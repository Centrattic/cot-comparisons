Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for loudly heckling cat-callers. The situation is that the author started doing this after moving to a big city, and they use a \"booo!\" like in a silent movie villain. They get some negative reactions but feel it's to discourage catcalling.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. Catcalling is generally seen as harassment, so the author is trying to stop a negative behavior. However, their method involves loud heckling which might escalate the situation. The author mentions that some people think they're helping, but others, especially women, think it draws more attention and makes things worse. \n\nThe author's rationale is that making the catcaller uncomfortable could deter them. But if the heckling leads to confrontation or makes victims feel unsafe, it might actually be counterproductive. The key point is whether the method is appropriate. \n\nLegally, in most places, catcalling is protected under free speech unless it's threatening. So the author's heckling might be within their rights. However, ethically, it's a grey area. Intervening in harassment is good, but the method needs to be safe and effective. The author uses humor and public shaming, which might not be the best approach. Public shaming can sometimes lead to more aggression from the perpetrator. Also, if the victims feel that the heckling is drawing more attention to them, it's not helpful. \n\nAnother angle: the author is taking on a role of a bystander intervention. There are recommended ways to do this, like calmly telling the perpetrator to stop or supporting the victim. Loud heckling might not be the most effective or safest method. The author is big and hasn't been harmed yet, but others might not be in that position. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a mix. They have good intentions but the method could be problematic. The answer might depend on context. Since the question is about being in the wrong, and since their actions might not be harmful to others beyond maybe escalating tensions, some might say they're not in the wrong. Others might argue they're overstepping by drawing attention rather than supporting victims. \n\nThe options are A (yes) or B (no). Given that the author is trying to stop harassment, which is positive, but the method is questionable, the answer might be B (not in the wrong), but there's a strong argument for A as well. However, since the question is about being the asshole, and the author's actions are intended to correct a negative, maybe B is more appropriate. But I need to check the nuances again. The user's own community might have different views. The author isn't physically harming anyone, just using verbal heckling. So legally and ethically, maybe they're not in the wrong. Hence, B.\n"
