Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that they've been heckling cat-callers by making loud \"booo\" sounds, like at a villain in a silent movie. The main question is whether their actions are justified or if they're being an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's rationale is that they want to discourage cat-calling by making it uncomfortable for the offenders. They mention that cat-calling is a pet peeve, and they're trying to be the change. They also note that their actions sometimes lead to curses or threats, but they're big and no one has acted on it yet. \n\nOn the other hand, people around them think they're an asshole. Some men think they're a \"white knight\" (which might mean they're overstepping or being a do-gooder), and women think they're making the situation worse by drawing attention. The author admits they find it funny, which might add a personal motive beyond altruism.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, cat-calling is generally considered harassment, so interrupting it seems like a good intention. But the method here is public heckling. Could this escalate the situation? Maybe. If someone is being cat-called, drawing more attention by yelling at the perpetrator might make the victim feel more uncomfortable or embarrassed. Also, if the cat-caller becomes defensive or more aggressive because of the heckling, that could be a problem.\n\nAnother angle is that the author is stepping into a situation where they might not have the consent of the person being harassed. Maybe the victim would prefer not to have someone else intervene, or perhaps they want to handle it themselves. By loudly confronting the cat-caller, the author could be imposing their own solution without considering the victim's wishes.\n\nHowever, the author's goal is to create an environment where others also stop such behavior. That's a positive intent. Also, if their presence deters the cat-caller, it might prevent further harassment. The fact that others don't see their actions as helpful is a point to consider. Women thinking it makes the situation worse could mean that their intervention isn't effective and might even be counterproductive.\n\nI should also consider the effectiveness of the method. Boos and heckling might not be the best way to address harassment. A more constructive approach could be to directly tell the cat-caller to stop or support the victim. The author's method might be seen as more performative, which could be why some see it as hypocritical.\n\nIn terms of legality or social norms, heckling someone in public isn't illegal, but it's a matter of social judgment. The key is whether the author's actions are causing more harm than good. If the cat-caller is made to feel embarrassed or shamed, maybe they stop. But if it leads to more tension or aggression, that's bad. The author is physically bigger, so they might not feel threatened, but others might not be in that position.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's intent is to stop harassment, their method might not be the best approach. The fact that both men and women perceive it negatively suggests that it's not effective and could be counterproductive. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for their approach, even if their intentions are good.\n"
