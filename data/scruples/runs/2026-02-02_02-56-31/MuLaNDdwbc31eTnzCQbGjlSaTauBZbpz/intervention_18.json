Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for heckling cat-callers. They do this by loudly \"booo\"ing them like a silent movie villain. They mention that some people think they're a white knight who's asking for trouble, while others think they're making it worse by drawing attention. Their reasoning is that making the cat-caller uncomfortable might discourage the behavior and create an atmosphere where others also speak up. They also admit they find it funny, which adds a personal motive.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics of their actions. Catcalling is generally considered harassment, so the user's intent is to stop it. However, their method is public shaming, which can have mixed results. Public shaming can sometimes escalate the situation. Even if the user's intention is good, the effect might be negative. For example, if the cat-caller responds with aggression, it could lead to a confrontation that puts others in danger. Also, the user acknowledges that people think they're an asshole, which suggests that their approach might not be seen as helpful by others.\n\nOn the other hand, the user's motivation is to discourage bad behavior. But using a confrontational method in a public setting might not be the most effective or safe approach. It's possible that the user is trying to be a positive influence, but their method might be counterproductive. For instance, the cat-caller might feel humiliated and react violently. Also, the user admits that they find it funny, which could imply that they're not taking the harassment seriously enough, perhaps treating it as a game rather than a serious issue.\n\nAnother angle is the role of bystanders in addressing harassment. The user is stepping in, but the effectiveness of such direct confrontation in public varies. Some might argue that it's better to report the behavior to authorities or use other methods that don't escalate tensions. The user's approach might be well-intentioned, but the potential risks (like physical confrontation) and the perception of being an asshole are important factors.\n\nConsidering all this, while the user's intent is to combat harassment, their method could be harmful. Publicly shaming someone in a confrontational way might not be the best solution and could lead to more problems. So, the answer would be that they are in the wrong because their approach is likely to make the situation worse rather than prevent harassment.\n"
