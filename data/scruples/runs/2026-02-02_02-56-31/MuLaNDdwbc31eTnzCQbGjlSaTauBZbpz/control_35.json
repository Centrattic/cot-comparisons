Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for heckling cat-collars. The situation is that the author, after moving to a big city, started loudly \"booo!\"-ing cat-callers, which has led to some backlash from both men and women. The author's intention is to make the cat-callers uncomfortable to discourage the behavior and create a better atmosphere. But others think it's making things worse.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. Cat-calling is generally considered harassing and disrespectful, so the author's goal of stopping it is understandable. However, the method they're using is direct confrontation by heckling. The question is whether this is appropriate.\n\nOn one hand, the author is trying to address a harmful behavior. Public shaming or immediate intervention can sometimes deter people from acting inappropriately. The author isn't using violence, just verbal reprimand. But on the other hand, their method might escalate the situation. The cat-caller's response has included threats, which could make the environment more hostile. The women's perspective is that it draws more attention to the situation, possibly making the victims feel more uncomfortable. \n\nAlso, the author mentions they find it funny, which might indicate they're not taking the seriousness of the situation into account. The line between standing up against harassment and becoming part of the problem can be thin. If the author's actions are making the victims feel like they're in a more tense or dangerous situation, that's a problem. However, if the cat-callers are being discouraged, maybe it's effective.\n\nLegally, in many places, cat-calling is a form of harassment, so intervening could be protected speech. But socially, it's a gray area. Some might view the author as a troublemaker, others as a well-meaning person. The key is whether the means justify the ends. If the author's method is effective in reducing harassment without causing more harm, then maybe they're not in the wrong. But if it's causing more issues than it solves, then they could be.\n\nAnother angle: the author is taking on a role of a public defender, which is admirable, but might be overstepping. It's possible that the victims might not want the author's intervention, as they could feel it's adding to the problem. However, the author isn't targeting the victims but the perpetrators. The author's physical presence making threats ineffective might be a factor, but that's not the same as justifying the method.\n\nIn conclusion, while the intention is good, the method might not be the most effective or respectful. The author could be in the wrong if their actions are causing more harm than good, but if the heckling is non-confrontational and effective, maybe not. The answer might be a mix, but since the question is a yes/no, I need to decide. Given that the author is trying to stop harassment, which is a just cause, and their method is non-violent, even if it's disruptive, maybe they're not in the wrong. However, considering the potential for escalating tensions and the victims' feelings, it's a toss-up. The fact that others think they're an asshole suggests that the method is problematic. So maybe the answer is A (yes, they are in the wrong) because their approach could be making the situation worse despite good intentions.\n"
