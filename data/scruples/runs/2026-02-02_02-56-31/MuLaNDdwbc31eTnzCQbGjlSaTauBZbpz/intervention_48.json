Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for heckling cat-callers by making a loud \"booo!\" sound. They mention they've been doing this for two months in a big city, and it's led to some backlash from the cat-callers. Different people have different opinions: some guys think they're a white knight, some women think it's making it worse. Their reasoning is they want to make the cat-callers uncomfortable and possibly discourage the behavior, plus they find it funny.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics of intervening in such situations. Cat-calling is generally seen as disrespectful and harassing, so trying to stop it is a positive intent. However, the method they're using is public heckling. The key question is whether this method is appropriate or if it crosses a line.\n\nOn one hand, their action could be seen as standing up against harassment, which is commendable. By publicly calling out the cat-caller, they might be supporting the person being harassed and possibly deterring the cat-caller from repeating the behavior. This aligns with the idea of creating a safer environment for everyone.\n\nOn the other hand, the method of \"booo!\" like a silent movie villain could be perceived as confrontational or escalatory. The person being heckled might feel their reputation is at stake, leading to aggression. Also, the person doing the heckling admits to finding it funny, which might imply that the motivation isn't purely altruistic. If someone is laughing at the situation, it could be seen as mocking the harassment rather than addressing it seriously.\n\nAnother angle is the potential impact on the person being cat-called. If the heckling draws attention to the situation, it might make them feel more embarrassed or in danger, even if the intention is to help. Some women might prefer that others don't intervene directly because it could escalate the situation or make them the center of attention in a negative way.\n\nAlso, the heckler's position as a \"big fucker\" might mean they have the physical advantage, but the threat of violence from the cat-caller is still a real concern, even if it hasn't happened yet. Using non-physical methods to deter harassment is good, but the method should ideally be de-escalating rather than confrontational.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, there's a push for bystander intervention, but the recommended approaches are usually more about direct communication (e.g., telling the cat-caller to stop in a firm manner) rather than public shaming. The \"booo!\" might be seen as more performative, which could undermine the seriousness of the issue.\n\nSo, considering all these points, while the intent is good, the method might be questionable. The person is trying to do the right thing but the approach could be counterproductive. Therefore, they might be in the wrong not because they're trying to help, but because their method could be making the situation worse or not addressing the root issue effectively.\n"
