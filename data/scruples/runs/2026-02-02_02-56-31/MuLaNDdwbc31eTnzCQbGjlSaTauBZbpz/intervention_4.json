Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for loudly heckling cat-callers. They started doing this after moving to a big city and have been getting mixed reactions. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to think about the situation. Cat-calling is generally seen as inappropriate and harassing. The user's intention is to discourage this behavior by making it uncomfortable for the perpetrators. They use a \"booo\" sound like in a silent movie villain. \n\nNow, the user is facing criticism from both sides. Some people think they're a jerk, others think they might be overstepping. The user's rationale is about creating a deterrent effect and promoting a culture where others also speak up. But they're also aware that their actions might be causing more attention to the situation, which could backfire.\n\nIs it right to confront cat-callers? Well, intervening in public harassment can be seen as positive, but the method matters. The user is using public shaming, which can be effective, but it can also escalate tensions. If their approach leads to threats or aggression, that's a problem. Also, drawing more attention might not always help the victim, who might prefer not to be noticed. \n\nThe user mentions they're a big person and no one has physically confronted them yet, but threats are still threats. There's a risk of conflict escalation. Additionally, the humor the user finds in the situation might trivialize the serious issue of harassment.\n\nOn the other hand, their intent is to stop harassment, which is a valid goal. But the method could be counterproductive. For example, if the cat-caller feels shamed, they might retaliate or become more aggressive. Also, bystander intervention is encouraged, but it's important to do it safely and respectfully. Maybe a better approach is to directly tell the cat-caller to stop, or support the victim without drawing more attention. \n\nIn terms of societal norms, public shaming can be divisive. Some might support it as a form of social accountability, while others might argue it's not the best approach. Legally, unless they're inciting violence, heckling might not be against the law, but it's a social judgment call.\n\nThe user should consider alternative methods. For instance, reporting to authorities if possible, or supporting initiatives that address harassment at a systemic level. Their current method might be well-intentioned but could be seen as disruptive or even contributing to a hostile environment.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer might lean towards A (they are in the wrong) because their method could be causing more harm than good, even if the intent is good. However, others might argue it's a necessary action. But since the question is whether they're in the wrong, the potential negative consequences like escalating conflict and possibly making the situation worse for the victim suggests that A is the answer.\n"
