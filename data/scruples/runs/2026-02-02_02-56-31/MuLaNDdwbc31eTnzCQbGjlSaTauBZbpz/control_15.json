Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for heckling cat-callers. The author describes themselves as loudly \"booo!\"-ing cat-callers, which has led to some backlash. They mention that both men and women have different opinions on their actions.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. Cat-calling is generally considered inappropriate and disrespectful. The author is trying to address this by making the cat-callers uncomfortable, hoping to deter the behavior. Their intention is to create a better environment by discouraging such actions. But is their method acceptable?\n\nOn one hand, the author is standing up against harassment, which is a positive action. They might be protecting others from feeling uncomfortable. On the other hand, loudly heckling could escalate the situation. Some might argue that it draws more attention to the cat-caller, which could validate their behavior or make the victim feel more self-conscious. The author acknowledges that women think it makes the situation worse, which is a valid concern.\n\nAlso, the author's method could be seen as confrontational. While they're not physically engaging, the verbal confrontation might not be the most effective way. There's a risk of provoking a physical altercation, even though the author feels confident they can handle it. The threats they receive show that their approach is causing tension.\n\nAnother angle is the principle of non-violence and de-escalation. The author's approach is direct but maybe not the best in terms of promoting long-term change. It's possible that other methods, like bystander intervention training, might be more effective. However, the author's intention is good, aiming to create an atmosphere where others also intervene.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the answer isn't black and white. The author is addressing a problem, but their method might have unintended consequences. They should consider the potential for making the situation worse for the victim. The key is whether the heckling helps or harms the people being cat-called. If it's distracting or making them feel unsafe, then maybe they are in the wrong.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the answer would lean towards A (the author is in the wrong) because even though their intention is good, the method might be causing more harm than good by drawing attention and potentially making the victims uncomfortable. However, there's a counterargument that they're doing a good deed. But since the question is about being in the wrong, the answer would be A.\n"
