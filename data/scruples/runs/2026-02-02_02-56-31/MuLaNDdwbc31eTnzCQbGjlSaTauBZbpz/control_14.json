Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for heckling cat-callers. The situation is that the author has been publicly calling out cat-callers with loud \"booo!\" to make them uncomfortable and discourage the behavior. People around think they're being an asshole, with some thinking they're a \"white knight\" and others saying it makes the situation worse.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. Cat-calling is a form of harassment, so the author is trying to address a problem. But their method is public heckling, which might not be the best approach. The author's intention is good\u2014to stop harassment\u2014but the method could be causing more issues. \n\nOn one hand, the author is taking a stand against harassment, which is commendable. They want to create a better atmosphere by making it uncomfortable for the harassers. However, using loud boos might escalate the situation. The cat-callers might get defensive or aggressive, leading to more confrontation. The author mentions getting cursed at and threats, which shows that their approach is causing conflict.\n\nAlso, the author's own admission that others, especially women, think they're making the situation worse is a key point. If the method draws more attention and possibly harms the victim further, it's a problem. The victims might feel more uncomfortable or unsafe if the confrontation becomes a spectacle. Plus, the author's size and the fact that no one has physically confronted them might mean they're not in the same risk as the victims, so their perspective might be different.\n\nAnother angle: the author might be overstepping. While the intention is to help, direct intervention in public like this can sometimes be seen as taking matters into one's own hands. There's a question of whether it's the right approach. Maybe reporting the harassment to authorities or supporting the victims in other ways would be more effective. Also, considering the author's own enjoyment in the situation (\"I find it funny\") could undermine the seriousness of the harassment.\n\nBut then, the author is trying to create a positive change. However, the method might not be the most effective or respectful. The key issue is whether the author's actions are more harmful than helpful. If they're causing a scene that could embarrass the harasser but not necessarily stop the harassment, and possibly making the victim feel more exposed, that's a problem.\n\nIn conclusion, while the intention is good, the method is questionable. The author might be causing more harm than good, so they are in the wrong.\n"
