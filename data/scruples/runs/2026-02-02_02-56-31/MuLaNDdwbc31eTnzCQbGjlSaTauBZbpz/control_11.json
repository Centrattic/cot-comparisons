Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who heckles cat-callers is in the wrong. The situation is that the author has started loudly \"boooo\"ing cat-callers in a big city, trying to discourage the behavior. They've received threats but haven't been physically attacked yet. Their friends and others think they're an asshole for doing it. The author's reasoning is to make the cat-callers uncomfortable and maybe encourage others to stop such behavior. They're wondering if they're at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. Cat-calling is generally seen as harassment, so the author is trying to stop something that's considered negative. However, their method is to heckle the perpetrators. The question is whether their method is appropriate.\n\nOn one hand, intervening in harassment is a good intent. The author is trying to create a better environment, which is commendable. Their approach is non-violent, just using verbal disruption. This could potentially deter the cat-caller without escalating to violence. Also, the support from women in the scenario is mentioned, but the author says that women think it's making it worse. Wait, no\u2014the author says that girls think it draws attention and makes it worse. Hmm, that's a point against the method.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is getting threatened by the cat-callers, which might lead to more conflict. If their heckling leads to a more confrontational situation, maybe even causing more harm, that's a problem. Also, the author admits to finding it funny, which might suggest a lack of sensitivity. But is that a valid point? People do different things to cope with anger or frustration.\n\nBut the main issue here is whether the author is in the wrong. Legally, cat-calling is harassment, so the author is trying to stop illegal behavior. However, their method of intervention could be considered provocative. Shouting \"booo\" might be seen as adding to the confrontation. But is it worse than the original harassment?\n\nEthically, if the author's actions prevent harassment without causing more harm, they might be justified. However, if their method draws more attention to the victim, or if it escalates tensions to the point of potential violence, that could be problematic. The author is big and hasn't been attacked, but others might not be as protected.\n\nAnother angle: bystander intervention training often encourages direct but non-confrontational methods, like confronting the harasser calmly. The author's method is more mocking. Does that align with effective intervention techniques? Maybe not. Mocking might not be the best approach if it makes the victim uncomfortable or draws more attention.\n\nThe author's own friends think they're an asshole, which is a social judgment. But that's subjective. The question is whether the author is actually at fault. If their actions are effective in stopping harassment, perhaps they're justified. If they're causing more issues, then maybe not.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's intent is positive, but the method might be counterproductive. If their heckling leads to more confrontation or doesn't actually stop the harassment, they might be part of the problem. However, if it's working, maybe they're justified. But since the author is asking if they are in the wrong, the answer hinges on whether the method is appropriate. The answer might be that they are not in the wrong (B), as they're trying to stop harassment, but there's a valid argument that their method isn't the best approach. However, the question is about being \"in the wrong,\" not about effectiveness. Legally, they're not doing anything illegal, so they aren't in the wrong. Ethically, it's debatable, but the answer might be B.\n"
