Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if they're wrong for heckling cat-callers. The scenario is that they've been doing this for two months in a big city. They use a \"booo!\" like a silent movie villain, which leads to some backlash but they haven't been physically attacked yet.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. Cat-calling is generally seen as inappropriate and harassing. The user is trying to stand up against it, which is a positive intent. But the method they're using is public shaming, which can be controversial. \n\nPublic shaming can have mixed effects. On one hand, it might discourage the cat-caller from repeating their behavior. On the other, it could escalate the situation, making it more confrontational. The user mentions that others think they're an asshole, with some people believing they're drawing more attention or being a \"white knight.\" \n\nThe user's rationale is to make the cat-caller uncomfortable to discourage the behavior. But there's a question of whether this approach is effective or if it's just adding to the problem. Also, safety is a concern. Even though the user is a \"big fucker,\" threatening language from others could lead to physical confrontation eventually. \n\nAnother angle is the potential for creating a culture where others feel empowered to stop such behavior. If the user's actions inspire others, that could be positive. However, if it's just the user doing it alone, it might not have that ripple effect. \n\nThe user also admits to finding it funny, which might suggest that their primary motivation isn't purely altruistic. This could affect how their actions are perceived\u2014some might see it as performative or self-righteous. \n\nFrom a social perspective, confronting cat-calling is important, but the method matters. There's a difference between direct confrontation and public shaming. The user's approach might be seen as aggressive rather than helpful. The threat of violence in response could also make the situation worse for the victims, who might now have to deal with two hostile parties instead of one. \n\nIn terms of ethics, intent is part of the consideration. The user's intent is to stop harassment, which is good. But the impact is also important. Even with good intentions, the method might not be the most effective or safest. \n\nSo, is the user in the wrong? They're trying to do something positive, but their method could be problematic. Public heckling might not be the best approach. Alternatives like reporting the behavior, supporting the victim discreetly, or engaging the cat-caller in a respectful but firm way might be more effective. \n\nConsidering all this, the user might be in the wrong not because their intent is bad, but because their method could be counterproductive and potentially harmful. So the answer would be A (Yes, I am in the wrong).\n"
