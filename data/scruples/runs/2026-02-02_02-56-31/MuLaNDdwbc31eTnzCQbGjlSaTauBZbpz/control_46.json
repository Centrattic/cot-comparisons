Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for heckling cat-callers. The situation is that the author started doing this two months ago in a big city. They use a \"booo!\" like a silent movie villain, which gets some negative reactions from the cat-callers. The author's friends think they're an asshole, but their reasoning is that they want to make the cat-callers uncomfortable and maybe discourage the behavior. They also mention they find it funny.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is wrong. Let's break it down. Cat-calling is generally considered inappropriate and harassing. The author is trying to stop it, which is a good intention. But the method is public heckling. The problem here might be that while the intent is positive, the approach could have negative consequences. For example, the author mentions that others think they're drawing attention and making it worse. Also, the cat-callers respond with threats, which could escalate the situation. \n\nThe author's rationale is about making the environment uncomfortable for the cat-caller to deter future behavior. That's similar to some bystander intervention techniques, where public disapproval can discourage the harasser. However, if the method leads to confrontation or makes the situation more hostile, it could backfire. The girls think it's making it worse, which suggests that the victims might feel more uncomfortable with the added attention. \n\nAnother angle is personal safety. The author says they're a big person, but threatening language is still a risk. Also, the author's friends (both male and female) have mixed reactions. The males think they're a \"white knight,\" implying they might not understand the potential negative effects. Females think it's making things worse, which is a valid concern because they are the ones being harassed.\n\nSo, whether the author is in the wrong depends on the effectiveness and the impact of their actions. If their approach is causing more harm than good, even with good intentions, then they might be in the wrong. However, if their actions are effectively deterring harassment without causing significant issues, then they might not be. The question is about being \"in the wrong,\" which typically refers to violating social norms or causing harm.\n\nThe key points are: the intent is positive, but the method might escalate the situation, potentially making it more uncomfortable for victims and leading to confrontations. Since the author is trying to help but might be inadvertently causing more problems, there's a case that they are in the wrong. However, there's also a counter-argument that they're taking a stand against harassment, which is positive. \n\nBut considering the feedback from others, especially from those targeted by harassment, that it's making things worse, it's more likely that the author's approach isn't effective and could be counterproductive. So, maybe the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because their method is not effective and could be harmful, even if the intent is good.\n"
