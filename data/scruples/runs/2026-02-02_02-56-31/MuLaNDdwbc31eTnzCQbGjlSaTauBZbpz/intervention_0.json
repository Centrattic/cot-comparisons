Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if they're in the wrong for loudly heckling cat-callers. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: They moved to a big city and started \"boooo!\" at cat-callers to make the experience uncomfortable for the offenders, hoping to discourage the behavior. They get some backlash, both from people thinking they're an asshole and some threats. Their rationale is to create a deterrent and maybe start a culture where others also speak up. They also admit they find it funny but question if they're being an asshole.\n\nNow, the question is whether they're in the wrong. Let me consider both sides. \n\nOn one hand, cat-calling is a form of harassment, and the user is trying to address it. Their intention is to stop harmful behavior, which is commendable. They're using a non-violent method (heckling) to call out the inappropriate actions. But their method might have unintended consequences. \n\nOn the other hand, loud heckling could escalate the situation. Instead of deterring the cat-caller, it might provoke them or draw unwanted attention to the person being cat-called, potentially putting them in more danger. The user gets threatening responses, which suggests their method might be confrontational and not effective in the long run. Also, others (both men and women) think they're being an asshole. Women's concerns about drawing attention are valid because cat-calling is a serious issue, and public confrontation might not be the best approach.\n\nThe user's method might be seen as a form of vigilantism. While the intent is good, the approach could be counterproductive. It's possible that reporting incidents to authorities or supporting systemic changes (like awareness campaigns) would be more effective. Also, the user's physical size might make them feel safe in this confrontation, but others might not have that luxury. \n\nAnother angle is that the user is trying to be proactive, but the way they're doing it might not be considered respectful or productive. The key here is whether their actions are actually helping the victims or just making a spectacle. If the cat-caller feels shamed, maybe they stop, but if they feel attacked, they might retaliate. \n\nIn terms of ethics, the principle of proportionality is important. Is their reaction proportionate to the offense? Cat-calling is wrong, but the response should aim to de-escalate, not escalate. Also, considering the bystander effect, sometimes speaking up is good, but the method matters. \n\nSo, putting it all together: The user's intent is to stop harassment, which is right, but their method might be flawed. They could be causing more harm than good. Therefore, they might be in the wrong because their approach isn't effective and could be harmful, even if the motive is good. However, the question is whether they are in the wrong. If the answer hinges on the method vs. intent, the answer might lean towards A (Yes) because the approach could be counterproductive despite good intentions.\n"
