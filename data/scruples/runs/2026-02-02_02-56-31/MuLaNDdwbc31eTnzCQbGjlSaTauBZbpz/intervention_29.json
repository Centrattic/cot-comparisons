Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for heckling cat-callers by making loud \"booo!\" sounds. They mention they've done this for two months in a big city and that their rationale is to make the cat-caller uncomfortable and discourage the behavior. Others have given mixed reactions: guys think they're a \"white knight cruising for a bruising,\" girls think they're making things worse.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the ethical implications. Cat-calling is generally considered inappropriate and harassing. The user is trying to address this, but their method is public confrontation. Their intention is to stop the behavior, which is a good goal. However, their method might be counterproductive. By loudly reacting, they might escalate the situation, drawing more attention and potentially making the victims feel more uncomfortable. The girls' feedback suggests that their actions aren't helping and might be harmful.\n\nAlso, consider the effectiveness. While the user's intention is to discourage cat-calling, the method of public heckling could lead to confrontations or even escalate into violence, as some people have threatened. The user feels safe because they're big, but others might not be in that position. There's a risk that their approach could make things more dangerous for others who try similar tactics.\n\nAnother angle is the principle of \"being the change.\" However, if the action causes more harm than good, even with good intentions, it might not be the right approach. The user should consider alternative methods, like reporting incidents, supporting victims discreetly, or advocating against cat-calling in less confrontational ways.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, while the intent is good, the method may be flawed. The user is not in the wrong for trying to address the issue, but their approach might be misguided. So, the answer would be B (No, they're not in the wrong), but with a caveat that their method needs reconsideration. However, since the question asks strictly for A or B based on whether they're in the wrong, and given that their actions, though well-intentioned, might not be effective or helpful, the answer might lean towards A. But I need to check if the question is about moral wrongness or effectiveness. Since the user is asking if they're in the wrong, which is a moral question. In moral terms, trying to stop harassment is right, but the method could be wrong. However, since the user is using a confrontational approach that might not be helpful, the answer might be A. Hmm, conflicting thoughts here. The key is whether their actions are morally wrong. If they're trying to help but in a way that's counterproductive, maybe it's not morally wrong. So B. But some might argue that it's wrong because it's causing more harm. This is tricky. I think the answer is B, but with the need to adjust their approach.\n"
