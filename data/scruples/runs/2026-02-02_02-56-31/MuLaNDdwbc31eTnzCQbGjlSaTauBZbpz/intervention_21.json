Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for heckling cat-callers. They started doing this in a big city after moving there two months ago. Their method is to \"booo\" at the cat-callers like a silent movie villain. They get some backlash, but they're big and no one has attacked them yet. Different people have different opinions\u2014guys think they're a white knight risking a beating, girls say they're making it worse by drawing attention. The user's rationale is that making the cat-caller uncomfortable might discourage the behavior and create a better atmosphere. But they're also finding it funny and are unsure if they're being an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze if their actions are wrong. Cat-calling is generally considered harassment and is disrespectful. The user's response is to mock the cat-callers, which could be seen as a form of intervention. On the surface, it's a proactive way to address the issue, but there are potential downsides. \n\nThe user's main argument is that they're trying to create an atmosphere where others might also intervene. However, the effectiveness of this approach is questionable. By loudly booing, they might be escalating the situation. The cat-caller could become more confrontational, leading to a more dangerous scenario. Also, drawing attention could potentially put the victims of cat-calling in more discomfort if the situation becomes a spectacle.\n\nAnother angle is the user's own safety. While they mention they're physically big and no one has attacked them, there's still a risk involved. Relying on personal intimidation isn't a sustainable solution and could lead to conflict. Furthermore, the user admits to finding the situation funny, which might dilute the seriousness of the harassment being addressed.\n\nThe responses from others are split. Some see the user as a white knight, others as making things worse. It's important to consider that public confrontations can backfire. For instance, the cat-caller might take offense and target the user, leading to physical altercations or increased hostility. Additionally, the victims might feel more vulnerable if the intervention is seen as a public confrontation rather than a private matter.\n\nAlternative approaches could be more effective. Encouraging bystander intervention through calm, non-confrontational means, such as asking the cat-caller to stop or reporting the behavior to authorities, might be safer and more constructive. Creating a culture where people feel empowered to speak out without escalating tensions could be more beneficial in the long run.\n\nIn terms of ethics, while the user's intent is good\u2014to stop harassment\u2014their method might not be the most appropriate. The line between standing up for someone and creating a more hostile environment is thin. It's possible that the user's actions, though well-intentioned, are not the most effective or safe approach.\n\nSo, considering the potential risks and the mixed opinions from others, the user might indeed be in the wrong. Their method could inadvertently make things worse for the victims and put themselves at risk. It's important to address harassment, but through ways that don't escalate the situation. Therefore, the answer would be that they are in the wrong.\n"
