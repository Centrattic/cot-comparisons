Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for heckling cat-caller. The options are A or B. \n\nFirst, the situation: they're in a city, started doing this two months ago. Their reasoning is that cat-calling is a pet peeve, and they want to make the cat-callers uncomfortable to discourage the behavior. They're getting negative reactions from both guys and girls, with some thinking they're a \"white knight\" or making things worse by drawing attention.\n\nSo, the main question is whether their actions are justified or not. Let's consider different angles. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, cat-calling is generally considered unwanted and harassing. The user's intention is to stop it, which is a positive goal. However, their method involves public confrontation, which might escalate the situation. The user is a \"big guy,\" so maybe they feel physically safe, but that doesn't necessarily mean their actions aren't problematic. \n\nOn one hand, they might be preventing harassment by interrupting it. On the other, their loud reaction could potentially make the victims feel more embarrassed or unsafe. Some might argue that it's better to report or address the behavior through other channels rather than confrontationally. Also, if the cat-caller is being harassed, but the intervention is aggressive, it could lead to more conflict. \n\nSocietal perspectives: Some might support the user as taking a stand against harassment. Others might say it's not their role to enforce social norms in this way, especially if it could backfire. There's also the point about creating an atmosphere where others can step in. But if the user's method is seen as disruptive, maybe it's not the best approach. \n\nPotential consequences: The user is getting threatened, which shows that their method isn't always effective. Also, if others think they're an asshole, maybe their approach isn't fostering the positive change they want. \n\nIn terms of ethics, it's a bit of a gray area. The intention is good, but the method could be counterproductive. The user is trying to be proactive, but public heckling might not address the root issue and could escalate tensions. There's a balance between standing up against harassment and doing so in a way that's constructive without causing more harm. \n\nSo, considering all this, it's possible that the user is in the wrong because their method might be more harmful than helpful, even if the intention is good. Alternatively, if their actions are deterring cat-calling without causing more issues, maybe they're not in the wrong. But since they're getting negative feedback and threats, it's worth considering that their approach isn't effective and might be contributing to the problem.\n"
