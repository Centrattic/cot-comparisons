Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who's loudly heckling cat-callers is in the wrong. The situation is that the author is in a big city, and they've started to publicly shame cat-callers by making \"booo!\" sounds like in a silent movie. They're getting some negative reactions from the cat-callers but think it might help reduce the harassment. The options are A (they're in the wrong) or B (they're not).\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical angles here. Cat-calling is generally seen as inappropriate and unwelcome, so the author is trying to address a problem. However, their method involves directly confronting the cat-caller in a public way. The question is whether this method is justified or if it's crossing a line.\n\nOn one hand, the author's intention is to make the cat-callers uncomfortable and possibly deter them. That's a valid goal since cat-calling is a form of harassment. By publicly shaming them, maybe it discourages future incidents. Also, the author is using a non-physical method, which avoids direct conflict. But the problem could be that they're adding to the situation by drawing attention. The women they mention think it's making the situation worse, as it might draw more attention to the victims. Also, the author is a bit hypocritical because they mention they dislike cat-calling but might be contributing to the problem in another way by making a scene.\n\nThen there's the aspect of personal right to address harassment. If someone is being harassed, others might feel empowered to speak up. But the method here is public shaming, which could be seen as aggressive or confrontational. The author is getting threats, which shows that some people don't take it well. They might be escalating the situation instead of de-escalating. Also, the author is using humor (\"funny\") which might trivialize the serious issue of harassment.\n\nAnother angle: the effectiveness. If the author's actions are making the cat-callers uncomfortable, does that actually reduce harassment in the long run? Maybe in some cases, but it's possible that it just makes the cat-callers angry and possibly more confrontational. The author's size might protect them from physical retaliation, but others might not be as safe.\n\nAlso, the question is about being \"in the wrong.\" If the author is trying to address a wrong, maybe they're justified. But if their method is counterproductive or causes more harm, then they might be in the wrong. The women's perspective is that they're making it worse by drawing attention, which could make victims feel more uncomfortable. So maybe the author isn't considering that their intervention could have unintended negative effects.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, public shaming can be a gray area. It's often discouraged because it can lead to mobbing or escalate conflicts. However, in the context of social justice, some might argue that confronting harassment is necessary. The key is whether the method is appropriate. The author is using a non-violent approach, but it's public and loud. \n\nSo weighing all these factors: the author's intention is good, the method is non-violent, but the potential negative consequences (making the situation worse for victims, escalating conflict) might mean they're not considering all angles. The answer might hinge on whether the method is effective and respectful. \n\nBut since the question is about being \"in the wrong,\" if the action is not illegal and the author is trying to prevent harassment, maybe they're not in the wrong. However, if the method is causing more harm than good, then perhaps they are. The ambiguity here makes it tricky. The author is a big person and hasn't faced physical retaliation, so their approach might be safe for them, but not necessarily for others. The women's perspective is important here\u2014by drawing attention, maybe they're unintentionally harming victims. \n\nGiven that, the answer might lean towards A (they're in the wrong) because their method could be counterproductive despite good intentions. But others might argue B (not in the wrong) because they're addressing harassment.\n"
