Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for heckling cat-callers. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author has been loudly making \"booo\" sounds at cat-callers for two months in a big city. Their reasoning is to make the cat-callers uncomfortable, discourage the behavior, and maybe create a culture where others tell off the cat-callers. The author acknowledges that people think they're an asshole\u2014guys think they're a \"white knight\" inviting trouble, and women think they're making things worse by drawing attention.\n\nThe key points to consider here are whether the author's actions are justified or if they cross a line. On one hand, cat-calling is a form of harassment, and the author is trying to stop it. Their method is non-physical, just verbal heckling. They do face some backlash but no physical confrontation yet. \n\nBut on the other hand, the author is inserting themselves into a situation that might not be their place. Even if their intention is good, does their method of \"booo\"ing make the situation worse? The women's perspective is that it draws more attention, which could make the victims feel more uncomfortable. Also, the author is perceived as a \"white knight,\" which often refers to someone who thinks they're helping but may not consider the actual needs or safety of the people they're trying to help. \n\nAnother angle is the potential for escalating the situation. If the cat-caller gets angry and turns aggression towards the author, it might put the author in danger, even though they claim to be a \"big fucker.\" Also, the author's own admission that others think they're an asshole suggests that their approach is controversial.\n\nThe question is about whether the author is in the wrong. From a moral standpoint, addressing harassment is positive, but the method and the author's role in it matter. If the author is causing more harm than good, like making the victims feel more targeted or escalating the situation, then they might be in the wrong. However, if their actions are non-confrontational and effectively deter the behavior without causing harm, then they might be justified.\n\nI need to weigh intentions vs. outcomes. The author's intention is good, but the outcomes (people thinking they're an asshole, potential escalation) might mean they're not considering the broader impact. Maybe there's a more effective way to address cat-calling, like reporting or supporting the victims without direct confrontation. \n\nIn conclusion, while the author's intent is to stop harassment, their method could be counterproductive. The answer might lean towards A (the author is in the wrong) because their approach may not be the most effective or considerate, even if their intentions are good.\n"
