Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person asking is in the wrong for loudly heckling cat-callers. Let me start by breaking down their situation.\n\nFirst, they moved to a big city and have been doing this for two months. Their main reason is that cat-calling is a pet peeve. They compare it to \"the change you wanna see\" idea, so they want to be a positive influence. They use a booo! like a silent movie villain, which gets some negative reactions from the cat-callers but they haven't faced physical consequences yet. People around them disagree: some men think they're a white knight who might get beaten up, and women think they're making the situation worse by drawing attention. The person's rationale is that making the cat-caller uncomfortable might discourage the behavior and create a culture where others tell them to stop. They also admit they find it funny, which might be a problem.\n\nNow, the question is whether they're in the wrong. The possible answers are A (yes) or B (no). Let me think about the arguments for each side.\n\nArguments for being in the wrong (A):\n1. Drawing attention to the situation could escalate it. If the cat-caller feels humiliated, they might react more aggressively, putting everyone in danger. The person mentions threats, so there's some evidence that this might lead to conflict.\n2. Women's perspective: they think it's making things worse. If the goal is to help victims, maybe the heckling is not effective and could even harm the person being targeted by focusing attention on them.\n3. Using humor (\"find it funny\") might trivialize the serious issue of harassment. It's possible that the heckler isn't fully considering the intent or impact of their actions beyond their own amusement.\n\nArguments for not being in the wrong (B):\n1. Cat-calling is a form of harassment and bystander intervention can be effective. By stepping in, they're supporting the person being targeted and potentially deterring future harassment.\n2. The person is using non-violent methods to address the issue. They're not causing physical harm, just expressing disapproval publicly. This could create a social norm against cat-calling.\n3. Their intention is to discourage the behavior, which aligns with promoting a respectful environment. Even if others disapprove, the motivation is to reduce harassment.\n\nI need to consider effectiveness, safety, and intent. While the intention is good, the method might have unintended consequences. Drawing attention could indeed make the situation more uncomfortable for the victim. However, bystander intervention is often encouraged in anti-harassment strategies, but it's usually advised to do it in a way that's safe and supportive. Maybe the \"booo\" approach isn't the best method here. Also, the fact that people are getting threatened might mean that it's causing more conflict than preventing harassment.\n\nAnother angle is that the person is taking a public stance, which could encourage others to do the same. But if it's leading to threats, that's a problem. The key is whether their actions are actually reducing harassment or causing more harm. The person admits they find it funny, which might suggest that their primary motivation isn't purely altruistic, which could undermine their approach.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. But considering that their method might be counterproductive (as per the women's perspective and the threats received), it's possible they're causing more harm than good. Therefore, they might be in the wrong for using a method that could escalate the situation rather than defuse it.\n"
