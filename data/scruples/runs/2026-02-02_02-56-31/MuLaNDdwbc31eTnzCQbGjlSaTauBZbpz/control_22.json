Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for loudly heckling cat-callers. The author started doing this after moving to a big city and wants to stop the behavior by making it uncomfortable for the cat-callers. They use the \"booo\" sound like in a silent movie. People around think they're an asshole, with men thinking they're being a white knight and women thinking they're making it worse. The author's rationale is to discourage the cat-calling and create a better atmosphere, but also admits they find it funny.\n\nHmm. So, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). I need to consider the ethical aspects here. Cat-calling is generally considered harassing and disrespectful. The author is trying to stop it, which is a positive intent. However, their method is to mock the cat-callers. Is that an appropriate response?\n\nOn one hand, the author's intention is good\u2014they want to create a safer environment by discouraging harassment. Their action might indeed make the cat-caller feel socially shunned, which could reduce the behavior. But on the other hand, using mockery could escalate the situation. The cat-callers might become more hostile, leading to potential conflicts. The author mentions that people get angry or threatening, which could lead to violence. Even though the author is confident in their physical ability, it's still a risk.\n\nAlso, the author is drawing attention to the situation. Some argue that by getting involved, they might inadvertently focus more attention on the victim, which could be problematic if the victim prefers not to be noticed. However, in this case, the author is targeting the cat-caller, not the victim. The girls' perspective is that it makes the situation worse, perhaps by adding more tension or drawing the cat-caller's focus away from the victim but into conflict with the heckler.\n\nAnother angle: Is heckling a form of free speech or a public good? In many places, intervening in harassment can be seen as a positive, but the method matters. If the heckling is confrontational and leads to threats, it might cross into inciting violence or disorder. However, the author hasn't caused physical harm yet, just verbal responses.\n\nThe author also admits to finding it funny, which could be seen as exploiting the situation for personal amusement. But again, the line between personal enjoyment and social activism is blurry here.\n\nIn summary, the author's intent is to stop harassment, which is commendable, but the method might have unintended consequences. The key here is balancing the effectiveness of their actions against potential risks. If the heckling leads to a hostile environment or escalates the situation, it's not ideal. However, if it's effective in deterring cat-calling without causing harm, it could be justified. The answer might depend on the context and the specific outcomes, but since the author is facing criticism and threats, it's possible that their approach isn't the most appropriate. So, the author might be in the wrong if their actions are causing more harm than good, even if the intention is good. Therefore, Answer A (Yes).\n"
