Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for heckling cat-callers. They started doing this to address a problem they find annoying. Their method is to \"booo\" the cat-caller, which draws attention and sometimes leads to verbal abuse from the offenders. They mention that people around them have mixed reactions: some think they're a \"white knight\" risking a fight, others, especially women, think they're making things worse by drawing attention. Their rationale is to make the cat-caller uncomfortable and perhaps discourage the behavior.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics of their actions. Cat-calling is generally seen as a form of harassment, so intervening is usually looked upon favorably. However, the method here is to mock the cat-caller publicly. The question is whether their approach is appropriate or if it's crossing a line.\n\nOn one hand, standing up against harassment is commendable. The user's intention is to stop the behavior and create a better environment. Their action might not only affect the cat-caller but also influence others, promoting a culture where such behavior is discouraged. It's a form of direct action without physical confrontation, which can be safer than other methods.\n\nOn the other hand, some people might argue that the user is escalating the situation. By making noise, they could draw more attention to the incident, which could make the victims feel more uncomfortable. Women might fear that this could lead to more aggression or that it's not the best way to address the issue. Additionally, the user's method might not be effective if it leads to confrontations or threats, which could be dangerous, even if the user feels physically capable.\n\nAnother angle is the potential hypocrisy. The user acknowledges their own pet peeve, but does their method inadvertently mirror the cat-caller's behavior by making a scene? If someone is shouting at a woman, then another person making loud noises in response might not be the most constructive approach. It's a public disruption that might not resolve the issue but instead create a different problem.\n\nAlso, effectiveness is a factor. If the user's action is causing the cat-caller to get angry but not actually stopping the behavior, then is it worth it? The user's goal is to discourage the behavior, but if it's leading to threats or a cycle of escalation, that could be counterproductive.\n\nSocial norms in a big city might influence this. In some places, public interventions are seen as positive, while in others, they might be seen as unnecessary. The user's approach might not fit everyone's comfort zone, hence the mixed reactions from people around them.\n\nLegal considerations aren't mentioned here, but if the heckling leads to a physical confrontation, there could be legal implications. However, the user hasn't experienced that yet, as no one has followed through on the threats.\n\nIn conclusion, the user's intentions are good\u2014they want to stop harassment. However, the method they're using has potential downsides. Whether they're in the wrong depends on the balance between the intent to help and the possible negative consequences of their actions. Since the question is whether they're in the wrong, the answer might lean towards A (Yes) because their approach could be causing more harm than good, even if the intention is positive. However, others might argue that it's a valid form of protest. The key is whether the method is effective and respectful, which is debatable here.\n"
