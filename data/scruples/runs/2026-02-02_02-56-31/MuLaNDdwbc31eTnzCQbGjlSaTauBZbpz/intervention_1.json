Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the person is in the wrong for heckling cat-callers. Let me start by breaking down the situation. They moved to a big city and started loudly \"booo\"ing cat-callers, like a silent movie villain. Their reasoning is that making the cat-callers uncomfortable might discourage the behavior and create a better atmosphere. But others think they're an asshole, with some saying it draws attention and makes things worse.\n\nFirst, I should consider the ethics here. Cat-calling is generally seen as harassment and disrespectful. The person is trying to address this by publicly shaming the offenders. On one hand, they're standing up against harassment, which is a positive intent. On the other hand, their method involves confrontation, which could escalate the situation. \n\nThere's a question about whether their approach is effective or appropriate. Public shaming can sometimes lead to backlash, as the cat-caller might get defensive or aggressive. The fact that they've received threats suggests that their method might provoke a negative reaction, potentially putting themselves and others at risk. Also, by drawing attention, they might make the victim feel more self-conscious or embarrassed instead of helping them.\n\nAnother angle is the potential for creating a culture where others follow suit. If the person's actions encourage others to tell the cat-callers off, that could be positive. But if it leads to more conflict, it might not be helpful. The person mentions that the girls think they're making it worse, which implies that victims might not appreciate the attention or the confrontational approach.\n\nLegal aspects? In some places, cat-calling can be considered harassment, but the person isn't physically intervening, just verbally. So they might not be doing anything illegal, but it's about social norms and appropriateness.\n\nMoral responsibility: Is it the person's place to intervene in this way? Some might say it's brave and supportive, others might argue it's overstepping. The key is balancing the intent to help with the method's effectiveness and potential harm.\n\nI need to decide if the person is in the wrong. If their actions, while well-intentioned, cause more harm (like making victims uncomfortable or escalating conflicts), then maybe they are in the wrong. If the method is effective and the intent is good, perhaps not. But since the victim's perspective is important here, and if their method isn't helping the victims but instead making things worse, that leans towards them being in the wrong. Also, the threats they receive suggest that the approach isn't peaceful and might not be the best way to address the issue. So maybe B is the answer, but I'm a bit conflicted because the intent is good. However, the question is about being in the wrong, not about the intent. If their actions are causing more problems despite good intent, then they might be in the wrong. So Answer A.\n"
