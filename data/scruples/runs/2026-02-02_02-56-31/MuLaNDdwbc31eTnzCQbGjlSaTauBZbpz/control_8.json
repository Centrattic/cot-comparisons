Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for loudly heckling cat-callers. Let me read through the scenario again.\n\nThe author moved to a big city and started this habit two months ago. They're responding to cat-calling by making loud \"booo!\" sounds, like mocking a villain. The cat-callers get mad, sometimes threatening them, but the author is big and no one has attacked. People around think the author is an asshole, with men thinking they're a \"white knight\" and women saying it draws attention and makes things worse. The author's reasoning is that making the cat-caller uncomfortable might discourage the behavior and create a better atmosphere. They also admit it's funny to them.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no).\n\nFirst, cat-calling is generally considered harassing and disrespectful. The author is trying to stop it, which is a positive intent. But their method is public heckling, which could be seen as confrontational. The author is using a mocking sound, which might be effective in some ways but could also escalate the situation. The responses from others are mixed: some think they're a white knight, others think they're causing more attention. The author acknowledges it's possible they're an asshole.\n\nNow, the ethics here. Is it wrong to confront harassment publicly? Some might argue that it's a valid form of intervention to stop harassment, especially if it's non-violent. Others might say that it draws more attention to the harassment, possibly making the victim more uncomfortable. The author is not physically confrontational but uses verbal mockery. However, the cat-callers respond with threats, which might indicate the author's approach is effective in making them uncomfortable. But does that justify the method?\n\nThe author's intent is to discourage the behavior, which is good, but the method's effectiveness is debatable. The key here is whether the author's actions are proportionate and constructive. If the heckling leads to a safer environment without causing more harm, it's justified. However, if it's causing more conflict or drawing attention to the harassment, maybe it's not the best approach.\n\nThe women's perspective is that it makes the situation worse. That could be because the harassment is now a spectacle, making the victim feel more targeted. Alternatively, if the victim is the one being cat-called, the heckling could be a form of support. But since the author is not the victim, they might be inserting themselves into a situation where their intervention isn't welcomed.\n\nAlso, the author admits it's funny to them, which might reduce the seriousness of their intent. If someone is mocking the cat-caller for their own amusement, that might not be the best approach, even if it's intended to stop the harassment.\n\nIn terms of the law, heckling in public spaces is generally allowed unless it incites violence. The threats from the cat-callers are on them. But the question is about being in the wrong morally or socially, not legally.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author's actions are a form of intervention against harassment, which is a positive intent. However, the method might not be the most effective or considerate. The fact that people around think they're an asshole suggests that it's a controversial approach. The author's method could be seen as taking the moral high ground but in a way that's confrontational and possibly counterproductive. Therefore, there's a case for saying the author is in the wrong because their method might not help the situation and could make it worse for the victims.\n\nBut another angle is that it's a form of allyship. If the author is trying to stand up against harassment, even if their method isn't perfect, they're on the side of doing good. The key is whether the consequences are worse than the intention. Since no one has been physically harmed, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. However, the potential for drawing attention and making victims uncomfortable is a downside.\n\nI think the answer depends on perspective. If the author's actions are effective in stopping harassment without causing more harm, then B (not in the wrong). If their actions are causing more issues, then A (in the wrong). Since the question is whether they are in the wrong, and considering common social norms, public heckling as a form of intervention is a gray area. Some see it as brave, others as disruptive. The author's own admission of possible hypocrisy and the mixed reactions suggest it's not clear-cut. However, given that the intent is to stop harassment and the method is non-violent, even if confrontational, I might lean towards B. But the fact that people think it's making things worse for victims could mean A. Hmm.\n\nAnother angle: cat-calling is the initial wrongdoing. The author is responding to that. If the author's response is a form of passive resistance without escalating to physical confrontation, maybe it's justified. But if it's causing more attention and possibly more harassment, it's not. The women's opinion is that it's making it worse. So if the author's action is harming the victims more, then they are in the wrong. But if they are helping, then not. Without knowing the victims' opinions, but the question is about being in the wrong, not effectiveness. The author is trying to do good, but their method might be flawed. So perhaps they are not in the wrong, but should consider other methods.\n\nI think the answer is B (not in the wrong) because the intent is good and the method is non-violent. However, the author should consider better approaches. But the question is about being in the wrong. Since they are trying to stop harassment, even if their method is debatable, they are not in the wrong. So answer B.\n"
