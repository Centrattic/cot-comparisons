Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for loudly heckling cat-callers. The author started doing this after moving to a big city, motivated by their dislike of catcalling. They use a \"booo!\" like in silent movies, which leads to some backlash but they haven't been physically attacked yet. People around think they're an asshole, with guys calling them a white knight and girls saying they make things worse. The author's reasoning is to make the cat-caller uncomfortable to discourage the behavior and maybe create a norm where others stop it too. They also admit they find it funny. Now, the question is whether they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. Catcalling is a form of harassment, so the author is trying to address a problem. However, their method is public heckling. Is that appropriate? On one hand, intervening can be seen as standing up against harassment, which is positive. But the method of \"booo!\" might be seen as mocking or adding to the humiliation. The author mentions that girls think they're making it worse by drawing attention. Maybe the situation becomes more confrontational, which could escalate things. If the cat-caller is being shamed, maybe that's effective, but if it leads to more conflict, that's a problem. The author is in a big city, where such incidents are common, so the environment might be more tolerant of such behavior, but does that justify it? Also, the author's own admission that others think they're an asshole is a point against them. The line between stopping harassment and becoming part of the problem is thin. The author might argue self-defense or promoting a better atmosphere, but the methods could be seen as aggressive. So, is the author in the wrong? It's a tough call. The intent is good, but the method could be counterproductive. Maybe the author is in the right in intention but wrong in execution. However, the question is about being in the wrong overall. Since the author is trying to prevent harassment, which is a good cause, but their method might not be the best approach. The answer could be A (Yes, in the wrong) because their approach might be causing more harm, but some might say B (No) because they're addressing a problem. But the fact that people around them think they're an asshole and that it might make things worse suggests that they are in the wrong. So the answer is A.\n"
