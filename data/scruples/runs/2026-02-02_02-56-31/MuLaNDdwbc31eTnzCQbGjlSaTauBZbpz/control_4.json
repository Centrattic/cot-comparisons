Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for heckling cat-callers. The author started doing this two months ago in a big city. Their reasoning is that they want to make the cat-callers uncomfortable and discourage the behavior. They mention getting cursed at and threats, but no actual harm. \n\nSo, the first thing to consider is the ethics of interrupting someone. If someone is harassing another person, intervening can be seen as standing up against harassment. But the method here is making fun of them with \"booo!\" like a silent movie villain. That might be seen as mocking, which could escalate the situation.\n\nThe author says that both guys and girls think they're an asshole. Guys think they're being a white knight, which might mean they're seen as overstepping. Girls think it draws attention and makes it worse. Cat-calling is unwelcome, but the author's response might be adding to the confrontation. \n\nThe author's rationale is to create an atmosphere where others also stop the behavior. However, if the approach leads to more hostility, maybe it's counterproductive. Also, the author admits they find it funny, which might indicate a lack of empathy towards the cat-caller's reaction, even if the intention is good.\n\nBut on the other hand, the author is trying to address a problem. Cat-calling is a form of harassment that many people find offensive. The question is whether the method is appropriate. Public shaming can be a controversial tactic. Some might argue that it's a valid form of protest, others that it's not the right approach.\n\nI need to consider if the author's actions are justified. If the goal is to stop harassment, maybe there are other ways. But if the author is just trying to call out the behavior on the spot, maybe their method is acceptable. However, the fact that others think they're making it worse suggests there's a problem with their approach. Also, if the author is being confrontational, it might not address the root issue and could escalate tensions. \n\nSo, the answer might be that the author is in the wrong because their method of intervention could be counterproductive, even if the intention is good. They might be adding to the problem by drawing more attention and causing more conflict instead of de-escalating the situation.\n"
