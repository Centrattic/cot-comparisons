Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the author of the given scenario is in the wrong for loudly heckling cat-callers. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author has started catcalling people in a big city as a way to address random men shouting at others. Their method is to \"booo!\" like a silent movie villain, which leads to some backlash. They mention that both men and women have different opinions\u2014men think they're a \"white knight\" risking a beating, while women feel they're making things worse by drawing attention. The author's rationale is to make the cat-caller uncomfortable to discourage the behavior and create a culture where others stop it too. They also admit they find it funny but are unsure if they're being an asshole.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nLet me consider the arguments. On one hand, catcalling is a form of harassment, and the author is trying to counter it. Public shaming or interrupting the harassment could be seen as a form of intervention. However, the methods involve public confrontation, which might escalate the situation. The author mentions getting threats and curses in return, which suggests that their approach might be confrontational. \n\nThe key points are: \n1. Is the author's method effective? They argue it might discourage the behavior, but others think it makes things worse by drawing attention. \n2. Is the method appropriate? Public heckling could be seen as a form of intervention, but it might also escalate tensions, leading to potential violence. \n3. The author acknowledges their own hypocrisy (as a pet peeve holder but now engaging in similar behavior, albeit different). \n4. The author's intent is to create a better environment, but their method might not be the best approach. \n\nLegally, unless the heckling involves threats or incitement, it might be protected speech. Ethically, it's more nuanced. While the goal is good (stopping harassment), the method could be problematic. Public shaming can sometimes be counterproductive, as it might make the perpetrator more defensive. Also, the author admits to finding it funny, which might downplay the seriousness of the issue for some. \n\nThe responses from others\u2014men thinking they're a white knight and women thinking it's making things worse\u2014indicate conflicting views. The author's approach might not be the most effective way to address the problem. It's possible that direct intervention (like telling the cat-caller to stop) could be more effective and less confrontational. However, the author is taking a non-confrontational approach by not engaging physically but using social disapproval. \n\nBut is it the author's place to do this? If the author is not the target, stepping in could be seen as allyship, but the method might not be the best. Alternatively, if the author is a target themselves, but in this case, they're intervening for others. \n\nIn terms of being in the wrong, if the author's actions are not illegal and are intended to stop harassment, it's a tough call. However, if their method leads to more conflict or doesn't effectively address the root issue, some might argue they're overstepping. The author is using humor and public shaming, which can be a double-edged sword. \n\nSo, considering the potential for escalation and the mixed responses, the author might be in the wrong not because their intent is bad, but because their method could be ineffective or counterproductive. The answer could lean towards A, but I need to be careful. Alternatively, if the method is within legal bounds and the intent is good, maybe B. But since the user is asking if they're in the wrong, and the scenario includes others judging them as an asshole, the answer might be A. However, there's a nuance here. The author is trying to do the right thing but with questionable methods. So, maybe the answer is A (they are in the wrong) because their method is causing more harm than good, even if the intent is good. But others might say they're not in the wrong because they're trying to stop harassment. \n\nHmm. The question is whether they are in the wrong. The \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) context usually considers both intent and outcome. The community often looks at if the person's actions, despite good intentions, are causing more problems. Since the author's actions lead to threats and others think it's making things worse, the community might say they are the asshole (A). So the answer would be A.\n"
