Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for heckling cat-callers. The author's reasoning is that they want to make the cat-callers uncomfortable and discourage the behavior. They mention getting negative reactions but think it's worth it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. Cat-calling is generally seen as inappropriate and disrespectful. The author is trying to counter that behavior, which seems like a positive intent. But the method is loud heckling, which might escalate the situation. \n\nThe author mentions that others think they're being an asshole. Some people might see their approach as confrontational and potentially making the situation worse. However, others might support it as a form of standing up against harassment.\n\nLegally, in many places, cat-calling is a form of harassment and not protected speech. Interfering with harassment could be justified. But the author is not a law enforcement officer, so there's a line between standing up for others and creating a confrontation that could lead to violence.\n\nAlso, the author is big and hasn't faced physical harm yet, but threatening language is involved. Public shaming might not be the most effective solution. It's possible that the author's method could deter the cat-callers, but it might also draw more attention and potentially escalate tensions.\n\nIn terms of social norms, some might argue that direct intervention is necessary to create a safer environment, while others believe that it's not the individual's role to police others in public spaces. The author's approach is a personal choice, but it's important to weigh the potential consequences.\n\nSo, considering all angles: the intent is good, but the method could be problematic. The author might be in the wrong if their actions lead to more conflict rather than resolving it. However, if the intent is to prevent harassment, there's a case for them not being in the wrong. The answer might depend on cultural context and specific circumstances, but since the question is binary, I need to choose between A and B. Given that the author is trying to address a harmful behavior, even if their method is contentious, the answer might be B (not in the wrong). But if their method is seen as causing more harm, then A. Hmm.\n"
