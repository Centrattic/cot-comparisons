Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for heckling cat-callers by booing them. They moved to a big city and started this two months ago. They mention that cat-calling is a pet peeve, and their reasoning is to make the cat-caller uncomfortable to discourage the behavior and create an atmosphere where others might also stop it. They also admit that people think they're an asshole, with guys thinking they're a \"white knight\" and girls saying it makes things worse. The user is conflicing because they find it funny but are open to stopping if they're wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. Cat-calling is generally considered harassing and unwanted. The user's intention is to stop the behavior, which is a good goal. But the method is to boo and mock the cat-caller. Does that make the situation worse? The user is trying to be proactive, but is their approach counterproductive?\n\nOn one hand, publicly shaming the cat-caller might make them feel embarrassed and stop. But on the other hand, it could escalate the situation. If the cat-caller is threatened or angry, they might retaliate or make the situation more hostile. The user mentions getting cursed at and threats, which could lead to physical confrontation. Even though they're \"a fairly big fucker,\" it's risky.\n\nAlso, some people think the user is drawing more attention to the situation. If a woman is being cat-called, adding a loud boo might shift the focus to the heckler instead of supporting the person being harassed. The women's perspective here is important\u2014they might feel that the heckling isn't helping them but instead making them part of the confrontation.\n\nAnother angle: bystander intervention. There are recommended ways to intervene safely, like directly telling the harasser to stop, supporting the victim, or distracting them. Booing might not be the most effective or safe method. The user's approach might come off as confrontational without actually addressing the root issue. Plus, the user's admission that they find it funny could undermine their intention, suggesting it's more for their own amusement than genuine help.\n\nLegal and social norms: In many places, cat-calling is a form of harassment, and bystanders have a responsibility to help. But the method of intervention matters. If the user's actions lead to violence or escalate the situation, they could be seen as contributing to the problem rather than solving it. Also, personal safety is a factor. Even if no one has attacked them yet, the threats indicate potential danger.\n\nSo, while the intention is good, the method might be flawed. The user could be in the wrong if their actions are making the situation worse, not helping the victim, or putting themselves and others at risk. The key is whether the heckling effectively addresses the harassment without causing more harm. The fact that others (especially women) think it's making things worse suggests that the approach is counterproductive. Therefore, the answer might lean towards A (in the wrong) because their method isn't effective and could have negative consequences.\n"
