Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for heckling cat-callers. They've been doing this for two months in a big city. Their approach is to \"booo\" like a silent movie villain, which sometimes leads to curses or threats but no actual consequences. They mention that their reasoning is making the cat-caller uncomfortable to discourage the behavior and maybe create a better atmosphere. But people around think they're an asshole, with guys thinking they're asking for a fight and girls thinking it's making things worse. The user is unsure if they should stop.\n\nHmm. First, I need to consider the ethics here. Catcalling is definitely a problem and respectful. The user wants to address it, which is good. But their method is public heckling. The key points here are: Is their method effective? Is it counterproductive? Are they causing more harm than good?\n\nOn one hand, the user's intention is positive\u2014they want to stop harassment. But the method involves confrontation, which might escalate situations. The user mentions getting threats and curses. Even if they aren't physically harmed, their actions could lead to more conflict. Also, when someone is catcalled, the person being targeted might not want bystanders to intervene in a way that draws attention. The victim might feel more unsafe if the situation escalates. The user thinks they're helping, but maybe they're unintendedly making it worse by adding to the confrontation. \n\nAlso, the user says that women think it's making things worse. That's a valid point. If the victims feel like the heckling is adding to the discomfort, that's a problem. The user's approach might not be the best way to support them. There's a concept in activism called \"savior complex,\" where people think they know what's best for others, but their actions might not align with the community's needs. \n\nAnother angle: public heckling could be seen as disruptive. The user is in a public space, and their loud \"boooo\" might be disturbing others. It's a matter of public order versus personal expression. Depending on the city, there might be laws about public disturbances, but the user hasn't mentioned legal issues. Still, from a social norm perspective, it's possible others find it annoying.\n\nIs there a better way to address catcalling? Maybe reporting to authorities, supporting policies against harassment, or educating others. The user's approach might not be the most effective. Also, the user is taking on a role of a defender, which could lead to unnecessary risks for themselves, even if they aren't harmed yet. \n\nIn terms of ethics, the user's intention is good, but the method's consequences might be negative. They might be well-meaning but causing more problems. So, the answer would likely be that they are in the wrong (A) because their method could be detrimental, even if the intent is positive. However, it's a nuanced situation. They aren't a \"bad person,\" but their actions might not be the best approach.\n"
