Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for heckling cat-callers by making loud \"booo\" sounds. They mention they've been doing this for two months in a big city. Their reasoning is to make the cat-callers uncomfortable and discourage the behavior, while also acknowledging that others think they're an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. Cat-calling is generally considered inappropriate and can make people feel harassed. The user's intention is to stop the behavior, which is a positive goal. But their method involves publicly shaming the cat-caller. \n\nPublic shaming can be a double-edged sword. On one hand, it might deter the person from cat-calling again. On the other, it could escalate the situation, making it more confrontational. The user mentions that they get cursed at and threatened, but they're big and no one has acted on it yet. However, there's a risk that someone might retaliate, leading to a physical confrontation.\n\nAlso, the user notes that women think they're making the situation worse by drawing attention. This is a valid point because sometimes, when someone is being harassed, having others intervene can either help or make them a target themselves. It's possible that the cat-caller might redirect their aggression towards the person intervening.\n\nAnother angle is the effectiveness. Is publicly shaming someone actually effective in changing behavior? Studies on shaming suggest it's not always effective and can sometimes lead to defensiveness. The user's approach might not be the most effective way to stop cat-calling. There might be better methods, like direct confrontation (if safe), reporting to authorities, or supporting systemic changes.\n\nAdditionally, the user admits they find it funny, which could indicate that their motivation isn't purely altruistic. While their intention to discourage cat-calling is good, mixing in personal amusement might not be the best approach. It could come off as mocking rather than a serious attempt to stop harassment.\n\nThere's also the aspect of personal safety. Even though the user is physically big, engaging in confrontations can be risky. It's possible that one day someone might take the threats seriously and act on them, leading to harm.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, some people might support the user's actions as standing up against harassment, while others might argue that it's not their place to police others, and that it could lead to more conflict. The rightness or wrongness can be subjective, but the potential negative consequences need to be weighed against the intended positive impact.\n\nSo, considering all these factors\u2014intentions, effectiveness, potential escalation, safety, and differing opinions\u2014it's a bit of a grey area. But the user's method could be seen as harmful if it escalates situations or puts others at risk. Therefore, the answer might lean towards A (they are in the wrong) because their approach, while well-intentioned, might not be the best way to address the issue and could have negative repercussions."
