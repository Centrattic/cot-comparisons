Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for loudly heckling cat-callers. They moved to a big city two months ago and started doing this as a way to address the problem. Their method is to \"booo!\" like a silent movie villain, which gets some negative reactions but they haven't been physically attacked yet. People around think they're an asshole, some men think they're a white knight risking a beating, women think they're making it worse. Their reasoning is to make the cat-caller uncomfortable, discourage the behavior, and create an atmosphere where others stop it. They also admit they find it funny but are unsure if they're an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. Cat-calling is generally considered harassment and disrespectful. The user's intention is to stop it, which is positive. However, their method is public heckling. The question is whether their method is appropriate.\n\nOn one hand, they're trying to address a harmful behavior, which is commendable. They might be contributing to a culture where such behavior isn't tolerated. But the user's approach could have unintended consequences. For example, making a scene might escalate the situation or draw unwanted attention, which some argue could make things worse. Also, if the heckling is disruptive or confrontational, it might not be the best approach.\n\nAnother angle is the potential for being seen as a jerk. If the user is loud and confrontational, others might perceive them as aggressive rather than helpful. Women might feel that the situation is now more attention-grabbing, which could intimidate them further. The user's size might also play a role, making others less likely to challenge them physically but not necessarily making their approach effective.\n\nAlso, the user's own admission about finding it funny is a red flag. If the motivation isn't purely about stopping harassment but also includes personal amusement, that could be problematic. It might come across as performative or insincere.\n\nIn terms of the right approach, there's a debate between direct confrontation and more subtle methods. Some might argue that bystander intervention training suggests more strategic approaches, like calmly telling the cat-caller to stop or supporting the victim without confrontation. The user's method might not be the most effective or safe. Also, the threats they receive indicate that their approach could lead to personal risk, even if they haven't faced it yet.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the user might be in the wrong not because they're trying to stop harassment, but because their method could be counterproductive, potentially harmful, and possibly disrespectful in its approach. The key is whether their action is the best way to address the issue without causing more problems. Therefore, the answer might be A (in the wrong) because their method isn't effective and could make things worse, even if the intent is good.\n"
