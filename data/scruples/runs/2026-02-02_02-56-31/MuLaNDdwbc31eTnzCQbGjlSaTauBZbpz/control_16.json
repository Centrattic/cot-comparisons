Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that they've been heckling cat-callers by making loud \"booo!\" noises, which is causing some backlash. The person is asking if they're an asshole (AITA) for doing this.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics of the situation. Cat-calling is generally considered disrespectful and unwelcome behavior. The author is trying to stop it by making the cat-callers uncomfortable, which could be seen as standing up against harassment. But they're doing it in a public way that might involve confrontation.\n\nThe author mentions that both men and women have different reactions. Men think they might be inviting trouble, and women think it draws more attention and makes things worse. The author's rationale is that making the cat-callers uncomfortable might deter them and create a culture where others also stop the behavior. They also admit they find it funny, which might be part of their motivation.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong (answer A) or not (B)? The key factors here are the intent and the consequences. The intent is to stop harassment, which is a positive goal. However, the method might be seen as provocative. By loudly heckling, they could be escalating the situation, leading to potential confrontations or violence. The cat-caller might feel shamed, leading to aggression. Also, the author admits to getting cussing and threats, which shows some negative interactions.\n\nOn the other hand, bystander intervention can be effective in reducing harassment. The author is taking a stand, which might encourage others to do the same. However, the approach might not be the most effective. For example, some studies suggest that direct confrontation can sometimes escalate situations. Alternatively, reporting to authorities or using more passive methods (like not responding at all) might be safer.\n\nThe author's size and ability to handle threats might mitigate some risks, but the behavior still could be seen as aggressive. Whether it's right or wrong might depend on cultural context too. In some places, public shaming like this might be more accepted as a form of protest. In others, it might be seen as inciting conflict.\n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the action is meant to protect others from harassment, that's a positive intent. However, the method could be problematic because it's confrontational and might lead to further issues. The author is taking a stance against harassment, which is commendable, but the method's effectiveness and appropriateness are questionable. So it's a bit of a gray area.\n\nGiven that, I need to decide between A and B. If the consensus is that their method is more harmful than helpful despite good intentions, then A. If it's seen as a valid form of protest, then B. Since the author is causing discomfort to the cat-callers but not physically harming them, and the goal is positive, maybe B is the answer. But there's also the risk of making the situation worse by drawing attention. Hmm.\n\nI think the answer is B (not in the wrong) because the intent is to prevent harassment, which is a good cause. However, it's worth noting that there might be better ways to handle it. The author isn't physically harming anyone, just using verbal protest. So, unless there's a specific rule in the city against it, it's a form of free speech. However, if it's causing more harm (e.g., making victims uncomfortable or escalating to violence), that could tip it towards A. But given the info here, B seems more likely.\n"
