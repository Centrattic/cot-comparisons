Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for heckling cat-callers. They\u2019ve been doing it for two months, using a \"booo\" like a silent movie villain. They get some backlash but think it might deter the behavior.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The user's intention is to discourage catcalling, which is a valid concern. Catcalling is generally considered harassing and unwanted, so the user's stance against it is understandable. However, their method is public heckling, which might escalate the situation. \n\nThe responses from others are mixed. Men think they're a white knight risking a beating, women think it draws more attention and worsens the situation. Women's concerns are important here because catcalling is about making women feel unsafe. Adding a confrontation might make the situation more stressful for the woman involved, even if it's meant to help. \n\nAlso, the user mentions they find it funny, which could be seen as using the situation for personal amusement rather than genuine help. The effectiveness of their method is questionable. If it's causing the cat-callers to curse back or threaten them, maybe it's not creating a positive atmosphere. Instead, it might be a spectacle that doesn't address the root issue. \n\nOn the other hand, public shaming of the cat-callers might deter them, as the user argues. But there's a risk of creating a cycle of aggression. It's also possible that the user is overestimating their impact and underestimating the potential harm, like making the women feel more exposed or the cat-callers more antagonistic.\n\nLegally, unless the heckling becomes a form of harassment itself, it's hard to say it's wrong. But ethically, the user needs to consider if their approach is truly helping the victims. Maybe alternative methods, like reporting or supporting systemic changes, would be more effective. \n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, the user might be well-intentioned but using a method that could worsen the situation. The key is whether their actions are genuinely supporting the person being harassed or inadvertently making it worse. Since women think it draws attention and makes things worse, that's a strong point in favor of the user being in the wrong. Their approach might not be as helpful as they think and could cause more harm than good.\n"
