Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for loudly heckling cat-callers. The scenario is that the author, in a big city, has started to respond to cat-calling by making a loud \"booo!\" sound, similar to a silent movie villain, to discourage the behavior. The person is getting some backlash but also feels they're doing the right thing.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. Cat-calling is generally considered a form of harassment, especially towards women. The author is trying to intervene, which is a positive intent. However, the method they're using is public shaming or heckling. The question is whether this approach is appropriate.\n\nOn one hand, the author is standing up against harassment, which is a valid stance. Publicly confronting the cat-caller might deter them and support the victim. The author mentions that they are larger and haven't faced physical retaliation yet, so maybe they feel physically capable.\n\nOn the other hand, public shaming can sometimes escalate situations. The cat-caller might become more aggressive if they feel attacked. Also, the author's approach could draw unwanted attention to the victim, making the situation worse. The commenters mentioned that both men and women think the author is an asshole, with women being concerned about drawing more attention to the harassment. This suggests that the method might not be effective and could be counterproductive.\n\nAnother angle is the intent versus the impact. The author's intent is to discourage the behavior, but the impact could be making the environment more hostile, not just for the cat-caller but also for potential victims. There's a risk that this kind of intervention might not actually help the victim and could put them or the intervenor in danger if the situation escalates.\n\nAlso, there's the aspect of personal responsibility. The author is taking on a role as an enforcer of social norms, which can be problematic if not done carefully. Some might argue that the appropriate response is to support the victim and encourage them to report the harassment rather than confronting the perpetrator directly in a public manner.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, there's a growing movement against harassment, and public interventions are sometimes supported. However, the method of intervention matters. The \"booo!\" might be seen as humorous or dismissive, which might not be the best approach. It's possible that the author is projecting their own views on how to handle harassment without considering the complexities of the victims' experiences.\n\nAdditionally, the author's admission of possibly being a hypocrite adds a layer of self-awareness. Their own acknowledgment that others think they're an asshole suggests that their method isn't universally accepted, which is a red flag.\n\nIn conclusion, while the intent is good, the method might not be the most effective or safe approach. Public shaming can have unintended consequences, and there might be better ways to address cat-calling, such as supporting the victim and promoting a culture of respect without escalating the situation. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for how they're handling the situation.\n"
