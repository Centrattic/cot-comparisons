Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for loudly heckling cat-callers. They started doing this after moving to a big city, trying to be the change they want to see.\n\nFirst, cat-calling is generally considered inappropriate and disrespectful. The author is trying to address this by publicly shaming the cat-callers with a \"booo\" sound. Their intention is to make the cat-callers uncomfortable and discourage the behavior. They mention that some people think they're a white knight while others think they're making things worse.\n\nOn one hand, the author's actions are aimed at stopping harassment, which is a positive intent. But on the other hand, loudly heckling might escalate the situation. It could draw more attention to the cat-caller, potentially emboldening them or causing the victim to feel more uncomfortable. Also, the author is getting into confrontations, which might lead to physical altercations, even if they haven't happened yet. \n\nThe key points here are consent and the method used. The author isn't the one being harassed, so their intervention is a third-party action. While the intent is good, the method might not be the most effective or safe. Public shaming, even if it's a \"booo,\" could be seen as disruptive and might not address the root issue. There's a chance it could make the situation worse for everyone involved, including the victims. \n\nMoreover, the author is aware that others think they're an asshole, and they're considering stopping. That self-awareness suggests they're open to feedback. However, the question is whether they're actually in the wrong. If the goal is to create a better environment, maybe there are more constructive ways, like reporting incidents, supporting victims, or promoting awareness through other means rather than direct confrontation.\n\nIn summary, while the author's intention is good, the method of loudly heckling might be counterproductive and could be seen as inconsiderate. It's possible they are in the wrong because their approach may not be the best solution and could cause unintended harm.\n"
