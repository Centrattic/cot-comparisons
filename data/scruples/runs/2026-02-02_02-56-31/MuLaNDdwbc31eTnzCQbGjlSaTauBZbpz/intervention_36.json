Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for loudly heckling cat-callers. They've been doing this for two months since moving to a big city. They use the \"booo!\" like a silent movie villain. People around think they're an asshole, with some guys calling them a white knight and girls saying it makes things worse. The user's reasoning is to make the cat-caller uncomfortable to discourage the behavior and maybe create a better atmosphere. They also find it funny but are wondering if they're being an asshole.\n\nSo, the question is whether their actions are wrong. Let me break it down. On one hand, cat-calling is a form of harassment and is definitely inappropriate. The user is trying to stand up against that, which is a good intention. But their method is to publicly shame the cat-caller by heckling them. The user is big and hasn't faced physical consequences yet, but others are upset. The people around think they're causing more attention, which might make the situation worse. The user's approach might be seen as confrontational and possibly escalating the situation, even if the intent is good.\n\nNow, the key points here are the intent vs. the impact. The user wants to stop the harassment by making the cat-caller uncomfortable. However, the effectiveness of this method is questionable. Drawing attention to the situation might not be helpful for the person being harassed, as it could put them in a more uncomfortable position. Also, the response of the cat-caller (cussing and threatening) shows that the user's method isn't de-escalating the situation but potentially making it more confrontational.\n\nAnother angle is whether the user's actions are appropriate. While the intention is good, the method might not be the best. Public shaming can sometimes backfire or lead to more conflict. It's important to consider the safety of everyone involved. The user might be overestimating their ability to handle potential physical altercations, even if they haven't been harmed yet. \n\nAdditionally, the user's own admission that girls think it's making things worse is a significant point. The people who are being harassed might not want more attention drawn to their situation. The user's actions could inadvertently put the victim in a more vulnerable spot. \n\nSo, while the user is trying to do the right thing, their approach might not be the most effective or considerate. There are better ways to address harassment without escalating the situation, such as reporting the behavior to authorities, supporting the person being harassed, or using non-confrontational methods to discourage the cat-caller. \n\nTherefore, even though the intent is good, the method could be wrong. The user might be in the wrong because their approach could be making things worse for the victims and creating more conflict rather than solving the issue.\n"
