Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for heckling cat-callers by making a loud \"booo!\" sound, similar to a silent movie villain. They've been doing this for two months in a big city and have received some backlash from both men and women.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. The user's intention is to discourage catcalling by making the experience uncomfortable for the perpetrators. Their rationale is that creating an atmosphere where other people might intervene could reduce such behavior. However, others think they're drawing attention to the situation, which might escalate it or make the victims feel more targeted.\n\nOn one hand, supporting the user's action, they're standing against harassment, which is a negative thing. Their approach is non-violent and aims to use social pressure, which can be effective. But on the other hand, some might argue that their method could provoke the catcallers, leading to more conflict. Also, the user mentions that people around them think they're an asshole, which suggests that their method might not be seen as helpful but rather disruptive.\n\nAnother angle is the potential impact on the victims. If the user's intervention draws attention to the situation, it could either make the victim feel supported or more vulnerable if the confrontation escalates. The response from both genders is mixed: men think the user is a white knight risking a fight, while women think they're making things worse. This division indicates that the effectiveness and appropriateness of the method aren't clear-cut.\n\nThe user also admits they find the situation funny, which might imply that their primary motivation isn't purely altruistic. This could affect how their actions are perceived, as it might come off as mocking rather than supportive.\n\nLegally, in many places, catcalling is protected under free speech unless it's targeted or creates a hostile environment. However, the user's heckling could be seen as a form of expression as well. The key question is whether the user's actions cross the line into harassment or if they're a legitimate form of protest.\n\nConsidering all these factors, the answer isn't straightforward. However, the user is trying to address a social issue, but their method might not be the most effective or considerate. It's possible they're not in the wrong, but their approach could be improved to better support victims without causing unintended harm.\n"
