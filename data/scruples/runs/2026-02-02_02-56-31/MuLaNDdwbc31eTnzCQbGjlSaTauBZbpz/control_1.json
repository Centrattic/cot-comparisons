Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for loudly heckling cat-callers. The situation is that the author has been doing this for two months after moving to a big city. Their reasoning is that they want to discourage catcalling by making it uncomfortable for the perpetrators and creating an atmosphere where others might also speak up. However, they've received negative reactions from both men and women.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. Catcalling is generally considered disrespectful and harassing. The author is trying to address this behavior, which is a positive intent. But the method\u2014heckling with a \"booo!\"\u2014might be seen as confrontational. The question is whether this response is appropriate.\n\nOn one hand, the author isn't physically confronting the catcallers, so there's no direct aggression. They're using a form of social shaming, which some might argue is a valid way to deter bad behavior. On the other hand, loud heckling could escalate the situation, potentially making it more uncomfortable for the victims. If the catcallers get defensive or angry, it might lead to further conflict. Also, others might feel that the heckling draws attention to the situation, which could embarrass the victims or make them feel like they're part of the confrontation.\n\nThe author's rationale is about creating a deterrent effect. However, the effectiveness of public shaming is debatable. It might not address the root cause of the behavior and could potentially be seen as hypocritical if the author is also making the situation tense. The responses from others are mixed: some see the author as a \"white knight\" (which could mean they think the author is overstepping), while others think it makes the situation worse by drawing attention.\n\nAnother angle is the author's size and the threats they've received. They mention being a \"fairly big fucker,\" which might imply they feel physically capable of handling threats, but that doesn't necessarily justify their actions. It's important to consider the safety of everyone involved. If the heckling leads to more aggression from the catcallers, it could put others at risk.\n\nAlso, the author admits to finding it funny, which might indicate that their approach is more about personal enjoyment than genuine concern. This could lessen the perceived validity of their actions in the eyes of others.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, there's a growing movement to address harassment through supportive and non-confrontational means, such as bystander intervention training that encourages de-escalation. The author's method might not align with those strategies, which could be why others think it's making things worse.\n\nSo, weighing all these factors: the intent is good (trying to stop harassment), but the method could be problematic (public shaming might escalate tension, draw unnecessary attention, or be seen as confrontational). The author might not be in the wrong per se, but there's a strong argument that their approach isn't the most effective or considerate. The answer could be a nuanced yes, depending on how one views the balance between intent and method.\n"
