Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who's heckling cat-callers is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nThe author is in a big city and has taken to loudly \"booo!\" at cat-callers, trying to make the experience uncomfortable for them. They mention that guys think they're a \"white knight\" who's asking for trouble, and women think they're making the situation worse by drawing attention. The author's rationale is to discourage the behavior and create an atmosphere where others might tell the cat-callers to stop. They also admit they find it funny.\n\nSo the question is whether this is the right approach. The key points to consider here are: is the author's action effective in stopping the harassment, is it escalating the situation, and is it appropriate?\n\nFirst, cat-calling is a form of harassment and can make people feel unsafe. The author's intent is positive\u2014they want to stop it. But the method is to confront the cat-caller publicly by heckling them. The problem here is that the author is inserting themselves into a situation that isn't their direct problem. \n\nWhen someone is being cat-called, the person being harassed might not want others to intervene because it could escalate the situation. For example, if the author's heckling leads to the cat-caller becoming angrier or more aggressive, it could put the person being harassed at more risk. The article mentions that the author gets cussed at and threats, which might not resolve the issue and could make the harassment worse. \n\nAlso, the author admits that others think they are making things worse. Women think it's drawing attention and making the situation worse. This is a valid concern. The person being harassed might not want to be part of this confrontation, and the author's actions could inadvertently make them a target as well. \n\nAnother aspect is the author's own admission of humor. If they are doing this partly for their own amusement, it might not be the most respectful approach to a serious issue. It's easy to see this as performative allyship, where the author is seeking to look like they're helping but might not actually be addressing the root problem.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's intention is to discourage the behavior by making the cat-caller uncomfortable. There's a belief that peer pressure could work. However, in practice, public confrontations can sometimes make the cat-caller more defensive or hostile. It's possible that the method isn't effective and might even backfire, as the author has received threats but no real evidence that the behavior is being discouraged.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's a matter of perspective. The author's intent is good, but the method could be problematic. It's possible they are overstepping by taking personal action without considering the safety of those involved. The best approach might be to support the person being harassed, like suggesting they report it to authorities or using non-confrontational methods. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's actions are likely causing more harm than good. Even though their intent is positive, the execution might be counterproductive. Therefore, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong (A).\n"
