Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the person who loudly heckles cat-callers is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is in a big city and has started loudly \"boooo!\" at cat-callers to make them uncomfortable and discourage the behavior. They get negative reactions from both men and women. The author's reasoning is to create an environment where others might also confront cat-calling.\n\nNow, considering the morality here. Cat-calling is generally seen as a form of harassment, especially towards women. The author is trying to stop it, which is a positive intent. However, their method is public heckling, which might be seen as escalating the situation. The question is whether this method is appropriate.\n\nOn one hand, the author is standing up against harassment, which is commendable. Their intention is to reduce the behavior by making it uncomfortable for the offenders. On the other hand, some people argue that this public confrontation might draw more attention to the cat-caller, potentially embarrassing them or causing a confrontation that could escalate. The author does mention that some people think they're making things worse by drawing attention.\n\nBut the key point is whether the author is in the wrong. Legally, cat-calling is a form of harassment, and the author is intervening. However, using public heckling could be seen as a form of confrontation that might not be the most effective method. But is it morally wrong? The author isn't using physical violence or threatening language, just verbal disapproval. \n\nAnother angle: bystander intervention. Studies suggest that sometimes direct, clear disapproval can be effective. However, the method here is loud, which might not be the best approach. But the intent is good. The author is trying to create a social norm against cat-calling.\n\nThe responses from others are mixed: guys think they're a \"white knight\" risking a beating, women think they're making it worse. But the author isn't physically intervening, just verbal. So, even if others disagree, the act of verbally opposing harassment isn't inherently wrong. The question is whether the method is inappropriate. \n\nIn many contexts, standing up against harassment is considered right. However, the method might not be the most effective. But the question is about being in the wrong, not effectiveness. Unless there's a specific rule against this behavior in the city, the author isn't breaking any laws. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author's intent is to prevent harassment, and while the method might be debatable, the act of intervening is positive. Therefore, they aren't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
