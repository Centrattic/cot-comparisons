Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who heckles cat-callers is in the wrong. The author is doing this to discourage the behavior and create a better atmosphere, but others think they're an asshole. \n\nFirst, cat-calling is generally considered harassment and is unacceptable. The author is trying to intervene, which is a good intention. But the method is loud heckling, which might escalate the situation. The problem is that while the goal is positive, the approach could be counterproductive.\n\nWhen someone is being harassed, the best approach is often to support the victim without putting oneself in a dangerous situation. The author's method might draw attention, which the victims might not want, as the author mentions that some women think it's making things worse. Also, the author is using a confrontational method that could provoke the harassers, leading to potential conflict or escalation. \n\nThe author is a \"big fucker\" and hasn't faced consequences yet, but that doesn't mean it's safe. Confrontations can be risky, and even if the author feels capable, it's not a good idea to encourage others to do the same. The right approach would be to report the harassment to authorities or use non-confrontational methods to support victims, like creating awareness through other means.\n\nSo, while the intention is good, the method might be flawed. The author could be seen as overstepping, making the situation more hostile, and not addressing the root issue effectively. Therefore, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
