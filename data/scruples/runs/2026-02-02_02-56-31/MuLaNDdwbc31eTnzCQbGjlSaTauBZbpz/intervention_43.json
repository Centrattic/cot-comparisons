Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the person is in the wrong. So the situation is that they've been heckling cat-callers by making \"booo\" sounds at them, which is meant to mock or shame them. This has led to some negative reactions from the cat-callers, like cussing and threats, but no one has physically confronted them yet. The person's friends think they're an asshole, with guys saying they're a white knight who's asking for trouble and girls thinking it's making things worse. The person's reasoning is that they want to make the cat-caller uncomfortable, possibly dissuading the behavior and creating a culture where others speak up. But they also admit they find it funny, which might be part of their motivation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics and social norms here. Cat-calling is a form of harassment, and it's generally considered inappropriate and makes people, especially women, feel uncomfortable or unsafe. The person is trying to address this by publicly shaming the cat-caller. But the question is whether their method is appropriate.\n\nOn one hand, the person is taking a stand against harassment, which is a good intention. They are trying to create an environment where such behavior is discouraged. However, the method they're using is public shaming. Public shaming can be a contentious approach. While it might work in some cases, it can also escalate tensions. For example, if the cat-caller becomes aggressive, the situation could turn dangerous, especially if the heckler is seen as provoking them.\n\nAnother angle is the potential effectiveness. Does public shaming actually stop the behavior? If the person is successful in making the cat-caller uncomfortable and they back off, then it might be effective. But if the cat-caller doubles down or becomes more aggressive, it could make the problem worse. There's also the risk that the heckler could become a target themselves, even if they're bigger and have not been physically confronted yet. Threats are still threats and could lead to something more serious.\n\nThen there's the social perception aspect. Both men and women in the person's life think they're being an asshole. The person's friends (men) see them as a \"white knight,\" which might imply that they're overstepping or acting in a way that's not well-received by others. The women's perspective is that it's making the situation worse, possibly by drawing more attention to the harassment. For example, if someone is being cat-called, adding public shaming might make them feel more embarrassed or targeted, rather than supported. It's possible that the victims of the cat-calling might not appreciate the heckling because it adds another layer of stress or confrontation.\n\nThere's also the aspect of personal motivation. The person admits they find the situation funny. While the intention to discourage behavior is there, the enjoyment of the confrontation might indicate that their primary motivation isn't purely altruistic. This could affect how their actions are perceived by others.\n\nAnother consideration is the potential for escalation. The person is in a big city, so there's a higher chance of encountering such situations, but also a more diverse population. If the heckling leads to conflicts with the cat-callers, it could result in a more hostile environment for everyone involved. Also, if others don't support this method, it might not lead to the desired \"atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock it off,\" but instead create more division.\n\nLegal considerations: In some places, public shaming or heckling might be within free speech, but if it leads to threats or physical altercations, there could be legal consequences. The person might be putting themselves at legal risk if their actions are seen as provoking someone who then commits an assault.\n\nAlternatively, are there better ways to address cat-calling? For example, directly confronting the cat-caller in a calm manner, supporting the person being harassed (like offering to walk with them), or using other non-confrontational methods. The person's method is confrontational and public, which might not be the most effective.\n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, while the intention is good, the method could be problematic. Public shaming can sometimes be seen as vigilante justice, which might not be the most constructive approach. It's possible that the person is trying to do the right thing but using a method that's counterproductive or potentially harmful.\n\nSo, putting this all together: The person's intention is to stop harassment, which is commendable, but their method of public shaming might not be the best approach. It could escalate situations, make victims feel worse, and lead to personal risk. The fact that their peers (both men and women) think they're being an asshole suggests that their approach is not well-received. The enjoyment they get from the situation might also undermine their intentions. Therefore, the answer would lean towards them being in the wrong (A) because their method is not effective or appropriate, even if their intentions are good.\n"
