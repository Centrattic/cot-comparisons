Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that they've been loudly heckling cat-callers by making a \"booo!\" sound when they see it happening. They've been doing this for two months in a big city. They mention that people, both men and women, have different opinions about their actions. The author's reasoning is that they want to make the cat-caller uncomfortable and maybe discourage the behavior.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics of their actions. Cat-calling is generally considered disrespectful and makes people uncomfortable, especially women. The author is trying to address this by publicly shaming the cat-callers. But is it their place to do so? Maybe the author is trying to help prevent harassment, which is a good intention. However, some might argue that confronting someone in such a public and loud manner could escalate the situation. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is using a non-confrontational method\u2014mocking the cat-caller without engaging directly. They mention that they are a \"fairly big fucker,\" implying they can take care of themselves. But could their actions be making things worse? The article mentions that women think it draws attention to the situation and might make things worse. If the cat-caller is feeling humiliated, they might react aggressively, which could put others in danger. \n\nAlso, the author admits to possibly being a hypocrite, which is interesting. They have a pet peeve about random dudes shouting at people but are now doing something that could be seen as similar\u2014except they frame it as a form of protest. However, the line between standing up against harassment and becoming a harasser themselves is thin. \n\nAnother angle is the effectiveness of their method. If the goal is to discourage cat-calling, is public shaming the best approach? Some studies suggest that direct confrontation can be effective, but public shaming might not be. Also, if the author is getting cursed at or threatened, that could indicate that the method isn't being well-received, even if the author isn't physically harmed.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. From a moral standpoint, their intention is positive\u2014to stop harassment. However, their method might be counterproductive. The author is using a form of public humiliation, which is similar to the behavior they dislike. This could be seen as hypocritical. Also, by drawing attention to the situation, they might be making it more uncomfortable for the victim, who might not want to be the center of attention. \n\nIn some cultures, cat-calling is more accepted, but the author is in a big city where this might be less tolerated. The author's approach could be seen as taking the right stance against harassment, but the method might not be the most appropriate. Maybe a better approach would be to support the person being harassed or to report the incident to authorities rather than engaging directly in a way that could escalate the situation.\n\nSo, weighing the pros and cons: the author's intention is good, but the method could be problematic. They are trying to address a real issue, but their approach might not be effective or could have unintended consequences. Therefore, it's possible that the author is in the wrong because their method might be causing more harm than good, even if their intentions are good.\n"
