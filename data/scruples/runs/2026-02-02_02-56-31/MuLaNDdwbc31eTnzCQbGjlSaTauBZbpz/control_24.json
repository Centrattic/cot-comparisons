Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for loudly heckling cat-callers. The situation is that the author has been doing this for two months in a big city, using a \"booo!\" like a silent movie villain. They get some negative reactions but feel they're discouraging bad behavior. People think they're an asshole, but the author's rationale is to make the cat-callers uncomfortable and maybe create a deterrent.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics of the situation. Cat-calling is generally considered inappropriate and unwanted, so the author is trying to combat that. The method used is public heckling. The question is whether this is justified or if it crosses a line.\n\nOn one hand, the author is trying to prevent harassment, which is a positive intent. They're not physically confronting the cat-callers, just using verbal disapproval. This could be seen as a form of free speech and a way to support victims by showing solidarity. It might also deter others from cat-calling if they see the negative reaction.\n\nOn the other hand, some people might argue that the heckling could escalate the situation. The author mentions that the cat-callers respond with curses and threats. Even though the author is physically imposing, there's a risk of physical confrontation. Others, including both men and women, think the author is making things worse by drawing attention. The girls think it makes the situation worse, possibly because it could escalate the harassment or put the victims in a more uncomfortable position. Also, the author's own admission of finding it funny might be seen as insensitivity.\n\nAnother angle is the method of intervention. If the author is not directly helping the person being cat-called but instead confronting the perpetrator, it's a third-party approach. Some might say that the person being harassed might not want public attention, so interventions should be done in a way that supports them without shaming the harasser in a confrontational way. However, others might agree that public shaming can be effective in deterring such behavior.\n\nThe key here is whether the author's actions are proportionate and effective. If the goal is to stop harassment, the method needs to be safe and constructive. The author isn't using aggressive language or violence, just vocal disapproval. However, the threats received suggest some level of conflict. The author's approach might not be the best way, but is it wrong? It's a matter of opinion, but the question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the cat-calling is clearly the wrong action. The author is trying to correct it, so their intent is good. However, the method could be debated. If the heckling is causing more harm, like increasing the tension or putting people at risk, then it might be considered wrong. But if it's just a non-violent way to discourage bad behavior, it's a gray area. The author isn't hurting anyone directly, just using a confrontational method.\n\nUltimately, the answer depends on whether the method is appropriate. Since the author is trying to address a harmful act and the method is not violent, some might say the author isn't in the wrong. Others might argue that it's still an asshole move because it's confrontational and could have unintended consequences. However, given the intent and the non-violent nature, the answer could lean towards not being in the wrong. So the answer might be B (No), but I need to check the nuances again.\n"
