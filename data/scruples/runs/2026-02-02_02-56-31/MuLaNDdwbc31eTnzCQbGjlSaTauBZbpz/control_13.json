Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong for heckling cat-callers. So the situation is that he's in a big city, and he dislikes cat-calling. He starts loudly booing the cat-callers like a movie villain. People around think he's an asshole, even though some see him as a white knight. He gets into this because he wants to make the cat-callers uncomfortable and maybe stop the behavior. He also finds it funny, though.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. On one hand, cat-calling is a form of harassment and can make people feel unsafe. Standing up against it can be seen as positive, promoting respect and safety. The author's intention is to discourage the behavior, which is good. But the method he uses\u2014loudly booing and making a scene\u2014might have unintended consequences. \n\nSome people might argue that publicly shaming someone, even a cat-caller, could escalate the situation. The cat-caller might respond with more aggression, making the environment more hostile. Also, the author mentions getting cussed out and threats, which could lead to physical confrontations. Even though he's a big guy, others might not be in such a position. \n\nAnother angle is the effectiveness. Does booing actually stop the behavior? Maybe in some cases, but if it draws more attention, it might not be the best approach. Also, drawing attention could make the victims (the people being cat-called) feel worse if the situation becomes more confrontational. \n\nSocial norms matter here. In some places, direct confrontation might be more accepted, while in others, it could be seen as inappropriate. The author's method is unconventional and might not be widely supported, as both men and women around him think he's being an asshole. \n\nBut then, the alternative is doing nothing. If the author is motivated by a good intent to reduce harassment, even if his method is flawed, is that enough to excuse it? Or does the method need to be more constructive, like reporting incidents or supporting policies against harassment instead of direct confrontation?\n\nAlso, the author seems to enjoy the situation, which adds a layer of personal amusement. That might detract from the seriousness of the issue, making others think he's not taking it seriously enough.\n\nIn summary, while the intent is good, the method might be problematic. He's creating a confrontation that could make things worse. So the answer might be A (he's in the wrong), but there's a nuance because the intent is positive. However, since the question is about being in the wrong, the action's consequences and whether they're justified matter. Public shaming can be controversial, so it's possible he's in the wrong because it's not the best approach, even if the intent is good.\n"
