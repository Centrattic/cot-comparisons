Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if they're in the wrong for heckling cat-callers. Let's break this down. The person moved to a big city two months ago and started loudly \"booo\"ing cat-callers, which has led to some backlash with curses and threats. They mention that their peers don't think they're an asshole, but others, especially women, think it's making things worse. The user's reasoning is that making the cat-caller uncomfortable might discourage them, and they want to create an atmosphere where others also stop the behavior. They also admit they find it funny, which might complicate things.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. The user is trying to address a problem they find offensive\u2014cat-calling. Their method is public confrontation, which could be seen as standing up against harassment. On one hand, their intention is to stop harmful behavior, which is positive. But on the other hand, their method might escalate the situation. The threats they receive suggest that their approach could provoke a negative reaction. Also, the user is a \"fairly big fucker,\" which might contribute to others not challenging them directly, but does that justify their actions?\n\nAnother angle is the potential to draw attention. The user says that women think they're making it worse by drawing attention. Cat-calling can make victims feel more vulnerable; adding public confrontation might not be helpful. It's possible that the cat-caller is already intimidating, and the user's heckling could escalate the situation, putting others at risk. Also, the user's approach might not address the root issue or encourage the cat-caller to reflect on their behavior in a constructive way. Instead, it might just lead to retaliation or more hostility.\n\nThen there's the personal enjoyment aspect. The user admits they find it funny. That could be problematic if their enjoyment comes from others' discomfort, even if the cause is just. It's important to consider if their actions are motivated by a genuine desire to help or a personal thrill. If the latter, that might be seen as using others' harassment for their own entertainment.\n\nHowever, the user's intention to create a culture where others also speak out against cat-calling is commendable. But the method might not be effective. There's a difference between standing up against harassment and engaging in a public confrontation that could backfire. Maybe there are more constructive ways to address the issue without escalating tensions.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, public heckling might not be the most accepted form of intervention. Laws regarding public behavior might also come into play if the user's actions are seen as inciting trouble. Even if their intent is noble, the method could be considered confrontational and potentially illegal, depending on the jurisdiction.\n\nConsidering all these points, the user's actions might not be entirely wrong if their intention is to stop harassment, but the method could be counterproductive. They might be causing more harm than good by escalating situations and drawing attention. The fact that others think they're making it worse is a red flag. While their intent is to help, the approach might not be effective or safe. Therefore, the answer might lean towards them being in the wrong (A) because their method could be causing more issues despite good intentions.\n"
