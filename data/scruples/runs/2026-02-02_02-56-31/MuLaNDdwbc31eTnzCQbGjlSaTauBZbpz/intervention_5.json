Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether they're in the wrong for heckling cat-callers. They started doing this in a big city after moving there, and they've been getting mixed reactions. The main question is whether their actions are justified or if they're being an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. Cat-calling is generally considered unacceptable behavior, and the user is trying to confront it by making a loud \"*booo!*\" sound. They mention that guys see them as a \"white knight\" who might get beaten up, while women think it's making things worse by drawing attention. The user's rationale is making the cat-caller uncomfortable to discourage the behavior and create a better atmosphere. But they also admit it might be hypocritical and are unsure if they're an asshole.\n\nNow, considering the options: A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no). \n\nOn one hand, the user is trying to address a negative behavior, which is commendable. Their intention is to stop cat-calling, which many people find harassing. However, their method involves public confrontation, which could escalate the situation. By making a big scene, they might be putting themselves and others at risk. Also, women's perspective here is important\u2014drawing attention could indeed make situations more dangerous. If the cat-caller is threatened or angry, it might lead to violence against the person being heckled or even the intervenor. \n\nOn the other hand, the user's goal is positive. They're trying to create a safer environment. But the method might not be the most effective. Maybe a more discreet intervention or reporting the behavior would be better. Also, the user is big and hasn't faced physical consequences yet, but that doesn't mean it's safe long-term. \n\nAnother angle: Is it the user's place to intervene? If they're not the target of the cat-calling, stepping in as a bystander can be tricky. While it's good to support others, the approach should be safe and effective. The \"*booo!*\" might not actually stop the behavior and could make the cat-caller more aggressive. Plus, if the user is being threatened, it's a sign that their method is causing conflict rather than resolving it.\n\nAlso, hypocrisy is mentioned. The user says they're about to be a hypocrite, so maybe they do cat-call or have other issues. But that's not clear. Maybe they're being self-aware, though.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, bystander intervention is encouraged, but it's usually recommended to be non-confrontational if possible. Shouting might not be the best method. There's a balance between standing up against harassment and ensuring personal safety and not escalating the situation.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The user's intention is good, but their method could be problematic. They might be in the wrong if their approach is causing more harm than good, like attracting attention, risking violence, or not effectively stopping the behavior. Alternatively, if their actions are helping deter cat-calling without causing issues, then maybe not. But since the reactions are mixed and there's a risk of escalation, it's possible they're in the wrong. However, the answer isn't straightforward. But the question is asking for A or B. \n\nI think the correct answer is A: Yes, they are in the wrong. Because while the intent is good, the method is confrontational and potentially harmful. There are better ways to address cat-calling without putting oneself and others at risk. The user's actions might be counterproductive, as they could escalate the situation instead of de-escalating it. Women's concerns about drawing attention are valid, as harassment can sometimes lead to violent reactions. Therefore, the user's approach is flawed, making them in the wrong.\n"
