Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for loudly heckling cat-callers. They started doing this after moving to a big city, and they get some backlash but also think they're helping. People around them have mixed opinions: some guys think they're a white knight, while girls think they're making things worse. Their reasoning is that making the cat-caller uncomfortable might discourage the behavior.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical angle. Cat-calling is generally seen as harassing and unwelcome. The user's intention is to stop it by making the cat-caller feel uncomfortable. But does that method cross a line? If the user is using loud boos, that could be seen as confrontation. The problem is that even if the intent is good, the method might escalate the situation. \n\nThen, the users' friends' opinions: some see them as a white knight, others as an asshole. The key here is whether the action is effective and respectful. The user is a \"fairly big fucker,\" so maybe they can handle the threats, but others might not. Also, the user mentions that women think they're making it worse. Maybe the heckling draws attention and could make the situation more uncomfortable for the victim. \n\nAnother angle: public harassment and how to address it. Some might say that the user is taking matters into their own hands, which could be admirable, but others might say it's not the best approach. There's also the aspect of whether this action is productive. Does it actually stop the cat-caller, or just create a confrontation without solving the underlying issue?\n\nThe user also says they find it funny. That might come across as not taking the issue seriously enough. Using humor in a serious situation could be seen as dismissive or even contributing to the problem. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The intent is good, but the method might not be effective. The user's actions could be seen as a form of public shaming, which might not be the best approach. It's possible that by drawing attention, the user is inadvertently making the situation more stressful for the victim. \n\nAlso, considering the responses from others, if women are saying it's making it worse, that's a strong indicator that the method might not be appropriate. The user should consider alternative ways to address cat-calling, such as supporting the victim without confrontation or reporting the behavior to authorities if possible.\n\nSo, putting it all together, while the user's intention is to stop harassment, their method could be counterproductive and potentially harmful. Therefore, the user might be in the wrong for using this approach.\n"
