Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if they're in the wrong for heckling cat-callers. Let me try to break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: They're in a big city, and they've been loudly \"boooo\"ing cat-callers for two months. The motivation is to make the cat-caller uncomfortable and maybe discourage the behavior. They've gotten some negative reactions, like curses and threats, but no physical confrontation. Their friends think they're an asshole, with some guys thinking they're inviting trouble and girls saying it makes things worse. They're wondering if they're the asshole here.\n\nSo, the key points are: their intent is to stop harassment, but their method is public heckling. Now, cat-calling is generally considered unacceptable, so their goal is good. But their approach\u2014publicly shaming the cat-caller\u2014might have unintended consequences.\n\nOn one hand, they're trying to address a problem. On the other, their method could escalate the situation. The girls' perspective is that drawing attention might make things worse. If the heckling leads to more confrontation or embarrassment, maybe it's not helping. Also, the user mentions they find it funny, which might suggest they're more about the spectacle than helping the victim.\n\nBut then, is it their responsibility to intervene? Some might say yes, but others might argue that it's not their place and that it could put them or others at risk. Also, the threats they've received indicate that their actions are provocative. Even if they're not at physical risk, creating tension in public spaces could be seen as problematic.\n\nAnother angle: the effectiveness. If their method is not actually stopping the behavior but just making the cat-caller angry, maybe it's not effective. Also, could it inadvertently make the victim feel more uncomfortable? For example, if someone is being cat-called, having strangers yell at the perpetrator might be helpful or could draw unwanted attention to the victim.\n\nSo, considering all this, the answer might hinge on whether the method is constructive. Public shaming can sometimes backfire. The user's intent is good, but the execution might be counterproductive. Therefore, even if their goal is noble, the approach might be wrong. So, they might be in the wrong because their method could be making things worse, despite good intentions.\n"
