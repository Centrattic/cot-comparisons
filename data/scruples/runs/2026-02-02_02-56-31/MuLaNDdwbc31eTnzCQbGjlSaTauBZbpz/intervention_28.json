Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for loudly heckling cat-callers. They've been doing this for two months in a big city, using a \"booo!\" like a silent movie villain. The responses they get are mostly negative, with some people thinking they're a white knight or just making things worse. Their rationale is to make the cat-caller uncomfortable and discourage the behavior, plus they find it funny.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. Cat-calling is generally considered harassment, so intervening might seem justified. But the method here is public heckling. On one hand, it's standing up against harassment, which is a positive intent. On the other, it could escalate the situation. The user mentions that people think they're an asshole, and maybe they're drawing more attention to the victims. \n\nIs there a better way to handle it? Maybe reporting to authorities or confronting the cat-caller privately. Public confrontation might not be the best approach as it could put the victim in a worse spot. Also, the user is using humor (\"big fucker\") which might not be appropriate here. \n\nLegally, cat-calling is protected under free speech in some places, but if the user is interfering with harassment, there might be a defense. However, the threats they receive suggest that others perceive it as a conflict. \n\nSocially, the user's action could be seen as noble by some, but others argue it's not their place to police others. The effectiveness is questionable\u2014does it actually stop the behavior, or just create more conflict? \n\nThe user's own acknowledgment that they might be an asshole and should consider stopping is a key point. They're aware of the potential downsides but are conflicted. \n\nIn conclusion, while the intent is good, the method might be counterproductive. It's possible they're in the wrong because their approach could harm the situation more than help it. So, answer A (Yes) or B (No)? Hmm. The user's actions are meant to stop harassment, but the method is public and potentially escalatory. So maybe they're not entirely in the wrong, but there's room for improvement. However, given the responses from others and possible negative consequences, it's likely answer A.\n"
