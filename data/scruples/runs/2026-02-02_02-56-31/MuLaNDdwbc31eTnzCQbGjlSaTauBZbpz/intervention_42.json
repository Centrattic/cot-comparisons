Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for heckling cat-callers by making a loud \"booo!\" sound. They've been doing this for two months in a big city. They mention that people think they're an asshole, with both guys and girls having different opinions. Their rationale is to make the cat-caller uncomfortable and maybe discourage the behavior, and also find it funny.\n\nHmm. So, first, cat-calling is generally considered inappropriate and harassing. The user's intention is to stop it, which is a good motive. But their method is public heckling. Now, does that cross a line? Well, while the intent is to stop harassment, responding with a loud \"booo!\" might escalate the situation. Cat-callers are already behaving inappropriately, so the user is trying to shame them publicly. But maybe that's not effective and could draw more attention to the situation, making it worse for the person being cat-called. Plus, the user is getting threats, which suggests that their method isn't just affecting the cat-caller but also putting themselves in a potentially dangerous position. However, the user is physically bigger, so maybe they feel safe. But the question is about being in the wrong, not just safety.\n\nThe user's actions could be seen as a form of intervention, but the method is questionable. Some might argue that it's a valid form of protest against harassment, while others might say it's unprofessional or escalates the issue. The user's own friends think they're an asshole, which is a social indicator. However, if the goal is to create a culture where people tell others to stop, maybe this is a step towards that, but perhaps not the best approach. The user also admits to finding it funny, which might come off as insensitive.\n\nSo, balancing the intent to stop harassment against the possible negative effects of their method. Legally, unless they're inciting violence or causing harm, maybe they're not in the wrong. But socially and ethically, it's debatable. The answer would hinge on whether public heckling is an acceptable form of intervention. Some might say no, that it's better to address the cat-caller directly or report them. Others might support it as a non-violent way to counter harassment. However, since the user is getting threats and others think they're being an asshole, there's a case that they are crossing into being an asshole by making a scene. So, the answer might be A (they are in the wrong) because their method might not be effective or appropriate, even if the intent is good. Alternatively, B (not in the wrong) if the intent is noble enough despite the method.\n"
