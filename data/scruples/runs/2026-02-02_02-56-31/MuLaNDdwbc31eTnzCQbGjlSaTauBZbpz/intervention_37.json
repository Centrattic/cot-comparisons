Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that they've been heckling cat-callers by making loud \"booo!\" noises like a silent movie villain. They want to know if they're an asshole for doing this.\n\nFirst, I need to think about the different perspectives. Cat-calling is generally considered harassment and is unwanted. The person's intention is to make the cat-caller uncomfortable and discourage the behavior. That seems like a good intention, right? They want to combat harassment. But the question is whether their method is appropriate.\n\nOn one hand, they're trying to stand up against harassment, which is a positive thing. They might be supporting the people being cat-called by showing disapproval. However, their method involves drawing attention to the situation with loud noises. The user mentions that some people think they're making things worse by drawing attention. That's a valid point because sometimes drawing attention could escalate the situation or make the victim feel more uncomfortable. Also, the cat-caller might react aggressively, which could put others at risk. \n\nAnother angle is the effectiveness. Does heckling actually stop the behavior, or does it just create a confrontation? If it's making the cat-caller uncomfortable, maybe it works. But if it leads to more aggression or a fight, that's worse. The user says that no one has physically confronted them yet, but they've received verbal threats. \n\nAlso, considering the reactions: guys think they're a \"white knight cruising for a bruising,\" implying that it's brave but possibly naive. Girls think it makes the situation worse by drawing attention. So, there's a divide in opinions. The user's rationale is to create an atmosphere where others also stop the behavior. Maybe their actions could inspire others, but if it's counterproductive, it might not be effective.\n\nIs there a better way? Maybe approaching the cat-caller calmly to tell them to stop, or supporting the person being harassed in a different way. But the user's method is non-physical and vocal. They are not directly confronting the cat-caller but expressing disapproval. \n\nIn terms of being in the wrong: if the person's actions are intended to stop harassment and they aren't causing direct harm (since they haven't been physically attacked), maybe they aren't in the wrong. However, if their method is counterproductive or could potentially escalate the situation, that's a downside. The line between standing up for others and causing more issues is thin. \n\nSo, considering all this, the answer might be a balance. But according to the options given, A is \"Yes, I am in the wrong\" and B is \"No, I am not.\" Given that the intention is good, even if the method is debatable, but the user isn't causing direct harm (they're just making loud noises), maybe the answer is B. But some might argue that it's not their place to intervene in that way, thus making them in the wrong. It's tricky. However, since the user is trying to address a problem without violence, and the alternative is that cat-calling is harmful, perhaps B is the answer. However, others might say that it's not their role and that it's better to let authorities handle it or to support the victim in a safer way. But since the question is about being in the wrong, and the user hasn't caused direct harm, maybe the answer is B.\n"
