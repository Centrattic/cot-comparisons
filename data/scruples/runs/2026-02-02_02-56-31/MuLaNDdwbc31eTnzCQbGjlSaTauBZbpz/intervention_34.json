Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for heckling cat-callers. They started doing this in a big city after moving there. Their approach is to \"boo\" the cat-callers like a silent movie villain. They've gotten some angry reactions but no actual harm so far. People around them have mixed opinions: guys think they're a white knight risking trouble, while women think they're making things worse. The user's reasoning is that making the cat-caller uncomfortable might discourage the behavior and create a better atmosphere where others would also tell them to stop. They admit they find it funny, but are questioning if they're an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether their actions are wrong. Cat-calling is a form of harassment, so it's definitely unwanted behavior. The user is trying to address this by publicly shaming the offenders. The main issue here is whether their method is appropriate. \n\nOn one hand, publicly confronting someone can escalate the situation. Even if the user is bigger and hasn't faced physical consequences, there's a risk of violence. Also, when they \"boo\" the cat-callers, this might draw attention to the situation, which could make the victim (the person being cat-called) feel more embarrassed or targeted. The user mentions that women think it's making things worse, which suggests that their method might not be effective or could be counterproductive. \n\nThe user's rationale is that shaming the cat-caller could discourage them from doing it again. However, public shaming can sometimes lead to defensiveness rather than reflection. The cat-caller might double down on their behavior or take out their anger on the user, not realize the inappropriateness. Also, the user's method might not actually help the person being harassed. The victims might feel like they have to deal with both the harassment and the user's reaction, which could add to their distress.\n\nAnother angle is the user's admission that they find it funny. This could imply that their motivation isn't purely altruistic, which might affect the perception of their actions. If they are deriving amusement from the situation, others might see it as a form of aggression or attention-seeking rather than a genuine attempt to help.\n\nOn the other hand, the user is trying to address a problem. Cat-calling is a real issue, and some people do feel empowered by publicly standing up against it. The user's approach might encourage others to speak out, as they suggest. However, the effectiveness of this method is questionable. There might be better ways to address the issue, like reporting harassment to authorities or supporting policies that discourage such behavior.\n\nThe key points are: the potential for escalation, the possible negative impact on the victim, the mixed public perception, and the question of whether the method is effective. The user's actions, while aimed at stopping harassment, might not be the most constructive approach. It could make the situation more uncomfortable for everyone involved. The fact that women feel it's making things worse is a strong indicator that the approach is not helpful. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the user is trying to do the right thing by opposing harassment, but their method could be problematic. The line between standing up against harassment and creating a hostile environment oneself is thin. The user's actions might be seen as aggressive or confrontational, which could lead to more harm than good. Therefore, even if their intention is good, the execution might be wrong because it's not effective and could harm the victim further.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the answer would lean towards A (Yes, they are in the wrong) because their method of intervention might be counterproductive and could potentially worsen the situation for those being harassed."
