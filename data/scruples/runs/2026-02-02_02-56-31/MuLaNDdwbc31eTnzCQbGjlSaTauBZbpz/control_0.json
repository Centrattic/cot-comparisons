Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for heckling cat-callers. They started doing this two months ago in a big city. Their approach is to loudly \"booo!\" at the cat-callers, like a silent movie villain. They mention that this gets them cussed at and threats, but they haven't been physically attacked yet.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Cat-calling is a form of harassment, which is clearly wrong. The author is trying to confront this by making the cat-callers uncomfortable. Their reasoning is that if they make it unpleasant for the perpetrators, it might reduce the behavior and encourage others to stop. However, they also acknowledge that people, both men and women, have mixed reactions. Men think the author is overstepping, risking conflict, and women think it's drawing more attention, potentially making the situation worse.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, from a moral standpoint, addressing harassment is generally seen as positive. But the method here is public confrontation, which can have unintended consequences. By loudly heckling, the author might escalate tensions, leading to more hostility. The threats received suggest that the cat-callers are not receptive to this approach, and the author is putting themselves in a situation where physical conflict could occur. Also, women's concern about drawing attention might be valid because it could make the victim feel more targeted. \n\nThe author's intention is to discourage the behavior, but the effectiveness of their method is questionable. While the intent is good, the approach might not be the most effective or safe. It's possible that a different method, like educating others or supporting victims in a non-confrontational way, could be better. However, the act itself is not inherently wrong. The author is trying to address a problem, even if the method isn't perfect. \n\nIn terms of legal or ethical wrongs, unless the heckling involves threats or illegal behavior, it's within their rights to express disapproval. So ethically, are they \"in the wrong\"? It's a gray area. They're trying to do good but using a method that some might see as provocative. The answer depends on whether the method justifies the intention. Since the question is about being an asshole (AITA), the community might weigh in on whether the approach is counterproductive. \n\nConsidering all this, I think the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because their method could be making the situation worse, even if their intention is good. Alternatively, if the action is seen as a valid form of protest, then B (No). But given that the author is causing escalation and possibly drawing more attention, leading to threats, the consensus might lean towards A.\n"
