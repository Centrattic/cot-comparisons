Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for heckling cat-callers. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is in a big city and has started loudly responding to cat-calling by making a \"*booo!*\" sound, like a silent movie villain. They've faced some cussing and threats but haven't been physically attacked. The people around think they're an asshole. The author's reasoning is that making the cat-callers uncomfortable might discourage the behavior and create an atmosphere where others tell the cat-callers to stop. They also admit they find it funny but are unsure if they're being an asshole.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. So, I need to evaluate from different angles: legality, ethics, social norms, and effectiveness.\n\nLegally, cat-calling is a form of harassment, but the author's response is verbal heckling. In public spaces, people have the right to express disapproval, so it's probably legal. But is it ethical?\n\nEthically, the author is trying to stop harassment, which is a good intention. However, their method might be counterproductive. Cat-calling is degrading and disrespectful, but responding with loud heckling could escalate the situation. The author mentions that both men and women think they're being an asshole. Women's concern is that it draws attention, potentially making the situation worse. If the cat-caller becomes hostile, it might put the victims in more danger. \n\nAlso, the author admits to hypocrisy. They say they dislike cat-calling but might be contributing to a hostile environment. The method of using a \"*booo*\" is infantile, and the author's own admission of finding it funny suggests it's more for their amusement than serious intervention. \n\nEffectiveness-wise, does this method actually stop the behavior? If the cat-caller is shouted down, maybe they'll stop, but if they respond with threats, it could lead to more conflict. The author's size might prevent physical confrontation, but others might not be as protected. \n\nSocial norms: Public heckling is generally seen as confrontational. In many contexts, this could be seen as aggressive. While the intention is good, the approach might not be the best. The author's method could be perceived as mocking the cat-caller, which might not address the root issue of harassment but instead create a spectacle.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author's intentions are positive, but the method might be inappropriate. The key point is whether the means justify the ends. If the author's actions are causing more harm (escalating tensions, drawing unwanted attention) than good (discouraging harassment), then they might be in the wrong. However, if their approach is seen as a valid form of protest, then not.\n\nBut since the author is using a confrontational and possibly escalatory method in a public space where it's not illegal, but it's causing conflict with others, it's a grey area. However, the consensus in the AITA scenario is that most people think the author is an asshole. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the author's actions are causing discomfort and potential escalation, and there's a better way to address harassment (like reporting, raising awareness through other means), the answer might be A (Yes, in the wrong). The method is not effective and could be harmful, even if the intent is good.\n"
