  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for loudly heckling cat-callers?\nThis is something I've been in the habit of doing for like two months now, ever since moving to a big city. Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for heckling cat-callers. They've been doing this for two months in a big city. Their main argument is that they want to discourage catcalling by making it uncomfortable for the offenders. They get some negative reactions but haven't faced physical consequences yet. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. Catcalling is generally seen as a form of harassment, so the user's intent is to stop something that's harmful. But their method is to publicly shame the catcallers by \"booo\"ing them. The user mentions that some people think they're a \"white knight\" and others think they're making the situation worse by drawing attention.\n\nThe key points here are intent versus outcome. The user's intent is good\u2014they want to reduce harassment. However, the outcome might not be as intended. If their heckling leads to more confrontation, maybe it's not effective and could escalate situations. But on the other hand, if it actually deters the behavior, it's helpful.\n\nAnother angle is the user's method. Public shaming can be a double-edged sword. While it might discourage the person from catcalling again, it could also provoke them, leading to more aggressive behavior. Also, the user is putting themselves in a position where they might face threats or violence, even though they say they haven't been harmed yet.\n\nThe user is also big and might feel physically safe, but others might not be in the same situation. So, is it responsible to encourage others to do the same? Maybe not, since it's a risky approach. However, the user isn't advising others; they're just doing what they think is right.\n\nAlso, the user acknowledges that people think they're an asshole. That's a sign that their actions might be perceived negatively, even if their intentions are good. The question is whether the ends justify the means. \n\nIn terms of societal norms, collective action against harassment is usually supported, but individual confrontation can be tricky. Maybe a better approach would be to support systemic changes or report the behavior to authorities. But the user is acting in the moment, which might not be the most effective strategy.\n\nSo, considering all this, the user's intent is positive, but the method might not be the best. They might be causing more harm than good by escalating situations. Therefore, they could be in the wrong if their actions lead to negative outcomes, even if unintended.\n"
