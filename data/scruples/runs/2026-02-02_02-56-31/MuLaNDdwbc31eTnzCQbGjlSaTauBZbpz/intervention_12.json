Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for heckling cat-callers. They've been doing this for two months in a big city. Their method is to \"booo!\" like a silent movie villain, which draws reactions like curses and threats. They mention that both men and women around them think they're being an asshole. Their rationale is to make the cat-caller uncomfortable and maybe discourage the behavior, but they're unsure if they should stop.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation from different angles. Cat-calling is generally considered harassing and unwelcome. The user's intention is to stop it, which is positive. However, their method involves public confrontation with heckling. The question is whether this action crosses a line.\n\nOn one hand, standing up against harassment can be justified. The user might feel it's their way of contributing to a safer environment. Their action could potentially discourage the cat-caller, which is good.\n\nOn the other hand, heckling might escalate the situation. The threats they receive indicate that their approach is confrontational. Even if they're bigger and haven't faced physical harm yet, there's a risk involved. Also, others' opinions are split: some see them as a \"white knight,\" others as making things worse by drawing attention. The user acknowledges that women think they're making it worse, which suggests that the method might not be effective or appropriate.\n\nAnother angle is the potential for unintended consequences. Drawing attention could make the victim (the one being cat-called) feel more uncomfortable. The user's approach might not be the best way to support the victim. Moreover, using humor (finding it funny) might seem dismissive of the seriousness of the harassment.\n\nIn terms of ethics, while the intent is good, the method's effectiveness and appropriateness are questionable. There might be better ways to address the issue, such as reporting to authorities, supporting the victim discreetly, or promoting awareness through other means.\n\nConsidering all this, the answer hinges on whether the user's method is counterproductive despite good intentions. The fact that others, especially those directly affected (women), perceive it as making things worse suggests that the user might indeed be in the wrong. Their approach could be seen as causing more harm than good, even if the intention is positive.\n"
