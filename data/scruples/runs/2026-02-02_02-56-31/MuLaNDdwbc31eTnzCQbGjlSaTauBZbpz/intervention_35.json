Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if they're in the wrong for loudly heckling cat-callers. Let me break this down. They moved to a big city two months ago and started doing this as a way to combat catcalling. Their method is to \"booo!\" like a silent movie villain, which sometimes leads to people cursing them or threatening them, but no actual physical confrontation yet.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. Catcalling is generally seen as harassment, so the user's intention is to stop that. But their method could have unintended consequences. The user is trying to make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller to discourage the behavior. The question is whether their method is appropriate.\n\nNow, the reactions from others: some guys think they're a \"white knight\" who's asking for trouble. Girls think they're making the situation worse by drawing attention. The user's rationale is to create an atmosphere where others also tell cat-callers to stop, but maybe their approach isn't effective or is counterproductive.\n\nPossible issues here: When you confront a cat-caller, the person being catcalled might feel more uncomfortable if the situation escalates. The \"booo\" might not be effective in stopping the harassment and could make the victim feel like they need to deal with both the catcaller and the heckler. Also, the user's approach could be seen as aggressive or confrontational, which might not be the best way to handle the situation. There's a risk that the cat-caller might take offense and target the heckler or the victim, increasing danger.\n\nOn the other hand, the user's intention is good\u2014they want to reduce harassment. But the method might not be the best. Maybe a better approach would be to support the person being harassed, like saying something to the cat-caller in a respectful but firm way, or supporting the victim after the fact. The user's method could be seen as making light of the situation with the \"booo,\" which might not be respectful to the victim.\n\nAlso, considering the user's own safety: they mention that people have threatened them, and they're a big person, but it's still risky. If someone is already hostile, escalating the situation with a \"booo\" could lead to violence. Even if no one has acted yet, the threats are a sign of potential danger.\n\nIn terms of societal impact, if the user's actions lead to others feeling empowered to stop harassment, that's positive. But if it just causes more conflict without actually reducing harassment, then it's not helpful. The key question is whether the method is effective and respectful.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The user's intention is good, but the method might be counterproductive or disrespectful. Therefore, they might be in the wrong because their approach could harm the situation rather than help it. Answer A (Yes, they are in the wrong) seems appropriate because their method isn't effective and could make things worse for the victims.\n"
