Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the person is in the wrong for heckling cat-callers. The user is asking if they're the asshole (AITA) for loudly reacting to cat-calling with \"*booo!*\" like a silent movie villain. They mention people have cursed them and threatened them, but they haven't faced actual physical consequences. Their reasoning is that making the cat-caller uncomfortable might discourage the behavior, but others think they're making things worse or being hypocritical.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. Cat-calling is generally seen as harassment, so intervening might seem justified. But the method here is public and confrontational. The user is using mockery to shame the cat-caller. On one hand, they're standing up against harassment, which is positive. On the other hand, their approach might escalate the situation. If the heckling draws more attention, it could potentially make the target of the cat-calling (usually women) feel more uncomfortable. Also, if it leads to a confrontation, there's a risk of violence, which the user is aware of but dismissive of due to their own size.\n\nAnother angle is whether this action is effective. The user believes it might deter others from cat-calling by making it uncomfortable for the offenders. However, if it's causing threats or escalating the situation, maybe it's counterproductive. Also, some people might think that addressing the issue should be left to the person being harassed or to authorities, not bystanders using public shaming.\n\nSocial norms also matter. In some contexts, public shaming is seen as a form of social justice, but there's a line between holding someone accountable and becoming a bully yourself. The user's approach might be seen as aggressive, even if their intent is good. The fact that both men and women have criticized them suggests that the method is controversial.\n\nThen there's the personal enjoyment factor. The user admits they find it funny, which might indicate that their motivation isn't purely altruistic. This could be seen as using the harassment of others as entertainment, which is problematic.\n\nBut then again, the alternative is doing nothing while someone else is harassed. The user is clearly bothered by cat-calling and wants to take a stand. The question is whether their method is appropriate.\n\nIn conclusion, while the intent to stop harassment is commendable, the method might be crossing a line. Public heckling could make situations more volatile and might not be the most effective way to address the issue. It's possible that the user is in the wrong because their approach could inadvertently harm the situation, even if their intentions are good. So, leaning towards answer A (Yes, they're in the wrong).\n"
