Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for loudly heckling cat-callers. They started doing this in a big city after moving there two months ago. Their approach is to \"booo!\" the cat-caller like a villain in a silent movie. They mention that this leads to some cussing and threats but no actual physical confrontations. Both men and women have different opinions on their actions. The user's rationale is to make the cat-caller uncomfortable and discourage the behavior, plus they find it funny.\n\nSo, the question is whether they're in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. Cat-calling is generally considered inappropriate and can make people feel harassed. The user's intention is to stop it, which is a good cause. But their method is public heckling. Is this a valid form of intervention?\n\nOn one hand, intervening can be seen as standing up against harassment, which is commendable. It might empower others to do the same and could deter the cat-caller. On the other hand, it could escalate the situation. The user mentions that their actions lead to cussing and threats, which might make the situation more confrontational. Some might argue that it's not their place to intervene, especially if it could lead to conflict or if the victims don't appreciate the attention. \n\nAlso, the user is using a humorous approach by comparing it to a silent movie villain. While they find it funny, others might see it as not taking the issue seriously. The women's perspective is important here\u2014they think it's making things worse by drawing attention. Maybe the cat-caller might target the victim more if someone else steps in. \n\nAnother angle: public heckling might be seen as a form of free speech and a peaceful protest. However, if it's leading to threats or hostility, it could be seen as inciting conflict. The user is physically large, so they might feel safe, but others might not be in that position. \n\nLegally, unless the heckling is threatening or abusive, it's probably protected speech. But socially, it's a gray area. The user is trying to create a culture where people call out cat-calling, which is a positive goal. But the method's effectiveness and appropriateness are debatable. \n\nConsidering both sides, the user's intention is good, but the method might have unintended consequences. While they are trying to do the right thing, the approach could potentially backfire. Therefore, there's a case for saying they're not entirely in the wrong (B), but there are valid concerns that suggest they might be (A). However, given that cat-calling is the real issue, and their action is a direct response to it, the answer might lean towards B. But if their method is causing more harm, then A. It's a bit tricky. Maybe the answer is B but with a note that the approach could be improved.\n"
