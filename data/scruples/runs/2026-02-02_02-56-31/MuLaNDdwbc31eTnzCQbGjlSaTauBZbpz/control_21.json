Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who loudly heckles cat-callers is in the wrong. The author's action is to confront cat-calling by making a loud \"booo!\" sound, which is meant to mock or shame the offenders. They've been doing this for two months in a big city and face some backlash but claim it's to discourage the behavior.\n\nFirst, consider the context. Cat-calling is generally considered unacceptable and harassing. The author is trying to address this by publicly confronting the cat-callers. But they're doing it in a way that's disruptive\u2014making noise, which could be seen as aggressive. The author mentions that others think they're an asshole, with both men and women having different opinions. \n\nNow, legal perspective: In many places, cat-calling is a form of harassment, and intervening can be protected under anti-harassment laws. However, the method of intervention matters. If the heckling is done in a way that's not threatening or aggressive, it's usually protected speech. The author isn't using physical violence but verbal disruption. \n\nEthically, the debate is about whether the author's actions are justified. Some might argue that publicly shaming the cat-callers could deter the behavior, which aligns with the author's intent. Others might say that it draws more attention to the situation, making the victim uncomfortable. The author acknowledges this as a possible downside. \n\nThe author's justification is that they're trying to create an environment where others also call out bad behavior. However, if their method leads to confrontations where others might feel unsafe, that's a concern. The fact that some people think the author is a \"white knight\" (someone who thinks they're doing good but actually causes problems) suggests that their approach might be seen as overstepping.\n\nAlso, the author mentions they find it funny. That part could be problematic because it might trivialize the harassment. The victims might not appreciate the heckling, as it could escalate the situation or make the harassment more public. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author is trying to do good but might be causing unintended harm. The key point is whether their actions are effective and respectful. Public shaming can sometimes backfire, and the threats the author receives indicate that some see their actions as aggressive. \n\nSo, balancing the intent to stop harassment against the potential for causing more harm. It's a grey area. If the method is non-violent and doesn't involve threats, it's hard to say the author is entirely wrong. However, the approach might not be the most effective or considerate. There's a chance that the author is overstepping their role, hence the question of whether they're the asshole (AITA).\n"
