Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for heckling cat-callers. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author moved to a big city and started loudly \"booooing\" cat-callers, similar to a silent movie villain. He's facing backlash from both sides: guys think he's a white knight, women think he's making it worse. He justifies it by wanting to make the cat-callers uncomfortable and discourage the behavior. He's also a big guy, so he's not afraid of threats, but he's questioning if he's an asshole.\n\nNow, the key here is to determine if his actions are wrong. Cat-calling is generally considered inappropriate and harassing. The author is trying to combat it, which seems positive. But his method is public shaming by loudly heckling. \n\nPublic shaming can be controversial. While the intent is good, the method might have unintended consequences. If he's drawing attention to the situation, maybe he's escalating it. The women's perspective is that it's making things worse. If the cat-caller is being publicly humiliated, they might become more hostile, which could make the environment more uncomfortable for others. Also, using a confrontational approach might not be the best way to deter behavior in the long run.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is trying to address a harmful behavior. He's not escalating to physical violence or using threats beyond heckling. The key question is whether his method is appropriate. Some might argue that it's a form of peaceful protest and that he's using his voice to stand against harassment. Others might say it's counterproductive because it could lead to more conflict.\n\nThe author also admits he finds it funny, which might suggest he's not as serious about the issue as he thinks. But that's part of his rationale. The responses from people around him are split, but mostly negative. However, the fact that the cat-callers are threatening him but not following through might indicate that his approach does have some deterrent effect.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a gray area. Legally, unless he's inciting violence or causing direct harm, it's probably not illegal. Ethically, it's about whether the method is effective and respectful. Public shaming can be seen as aggressive, but compared to the harassment itself, maybe it's a justified reaction. \n\nThe author is trying to create a culture where other men call out the cat-calling. If his actions encourage others to do the same, that could be positive. But if it's leading to a more hostile environment, that's bad. Since the women in the scenario don't support it, maybe he's not achieving his goal. \n\nSo, considering all angles, the author's intentions are good, but the method is questionable. He might be in the wrong because his approach could be making things worse, even if his intent is to stop the harassment. The answer might be A (yes, he's in the wrong) because his method isn't effective and could be harmful. However, others might argue it's a valid form of protest. The final answer depends on whether the means justify the ends in this context.\n"
