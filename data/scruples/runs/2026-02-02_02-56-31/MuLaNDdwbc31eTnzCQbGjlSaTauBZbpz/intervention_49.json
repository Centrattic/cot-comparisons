Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for heckling cat-callers. They started doing this because they find cat-calling annoying. Their approach is to make a loud \"booo!\" to mock the cat-caller, which sometimes leads to aggressive responses from the cat-callers. Other people's opinions are mixed: some think they're a white knight, others think they're making things worse. Their reasoning is that making the cat-caller uncomfortable might discourage the behavior.\n\nHmm. So, the first thing to consider is whether their actions are justified. Cat-calling is generally considered harassment, so intervening is usually seen as positive. But the method here is public shaming or mocking. Is that acceptable? Well, some might argue that it's a form of standing up against harassment, which is good. Others might say that it escalates the situation or draws attention, making it worse for the victim.\n\nThe user mentions that some people think they're drawing attention and making it worse. That's a valid concern. If the heckling causes the situation to become more confrontational, maybe it's not helping. Also, the user is getting threats, which implies that their approach is provocative. But they also say they're a big person and no one has acted on the threats. Still, maybe there's a risk involved.\n\nAnother angle is the effectiveness. Does publicly shaming the cat-caller actually stop the behavior? It might work sometimes, but maybe not always. There's also the question of whether the user's method is appropriate. Using mockery instead of confronting the person directly or reporting them. But in a public setting, maybe direct confrontation isn't safe or feasible.\n\nThe user also admits to finding it funny, which might suggest they're not entirely serious about the issue. That could come across as insincere or trivializing a serious problem. However, their main goal is to discourage the behavior, which is a positive intent.\n\nIn terms of being in the wrong, if someone is trying to stop harassment, even if their method is questionable, it's hard to say they're entirely wrong. But if their method causes more harm (like making the victim uncomfortable or escalating the situation), then maybe they are in the wrong. It's a balance between the intent and the impact.\n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the method is effective and respectful. Public shaming can be seen as a form of mob justice, which might not be the best approach. The user might be overstepping by inserting themselves into someone else's harassment, even if their intent is good. So, maybe they are in the wrong because their approach could be counterproductive or make things worse for the victim. But others might argue that any action against harassment is positive. It's a tricky call. I'm leaning towards them being in the wrong (A) because their method could be seen as escalating the situation instead of de-escalating it.\n"
