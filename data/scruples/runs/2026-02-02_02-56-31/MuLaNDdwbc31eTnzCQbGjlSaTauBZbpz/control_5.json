Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that they're heckling catcallers by making loud \"booo!\" sounds, similar to a villain in a silent movie. They've been doing this for two months in a big city. Their rationale is to make the cat-callers uncomfortable to discourage the behavior and maybe create an atmosphere where others stop it too. However, people around them, both men and women, think they're an asshole. Men think they're risking a beating, women think they're making things worse by drawing attention. The author is conflicted because they enjoy it a bit but wonder if they're wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics of their actions. Catcalling is generally considered harassment and is inappropriate. The author is trying to address this by publicly shaming the catcallers. Public shaming can be a form of social pressure, but it's a controversial method. Some might argue that it's a valid way to hold people accountable, while others might say it's overstepping and could escalate the situation.\n\nThe author mentions that their actions lead to the catcallers getting angry and sometimes threatening them. Even though no physical confrontation has happened, the threats are a red flag. If someone feels their safety is at risk, that's a serious issue. The author is a \"fairly big guy,\" so maybe they feel physically safe, but verbal threats shouldn't be ignored.\n\nWomen's perspective is that the author's intervention draws attention to the situation, making it worse. This is a crucial point. If the author's heckling causes the catcaller to become more agitated or shifts the focus away from the victim, it could indeed be counterproductive. The victim might feel more uncomfortable or in danger if the situation escalates because of the heckler's actions. \n\nAlso, the author is doing this for a sense of humor. If they're enjoying the confrontation, that might be seen as using the situation for personal satisfaction rather than genuine concern for the victim. This could come across as insensitive or self-centered.\n\nOn the other hand, the intention to stop harassment is commendable. The author is trying to use social pressure to discourage bad behavior. But the method might not be effective or appropriate. Direct confrontation can sometimes lead to unintended consequences, like the catcaller becoming more aggressive or the victim feeling embarrassed if the heckler's actions are perceived as disruptive.\n\nAnother angle is the potential for creating a culture where people support each other. If the author's actions can inspire others to speak up, that's positive. However, if it's just the author acting alone, it might not create the desired cultural shift and instead lead to isolated conflicts.\n\nLegally, unless the author is instigating violence, they might not be breaking laws, but socially, they're in a gray area. The question is about morality and societal norms rather than legality. The key issue is whether their actions help or hinder the situation. If they're causing more harm by escalating tensions, they might be in the wrong.\n\nIn summary, while the intent to stop harassment is good, the method of loud public heckling could be counterproductive, potentially endangering others and not effectively addressing the root issue. The author might not be in the wrong legally but could be morally at fault due to the negative consequences and the women's perspective that it makes things worse. Therefore, the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong.\n"
