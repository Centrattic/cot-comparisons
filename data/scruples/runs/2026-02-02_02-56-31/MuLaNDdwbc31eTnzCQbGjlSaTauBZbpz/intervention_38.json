Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for heckling cat-callers by making loud \"booo!\" sounds. They mention that they started doing this because they find cat-calling annoying and want to discourage it by making the experience uncomfortable for the perpetrators. The responses from others are mixed: some guys think they're a \"white knight\" who's asking for trouble, and girls think it draws more attention and makes things worse. The user is conflicted because they want to be the change but are getting pushback.\n\nSo, the question is whether their actions are justified or not. The possible answers are A (wrong) or B (not wrong). \n\nFirst, I need to consider the intent. The user's intention is to stop cat-calling by making it uncomfortable for the harassers. That's a valid goal since cat-calling is a form of harassment and should be discouraged. However, the method they use is public heckling. The key points here are whether their actions are effective and if they might inadvertently make the situation worse.\n\nOn one hand, intervening in public to stop harassment can be seen as a positive action. It might discourage the harasser and support the victim. On the other hand, publicly humiliating the harasser could lead to escalation, as the user has experienced with threats of violence. Also, some might argue that the victim is drawing more attention to themselves, which could be risky. However, the user is a large person, so maybe they can handle the confrontation.\n\nAnother angle: bystander intervention. There are recommended ways to intervene safely, like using a firm \"no\" or involving authorities. The user's method is more confrontational, which might not be the safest approach. But if the user is comfortable and has not faced actual harm yet, maybe it's a personal choice.\n\nHowever, the user's actions could also be perceived as aggressive, leading to conflict. The fact that others (especially women) think it's making things worse suggests that their method isn't effective and might distract from the victim's experience. Also, the humor aspect might trivialize the serious issue of harassment.\n\nIn terms of right vs. wrong, the intent is good, but the method might be problematic. The user might be in the wrong not because their intention is bad, but because their approach could be counterproductive or risky. So, the answer might be A (wrong) because while the goal is right, the method could be harming the situation.\n"
