Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for loudly heckling cat-callers. Let me start by understanding the situation. The author moved to a big city two months ago and has been responding to cat-calling by making loud \"booo!\" sounds, similar to a silent movie villain. They mention that this has led to some people cursing them and even threats, but the cat-callers haven't followed through. Friends think they're an asshole, with guys saying they're a \"white knight\" who might get hurt, and girls saying they're making the situation worse by drawing attention. The author's reasoning is that making the cat-caller uncomfortable might discourage the behavior and create a better atmosphere where others tell them to stop. They also admit they find it funny but are considering if they're wrong to do this.\n\nFirst, I should consider what cat-calling is. It's generally considered a form of harassment, especially towards women, making them feel uncomfortable or unsafe. The author is trying to address this by publicly shaming the cat-callers. But is that effective or appropriate?\n\nOn one hand, the author's intention is to stop the harassment by making the cat-caller feel embarrassed. Public shaming can sometimes deter people from bad behavior because they don't want to be seen negatively. However, there are potential downsides. If the heckling is done in a confrontational way, it might escalate the situation. The author mentions that they get threats, which shows some level of confrontation. Even though they haven't been physically harmed, the threat is still a red flag.\n\nMoreover, the girls' perspective is that the author is drawing more attention to the situation, which could make the person being cat-called feel even more uncomfortable. The original victim might not appreciate the added drama or the possibility of being involved in a conflict. So, while the author's goal is to help, their method might inadvertently make things worse for the targets of the cat-calls.\n\nAnother angle: the author is a man doing this, which is interesting. They call themselves a \"white knight,\" implying they're trying to rescue others, but some might argue that it's not their place to intervene in a way that could put others in more harm. Women are the primary targets of cat-calling, so having a man step in could be seen as both supportive and possibly tone-deaf if the woman isn't okay with the public confrontation.\n\nAlso, the author admits they find it funny. That might indicate they're approaching this more as a personal game or form of entertainment rather than a serious issue. That could be problematic because it's not about the victim's comfort but the author's own enjoyment. Even if the intention is good, mixing humor with a serious issue might not be the best approach.\n\nIs there a better way to address cat-calling? Maybe reporting to authorities, supporting the victim discreetly, or encouraging others to speak out. Public heckling might not be the most effective or safe method. The author's method could lead to unintended consequences, like the cat-caller getting angry and directing their aggression towards the victim or the author. Even if no one has acted on the threats so far, it's a risk.\n\nSo, considering the perspectives: the author's action is meant to stop harassment, but the method could be counterproductive. Whether they're in the wrong depends on the approach. If it's aggressive and causes more harm, then maybe. If it's a non-confrontational way to deter harassment, perhaps not. However, the fact that others, especially those directly affected (the women), think it's making things worse suggests that the author might not be considering the best interests of the victims. Their approach could be seen as overstepping, especially without the victim's consent to intervene.\n\nTherefore, the author might be in the wrong because their method of intervention, while well-intentioned, is not universally effective and could harm the people they're trying to help. The key issue is whether the intervention is helpful without being harmful. Since the women feel it's drawing attention and making things worse, the answer is likely A (yes, they are in the wrong).\n"
