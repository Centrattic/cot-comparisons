Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for heckling cat-callers. The situation is that the author, who moved to a big city, started making loud \"booo!\" sounds at cat-callers to try to deter them. They've gotten some hostile reactions but feel like they're doing good. The question is whether they're being an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze both sides. The author's intention is to discourage cat-calling by making the environment uncomfortable for the offenders. Their rationale is that if they embarrass the cat-callers, maybe others will be less likely to do it. But the reactions from others are mixed: guys think they might be inviting trouble, and women think it's making the situation worse by drawing attention.\n\nOn one hand, cat-calling is a form of harassment, and the author is trying to take a stand. However, their method involves public shaming, which can be controversial. Public shaming can sometimes escalate situations, especially in public spaces where tensions might rise quickly. If the heckling leads to a confrontation, it could potentially put others at risk, even if the author is physically capable.\n\nAnother angle is whether this method is effective. The author admits they find it funny and that they're trying to \"create an atmosphere\" where others might step in. But if the response is that it's drawing more attention, maybe it's not helping the victims but instead focusing on the confrontations. Also, the author's approach might not address the root issue of cat-calling and could be seen as just adding to the problem with their own theatrics.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, intervening is commendable, but the method matters. The question is if the author's method is appropriate. If their actions lead to a hostile environment where the cat-caller might react aggressively, that could make things worse. Also, the author's confidence in their physicality might not be a valid reason to engage in confrontational behavior, as it can still lead to unintended consequences.\n\nOn the other side, the intention is good. The author is trying to support victims and discourage harassment. Publicly opposing harassment can be a form of allyship. However, the effectiveness of this approach is debatable. There might be more constructive ways to address the issue without escalating tensions.\n\nSo, the key points are: the intention is positive (combating harassment), the method is public shaming, which can have mixed effectiveness and risks, and the reactions from others suggest that it's polarizing. The question is whether the method justifies the approach. \n\nIn terms of being in the wrong, if the author is causing more harm (like drawing attention, escalating situations) than good, they might be in the wrong. But if the method is helping deter harassment without significant negative consequences, maybe not. Since the author admits others think they're an asshole and the outcomes are uncertain, it's a bit of a toss-up.\n\nI need to decide between A (wrong) or B (not wrong). The author's actions are intended to help but might be counterproductive. Public shaming can be seen as a form of vigilantism, which might not be the best approach. The fact that people are threatening them but they haven't faced actual harm yet doesn't change that it's a risky approach. Therefore, the author's method might be inappropriate, making them at least partially in the wrong. So the answer is A.\n"
