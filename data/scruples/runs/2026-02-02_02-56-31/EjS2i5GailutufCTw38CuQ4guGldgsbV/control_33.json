It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not turning down a girl at their ex's wedding. The situation is a bit complicated.\n\nFirst, the author is close friends with the groom and his family, so attending the wedding as a guest makes sense. The bride had directly told him not to hit on any women at the wedding. The author claims he wasn't trying to pick up anyone, just enjoying the party. Then, a bridesmaid invited him to her hotel room, and he agreed. Now the bride is upset, and he's arguing that he didn't break his promise because she approached him, not the other way around.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the bride's explicit request, the author's actions, and whether his actions violated that request. The author says he didn't hit on anyone, but he accepted an invitation to a hotel room from a bridesmaid. Even though the woman initiated the invitation, being in that situation at the wedding could still be seen as crossing a line. The bride might feel that allowing such a scenario disrupts the event's atmosphere or invades her space as the newlywed. Also, the fact that it's an ex's wedding adds another layer, as the author might have a history with the family, making the social norms more sensitive.\n\nThe author's defense is that he didn't actively pursue anyone, but accepting the invitation could still be perceived as taking advantage of the situation. The bride's directive was clear, and the author might be in the wrong for not respecting that boundary, even if he didn't initiate the interaction. Social expectations at weddings often involve maintaining a respectful distance, especially regarding the bride's family and friends. The author's actions could be seen as disregarding the bride's feelings and the event's decorum. So, even if he didn't break the promise explicitly, the circumstances might still place him in the wrong.\n"
