It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if they're in the wrong for not turning down a girl at their ex's wedding. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the user went to their ex's wedding, which is already a sensitive situation. The bride had told him beforehand not to hit on anyone, which he agreed to. But then, at the end of the reception, a bridesmaid invited him to her hotel room, and he went along. Now the bride is upset. The user's defense is that he didn't initiate the interaction\u2014she asked him. Also, he claims he wasn't trying to hit on anyone but just enjoying the party.\n\nHmm. The key points here are the prior agreement with the bride and the social norms around ex's weddings. Even though the user didn't approach the bridesmaid, accepting her invitation might still be seen as crossing a line. The bride specifically asked him not to hit on anyone, and by going to her hotel room, he's engaging in a private setting with another woman at the event. Even if it's not exactly what the bride forbade, it's probably close enough to be offensive. \n\nSocially, there's an unspoken rule about respecting boundaries at such events, especially when there's an ex involved. The fact that he's at the groom's wedding adds another layer, as it's a family event, and his actions might have made others uncomfortable. The user might not think he broke the rule literally, but the spirit of the rule was to prevent him from making the bride uncomfortable. By accepting the invitation, he might have done just that. \n\nBut then again, if the bridesmaid approached him and he didn't push, is it his fault? Maybe. It's a bit of a gray area. The bride could be overreacting, but her feelings are valid. The user might not have intended to hurt her, but his actions had consequences. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the answer might hinge on whether he respected the implied boundaries. Even if he didn't actively hit on someone, the private interaction could be seen as inappropriate. So, the answer might lean towards A, he's in the wrong, because he didn't honor the bride's wishes in spirit, even if he followed the letter.\n"
