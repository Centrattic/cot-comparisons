It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves an ex getting married, and the writer attending the wedding. The bride had explicitly told him not to hit on anyone, which he agreed to. But then a bridesmaid invited him to her hotel room, and he accepted.\n\nFirst, the key points here are consent and boundaries. The bride set a boundary beforehand, so he should have respected that. Even if she didn't actively \"hit on\" him, he went to her hotel room, which could be seen as crossing the line. The bride might feel violated because her request wasn't honored, and the writer didn't consider her feelings. Also, the fact that he was at his ex's wedding adds another layer\u2014maybe the bride felt it was inappropriate for him to be there in the first place, but he was allowed because of the groom's family. \n\nHe argues he didn't break the promise because she initiated it. But by accepting the invitation, he still participated in the interaction. The line between socializing and inappropriate behavior can be blurry, but in this context, respecting the bride's wishes is crucial. The writer's judgment call here might have been poor, even if he didn't explicitly \"hit on\" someone. The bride's anger is justified if she felt her boundaries were disrespected. So, I think the answer is A\u2014he's in the wrong.\n"
