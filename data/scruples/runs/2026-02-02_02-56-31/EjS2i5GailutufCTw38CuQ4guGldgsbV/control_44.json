It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not turning down a girl at their ex's wedding. The situation involves a wedding where the author is close to the groom but is now in a new relationship.\n\nFirst, the bride told the author not to hit on any women at her wedding. The author claims they didn't actively solicit attention but were approached by a bridesmaid. The key points here are consent and boundaries. The author was warned not to hit on others, but the situation arose where they were invited to a hotel room by a bridesmaid. The author argues that the bridesmaid initiated the interaction, so they didn't break their promise. However, the bride is upset regardless.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. From an ethical standpoint, respecting the bride's wishes is important. Even if the author didn't initiate the contact, being in a situation that could be seen as violating the agreed-upon boundaries might still be problematic. The bride's discomfort stems from the fact that the author is attending a wedding with their ex, and such behavior could be perceived as inappropriate, regardless of who initiated it. \n\nAdditionally, the author's defense that they were \"just having a good time\" might not account for the sensitivity of the event. Weddings can be emotionally charged, especially ex-partner weddings. The author's actions, even if not directly against the rule, could be seen as disrespectful to the bride's feelings and the wedding's context. \n\nOn the other hand, if the author genuinely didn't solicit attention and was approached, it's a bit more nuanced. However, the bride's anger suggests that the situation is still an issue. The author might not have explicitly broken a rule, but their actions could still be seen as crossing a boundary by engaging in a potentially intimate scenario at the wedding. \n\nSo, considering the context and the bride's perspective, the author might be in the wrong for not considering the implications of their actions, even if they were invited. The answer would be A (Yes).\n"
