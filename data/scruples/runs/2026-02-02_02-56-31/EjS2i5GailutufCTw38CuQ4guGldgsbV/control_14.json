It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author went to their ex's wedding. The bride had told them not to hit on any women there. The author went to the wedding, had a good time, and ended up going to a hotel room with a bridesmaid. Now the bride is upset.\n\nFirst, the author's ex is the groom, so they're not in a relationship anymore. But they're close with the groom and his family. The bride asked the author not to hit on any women before the wedding. The author says they didn't actively hit on anyone but were just having fun. Then a bridesmaid invited them to her hotel room, and the author accepted.\n\nHmm, so the main issue here is whether the author is in the wrong for going to the hotel room. The bride is upset because they didn't reject the invitation. The author argues that it wasn't them approaching her, but her approaching them. \n\nI need to consider social norms here. At a wedding, especially someone's ex's wedding, there's an expectation of behavior. Even though they're not in a relationship anymore, the bride might feel uncomfortable if the ex (or someone connected) is interacting with other guests in a way that's perceived as inappropriate. The key point is that the bride directly asked the author not to hit on anyone. By accepting the invitation from the bridesmaid, the author might be seen as violating that request, even if it wasn't them who initiated the contact. \n\nAlso, the author mentions they were drinking and mingling. While that's common at weddings, the specific request from the bride adds a layer of responsibility. The author didn't explicitly break the promise because the bridesmaid approached them, but in the context of the wedding, maybe they should have been more cautious to avoid any appearance of impropriety. \n\nThe bride's perspective is important. She might feel that the author is disrespecting her by being in a compromising situation at their wedding. Even if the author didn't have ill intentions, the action could be seen as insensitive. \n\nSo, while the author might not be actively trying to cause harm, the fact that they went along with the invitation could be seen as inconsiderate towards the bride's feelings. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong because they ignored the bride's request and participated in an action that could be perceived as inappropriate in that setting.\n"
