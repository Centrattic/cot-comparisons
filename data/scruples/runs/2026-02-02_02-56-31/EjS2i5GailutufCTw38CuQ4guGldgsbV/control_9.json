It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not turning down a girl at their ex's wedding. The author's ex got married, and they were invited because they're close to the groom. The bride told the author beforehand not to hit on anyone, but the author didn't do that intentionally. Instead, a bridesmaid invited them to her hotel room, and the author accepted. The bride is upset now.\n\nFirst, the author's actions: they were just having a good time, not actively trying to pick up women. The bride's rule was that the author shouldn't hit on anyone, but the author didn't initiate; the bridesmaid approached them. So technically, the author didn't violate the rule as per their own understanding. But the bride is upset anyway. \n\nBut wait, maybe the issue is that even if the author wasn't the one approaching, accepting the invitation could still be seen as inappropriate in a wedding context. Weddings are for the couple, and maybe the author's presence there with an ex's spouse is causing tension. The author might not be in the wrong by the letter of the rule, but maybe by the spirit of it. The bride might feel that any interaction leading to a hotel room is unacceptable, regardless of who initiated it. \n\nAlso, the author is an ex of the groom, so there's a history there. Even if the author is close to the groom, being at the wedding and then engaging in such behavior might cross a line. The author might be seen as taking advantage of their position or disrespecting the bride's wishes. Even if the author didn't directly hit on someone, the situation could be interpreted as inappropriate. \n\nBut the key point is whether the author is responsible for not rejecting the invitation. If the author didn't initiate it, maybe they're not entirely at fault. However, the bride's rules were specific, and the author's presence in that scenario could still cause problems. The author might not be \"wrong\" in a legal sense, but socially, it's a breach of etiquette. The answer might depend on cultural norms. In some contexts, even accepting an invitation to a hotel room post-wedding could be seen as inappropriate, especially with someone connected to the event. \n\nSo, considering all angles, the author might not be in the wrong by their own account, but from the bride's perspective, they likely caused offense. The answer might be A (Yes, the author is wrong) because they didn't respect the bride's boundaries beyond just the initial rule. Even if they didn't start it, the situation could still be seen as violating the spirit of the request to not engage in any romantic interactions. Alternatively, if it's strictly about the rule (not initiating), then B (No). But considering the broader social context, A makes more sense.\n"
