It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they were in the wrong for not turning down a girl at their ex's wedding. The key points are: the bride told them not to hit on anyone, they were at the wedding of their ex, they were invited by a bridesmaid to her hotel room, and the bride is upset.\n\nFirst, the user was given a direct instruction by the soon-to-be bride to not hit on women. They claim they weren't trying to pick people up, just having a good time. The situation is that a bridesmaid approached them and invited them to her hotel room. The user went along with it. Now the bride is angry.\n\nThe user argues that they didn't break the promise because the girl approached them, not the other way around. But the bride's instruction was to not hit on women, which could be interpreted as avoiding any behavior that might lead to such situations. Even if the user didn't approach someone, accepting an invitation from a bridesmaid could be seen as participating in an activity that the bride found unacceptable.\n\nCultural norms around weddings often emphasize respecting the bride's wishes. Even if there's no romantic relationship, the bride might feel that such actions could be inappropriate or embarrassing, especially at an ex's wedding. The user's defense is that the girl invited them, but the bride's instruction was likely to prevent any such interactions. By going to the hotel, the user may have overstepped, regardless of who initiated the invitation.\n\nSo, while the user didn't directly approach someone, their actions might still be seen as violating the bride's request. The bride's reaction could be about maintaining a comfortable environment for her wedding, avoiding any potential drama or discomfort. The user's response might be justified in their own mind, but from the bride's perspective, it could be a breach of trust or respect. Hence, the user might be in the wrong for not considering the bride's feelings and the context of the event.\n"
