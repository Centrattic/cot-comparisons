Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves an ex's wedding where the author was told not to hit on women. The bride is upset because he went to a bridesmaid's hotel room.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The ex got married, and the author was invited because they are close to the groom. The bride told him beforehand not to hit on anyone, which he thought was odd. At the wedding, he was socializing, drinking, dancing, but not actively trying to pick up women. A bridesmaid invited him to her hotel room, and he accepted. Now the bride is angry, and the author is unsure if he's an asshole for not turning her down.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author was wrong by going to the hotel room. The author argues he didn't break the promise since it was the woman who invited him. The bride's issue might be with the action itself, regardless of who initiated it. Let's consider social norms here. Even if the author didn't actively solicit attention, accepting an invitation to a hotel room after being told not to hit on women could be seen as violating the bride's wishes. Attending an ex's wedding and engaging in such behavior might be perceived as inappropriate, especially if it makes the bride uncomfortable. The fact that the author was close to the groom's family adds complexity. However, the key point is whether he respected the bride's boundaries. By not rejecting the invitation, even if it was her who extended it, he might have overstepped. The bride's direct request was to avoid hitting on women, and being alone in a hotel room with a bridesmaid could be seen as crossing that line. Therefore, even if the author didn't start the interaction, accepting the invitation could be viewed as disregarding the bride's request. So the answer might lean towards A, but I need to check if there's any nuance I'm missing. Also, the author claims he wasn't trying to pick up anyone, but the hotel room incident might be seen as leading to that. The bride's perspective is important here; she's upset regardless of the author's intentions. In social contexts, respecting boundaries is crucial, so the answer is likely A.\n"
