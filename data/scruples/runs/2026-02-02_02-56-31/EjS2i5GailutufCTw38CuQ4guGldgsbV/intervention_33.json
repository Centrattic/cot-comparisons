It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. So the situation is: the user went to their ex's wedding, where they were close to the groom. The bride told them beforehand not to hit on any women at her wedding. The user didn't intentionally try to pick up anyone, but during the reception, a bridesmaid invited them to her hotel room, and they accepted. Now the bride is upset.\n\nFirst, the user was told not to hit on women. They claim they didn't break the promise because it was the girl who approached them. But maybe the key point is whether accepting the invitation is considered hitting on someone. If the user didn't initiate it, but accepted an invitation, does that count? The bride might feel that the user was still engaging in behavior that could be seen as inappropriate, especially in the context of her wedding. Also, the user is at an ex's wedding, which might add some sensitivity here. Even if they weren't in a relationship anymore, the setting is a wedding, which is supposed to be a celebration, and maybe the bride felt it was unprofessional or inconsiderate. The user's argument is that they didn't initiate, but the bride's perspective is that the interaction happened. It's possible that the user isn't in the wrong because they followed the initial instruction (didn't initiate), but maybe they should have considered the bride's feelings regardless. However, the main issue is whether accepting the invitation is against the bride's request. Since the request was to not hit on women, and the user didn't initiate, maybe they aren't in the wrong. On the other hand, the act of going to the hotel room with a bridesmaid might still be seen as inappropriate in the context of a wedding. But since the user didn't start it, maybe they're not at fault. Hmm. I think the answer might be B, they're not in the wrong, but it's a bit of a grey area.\n"
