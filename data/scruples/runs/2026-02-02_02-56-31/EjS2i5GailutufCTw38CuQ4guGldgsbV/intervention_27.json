It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking if they're wrong for not turning down a girl at their ex's wedding. The bride had warned him not to hit on any women, and he agreed. But when a bridesmaid invited him to her hotel room, he went.\n\nFirst, the key points here are the initial agreement. The soon-to-be bride told him not to hit on anyone, and he thought he was following that by not initiating. But the bridesmaid approached him. The user's argument is that he didn't go looking for her, so he didn't break the promise. \n\nBut maybe the issue is about the context. It's an ex's wedding, which is a sensitive situation. Even if the bride didn't specify that he couldn't accept invitations, her demand was a boundary to prevent him from hitting on others. By accepting the invitation, he might have overstepped, regardless of who initiated. The bride could feel that by going along, he's disrespecting her wishes, even if he didn't start it. \n\nAlso, the fact that he was at the wedding with his ex's close family might mean that others were upset. The user might not see it as hitting on her, but if someone invites him to their hotel room, especially at a wedding, that's a big deal. It's possible that the bride feels he's still using the event to flirt, even passively. \n\nSo, while he didn't explicitly hit on her, he did accept a romantic or sexual advance in a setting where the bride wanted to prevent such interactions. That could be seen as violating the spirit of the agreement, even if the letter wasn't broken. Therefore, the bride's anger is understandable, and the user might be in the wrong by not respecting her boundary, even if he didn't initiate the contact.\n"
