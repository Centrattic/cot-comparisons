It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that they went to their ex's wedding, and the bride had told them beforehand not to hit on any women there. Now, at the wedding, a bridesmaid invited them to her hotel room, and they accepted. The bride is upset about it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The user is at their ex's wedding, which can be a sensitive situation. The bride made a direct request not to hit on any women, and the user claims they didn't approach anyone but were invited by the bridesmaid. The key points here are whether the user violated the bride's request by accepting the invitation and if that's considered crossing a line.\n\nThe user argues that they didn't initiate the attention, so they didn't break the promise. But the bride might feel that accepting the invitation still goes against her wishes, even if the user wasn't the one to approach. The question is whether the user should have declined the invitation to respect the bride's boundaries, regardless of who initiated the interaction.\n\nAnother angle is the social norms around attending an ex's wedding. Even if the user isn't in a relationship with the ex anymore, the wedding is a significant event for the ex's new spouse. The user's actions could be seen as inconsiderate, especially if the bride felt uncomfortable or that the user was taking advantage of the situation.\n\nIt's also worth considering that the user was drinking and mingling, which might have influenced their decision to accept the invite. But the main issue is whether they respected the bride's request. Even if they didn't initiate the attention, by accepting, they might have still caused the bride distress. The bride's perspective is important here\u2014she set the boundary, and the user's action, though not direct, might have disregarded that.\n\nSo, weighing these factors, even if the user didn't break the promise by not approaching, accepting the invitation could still be seen as violating the spirit of the bride's request. Therefore, the user might be in the wrong for not respecting the bride's wishes, even if the invitation was from someone else.\n"
