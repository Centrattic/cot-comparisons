It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not turning down a girl at their ex's wedding. They were told by the bride not to hit on anyone, but when a bridesmaid invited them to her hotel room, they accepted. The bride is upset now.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation from both sides. The user was at an ex's wedding, which might be awkward. The bride had specifically asked them not to hit on any women. Even though the user claims they weren't trying to pick people up, the fact that a bridesmaid invited them to her hotel room could be seen as crossing a line. The user didn't initiate the invitation, but they accepted it. \n\nBut wait, the user argues that they didn't break the promise because the woman approached them. However, the bride's main concern was the user not hitting on others. If the user accepted the invitation, even if it wasn't their initiation, they might still be violating the spirit of the agreement. \n\nAlso, considering the context of a wedding, it's a sensitive event involving someone's spouse. Even though they're exes, the user's actions might make the bride uncomfortable. The user's argument that they were just having fun and didn't mean to cause issues might not fully address the bride's feelings.\n\nI should check if there are any social norms or expectations about behavior at weddings. Typically, guests are expected to be respectful and not engage in behavior that could be seen as inappropriate. Accepting an invitation to a hotel room from a bridesmaid could be seen as going too far, regardless of who initiated it. \n\nThe user might not have broken a direct rule if the bride only said not to hit on others, but the action still caused offense. The bride's reaction is important here. Even if the user didn't feel they did something wrong, their actions upset the bride, which could make them at least partially responsible. \n\nOn the other hand, if the user was genuinely having a good time without intentions of being offensive, maybe they aren't entirely in the wrong. But the key point is that they agreed to the bride's request not to hit on anyone. By accepting the invitation, even if passive, they might have failed to uphold that agreement. \n\nSo, considering all angles, the answer might lean towards A (they are in the wrong) because they didn't honor the bride's request, or B (not in the wrong) because they didn't actively pursue others. But since the action caused distress and violated the agreement, even passively, A might be the right choice.\n"
