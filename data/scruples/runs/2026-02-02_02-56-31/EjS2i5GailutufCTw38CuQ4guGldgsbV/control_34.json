It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for the situation described. The scenario involves the author attending their ex's wedding and being asked to a hotel room by a bridesmaid.\n\nFirst, the bride told the author not to hit on women at her wedding. The author says they didn't actively hit on anyone but were just having fun. Then a bridesmaid invited them to her hotel room, which the author accepted. The bride is upset now.\n\nHmm, so the key points here are the initial request from the bride and the author's actions. The author didn't go up to women to hit on them, but when approached by a bridesmaid, they went along. The author argues that the bride's request was a direct demand, but maybe that's not the main issue here. The bride might have expected the author to set boundaries themselves, even if approached. \n\nAlso, the fact that it's the ex's wedding adds complexity. The author is close to the groom and family, so maybe the bride felt the author had a history or connection here. But the author isn't in a relationship with the bride, so why is she upset? Maybe because of social norms or personal boundaries she set. \n\nThe author says they didn't break the promise since the woman approached him. But in social contexts, even if someone approaches you, accepting a hotel room invitation might be seen as inappropriate, especially at a wedding where the host (bride) would expect guests to behave respectfully. \n\nIt's possible that the author didn't consider how the bride would feel if someone from the wedding went to a hotel with another attendee, regardless of who initiated it. Even if the author wasn't actively hitting on people, accepting such an invitation could be seen as crossing a line set by the bride. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? The answer might depend on cultural norms and personal boundaries. If the bride explicitly asked them not to hit on women, then the author should have been extra cautious to avoid any situation that could be perceived as hitting on someone. By going to the hotel, it's possible that the author violated that trust, even if they didn't initiate the approach. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong because they didn't honor the bride's request by avoiding situations that could be seen as inappropriate, regardless of who approached whom.\n"
