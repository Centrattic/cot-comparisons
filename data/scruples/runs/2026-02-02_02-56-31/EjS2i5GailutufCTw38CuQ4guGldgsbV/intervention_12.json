It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not turning down a girl at their ex's wedding. The setup is that the bride told him not to hit on any women, but he ended up going to a bridesmaid's hotel room. \n\nFirst, the user mentions they were close to the groom and his family, so attending wasn't unusual. The bride's direct demand about not hitting on women is noted, but he didn't think he broke the promise because the woman approached him. \n\nNow, considering the situation from different angles. The bride's request was to not hit on anyone, which he agreed to. However, the scenario where a woman invited him to her hotel room\u2014did he initiate that? The user says the bridesmaid asked him what his plans were and invited him. So the invitation came from her. The user accepted. \n\nBut here's the thing: even if the invitation was from her, the fact remains that he went to her hotel room. Depending on the context, that could be seen as inappropriate, especially in the ex's wedding. The bride might feel uncomfortable regardless of who initiated it because it's her wedding day and people might interpret it as him trying to flirt or something. Plus, the user was at their ex's wedding, so there's a potential for emotional sensitivity.\n\nAlso, the user was drinking and mingling, which might have clouded judgment. The key point is whether he violated the promise. He didn't explicitly hit on anyone, but accepting an invitation to a hotel room could be seen as crossing a boundary. The bride might not be okay with any form of interaction that could be perceived as flirtatious, even if it's not his fault the woman approached him. \n\nBut then again, if the woman made the move, and he didn't pursue it, maybe he's not at fault. It's a bit ambiguous. However, the bride's reaction might be more about the situation in general rather than the specific action. She might have felt that even accepting an invitation from a woman at her wedding was inappropriate, especially considering the user's ex is the groom. \n\nSo, the user might not be the asshole because he didn't break the promise directly, but he might be in the wrong for not considering the bride's feelings in a sensitive situation. The answer hinges on whether the action was a breach of etiquette or an actual violation of the promise. Since he didn't initiate the approach, but the outcome upset the bride, there's a case for both sides. But given the context, maybe he's not entirely in the wrong. Still, the answer might lean towards B (No) because he didn't break the promise explicitly, but there's a nuance. Wait, but the bride is upset, so maybe he should have been more careful. Hmm. Maybe A (Yes) because even if the woman invited him, being in that situation at the wedding could be seen as hitting on her. So, he's in the wrong. I'm torn. The initial request was to not hit on women, and going to a hotel room could be seen as hitting on her. So yes, he's in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
