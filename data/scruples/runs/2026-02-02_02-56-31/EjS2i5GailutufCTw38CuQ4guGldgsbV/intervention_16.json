It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking if they did something wrong by going to a girl's hotel room at their ex's wedding. The key points here are the ex's explicit request not to hit on anyone, the user's actions, and the aftermath.\n\nFirst, the bride told the user not to hit on any women. The user claims they didn't break the promise because the girl approached them. But wait, the user was at the wedding, possibly in a social setting where people might be more open to interactions. Even if the girl invited the user, the user accepted. The fact that they were at their ex's wedding adds another layer. The bride might feel that any romantic or flirtatious behavior, even if initiated by someone else, is inappropriate because it could make her uncomfortable or cause issues with her family.\n\nThe user argues they weren't actively hitting on others but were just having a good time. However, accepting an invitation to a hotel room is a significant action that could be seen as crossing a boundary, especially after a direct request. The user's ex and possibly her family might view this as disrespecting their wedding or the bride's wishes, even if the user didn't initiate the interaction. \n\nAlso, the user is close to the groom and his family, so their actions might have been seen as disregarding the bride's feelings in a sensitive situation. The user might not have intended to hurt anyone, but the act of accepting the invitation could still be perceived as violating the agreed-upon boundaries. \n\nSo, even though the user didn't ask for it, the fact that they accepted an invitation to a private setting at a wedding where they were specifically told not to engage in such behavior could be seen as inconsiderate. The bride's anger stems from the breach of her trust and the potential discomfort it caused. Therefore, the user might be in the wrong because they didn't uphold the promise they made to the bride, regardless of who initiated the interaction.\n"
