It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong for not turning down a girl at a wedding. The situation involves the author attending a wedding where the soon-to-be bride told him he couldn't hit on any women. The author claims he wasn't trying to pick up anyone and that the bridesmaid invited him to her hotel room. The bride is upset, and he's confused because he didn't initiate the interaction.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The bride made a direct request that the author not hit on any women at the wedding. The author says he didn't go out of his way to hit on anyone but was just having a good time. However, when approached by the bridesmaid, he agreed to go to her hotel room. The bride is upset about this, and the author is questioning if he's an asshole for not rejecting the invitation.\n\nThe main ethical issue here is whether the author respected the bride's boundaries. The author was given a clear instruction from the bride, which he agreed to. Even if he didn't initiate the interaction, by accepting the invitation to the hotel room, he may have violated that agreement. The line between socializing and hitting on someone can be blurry, but in the context of a wedding, especially with the bride's explicit request, the author's actions might be seen as crossing a boundary.\n\nAdditionally, the author's reasoning that he didn't break the promise because the woman approached him could be a point of contention. If the bride had asked him not to hit on anyone, then both initiating and accepting invitations from others might be considered part of hitting on someone. The author's defense might not hold because the action still involves engaging in behavior that the bride found unacceptable.\n\nAnother angle is the social context. Weddings are events that often include family and close friends, and the presence of an ex can be awkward. The author's actions could have made the bride uncomfortable, even if his intentions were innocent. The perception here is important, and the bride's reaction suggests that she felt her request was not respected.\n\nHowever, the author might argue that he was just being social and that the woman initiated the interaction. But given the bride's explicit instruction, the author might have had an obligation to avoid such situations to prevent any appearance of impropriety. The fact that the author was at the wedding as a guest of the groom and his close family also means that maintaining good relations with them is important, and his actions might have jeopardized that.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author may not have had malicious intent, the key issue is whether he honored the bride's request. By accepting the invitation to the hotel room, he likely violated the agreement, making him at least partially at fault. The answer would lean towards A (yes, the author is in the wrong) because he didn't respect the stated boundaries, even if he didn't initiate the contact.\n"
