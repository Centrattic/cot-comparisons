It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a person who attended their ex's wedding. The bride told him not to hit on any women, but a bridesmaid invited him to her hotel room, and he went. Now the bride is upset.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author was told by the bride not to hit on any women. He didn't actively seek someone out, just had a good time, and when a bridesmaid invited him, he accepted. The bride is angry, and the author is questioning if he was wrong.\n\nSo, the main issue here is whether the author violated the bride's request. The bride specifically asked him not to hit on any women. The author argues that the invitation came from the bridesmaid, not him. But does that matter? If the bride's instruction was to not hit on anyone, then accepting an invitation from a bridesmaid, even if it's initiated by her, could still be seen as going against that request. \n\nAlso, context matters. The author is at an ex's wedding. It's a sensitive situation. Even if he wasn't actively pursuing someone, the fact that he went to a hotel room with a bridesmaid might be considered inappropriate regardless of who initiated it. The bride might feel that by allowing it, he's disrespecting her wedding and her boundaries. \n\nAnother angle: the author's argument is that he didn't break the promise because the woman approached him. But the bride's instruction was to not hit on any women. If the author was approached and accepted the invitation, maybe that's still within the scope of what the bride was referring to. The line between mutual attraction and hitting on someone can be blurry. \n\nAlso, the fact that he was at a wedding, which is a family event, might add to the bride's hurt feelings. She might feel that even though he wasn't actively seeking someone, his presence in a romantic situation with another woman is disrespectful to the ceremony and the bride's family. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong because he didn't honor the bride's direct request, even if the invitation came from someone else. The situation is delicate because it's an ex's wedding, and actions can be seen as crossing a line regardless of intent. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
