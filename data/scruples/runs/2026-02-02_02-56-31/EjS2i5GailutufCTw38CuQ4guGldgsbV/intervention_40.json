      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not turning down a girl at their ex's wedding. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: They went to their ex's wedding, which they were close with the groom. The bride told them not to hit on any women, but they didn't explicitly hit on someone. Instead, a bridesmaid invited them to her hotel room, and they accepted. Now the bride is upset.\n\nSo, the key points here are the expectation set by the bride versus the actual actions. The bride told him not to hit on any women, which he thought was a direct demand. He says he wasn't trying to pick people up, just having fun. Then, a bridesmaid approached him, and he went along with it. The user is wondering if he's in the wrong because he didn't reject her, even though she initiated.\n\nHmm. So the question is, does accepting an invitation from someone else at the wedding, when you were told not to hit on people, make you the asshole?\n\nWell, first, the user didn't approach the bridesmaid. The bridesmaid approached him. So maybe the user isn't the one initiating. But the bride's concern is that he might have been hitting on people. The user says he didn't break the promise because the other person approached him. But the problem is that by accepting, he might still be seen as participating in something inappropriate at her wedding.\n\nBut then again, if he's not the one initiating, maybe he's not at fault. However, the context is a wedding where the bride made a specific request. Even if it's not explicit hitting on, being in a hotel room with someone else could still be seen as violating the spirit of that request.\n\nAlso, how close is he to the groom? He said he's really close with the groom and the family. If he's there because of the groom, maybe he should have been more cautious to avoid any appearance of impropriety, even if he wasn't the one initiating. The bride might feel that his presence in a hotel room with a bridesmaid could make the groom or family uncomfortable, even if it's not his fault he was invited.\n\nSo the user's reasoning is that he didn't break the promise because the other person came to him. But the bride is still upset. The question is whether he should have rejected the invitation regardless. Maybe the answer depends on cultural expectations or social norms. In some circles, even accepting such an invitation could be seen as inappropriate, especially at a wedding where the host (the bride) set boundaries.\n\nBut then again, if it's a mutual decision between two adults, and he wasn't the one pursuing, maybe he's not at fault. But the bride's perspective is that he's at her wedding, and even if others approach him, it's still his responsibility to avoid situations that could cause discomfort.\n\nI think there's a nuance here. If he's not the one initiating, but still goes along, he might be sharing some responsibility. The bride's request was a clear boundary, and by entering a hotel room, he's violating that boundary, even if it's not by his initiation. So in that case, he might be in the wrong because he didn't respect her wishes, regardless of who approached whom.\n\nAlternatively, if the bride knew he was being invited by someone else, maybe she overreacts. But from her perspective, any interaction like that could be problematic. So the answer could be that he's not entirely in the wrong, but maybe he should have been more careful. However, the question is whether he's the asshole, which is a yes/no. The community often looks at these factors, and if he's not the one initiating, maybe he's not the asshole. But if he's in a position where he's at his ex's wedding, maybe the expectations are higher.\n\nHmm. I'm a bit torn. On one hand, he didn't break the rule literally, since he didn't hit on someone. On the other hand, he went to a hotel room with someone else, which might be seen as violating the spirit of the request. So maybe he's in the wrong because he didn't respect the bride's boundaries, even if it wasn't his initiation.\n"
