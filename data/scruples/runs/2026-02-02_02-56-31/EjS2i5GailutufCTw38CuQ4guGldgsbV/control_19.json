It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for not turning down a girl at their ex's wedding. The situation is a bit complicated.\n\nFirst, they went to their ex's wedding. The bride had told them not to hit on any women there. The person says they weren't actively trying to pick up anyone, just having a good time. Then a bridesmaid invited them to her hotel room, and they accepted. Now the bride is upset.\n\nSo, the main points are: the person was warned not to hit on anyone, but they ended up accepting an invitation from a bridesmaid. They argue that the invitation came from the woman, so they didn't break the promise. But the bride is upset. \n\nHmm. The key here is whether the person followed the bride's request. The bride said not to hit on any women. The person claims they didn't initiate anything, but they did accept an invitation. Is that considered hitting on someone? Maybe the line is blurry. If the person didn't approach the bridesmaid, but she approached them, then technically they didn't violate the request. But maybe the bride's rule was to avoid any form of flirtation or going into private situations. \n\nThe person's defense is that they didn't break the promise because the invitation came from the other person. But the bride might see it as the person still engaging in behavior that could be considered hitting on someone, regardless of who initiated the invitation. It's possible that the bride wanted her wedding to be a respectful event without any exes or guests from the other side's family trying to flirt. \n\nOn the other hand, the person wasn't the one who approached, they just accepted the invitation. If they didn't know the bridesmaid well, maybe it's a social faux pas, but not necessarily their fault. However, since they were warned not to hit on anyone, they might have been careless in accepting the invitation, even if it was the other person's initiative. \n\nThe question is whether the person is in the wrong. The answer depends on the interpretation of the bride's rules. If the rule was not to engage in any romantic or flirtatious behavior, then accepting an invitation to a hotel room could be seen as violating that, regardless of who initiated it. So, the person might be in the wrong because they didn't take the warning seriously enough and put themselves in a situation that could be perceived as hitting on someone. \n\nAlternatively, if the rule was about initiating, then the person is not at fault because they didn't start the interaction. But in social contexts, sometimes just accepting such an invitation can be seen as participating in something the bride would disapprove of. \n\nI think the answer leans towards A (the author is in the wrong) because they should have respected the bride's wishes more carefully, even if the invitation was from someone else. The situation is awkward, but the person did put themselves in a position that could be seen as violating the bride's request. So, they're at fault.\n"
