It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're the asshole for not turning down a girl at their ex's wedding. The bride told them not to hit on anyone, but they didn't actively approach someone; instead, the bridesmaid invited them. \n\nFirst, the context: the author is at their ex's wedding, which is a sensitive situation. The bride specifically told them not to hit on anyone. The key point here is whether the author violated that request. The author claims they didn't approach anyone, so they think they didn't break the promise. But the bridesmaid invited them to her hotel room, which the author accepted.\n\nNow, the ethical question. Was the author in the wrong? The bride's instruction was clear, so even if the invitation came from someone else, accepting it might still be seen as violating the spirit of the request. The ex's wedding is a place where the author should have been cautious to avoid any appearance of impropriety, especially since they were close to the groom. The fact that the author didn't initiate the interaction might mitigate some blame, but accepting the invitation could still be problematic. The bride's reaction is based on the situation being her wedding and wanting to prevent any uncomfortable dynamics. From an outsider's perspective, even if the author didn't start it, accepting the invitation could be seen as inconsiderate. So, the answer might lean towards \"Yes\" (A) because the author didn't honor the bride's wishes, even if indirectly.\n"
