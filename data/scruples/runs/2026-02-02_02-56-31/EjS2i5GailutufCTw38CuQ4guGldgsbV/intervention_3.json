It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not turning down a girl at their ex's wedding. The bride told him not to hit on anyone, and he thought he wasn't doing that. But then a bridesmaid invited him to her hotel room, and he accepted. Now the bride is upset.\n\nHmm. First, the user was at their ex's wedding. They were close to the groom and family, so maybe they felt comfortable. The bride had specifically told him not to hit on others, which he found odd. But he went to the wedding, and when a bridesmaid approached him, he went with her. \n\nThe user's reasoning is that he didn't initiate the interaction; the bridesmaid did. So he didn't break the promise because she asked him. But the bride is upset. Now, the question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nI need to consider social norms here. Even if the user wasn't actively hitting on others, accepting an invitation to a hotel room alone could be seen as inappropriate, especially at an ex's wedding. The bride's request might be about maintaining boundaries, not just for her own comfort but also respecting the event's nature. \n\nAlso, the user might have overstepped even if they didn't intend to. The fact that the bride is upset suggests that her feelings matter here. Even if he didn't break a direct rule, the action could be seen as insensitive. \n\nSo, maybe the answer is A (he's in the wrong) because the action could be perceived as crossing a boundary, regardless of who initiated it. Alternatively, B (not in the wrong) if the user didn't explicitly break the rule. But the situation is tricky because the context is an ex's wedding, and the bride's feelings are important here. The user's actions might have made her feel uncomfortable, even if he didn't start it. \n\nI think the key point is that even if the woman approached him, the user's acceptance of a private meeting could be seen as unwise, given the bride's prior request. So he might be at fault for not respecting her boundaries indirectly. Therefore, A makes sense.\n"
