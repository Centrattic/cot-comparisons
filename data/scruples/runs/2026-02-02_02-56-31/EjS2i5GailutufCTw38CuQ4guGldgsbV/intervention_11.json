It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not turning down a girl at their ex's wedding. The situation is a bit complicated. They were invited to the wedding, and the bride told them not to hit on anyone. But then a bridesmaid asked the user to her hotel room, and the user agreed. The bride is upset now.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The user is divorced and friends with the groom and his family. The bride made a direct request that they not hit on anyone, which the user thought was odd. The user claims they were just having fun, not actively trying to pick up women. The key point here is whether the user broke the bride's rule. The user says the bridesmaid approached them, not the other way around. So technically, the user didn't initiate the interaction.\n\nBut the bride is upset, so why? Maybe because even if the user didn't start it, the fact that they accepted the invitation could still be seen as violating the unspoken expectation of not engaging in such behavior at a wedding. Weddings are social events where guests are expected to behave respectfully towards the couple. The user might have thought that since it was a friend's wedding and they were close to the groom, they could be more relaxed. However, the bride's request was clear, and the user's actions, even if passive, might be perceived as disregarding that request.\n\nAnother angle is the user's ex being the groom. There could be lingering feelings or sensitivities there. The user might have overstepped by being in the same social circle post-breakup. But the main issue here is the interaction with the bridesmaid. The user didn't promise not to accept advances, only not to hit on others. The bride might feel that by accepting, the user is still violating the spirit of her request.\n\nHowever, the user argues they didn't break the promise because they didn't initiate. Legally or ethically, there's a difference between being approached and actively pursuing someone. But socially, the expectation might be that you avoid any situation that could be seen as inappropriate, even if you're not the one who approached. The user's presence at the wedding and accepting the invitation could be seen as insensitive, especially given the close relationship with the groom.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the user might be in the wrong because they didn't consider the bride's feelings and the potential impact on the wedding atmosphere. Even if the initiation was on the bridesmaid, the user's decision to go along could be seen as contributing to a breach of trust or respect towards the bride's wishes. The bride's request was a boundary, and respecting boundaries, even if they seem extreme, is part of being considerate in social settings.\n\nOn the other hand, the user didn't make a promise to the bride about not accepting advances, only not initiating them. If the bride's rule was to avoid any interaction that could be perceived as romantic, then the user might not have violated that explicitly. But if the request was to not engage in any romantic behavior, then accepting an invitation to a hotel room would definitely fall under that, regardless of who initiated it.\n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the user's actions, even if passive, violated the bride's stated rules. If the user agreed to the rule not to hit on anyone, and the bride's rule was broader to include any romantic interactions, then the user is in the wrong. If the user didn't promise to avoid all romantic interactions, just not to initiate them, then maybe not. But in social terms, respecting another person's wishes is crucial. The bride's request was specific, and the user's actions, even if they didn't break the exact phrasing of the rule, could be seen as violating the intent. Therefore, the user might be in the wrong.\n"
