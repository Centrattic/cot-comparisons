It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not turning down a girl at their ex's wedding. The ex got married, and the user was invited because they're close with the groom and family. The bride told them not to hit on anyone, but the user didn't intend to and ended up going to a hotel with a bridesmaid.\n\nSo, first, the user didn't break a promise because the bridesmaid approached them. But the bride is upset. The question is whether the user is in the wrong. \n\nHmm. The main points are: the user was told not to hit on others, they didn't actively seek someone out, but they accepted an invitation from someone else. The bride's anger might be about the principle of not wanting any romantic interactions at the wedding. Even if the user didn't initiate, being part of such an interaction could still hurt the bride, especially if it's a sensitive situation with their ex. \n\nBut the user argues they didn't break the promise. However, the bride might feel that the user's presence and accepting the invitation is still problematic. Also, considering the ex's wedding, there could be emotional sensitivities. Even if the user wasn't in a relationship anymore, the context of being at an ex's wedding might make such actions seem inappropriate regardless of who initiated it. \n\nIs it about respecting the bride's wishes? The user was told not to hit on anyone, which is a request to avoid causing discomfort. Even if the user didn't initiate, participating in that scenario could be seen as violating the spirit of the request. The bride might feel disrespected or that the user is exploiting the wedding setting for personal gain. \n\nOn the other hand, if the user didn't have bad intentions and the interaction was consensual, maybe there's a case for not being in the wrong. But the outcome is the bride being upset, which is the key here. The user's actions, even if not explicitly against the stated rules, might have caused emotional distress. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be that the user isn't in the wrong, but it's a close call. However, since the bride is upset, maybe there's a social expectation to avoid such situations entirely at a wedding, especially an ex's. The user might be seen as inconsiderate, even if they didn't break a direct rule. So maybe they are in the wrong. \n\nAlternatively, if the user didn't actively seek the interaction, they might not be at fault. But the context of the ex's wedding adds complexity. I think the answer depends on whether the user should have anticipated the bride's sensitivity and avoided the situation regardless of initiation.\n"
