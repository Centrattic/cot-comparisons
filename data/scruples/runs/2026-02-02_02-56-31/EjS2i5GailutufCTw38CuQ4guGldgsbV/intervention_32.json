It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not turning down a girl at their ex's wedding. The bride told him not to hit on anyone, but a bridesmaid invited him to her hotel room. He said yes.\n\nFirst, the user didn't go out of his way to hit on anyone. He was just having a good time. The bride's request was to not hit on any women, not to avoid being invited by someone. So if a woman approached him, accepting her invitation doesn't necessarily mean he broke the rule. He was passive here. The bride is upset, but maybe she should have considered that mutual interest isn't his fault. Also, he's not in a relationship now, so maybe it's okay. But depending on cultural norms or what the bride expected, it might still be a problem. But the user didn't take the initiative, so perhaps he's not at fault. Answer B.\n"
