It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not turning down a girl at their ex's wedding. \n\nFirst, the context: The author attended their ex's wedding, which they were close with the groom and his family. The bride had explicitly told them not to hit on any women at the wedding. The author claims they weren't hitting on anyone but were just having fun. Then, a bridesmaid invited the author to her hotel room, and they accepted. The bride is upset about this.\n\nThe key points here are the promises made to the bride and the social norms around attending a wedding. The bride made a direct request not to hit on women, and the author agreed. Even if the author didn't actively approach someone, accepting an invitation from a bridesmaid could still be seen as violating that promise. The bride's anger might stem from the fact that the author didn't honor her request, regardless of intent. Also, there's an inherent awkwardness in being at an ex's wedding and engaging in such behavior, which could be seen as insensitive or inappropriate, even if there's no current relationship.\n\nSocially, weddings are events where the focus is on the couple. The guest's behavior, especially an ex's, can be a sensitive issue. The author's actions might have made the bride uncomfortable, even if the author didn't mean harm. The fact that the author was in a previous relationship with the groom's ex might also add to the bride's feelings of being in a vulnerable position during her own wedding.\n\nSo, while the author didn't actively \"hit on\" others, accepting the invitation could be seen as crossing a line. The initial promise to the bride was broken, which is a key point. The bride's request was likely meant to prevent any situations that could cause discomfort, and the author's action might have undermined that. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not respecting the bride's boundaries, even if the invitation came from someone else.\n"
