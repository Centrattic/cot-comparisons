      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the question is whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong for not turning down a girl at their ex's wedding. The context is that the ex got married, the writer was invited because they're close with the groom and his family. The bride told the writer beforehand not to hit on any women, but the writer went to a bridesmaid's hotel room, and now the bride is upset.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The bride made a direct request: don't hit on any women at her wedding. The writer says they didn't go out to pick people up but were just having a good time. Then a bridesmaid invited them to her hotel room, and they accepted. The writer argues that since the invitation came from the girl, they didn't initiate it, so they didn't break the promise.\n\nBut wait, the bride's rule was not to hit on any women. If the writer accepted an invitation to a hotel room, even if initiated by the other person, does that still count as hitting on someone? The scenario is a bit ambiguous. The writer is at an ex's wedding, which is a sensitive situation. Even if they didn't approach the bridesmaid, going to her hotel room could be seen as participating in an inappropriate activity, especially given the context of a wedding where such behavior might be frowned upon.\n\nThe bride is upset because the writer was at her wedding and their ex's wedding. The writer was close to the groom, so maybe the bride felt it was a personal boundary to not have any romantic or flirtatious interactions there. The writer's argument is that they didn't initiate the contact, but the fact that they accepted the invitation could still be seen as violating the spirit of the bride's request. The line between socializing and hitting on someone might be thin here. Even if the woman approached them, accepting a hotel room invite could imply willingness to engage in something more than just friendly conversation, which might be what the bride is objecting to.\n\nAnother angle: the writer's ex is the groom, so they were in a past relationship. The bride might be feeling that the writer is still part of the inner circle, and any romantic interactions at the wedding could be awkward or inappropriate, especially if there's any lingering connection or if the bride wants to maintain a certain decorum. The writer's presence at the wedding might already be a point of tension, so the hotel room incident could be the last straw.\n\nThe writer's reasoning is that they didn't break the promise because the other person initiated, but the problem is that the situation itself, regardless of who started it, could be seen as violating the bride's boundaries. Whether the writer is at fault depends on how strict the bride's rule was. If the rule was \"don't engage in any romantic or flirtatious behavior,\" then accepting a hotel room invitation, even if initiated by another, would be a breach. However, if the rule was more about the writer approaching others, then maybe not. But in the context of a wedding, hotel room invites are often seen as leading to something more, so the writer's participation in that could be problematic.\n\nAlso, the fact that the writer was drinking and mingling\u2014being in a social setting where alcohol might lower inhibitions could play a role. But the writer argues they weren't trying to pick up anyone. Still, the outcome is that the bride is upset. The writer's responsibility here is to respect the bride's wishes, even if they feel they're not at fault. Social norms and expectations at weddings often include certain behaviors, and the bride's request was to not hit on any women. Even if the writer didn't start it, the fact that they went along with it might still be seen as crossing a line.\n\nIn conclusion, while the writer might not have explicitly broken a specific rule about initiating contact, the act of going to a hotel room with a bridesmaid could be seen as violating the bride's expectations and the general decorum of the wedding. Therefore, the writer might be in the wrong for not respecting the boundaries, even if they didn't take the first step.\n"
