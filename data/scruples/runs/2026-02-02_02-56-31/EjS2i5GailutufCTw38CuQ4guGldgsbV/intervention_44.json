It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not turning down a girl at their ex's wedding. The bride told them not to hit on anyone, and now they're upset because a bridesmaid invited them to her hotel room, and they accepted.\n\nFirst, the user was told not to hit on any women, which they agreed to. But the bride is upset now. The user's defense is that the girl approached them, not the other way around. But the key point here is the initial agreement. Even if the girl invited them, the user had promised not to hit on anyone. Accepting the invitation might still be seen as violating that promise, even if they didn't initiate it. \n\nAlso, considering the context of a wedding, which is a sensitive time, especially with an ex. Even if the user wasn't directly hitting on someone, being in a private setting with someone else's bridesmaid could be seen as inappropriate. The bride might feel that the user is disrespecting her by not respecting her boundaries. \n\nThe user argues they weren't trying to break the promise, but the action itself might have crossed a line. Whether the user is in the wrong depends on whether accepting the invitation counts as hitting on someone. If the intention was just to have a good time and not to flirt, but the action led to a situation that the bride found offensive, then the user might be in the wrong for not considering the bride's feelings. \n\nAlso, being close to the groom, the user's actions could reflect poorly on them in the eyes of the groom and their family. Even if the user didn't mean to, the bride's reaction suggests that the action was inappropriate. So, the user might have breached an agreement and caused discomfort, making them at least partially responsible.\n"
