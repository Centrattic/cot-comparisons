It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The person is at their ex's wedding. The bride had told them not to hit on any women there. They went to the wedding, had a good time, and ended up going to a bridesmaid's hotel room. The bride is upset now.\n\nFirst, the key points here are the expectations set by the bride. She told them not to hit on anyone, but the person says they didn't go out of their way to pick up anyone. The bridesmaid approached them. So, the question is whether they were in the wrong by not rejecting the invitation.\n\nThe user is asking if they're an asshole. From a third-party perspective, even if the person wasn't actively hitting on others, agreeing to go to someone's hotel room at an ex's wedding might be seen as inappropriate. The bride's request was to not hit on anyone, but engaging in a private meeting with a bridesmaid could be interpreted as crossing that line, regardless of who initiated it. \n\nHowever, the user argues they didn't break their promise because the bridesmaid approached them. But the issue might be that even if they didn't initiate, going to the hotel room could make the bride uncomfortable. The situation is subjective, but the bride's feelings are valid here. The wedding is a significant event for her, and respecting her boundaries, even if not explicitly stated, might be expected. \n\nSo, considering the bride's request and the potential for misunderstanding, it's possible the person overstepped, even if unintentionally. Therefore, they might be in the wrong.\n"
