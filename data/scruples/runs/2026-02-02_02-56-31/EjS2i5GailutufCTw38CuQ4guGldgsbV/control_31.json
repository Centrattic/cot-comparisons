It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not turning down a girl at their ex's wedding. The situation involves the author attending the wedding of their ex, where the bride had previously told them not to hit on any women. The author claims they weren't trying to pick anyone up, just having fun, but a bridesmaid invited them to her hotel room. The bride is upset, and the author is questioning if they're an asshole for not rejecting the invitation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author was at their ex's wedding, which is a sensitive situation. The bride had already given a direct instruction not to hit on women, which the author thought was strange but agreed to. Now, the author went to the wedding, was social, and when a bridesmaid invited them to her hotel, they accepted. The bride is angry, and the author is confused because they feel they didn't break their promise because the invitation came from the other person.\n\nThe key points here are consent and boundaries. The bride's request was to not hit on anyone, which the author took as a promise. However, accepting an invitation from someone else could still be seen as crossing a boundary, even if the author wasn't the one initiating. The issue might be that regardless of who initiated the interaction, the author is still engaging in behavior that the bride found uncomfortable. The ex's wedding is a place where the author is expected to be respectful and avoid any actions that could be seen as inappropriate, especially given their past relationship with the bride.\n\nAdditionally, the author's argument that they didn't break the promise because the other person invited them might not hold weight. The bride's instruction was likely to avoid any advances, regardless of who initiates. The author's presence at the wedding and their decision to go to the hotel with the bridesmaid could be seen as disregarding the bride's wishes and the sensitivities of the event.\n\nAnother angle is social etiquette. At a wedding, especially one of an ex, it's customary to be mindful of the host's comfort. The author might have overstepped by engaging in behavior that could be perceived as inappropriate, even if it wasn't their initial intention. The bride's upset reaction suggests that the action was indeed problematic from her perspective.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author might be in the wrong because they didn't take the bride's request seriously enough and participated in an activity that upset her, regardless of who initiated it. The social context of the wedding and the existing relationship dynamics make the situation more delicate. Therefore, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong.\n"
