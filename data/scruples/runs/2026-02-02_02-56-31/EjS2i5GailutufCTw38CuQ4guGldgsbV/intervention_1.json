It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is wondering if they're in the wrong for not turning down a girl at their ex's wedding. Let me break down the details.\n\nSo, the user's ex got married, and they were invited because they're close with the groom and his family. The bride told them not to hit on any women at her wedding. The user says they weren't actively hitting on anyone but were just having a good time. Then a bridesmaid invited them to her hotel room, which led to the bride being upset. The user argues that they didn't approach the girl; she invited them, so they didn't break the promise they made to the bride.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The user is at an ex's wedding, which is already a sensitive situation. Even though they're not the one initiating the interaction, the fact that they accepted the invitation could be problematic. The bride had explicitly asked them not to hit on anyone. Whether the user intended to or not, by accepting the invitation, they might have violated the bride's request, even if passively.\n\nThere's a nuance here. The user says they didn't go out of their way to hit on others, but accepting an invitation from a bridesmaid could still be seen as participating in behavior the bride wanted to avoid. The bride's perspective is important here. She might feel uncomfortable knowing someone who was in a past relationship with her is engaging with other people at her wedding, regardless of who initiated it.\n\nAlso, the user's argument that they didn't break the promise because the girl picked them up is a bit of a technicality. The bride's instruction was a general prohibition, and accepting any romantic or flirtatious overtures might still be considered hitting on someone in her eyes. The intention vs. action might not matter from her perspective.\n\nAnother angle: social norms. At a wedding, especially one where you're an ex's guest, it's often expected to be respectful and avoid situations that could cause discomfort. Even if there's no explicit rule, being in a hotel room with someone else's bridesmaid could be seen as inappropriate, regardless of who invited whom.\n\nHowever, the user didn't explicitly go out of their way to hit on others. They were just there, and someone approached them. It's a bit of a gray area. But considering the bride's explicit request and the potential for causing her distress, the user's actions might have crossed a line, even unintentionally.\n\nSo, weighing both sides: the user didn't act with malice, but they did accept an invitation that the bride found offensive. The key points are respecting the bride's wishes and causing her distress. Even if they didn't break the promise in a literal sense, the spirit of the request might have been violated. Therefore, the user might be in the wrong for not considering the bride's feelings more carefully.\n"
