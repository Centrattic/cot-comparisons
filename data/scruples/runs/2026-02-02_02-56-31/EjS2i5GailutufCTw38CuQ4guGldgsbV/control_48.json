It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit-style post is in the wrong for not turning down a girl at their ex's wedding. The situation is that the ex-bride told the author not to hit on any women at the wedding, and later when a bridesmaid invited the author to her hotel room, he accepted, leading the bride to be upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author's ex got married, and they were invited because they're close to the groom and family. The bride told him not to hit on others before the wedding. The author claims he wasn't actively trying to pick people up but ended up accepting an invitation from a bridesmaid. \n\nNow, the key points here are the bride's request and the author's actions. The bride's direct instruction was to not hit on any women. The author argues that it was the bridesmaid who approached him, not the other way around. So, technically, he didn't initiate the interaction. But does that matter? The bride's rule was to avoid hitting on anyone, regardless of who approaches. If the author didn't start the interaction but accepted an invitation, is that a violation of the rule?\n\nAnother angle: the author's relationship with the bride is past. However, attending the wedding as a guest, especially an ex, might have unspoken expectations of behavior. The bride's request might stem from wanting to protect her new spouse's feelings or her own. Even if the author didn't approach the bridesmaid, accepting the invitation could still be seen as taking advantage of the situation, especially in a wedding setting where such interactions might be sensitive.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that the bride is now upset. The reasons for her anger are unclear, but the author is puzzled. However, the author's actions, even if not directly initiating, could be perceived as crossing a boundary set by the bride. The fact that the author went to the hotel room with someone else might be seen as disregarding her request, even if it wasn't a direct approach by him.\n\nIn terms of social norms, weddings are times where guests are expected to behave in a way that respects the couple. The bride's explicit instruction to the author was a boundary. Crossing that, even if not by initiating, might be seen as inconsiderate. The author might not have violated the letter of the rule (since it was the other person's initiative), but the spirit of the request\u2014avoiding any romantic overtures during the wedding\u2014could still be breached.\n\nOn the other hand, if the author didn't start the interaction and was merely accepting a social invitation, maybe it's not his fault. However, the context of the wedding and the bride's specific request likely makes this situation more delicate. The author might have been expected to avoid such interactions entirely to respect the bride's wishes, regardless of who approached whom.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author might be in the wrong because he didn't honor the bride's request, even if the approach was from someone else. The expectation in such a setting, especially with the bride's explicit instruction, is to avoid any behavior that could be seen as inappropriate or disrespectful to the couple. Therefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
