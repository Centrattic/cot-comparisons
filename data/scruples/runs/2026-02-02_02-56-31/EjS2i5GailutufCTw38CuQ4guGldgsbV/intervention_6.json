It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not turning down a girl at their ex's wedding. The situation is a bit complex. \n\nFirst, the user went to their ex's wedding, which is already a potentially awkward situation. The ex's bride told them beforehand not to hit on anyone, which they agreed to. The user claims they didn't break the promise because the girl approached them. But then the bride is upset.\n\nHmm. So the main points here are: Did the user cross a boundary by accepting the advances of the bridesmaid? The bride's request was to not hit on anyone, but the user didn't initiate the contact. However, even if not initiated, going to someone's hotel room seems like it could be crossing a line, regardless of who approached first. \n\nThe user's defense is that they didn't break their promise because the girl invited them. But maybe the bride's rule was to not engage with anyone, regardless of initiation. Also, the user was at their ex's wedding, so there might be an unspoken rule about not creating drama. \n\nEven if the user wasn't in a current relationship, being at their ex's wedding and engaging in such behavior could be seen as insensitive or disrespectful to the bride. The key here is whether the user respected the bride's boundaries. The bride set a clear rule, and even if the user didn't break it technically, the action might have violated the spirit of the request. \n\nAlso, considering social norms, going to someone else's wedding and accepting a romantic invitation could be seen as crossing a line, especially if it causes discomfort to the host (the bride). So, even if the user didn't explicitly break their word, the action might still be considered wrong in terms of social etiquette and respect for the bride's feelings.\n\nSo, probably answer A (Yes, in the wrong) because they didn't respect the bride's boundaries, even if the interaction was initiated by someone else. The context of the wedding and the prior agreement matters here.\n"
