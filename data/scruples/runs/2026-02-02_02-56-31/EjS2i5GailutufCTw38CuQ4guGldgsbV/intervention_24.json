It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not turning down a girl at their ex's wedding. They were told by the bride not to hit on any women, but a bridesmaid invited them to her hotel room, and they went.\n\nHmm, so the key points here: the user was at an ex's wedding, which is already a delicate situation. The bride had directly told them not to hit on anyone. The user claims they weren't actively hitting on people but were just having a good time. Then a bridesmaid invited them to her hotel room, and they accepted. Now the bride is upset.\n\nFirst, the user was given a direct instruction by the bride not to hit on anyone. Even if they didn't think they were hitting on people, the bride's request was clear. Accepting an invitation from a bridesmaid might be seen as violating that request, even if it wasn't the user's initiative. The fact that the bridesmaid initiated the invitation could be a defense, but the user still chose to accept it. \n\nThe user argues that they didn't break the promise because the girl approached them. But the initial request was broad, so maybe the bride expected all interactions like that to be avoided. The user's presence at the wedding might already be a sensitive topic since it's their ex's wedding. They might have overstepped by accepting the invitation, even if they weren't the one approaching others. \n\nAlso, the user's actions could be seen as insensitivity towards the bride's feelings. Even if they weren't in a relationship with the bride anymore, showing up and then engaging in this kind of behavior might come off as disrespectful. The bride might feel that the user is not taking her feelings into account, especially since it's her big day.\n\nOn the other hand, the user didn't actively hit on anyone and the invitation came from the bridesmaid. But the problem is that the user didn't reject the invitation, which could still be seen as crossing a line. The answer depends on whether accepting the invitation is considered violating the bride's request. \n\nSo, considering the bride's perspective and the situation, the user might be in the wrong for not respecting her boundaries, even if it was the bridesmaid who initiated. The answer is likely A (they are in the wrong) because they didn't honor the bride's wishes despite the invitation being from someone else.\n"
