It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author did something wrong by not turning down a girl at their ex's wedding. Let's break down the details.\n\nThe author attended their ex's wedding, which they were close to the groom and family. Before the wedding, the bride told the author not to hit on any women there. The author says they weren't actively trying to pick people up but were just having a good time. Then, a bridesmaid invited the author to her hotel room, and he accepted. Now the bride is upset. The author is confused because the bridesmaid approached him, not the other way around.\n\nFirst, the key points here are the expectations set by the bride. She explicitly told him not to hit on women. Even though the author claims he wasn't trying to, accepting an invitation from a bridesmaid could still be seen as violating that request. The author argues that since the bridesmaid initiated, he didn't break the promise. But the problem is, the author didn't refuse the invitation, which might be the crux. \n\nThe bride's issue is likely about the perception. Even if the author wasn't actively pursuing others, accepting the invitation could be seen as inappropriate given the setting. Weddings are about the couple, and guests are expected to respect that. Plus, since it's the ex's wedding, there might be lingering sensitivities. \n\nAlso, the author is an ex, so maybe the bride felt that any romantic interaction in that context was off-limits. The author's argument that the girl picked him up might not matter if the bride's request was clear. The author didn't set boundaries by declining the invitation, so he might be in the wrong for not respecting her wishes. \n\nBut another angle: was the author supposed to read the bride's mind? If the bride only told him not to approach others, but someone else approached him, is that his fault? Maybe the author didn't break the rule directly, but the action still upset the bride. It's a gray area. \n\nHowever, in social settings, it's often expected to refrain from accepting romantic advances if someone is under a direct instruction not to engage in such behavior. The author's acceptance, even if initiated by another person, could still be seen as violating the spirit of the request. So the answer might lean towards A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
