It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is they went to their ex's wedding, where the bride had previously told them not to hit on any women. The author didn't actively try to pick up anyone, but someone\u2014a bridesmaid\u2014invited them to her hotel room, and they accepted. Now the bride is upset.\n\nFirst, the author's argument is that they didn't break their promise because the woman approached them, not the other way around. But the bride is upset regardless. The key points here are about consent and boundaries. The bride set a condition before the event, which the author agreed to, even if they found it odd. By accepting the invitation from the bridesmaid, even if it was initiated by her, the author might be seen as violating that agreement indirectly. \n\nHowever, the author claims they weren't hitting on anyone, just having fun. The question is whether the act of accepting an invitation from someone else at the wedding violates the initial agreement. The bride might feel that by being open to socializing and then accepting such an invitation, the author is still engaging in behavior she prohibited. \n\nBut then again, the author didn't approach the bridesmaid; the bridesmaid approached them. So technically, maybe the author didn't break the promise. However, the problem here is more about the perception. The bride might see it as the author being in a position that could be misinterpreted, even if the author didn't initiate it. \n\nAlso, considering the context of an ex's wedding, there might be lingering sensitivities. Even if the author is friends with the groom, the bride's feelings need to be respected. The author's presence and actions might cause discomfort, regardless of their intentions. \n\nSo, is the author wrong? If the agreement was not to hit on anyone, and the author didn't initiate, maybe not. But by accepting the invitation, even if it was the other person's idea, they might have overstepped. The bride's upset reaction is valid because she felt her boundary was crossed. The author should have considered her feelings and perhaps declined the invitation to avoid causing her distress. Therefore, the answer might lean towards A (the author is in the wrong) because they didn't respect the bride's boundaries even if they didn't directly hit on someone. But I'm a bit confused because they didn't initiate it. Hmm.\n"
