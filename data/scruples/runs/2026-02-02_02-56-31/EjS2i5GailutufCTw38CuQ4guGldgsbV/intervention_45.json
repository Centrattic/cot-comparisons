It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not turning down a girl at their ex's wedding. The bride told him not to hit on any women, and he didn't do that. He was just having a good time, and a bridesmaid invited him to her hotel room. He went along with it. The bride is upset now.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points here. The user was told not to hit on anyone, but he didn't proactively hit on anyone. A bridesmaid invited him, so he accepted. The question is whether he's at fault. \n\nFrom the user's perspective, he didn't break the promise because the girl approached him. But maybe the bride's instruction was a request to avoid any such situations entirely, regardless of who initiates. So even if someone approaches him, maybe he should have declined to avoid making the bride uncomfortable. \n\nThe bride being upset could be because of the public setting, the presence of the ex, or maybe the perception that he's disrespecting the wedding's sanctity. Even if he didn't do anything wrong from his standpoint, maybe the situation is sensitive. \n\nAlso, considering social norms, being respectful of the bride's wishes is important. If she clearly stated that he shouldn't engage with any women, then honoring that request is key to maintaining good relations. The user might have thought it was okay since he wasn't the one initiating, but the bride might feel violated or disrespected regardless. \n\nSo, even if the user didn't intend to break the promise, he might be in the wrong because he didn't follow the bride's explicit request, which could be seen as a boundary. The fact that someone else invited him doesn't negate the original instruction. \n\nTherefore, the answer might be A (Yes, in the wrong) because he didn't respect the bride's boundaries by accepting the invitation despite her warning.\n"
