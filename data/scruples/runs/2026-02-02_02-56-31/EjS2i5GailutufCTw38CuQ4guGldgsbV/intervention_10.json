It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if they're an asshole for not turning down a girl at their ex's wedding. The setup is that they went to their ex's wedding, were told by the bride not to hit on anyone, but then a bridesmaid invited them to her hotel room and they accepted. The bride is upset, and the user is wondering if they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The user is at their ex's wedding. Even though they're not in a relationship now, there might be some unspoken social rules. The bride explicitly told them not to hit on any women, so there's a clear boundary set. The user claims they didn't actively hit on anyone but were just having fun. The key point is that a bridesmaid invited them to her hotel room, and they accepted. The user argues that since the girl approached them, they didn't break any promise.\n\nBut wait, the bride's rule was not to hit on anyone, not necessarily to avoid being invited by someone else. The user might think they followed the rule because they didn't initiate the contact. However, from the bride's perspective, it's still about maintaining the wedding's atmosphere and not causing any issues. Even if the invitation came from the bridesmaid, accepting it could be seen as crossing a line, especially since it's the ex's wedding. The user's presence might be sensitive, and the bride might feel that any interaction between the user and another guest, especially a close one like a bridesmaid, is problematic.\n\nAlso, the user's ex is now married, so there's an expectation that the ex's partner (the bride) would want to avoid any situations that could be awkward or cause gossip. The user's actions, even if not directly hitting on someone, might still be perceived as inappropriate in that context. The user didn't have a romantic relationship with the bridesmaid, but going to her hotel room is a big step and could be seen as violating the unspoken rules of a wedding, where the focus should be on the couple celebrating.\n\nAnother angle is the user's own behavior. They were drinking and mingling, which is normal at a wedding, but when someone extends an invitation to a private setting, it's important to consider the implications. The user might not see it as hitting on someone, but the bride's anger suggests that she did. Even if the user didn't break a direct rule (since the girl invited them), the social context of the wedding and the relationship dynamics might mean that the user's actions were inappropriate. The user's ex's wife has a right to feel uncomfortable if the ex is interacting closely with other guests, especially if it could be seen as leading to something else.\n\nSo, considering the bride's perspective and the social norms around weddings, the user's decision to accept the invitation might be seen as crossing a line. Therefore, they might be in the wrong.\n"
