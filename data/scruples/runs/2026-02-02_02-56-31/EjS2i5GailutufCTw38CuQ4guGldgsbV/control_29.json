It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person is in the wrong for not turning down a girl at their ex's wedding. The situation is that the author didn't hit on anyone as per the bride's request, but a bridesmaid invited them to her hotel room, and the author accepted. The bride is upset.\n\nFirst, the bride told the author not to hit on any women at the wedding. The author claims they didn't approach anyone, but accepted an invitation from a bridesmaid. The key points here are the initial request from the bride and the nature of the interaction with the bridesmaid.\n\nThe bride's request was a direct warning, probably to avoid awkwardness since the author is an ex of both the groom and possibly the bride. The author didn't violate that by approaching someone, but by accepting an invitation from a bridesmaid, they might have created the impression of trying to make things uncomfortable or insinuate a relationship. Even if the author didn't make the move, being in a hotel room with a bridesmaid could be seen as crossing a line, especially given the context of being at an ex's wedding. \n\nThe bride's anger might stem from feeling that the author is disrespecting her wedding by engaging in behavior that could be perceived as inappropriate. The author might not have intended to break the promise, but the situation could still be hurtful to the bride and family. \n\nSo, even though the author didn't initiate the approach, accepting the invitation might be considered inconsiderate given the circumstances. The answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong because they didn't respect the bride's request implicitly by not engaging in any romantic interactions, even if it was initiated by someone else.\n"
