It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about not turning down a girl's invitation to her hotel room at an ex's wedding. \n\nFirst, the author's ex got married, and they are close to the groom and family. The bride told the author not to hit on any women at the wedding. The author didn't actively try to pick up anyone but ended up being invited to a bridesmaid's hotel room. The bride is upset, and the author is wondering if they're an asshole for not rejecting the invitation.\n\nSo, the key points: The bride made a direct request not to hit on women. The author claims they didn't break the promise because the woman approached him. The author is now in a situation where the bride is angry. \n\nNow, I need to consider social norms and expectations. Even if the author didn't initiate, accepting an invitation from a bridesmaid might still be seen as violating the bride's request. The bride might feel that the author is still engaging in behavior that could be considered inappropriate, especially at her wedding. The fact that the author is an ex adds another layer. Maybe the bride feels it's unkind to the groom if someone from the groom's side is being hit on. \n\nAlso, the author was at the wedding of their ex. There's a potential for awkwardness, and by accepting the invitation, they might have overstepped boundaries, even if not directly violating the initial promise. The nuance here is that the bride's request was about not hitting on women, but the author's acceptance could be seen as part of that behavior. \n\nAnother angle: The author was \"having a good time,\" which is fine, but entering a hotel room with someone else, especially at an ex's wedding, could be seen as reckless. The bride's anger might stem from the perception that the author is disrespecting her event or the groom's family. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? The initial promise was not to hit on women. The author didn't initiate, but by accepting the invitation, they still engaged in behavior that could be considered as hitting on someone, even if the other person initiated. So, maybe the author is in the wrong because the bride's request was to avoid such situations entirely. \n\nAlternatively, the author might argue they followed the rule by not approaching anyone. However, the line between socializing and inappropriate behavior can be blurry. The key is whether the author's actions, even if not initiated by them, still violate the spirit of the bride's request. \n\nIn conclusion, the author might be in the wrong (A) because they accepted an invitation that could be seen as violating the bride's boundaries, even if they didn't approach the woman themselves. The situation's context\u2014being at an ex's wedding and the bride's specific request\u2014adds to the complexity, making it a social misstep.\n"
