It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user had a wedding as a guest, and the bride told him not to hit on any women. He went to the wedding, had a good time, and ended up going to a bridesmaid's hotel room. The bride is upset, but he argues he didn't initiate the approach.\n\nFirst, the user is at his ex's wedding, which might be awkward. The bride made a direct request not to hit on anyone. Even if he wasn't actively trying to pick up women, the fact that a bridesmaid invited him to her hotel room and he accepted could be problematic. The bride's anger might stem from the assumption that he was hitting on her friend, even if she initiated it. \n\nThe user didn't break the promise because he didn't approach her, but maybe the situation still made the bride uncomfortable. The key points are consent and mutual understanding. If the bride had a rule and the user followed it by not initiating, but the situation still happened, maybe there's a misunderstanding. However, being at a wedding where such a rule is in place, the user should have been cautious. \n\nThe answer depends on perspective. Some might say he's not at fault since he didn't break the promise, while others might think he should have been more considerate to avoid the bride's discomfort. I think the main issue is the bride's perspective and the potential breach of trust, even if unintentional. So maybe the answer is B, but there's nuance.\n"
