It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about attending an ex's wedding, getting invited by a bridesmaid to her hotel room, and the bride being upset.\n\nFirst, the author was told not to hit on any women at the wedding. The author claims they weren't trying to pick anyone up but were just having a good time. Then, a bridesmaid invited them to her hotel room, and they accepted. The bride is upset about this.\n\nSo, the main points here are: the author was given a direct instruction not to hit on women, but they didn't initiate any advances. The bridesmaid approached them. The question is whether the author is at fault here.\n\nHmm. The key is whether the author broke the promise. The bride said not to hit on anyone, but the author didn't approach anyone. The bridesmaid invited them. The author might argue they didn't violate the rule because they didn't initiate. However, some might say that accepting an invitation from someone else could still be seen as participating in the behavior the bride was trying to prevent. \n\nAlso, the author is at their ex's wedding, which might add social complications. Even if they were just having fun, the bride might feel uncomfortable knowing that someone close to her spouse was in a compromising situation. \n\nBut the author's actions here were responding to an invitation, not initiating. So maybe they are not in the wrong. But maybe there's an expectation in such situations to avoid any interactions that could be misinterpreted. The bride's demand seems a bit controlling, but the author might have a valid point about not breaking their promise. \n\nI need to consider social norms. At a wedding, even if you're an ex, there's an expectation to behave respectfully. Accepting a hotel room invitation, even if invited by someone else, could be seen as inappropriate. The author might have crossed a line regardless of who initiated it. \n\nAlternatively, since the author didn't approach the bridesmaid, they might not be at fault. The responsibility could be on the bridesmaid for making the invitation. But the author's presence in the hotel room could still upset the bride, regardless of who asked. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the author's actions were within the boundaries set by the bride. If the bride's rule was to not engage in any romantic advances, then accepting an invitation to a hotel room could be seen as violating that, even if it was reciprocated. So the author might be in the wrong because they went along with the invitation, which could be interpreted as participating in the behavior the bride wanted to avoid. \n\nBut another angle is that the author didn't initiate it, so they followed their own interpretation of the rule. However, the bride's perspective is important here. The author's actions, while not directly hitting on someone, might still be seen as inappropriate in the context of a wedding. \n\nI'm leaning towards the author being in the wrong because they didn't set boundaries and allowed themselves to be in a situation that could be seen as violating the bride's request. So answer A.\n"
