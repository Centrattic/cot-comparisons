It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that he went to his ex's wedding. The bride had told him not to hit on any women there, but he ended up going to a hotel room with a bridesmaid. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics. He's at his ex's wedding, which can be tricky. The bride made a direct request that he not hit on women. He says he didn't hit on anyone, just had a good time. Then a bridesmaid invited him to her hotel room, and he accepted. Now the bride is upset.\n\nThe key points here are consent and the initial agreement. The bride asked him not to hit on women, so he agreed. By going to the hotel room with the bridesmaid, even if it was her initiative, it could be seen as violating that agreement. But he argues that he didn't initiate it, so he didn't break the promise. \n\nHowever, the problem is that being at the wedding, especially with an ex, can be sensitive. Even if the bridesmaid approached him, his decision to go along might still hurt the bride's feelings, especially if she felt that kind of interaction was disrespectful. The bride's perspective is important here. She might feel that any romantic interaction at her wedding, even with someone not her spouse, is inappropriate, especially if there's a history there.\n\nAlso, the fact that he's close to the groom complicates things. Maybe the bride feels that his presence with the bridesmaid could be misinterpreted by guests or that he's not respecting her wishes. Even if he didn't intend to hit on anyone, his actions might have crossed a line from her point of view.\n\nOn the other hand, he didn't explicitly ask for the invitation; the bridesmaid did. So maybe he's not entirely at fault. But the initial agreement was to avoid hitting on women, and he agreed to that. Accepting an invitation to a hotel room could be seen as going against that, regardless of who initiated it. \n\nSo, considering both sides, the author might be in the wrong because he didn't honor the bride's request, even if indirectly. The bride's request was to avoid any romantic interactions, and his actions, even if initiated by another woman, could be seen as violating that. Therefore, the answer might be A (Yes, he's in the wrong). But I need to be careful here. The line between accepting an invitation and initiating it is thin. If he didn't push for it, maybe he's not entirely to blame. However, the bride's feelings are valid, and he might have overstepped by not respecting her boundaries, even if it wasn't his idea. So leaning towards A.\n"
