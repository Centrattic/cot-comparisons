It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they were wrong for not turning down a girl who invited them to her hotel room at their ex's wedding. \n\nFirst, the user was at their ex's wedding, which they were invited to because they're close with the groom. The bride had told them beforehand not to hit on any women. The user claims they were just having a good time, not trying to pick anyone up. Then, a bridesmaid asked them to her hotel room, and they accepted. Now the bride is upset.\n\nThe user's reasoning is that the bride's anger is strange, and they didn't break the promise because the girl approached them. They're asking if they're an asshole for not rejecting her.\n\nHmm. Let's think. The main points here are consent and boundaries. The bride had set a clear boundary: no hitting on women. The user agreed to that. Then, a bridesmaid invited them to her hotel room. The user didn't initiate the approach, but they accepted the invitation. The question is whether accepting that invitation violates the bride's rule.\n\nBut wait, the rule was \"not to hit on any women,\" which is different from someone approaching you. If the user is just being friendly and dancing, that's one thing. But if a bridesmaid invites them to her room, and they go, that could be seen as engaging in behavior the bride didn't want. Even if the user didn't initiate, by accepting the invitation, they're participating in what the bride considers inappropriate. \n\nAlso, the bride might feel that regardless of who initiated, it's a breach of trust, especially at an ex's wedding. The user might think they're not at fault because they didn't start it, but the bride's perspective is that it's still happening at her event, which could make her uncomfortable. \n\nSo, maybe the answer is that the user is in the wrong because they didn't respect the bride's boundary, even if the other person initiated. The key is that the bride asked them to avoid hitting on women, and going to someone's hotel room is a step beyond casual mingling. Even if it's not their initiation, participating in that situation could be seen as violating the agreed-upon boundary. Therefore, answer A (Yes, they're in the wrong).\n"
