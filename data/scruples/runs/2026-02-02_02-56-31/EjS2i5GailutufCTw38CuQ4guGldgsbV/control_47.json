It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a person attending their ex's wedding and not turning down a girl who invites them to her hotel room. The bride was upset because she told him not to hit on any women, but he didn't approach her; she approached him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is close to the groom and his family, so attending the wedding makes sense. The bride told him not to hit on women before the wedding, which seems a bit controlling, but maybe she felt protective. The author claims he wasn't trying to pick people up, just having a good time. Then, a bridesmaid invited him to her hotel room, and he accepted. The bride is upset about this.\n\nThe key points here are consent and boundaries. The author didn't approach anyone; the bridesmaid made the move. But the bride's rule was that he shouldn't hit on any women. Does accepting an invitation from someone else count as hitting on them? Maybe not, since he didn't initiate the contact. However, the fact that he went to the hotel room with her could still be problematic. The bride might feel uncomfortable knowing that someone there, regardless of who initiated, is interacting with her guests in that way. Also, since he's an ex of the groom, there might be added tension or sensitivity about his interactions.\n\nAnother angle is that the author was given a direct instruction by the bride not to hit on women. If he agreed to that, then following through would be expected. Even if the other person approached him, by going to the hotel room, he might be violating that agreement. The bride's anger could stem from feeling that her request wasn't respected, even if the other person made the first move.\n\nBut on the other hand, the author didn't initiate the interaction. If the bridesmaid approached him and invited him, maybe he wasn't being forward. However, accepting such an invitation could still be seen as complicit in behavior the bride wanted to avoid. The author might argue that he didn't break the promise because he didn't start it, but the outcome is that someone was approached, which the bride wanted to prevent.\n\nAlso, the fact that he was at his ex's wedding adds another layer. The bride might be particularly sensitive about how ex-partners behave at the event. The author's presence could already be a point of contention for the bride, so his actions might be viewed more critically.\n\nIn terms of social norms, even if the other person initiated, going to a hotel room with someone at a wedding could be seen as inappropriate, especially if the person has a vested interest in others not engaging in certain behaviors (like the bride in this case). The author's decision might not be the worst, but it's possible he overstepped by not respecting the boundaries set by the bride, even if indirectly.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author might be in the wrong because he didn't honor the bride's request, even if the other person made the first move. His actions could be seen as disregarding her boundaries, leading to her anger. The key is whether the promise he made to the bride included avoiding any interactions that could be considered hitting on others, regardless of who initiated them.\n"
