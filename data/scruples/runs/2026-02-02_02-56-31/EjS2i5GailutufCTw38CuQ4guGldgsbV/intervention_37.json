It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they did the wrong thing by not turning down a girl at their ex's wedding. The bride told them not to hit on anyone, and the person agreed but then went to the hotel with a bridesmaid.\n\nFirst, the key points here are the context of the wedding, the direct request from the bride, and the person's actions. The person was at their ex's wedding, which is a sensitive situation. The bride made it clear they shouldn't hit on anyone, maybe to avoid awkwardness or to maintain some boundaries. The man agreed, but later, a bridesmaid invited him to her hotel, and he accepted. The bride is upset now, even though he didn't initiate the approach.\n\nThe person's defense is that he didn't break the promise because the woman approached him. But the bride is still upset. The question is whether he's in the wrong. \n\nFrom a social standpoint, even if he didn't initiate, accepting an invitation from someone else in that context might still be seen as crossing a boundary. The bride's request was to not hit on women, which is a reasonable boundary. By going to the hotel with a bridesmaid, even if she approached him, it could be seen as engaging in behavior that the bride wanted to avoid. The key here is whether the promise to not hit on anyone included being passive as well. If the person agreed to not approach anyone, but didn't consider being approached as breaking the promise, that might be his perception, but the bride might see it as still violating the spirit of the agreement. \n\nAlso, considering the wedding is their ex's event, there's an added layer of social expectations. People might expect attendees to be respectful and not engage in behavior that could be seen as causing discomfort, especially between the ex and their new spouse. The fact that the bride is upset suggests that the action did cause some level of discomfort or violation of trust, even if the person didn't break an explicit rule. \n\nSo, while the person might not have technically broken his word (since he didn't initiate), the outcome is that the bride is upset. Socially, it's about respecting boundaries and considering others' feelings. In this case, even if the action wasn't explicitly forbidden, it's possible that the person should have been more considerate of the bride's wishes and the overall sensitivity of the situation. Therefore, the answer might lean towards A, but it's a bit nuanced. However, given the context and the bride's reaction, the person might be in the wrong because they didn't consider the broader implications beyond just the direct request.\n"
