It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves an ex's wedding where the author was told not to hit on women. The bride is upset because he went to a bridesmaid's hotel room.\n\nFirst, the author was explicitly told not to hit on women at the wedding. Even though they claim they weren't trying to pick people up, the fact that a bridesmaid invited him to her hotel room is a concern. The key point here is consent and the initial agreement. The author agreed not to hit on anyone, and while the action was initiated by the bridesmaid, accepting the invitation could still be seen as violating the bride's request. \n\nThe bride's reaction might be based on her discomfort with any potential impropriety at her wedding, even if the author denies intentions. The author's defense is that he didn't seek out the interaction, but by accepting the invitation, he may have contributed to the situation. \n\nIt's important to consider the context of the wedding and the expectations set by the bride. The author's actions, even if not overtly flirtatious, might have caused the bride distress. So, while the author didn't directly hit on someone, the situation's optics could be problematic, leading to the conclusion that he might be at fault for not respecting the bride's boundaries more clearly.\n"
