It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by going through the situation step by step.\n\nFirst, the author's ex got married, and they were invited. They're close with the groom and his family, so the invite makes sense. The bride asked the author not to hit on any women at the wedding. The author thought it was weird but agreed. At the wedding, the author is just having a good time, not trying to pick up anyone. Then, a bridesmaid invites the author to her hotel room, and they go. Now the bride is upset.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that the bride is upset for no good reason and that they didn't break the promise because the woman approached them, not the other way around. The question is whether the author is an asshole for not turning her down.\n\nHmm. Let's break it down. The bride made a direct request not to hit on anyone. The author didn't initiate the interaction; the bridesmaid did. But does that matter? The bride's request was to avoid approaching others, but if someone approaches the author, does the author have a responsibility to decline?\n\nI think it depends on the context. The author agreed not to hit on anyone, which likely implies not initiating, but if someone else makes a move, the author isn't obligated to say no. However, maybe the bride's request was overly broad, and the author wasn't in the wrong for not declining the invitation. But some might argue that the author should have respected the bride's boundaries even if it wasn't their initiation. But the key point is that the author didn't go out of their way to hit on anyone. The bridesmaid approached them. So the author isn't the one making the move. Therefore, maybe they're not in the wrong. Alternatively, maybe the author should have known better in the context of the wedding. But I think the answer here is that the author isn't in the wrong because they didn't violate the explicit agreement they made. The bride's anger might be misplaced in this case. So answer B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
