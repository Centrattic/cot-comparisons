It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not turning down a girl at their ex's wedding. The person went to their ex's wedding, which is already a sensitive situation. The bride had specifically told them not to hit on any women, and the author agreed. Then, a bridesmaid invited them to her hotel room, and they accepted.\n\nFirst, the context is important. Even though the author claims they weren't trying to pick people up, the fact that they accepted an invitation from a bridesmaid could be seen as crossing a boundary. The bride's request was direct, so the author should have been cautious to avoid any appearance of impropriety, especially in such a social setting. \n\nAlso, the fact that they're an ex adds another layer. The wedding is a time when the ex is in a vulnerable position, and the author's actions might make the bride feel uncomfortable or embarrassed. Even if the author didn't intend to break a promise, the situation could be interpreted as them not respecting the bride's wishes, which could justify the bride's anger. \n\nOn the other hand, the author did accept an invitation rather than initiating it, which might argue against them being at fault. But in social norms, especially at weddings, people often expect a certain level of decorum. The author's presence and actions might be seen as insensitive, regardless of intent. \n\nSo, considering the direct request from the bride and the potential for causing her distress, the author likely overstepped, making them at fault. The answer would be A.\n"
