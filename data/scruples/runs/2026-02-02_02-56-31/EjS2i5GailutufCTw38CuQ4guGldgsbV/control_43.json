It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about not turning down a girl's invitation to her hotel room at an ex's wedding.\n\nFirst, the key points: The author's ex got married, and he was invited because he's close to the groom. The bride told him beforehand not to hit on any women. He didn't actively hit on anyone but was just having fun. Then, a bridesmaid invited him to her hotel room, and he accepted. Now the bride is upset.\n\nThe author argues that he didn't break the promise since the girl approached him. He also thinks it's strange that the bride is upset. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nI need to consider social norms and the context. The bride made a direct request, which he thought was odd but agreed to. However, by accepting the invitation to the hotel room, he might have violated that request. Even if he didn't initiate the approach, going to the hotel room could be seen as inappropriate, especially at a wedding. Weddings are family events, and such actions might make the bride uncomfortable, especially since it's her wedding. The author's defense is that he didn't actively hit on anyone, but the situation could still be considered disrespectful or inconsiderate towards the bride's wishes and the event's context. \n\nAlso, the fact that he was at the ex's wedding might add to the sensitivity. Even if he's not in a relationship anymore, certain boundaries are expected. The bride's reaction could be about maintaining her event's atmosphere and respecting her family's feelings. So, even if the girl approached him, accepting the invitation might cross a line, making the author in the wrong.\n"
