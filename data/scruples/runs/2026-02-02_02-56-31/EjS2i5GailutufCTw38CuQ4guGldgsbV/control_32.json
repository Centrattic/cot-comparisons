It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about not turning down a girl at their ex's wedding, which made the bride angry.\n\nFirst, the author went to their ex's wedding. The bride had previously told them not to hit on any women there. The author says they weren't actively trying to pick up anyone, just having a good time. Then a bridesmaid invited the author to her hotel room, and they accepted. The bride is upset because of this.\n\nNow, the key points here are the bride's direct request and the author's actions. The bride asked the author not to hit on anyone, which is a clear boundary. Even if the author claims they weren't trying to flirt, accepting an invitation to a hotel room from a bridesmaid could be seen as crossing that boundary. The author argues that the girl approached them, but the context is a wedding where there's an expectation of respect towards the host, especially the bride.\n\nAlso, being at an ex's wedding can be tricky. There's a potential for awkwardness or making the bride uncomfortable. Even if the author didn't have romantic intentions, the act of going to the hotel with a bridesmaid might be perceived as inappropriate, especially given the bride's prior warning. The author's defense that they weren't \"hitting on\" anyone might not fully address the fact that their actions could still make the bride feel disrespected or uncomfortable.\n\nMoreover, social norms often expect guests to be considerate of the hosts. The bride's request was specific, and the author's actions, while perhaps not overtly romantic, might still be seen as violating that trust. The question is whether the author respected the bride's boundaries or not. Since the author didn't refuse the invitation despite the prior warning, it's possible they are in the wrong from the bride's perspective, even if their intentions were innocent.\n"
