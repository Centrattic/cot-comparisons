It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is whether the person is in the wrong for not turning down a girl at their ex's wedding. Let me break down the details.\n\nFirst, the user went to their ex's wedding. The bride had explicitly told them not to hit on any women at her wedding. The user says they weren't trying to pick up anyone, just having a good time. But then a bridesmaid invited them to her hotel room, and they accepted. Now the bride is upset. The user is asking if they're an asshole for not rejecting the invitation.\n\nHmm. The user's main arguments are that they didn't break the promise because the girl approached them, not the other way around. But the bride's demand was clear: don't hit on any women. The user says they weren't trying to pick people up, but they did accept an invitation to a hotel room. That seems like it could be crossing a line, even if initiated by someone else. \n\nEven if the user wasn't the one approaching, accepting the invitation might still be seen as violating the bride's request. The bride might feel that allowing someone to go to a hotel room with a guest, especially someone connected to the ex, is inappropriate. The user might argue they were just being social, but in a wedding context, certain boundaries are expected. \n\nAlso, the fact that it's the ex's wedding might add to the sensitivity. The bride might be protective of her partner's ex, even if they were just friends. The user's presence could be seen as a potential disruption. \n\nBut then again, weddings are social events where people might mingle. However, the user was specifically told not to hit on anyone, so maybe there's a breach of agreement here. Even if it wasn't their idea, accepting the invitation might still be considered hitting on someone indirectly. \n\nI think the key point is the promise made to the bride. If they agreed not to hit on anyone, then even if someone else approached them, they might still be in the wrong because it's about respecting boundaries set by the bride. So the answer might be A, they are in the wrong.\n"
