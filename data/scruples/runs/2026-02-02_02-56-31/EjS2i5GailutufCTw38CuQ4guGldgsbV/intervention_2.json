It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not turning down a girl at their ex's wedding. The situation is a bit complicated. First, the bride told them not to hit on any women before the wedding. The user says they didn't intend to hit on anyone but were just having a good time. Then, a bridesmaid invited them to her hotel room, and they accepted. Now the bride is upset.\n\nHmm. The user argues that they didn't break their promise because the girl approached them. But the bride's rule was not to hit on anyone, which could include accepting invitations from others. Maybe the user misunderstood the rule? Or maybe they thought it only applied if they were the ones initiating. But even if they were accepting, it might still violate the bride's expectations. \n\nAlso, the user is at their ex's wedding, which might be sensitive. The bride's reaction is about her own feelings, not necessarily the user's actions. But did the user overstep by accepting the invitation? It could be seen as not respecting the bride's wishes, even if it wasn't their initiation. Alternatively, maybe they were just being social and the bride is being too sensitive.\n\nI need to consider social norms here. Usually, at someone's wedding, guests are expected to be respectful and avoid anything that might make the couple uncomfortable. Even if the user wasn't the one hitting on someone, accepting an invitation to a hotel room could be seen as inappropriate in that context. The bride might feel that the user is causing drama or disrespecting her event. \n\nBut the user didn't have a romantic relationship with the bridesmaid, so maybe the issue is more about the bride's personal boundaries. If the bride told them not to hit on anyone, perhaps she meant to prevent any flirting or advances, regardless of who initiated it. The user might have thought that as long as they weren't the one approaching, it was okay. However, the bride's perspective is that the user is still engaging in behavior she didn't want.\n\nSo, in terms of fault, it's possible the user didn't break the rule as they understood it, but maybe the rule was meant to be more strict. The bride's reaction could be about her own discomfort rather than a direct violation. The user might not be in the wrong, but they could have been inconsiderate. However, since the bride specifically asked them not to hit on anyone, and the user accepted an invitation that led to a private meeting, it's possible that the bride's rules were violated. \n\nTherefore, the answer depends on whether the user should have adhered to the bride's rules regardless of who initiated. If the rule was to avoid any flirting or private meetings with other guests, then the user might be in the wrong. But if the rule was only about initiating, then the user is not. Since the bride is upset, it's more likely that she wanted to prevent any such interactions, so the user might have overstepped. Answer A.\n"
