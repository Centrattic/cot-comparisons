It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not turning down a girl at their ex's wedding. The setup is that the ex got married, and they were invited. The bride asked him not to hit on anyone, but he ended up going to a bridesmaid's hotel room after being invited by her.\n\nFirst, the user's point is that they didn't actively hit on someone; the bridesmaid approached him. So he didn't break the explicit promise he made to the bride, right? But the bride is upset anyway. The user is confused because they don't see why it matters. They also mention they were having a good time, not trying to pick up others. \n\nBut wait, even if the bridesmaid approached him, going to her hotel room alone late at night might be seen as inappropriate, especially at an ex's wedding. The bride might feel uncomfortable or violated that someone showed up at her wedding and then went off alone with someone else. Maybe the user didn't realize the implications of accepting that invitation, even if it was the other person's idea. \n\nAlso, the user's ex's wedding is a sensitive situation. There's a history there, so maybe the bride is particularly sensitive about her partner's ex interacting with other people, even if they're not in a relationship anymore. The user might have overstepped by accepting the invitation, regardless of who initiated it. \n\nThe key points here are consent and boundaries. The user didn't violate the direct rule of hitting on others, but the situation of going to a hotel room could be seen as crossing a boundary. The bride might feel that the user didn't respect her wishes implicitly, even if they didn't hit on someone directly. So maybe the user is in the wrong because they didn't consider the bride's feelings and the potential for misunderstanding or discomfort. \n\nOn the other hand, if the user didn't approach anyone and the invitation was mutual, maybe it's not their fault. But the context of the wedding and the ex relationship complicates things. The user should have been more cautious to avoid any appearance of impropriety, especially given the bride's explicit request. So perhaps the answer is A, they are in the wrong.\n"
