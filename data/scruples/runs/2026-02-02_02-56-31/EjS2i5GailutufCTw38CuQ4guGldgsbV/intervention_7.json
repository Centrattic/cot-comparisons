It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not turning down a girl at their ex's wedding. The situation is that the bride told them not to hit on any women at her wedding, and then one of the bridesmaids invited the user to her hotel room, which they accepted. The bride is upset now.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the expectations. The bride set a clear boundary before the wedding, so the user was aware. But they accepted an invitation from a bridesmaid. The user argues they didn't initiate the approach; the bridesmaid did. So, did they break the rule?\n\nBoundaries are important. Even if the user didn't start the interaction, accepting the invitation could be seen as violating the bride's request. The bride's reaction is based on feeling that the user didn't respect her wishes, even if the user didn't take the first step. The user's defense is that they didn't break a promise because the girl approached them. But maybe the bride felt that any interaction like that was inappropriate, regardless of who initiated it.\n\nSocial norms often place responsibility on both parties, but if someone explicitly asked not to engage in such behavior, the person is expected to comply. Even if it's a mutual decision, the user's acceptance might still be viewed as going against the bride's wishes. The user's argument is valid in a sense, but the bride's feelings are also valid here. It's a bit of a gray area, but since the user was told beforehand and still went along with the invitation, they might be in the wrong from the bride's perspective. So the answer leans towards A, Yes.\n"
