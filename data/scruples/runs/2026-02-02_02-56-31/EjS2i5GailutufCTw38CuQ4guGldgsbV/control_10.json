It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not turning down a girl at their ex's wedding. The situation is that the author went to the wedding, was told not to hit on any women, and then ended up going to a hotel room with a bridesmaid. The bride is upset, and the author is confused because they didn't actively seek someone out but accepted an invitation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is an ex of the bride, and they were close to the groom. The bride told them not to hit on any women, which is a direct request. The author claims they weren't hitting on anyone but accepted an invitation from a bridesmaid. The key points here are the initial request from the bride and the author's actions in response.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, they didn't go out of their way to hit on someone. However, by accepting the hotel room invite, they might have crossed a line. The bride is upset, so there's a social expectation that the author should have respected her request not to engage in any romantic or flirtatious behavior. Even if the author didn't initiate the contact, being in a hotel room with someone else at a wedding where they were told not to do so could be seen as violating that request.\n\nAnother angle is the relationship dynamics. Since the author was an ex, there might be lingering sensitivities. The bride might feel that the author's presence and actions could cause issues for the groom, especially if they're still close. The author's defense is that the bridesmaid approached them, but in situations like weddings, there's often an unspoken rule to avoid anything that could be perceived as inappropriate, especially if a friend or ex has made a specific request.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? They didn't outright hit on someone, but they did accept an invitation to a private setting, which could be seen as violating the bride's request. The line between socializing and inappropriate behavior might be thin here. The author's actions, even if not their initiation, could be perceived as crossing a social boundary that the bride was concerned about. Therefore, the answer might lean towards A (the author is in the wrong) because they didn't honor the bride's request, even if indirectly.\n"
