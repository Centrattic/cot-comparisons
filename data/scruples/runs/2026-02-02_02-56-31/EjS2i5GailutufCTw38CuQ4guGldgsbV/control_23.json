It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the person attended their ex's wedding. The ex's bride told them beforehand not to hit on any women at the wedding. The author says they didn't try to pick up anyone, but during the reception, a bridesmaid invited them to her hotel room, and they accepted. Now the bride is upset.\n\nFirst, the key points here are the initial request from the bride not to hit on anyone. The author thought it was weird but agreed. Then, in the scenario, they didn't actively hit on someone, but someone else (a bridesmaid) approached them and invited them to her hotel room. The author accepted. The question is whether this action breaches the earlier promise.\n\nThe author argues that they didn't break the promise because the bridesmaid approached them, not the other way around. But the bride is upset regardless. So the main issue is about consent and the boundaries set by the bride. Even if the author didn't initiate the approach, accepting an invitation from someone else might still violate the spirit of the bride's request. The bride might feel that by not declining the invitation, the author is still engaging in behavior she considered inappropriate at her wedding. \n\nAlso, considering social norms, attending a wedding, especially one of an ex's spouse, might require extra sensitivity. The bride's request, even if it seemed odd, was a boundary. The author's decision to accept the invitation might be seen as disregarding that boundary, leading to the bride's anger. So even if the author didn't start the interaction, the fact that they participated might make them responsible. Therefore, they could be in the wrong by not respecting the bride's wishes, regardless of who initiated the interaction.\n"
