It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're an asshole for not turning down a girl at their ex's wedding. The bride told them beforehand not to hit on anyone, but they were invited by a bridesmaid to her hotel room.\n\nFirst, the user was told not to hit on any women. But they didn't actively approach someone. The bridesmaid approached them. So maybe the user didn't break the direct promise. But the situation is sensitive because it's their ex's wedding, which adds emotional complexity. \n\nThe user is having a good time, not trying to pick people up. The key point is that the invitation came from the bridesmaid, not them. The bride is upset, possibly because of jealousy or feeling disrespected. \n\nBut the user didn't promise not to accept invitations, just not to hit on others. So technically, they didn't break the promise. However, the context of the ex's wedding might make the action seem inappropriate regardless. \n\nIt's a bit of a gray area. If the user had been clear they were there for the ex and family, maybe it's worse. But since they were just at the wedding not to flirt, maybe not. The bride's reaction is part of the problem, but the user's actions might not be entirely wrong. So answer B.\n"
