It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they did something wrong by not turning down a girl at their ex's wedding. The setup is that the ex got married, and the user was invited because they're close with the groom and his family. The bride had explicitly told him not to hit on anyone at her wedding. The user claims they weren't hitting on anyone but were just having a good time. Then a bridesmaid invited him to her hotel room, and he accepted. The bride is upset now.\n\nFirst, the user's main argument is that they didn't break the promise because the girl approached him. But the bride had set a boundary beforehand. Even if he wasn't actively hitting on people, accepting an invitation from a bridesmaid could still be seen as violating that boundary. The bride might feel uncomfortable regardless of who initiated the contact, especially in the context of her wedding where she's already vulnerable. The user's response to the invite might come across as insensitive, even if they didn't mean to break any rules. Also, the fact that the user is at an ex's wedding adds another layer\u2014maybe the bride feels it's inappropriate for him to be there in the first place, but that's not the main issue here. The key point is whether accepting the invite crossed the line set by the bride. Even if he didn't make the first move, being in a position where someone might take advantage of the situation could be seen as inconsiderate. So, the answer might be A (they are in the wrong) because they didn't respect the bride's boundaries, even if the girl initiated the contact. However, if the user genuinely wasn't hitting on anyone and just accepted a random invitation, maybe it's not their fault. But considering the bride's explicit request and her subsequent anger, it's more likely the user should have been more cautious to avoid any misunderstanding. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
