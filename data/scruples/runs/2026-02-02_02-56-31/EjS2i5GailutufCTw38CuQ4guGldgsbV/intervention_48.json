It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not turning down a girl at their ex's wedding. The situation is a bit complex.\n\nFirst, the user was invited to the wedding because they're close to the groom and his family. They were given a direct instruction by the bride not to hit on women there. The user claims they weren't trying to hit on anyone but were just having a good time. Then a bridesmaid invited the user to her hotel room, and they accepted. Now the bride is upset.\n\nSo the key points here are: the user was told not to hit on any women, but they didn't take the initiative. The bridesmaid approached them. The user argues they didn't break the promise because it was the other person who initiated. \n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, even if the user wasn't the one approaching others, accepting an invitation from someone else at the wedding might still be seen as inappropriate, especially since the bride had explicitly asked them not to. The user might have known the bride's feelings on the matter, so even if they weren't the one starting the interaction, they could be seen as violating the trust or boundaries set by the bride. \n\nHowever, some might argue that if the user didn't initiate the contact and was just responding to someone else's invitation, they aren't responsible. But the fact that they were warned beforehand adds another layer. Maybe the user should have been more cautious given the bride's request, regardless of who approached them. \n\nThe user's defense is that they weren't hitting on anyone and didn't break the promise because it was the other person who picked them up. But the bride might still feel that the user's presence in such a situation, especially at her wedding, is problematic, regardless of who initiated it. \n\nIn social norms, even if someone else starts the interaction, accepting it could still be seen as crossing a line, especially in a context where they were explicitly told not to. The user's actions might have caused discomfort or hurt to the bride, even if they didn't intentionally break the rule. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be A (they're in the wrong) because they didn't respect the bride's boundaries even though she had asked them not to engage in such behavior, regardless of who approached whom.\n"
