It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that they went to their ex's wedding. The soon-to-be bride told them not to hit on any women there. The author says they weren't actively trying to pick up anyone, just having a good time. Then a bridesmaid invited them to her hotel room, and they accepted. Now the bride is upset.\n\nFirst, the author's perspective: They think they didn't break the promise because the woman approached them. They argue that they weren't the one initiating, so it's not their fault. But the bride is still mad. The question is whether the author is wrong for not turning down the invite.\n\nLet me break it down. The bride made a direct request, which the author might have agreed to, even if they found it weird. Even if the author didn't make a promise, respecting someone's wishes, especially in a sensitive situation like an ex's wedding, could be important. The key here is consent and respecting boundaries. The author was there as a guest, and the bride might feel responsible for the comfort of her guests. If a guest felt uncomfortable, the author's actions could have caused that.\n\nBut the author says they didn't break any promise because it was the woman who invited them. However, just because someone invites you doesn't mean it's acceptable. The author might still be in a gray area. The problem is whether their actions crossed a line, regardless of who initiated. Even if they weren't hitting on others, accepting an invitation to a hotel room could be seen as inappropriate, especially at an ex's wedding where tensions might already be high.\n\nAnother angle: The author's actions could be perceived as disrespectful to the ex's new spouse. Even if there was no explicit agreement, the implicit understanding of behaving respectfully at a wedding applies. The author might have overstepped, making the bride feel that the ex's partner isn't being respected.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong because they didn't respect the bride's wishes and potentially made the bride uncomfortable, even if it was initiated by another guest. The answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because they didn't uphold the bride's boundaries, which is important in maintaining respect in such situations.\n"
