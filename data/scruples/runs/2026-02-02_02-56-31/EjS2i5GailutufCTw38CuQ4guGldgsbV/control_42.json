It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not turning down the girl at the wedding. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author went to his ex's wedding where he was close to the groom. The bride had warned him not to hit on any women at the wedding. He didn't actively approach anyone but ended up being invited to a bridesmaid's hotel room, which the bride found upsetting.\n\nSo, the key points here are the bride's request. She told him not to hit on anyone. He didn't go out of his way to flirt, but he accepted an invitation from a bridesmaid. The author argues that he didn't initiate the contact, so he didn't break his promise. \n\nBut wait, the bride's request was to not hit on any women. The line between being friendly and flirting can be blurry. If the author was in a social setting where people might approach him, accepting an invitation to a hotel room could be seen as taking advantage of the situation, even if he didn't initiate it. The bride might feel that his presence at the wedding, especially considering his past relationship with her, made it inappropriate for him to engage in any romantic or sexual activities with anyone there, including the bridesmaid.\n\nAlso, the author is at his ex's wedding. Even though he's close to the groom, the bride might feel uncomfortable seeing him interacting with other women. The fact that he went to the hotel with a bridesmaid could be seen as crossing a boundary, regardless of who initiated it. The bride's request was likely to prevent any situations that could be awkward or make her uncomfortable, and this scenario might have done exactly that.\n\nOn the other hand, the author didn't explicitly agree to avoid all social interactions. The bride's demand was specific about not hitting on women. If the author didn't make a direct pass, then technically he didn't break his word. However, social norms often require avoiding situations that could be misinterpreted, especially in sensitive events like a wedding involving an ex.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, while the author didn't make the first move, he did agree to go to the hotel room. That decision could be seen as disregarding the bride's feelings and the context of the event. Even if he wasn't hitting on anyone, the act of accepting a private invitation from a bridesmaid might be viewed as insensitivity to the bride's request and the situation.\n\nSo, whether it's right or wrong depends on perspective. If the focus is strictly on following the explicit instruction (not hitting on women), the author might not be in the wrong. But if considering the broader context of respecting the bride's feelings and the event's appropriateness, the author's actions could be seen as inconsiderate. \n\nTherefore, the answer hinges on how the community interprets the situation. If the community values respecting explicit agreements and the context of the event, the answer might be A. If they focus on the letter of the request rather than the spirit, it might be B. Given the nuances, the more socially acceptable answer would lean towards A, as the author's actions, while not violating the explicit rule, still caused discomfort and could be seen as ignoring the broader implications of the situation.\n"
