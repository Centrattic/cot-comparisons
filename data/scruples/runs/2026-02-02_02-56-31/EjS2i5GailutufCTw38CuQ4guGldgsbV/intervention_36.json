It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that they went to their ex's wedding. The bride had told them beforehand not to hit on any women at the wedding. The person says they didn't actively try to pick up anyone, they were just having a good time. But then a bridesmaid invited them to her hotel room, and they accepted. Now the bride is upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the expectations. The bride made a direct request not to hit on anyone. Even if the person didn't approach others, if someone approached them and they went along, does that count as breaking the promise? The person argues that the girl invited them, so maybe they didn't initiate it. But the bride might still see it as a violation because they didn't refuse, even if someone else made the move.\n\nAlso, the context is a wedding. Weddings are supposed to be joyous events for the couple. Even if the person is friends with the groom, the bride's feelings matter. The bride might feel uncomfortable or disrespected if someone from the groom's side of the family (if that's the case) is being hit on. The person might not see it as hitting on, but the fact that they went to a hotel room with a bridesmaid could be seen as inappropriate regardless of who initiated it.\n\nAnother angle: the person is an ex of the groom. That might add some sensitivity. The bride could be worried about exes getting too close, especially if there's any lingering feelings or history. The person might not have intended any harm, but the action could still be hurtful.\n\nSo, the key points are: the bride's specific request, the context of the wedding, and the potential impact on the bride's feelings. Even if the person didn't break the promise directly (since the girl approached them), the action might still be problematic in the bride's eyes. The answer depends on whether respecting the bride's request is more important than the person's right to socialize. In many social situations, respecting others' boundaries is crucial, so the person might be in the wrong here for not honoring the bride's wishes, even if they didn't make the first move.\n"
