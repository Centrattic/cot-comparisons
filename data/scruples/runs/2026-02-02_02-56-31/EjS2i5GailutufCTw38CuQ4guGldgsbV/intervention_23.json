It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if they're in the wrong for not turning down a girl at their ex's wedding. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The person went to their ex's wedding. The bride had told them beforehand not to hit on any women there. The user says they weren't trying to pick up anyone but were just enjoying the party. Then a bridesmaid invited the user to her hotel room, and they accepted. Now the bride is upset.\n\nThe user's reasoning is that they didn't break the promise because the woman approached them, not the other way around. They don't see why the bride is upset and are asking if they're an asshole for accepting the invitation.\n\nHmm. From a social perspective, even if the user didn't actively approach someone, going to a hotel room with a bridesmaid at an ex's wedding could be seen as crossing a line. Weddings can be emotionally charged, especially when exes are involved. The bride might feel that the user is showing disrespect, either towards her or the event. Even if the invitation was mutual, the context of being at an ex's wedding might make it more sensitive.\n\nAlso, the fact that the bride set a boundary beforehand by telling the user not to hit on anyone. Even though the user says they didn't break the promise because the other person initiated, the outcome is that they ended up in a situation that could be perceived as inappropriate. The bride's feelings are valid here; she might feel her request was ignored because the result was similar to what she wanted to prevent.\n\nBut then, does the user have a point? They weren't trying to hit on anyone, just having fun. If the bridesmaid invited them, it's a mutual decision. But maybe the issue isn't just about the action but also about respecting the bride's feelings and the social context. Even if the user didn't break their specific rule literally, they might have ignored the spirit of it. The bride's reaction could be about the perception rather than the action itself.\n\nSo, considering all that, the user might be in the wrong because they didn't consider how their actions could be perceived, even if they didn't intend to hit on someone. The key is whether they respected the boundaries set by the bride, both in terms of actions and the social norms of attending a wedding with an ex. Even if the invitation was mutual, the context makes it problematic. Therefore, the answer would be A (Yes, they are in the wrong).\n"
