It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me read through the scenario again carefully. \n\nThe person went to their ex's wedding. The ex's bride told them beforehand not to hit on any women at the wedding. The person says they didn't go there to pick people up but were just having fun. Then, a bridesmaid invited them to her hotel room, and they accepted. Now the bride is upset.\n\nFirst, the user is asking if the author is an asshole for not saying no to the girl. Let's break it down. The key points here are the initial agreement. The bride told the author not to hit on any women. The author claims they didn't break the promise because the girl approached them. But the author went to a wedding where they were told not to hit on people. Even if the girl invited them, the situation could still be problematic. \n\nThe bride might be upset because even if the girl initiated, the author accepted the invitation. The author was at an ex's wedding, which could make things awkward. Also, the author is close to the groom, so maybe the bride feels it's inappropriate for the author to be in a hotel room alone with another guest. \n\nThe author argues that they weren't hitting on anyone and that the girl approached them. But the problem is that the author agreed to the bride's condition beforehand. By accepting the invitation, they might have violated that agreement. Even if it wasn't their initiative, the action still led to a situation that the bride found offensive. \n\nSocial norms suggest that at someone else's wedding, especially an ex's, you should be respectful. The groom is close to the author, so maybe the bride is trying to maintain a certain decorum. The author's defense is that they followed the initial rule by not approaching anyone, but accepting an invitation from someone else might still be seen as crossing a line. \n\nIt's possible the author didn't mean any harm, but the bride's perspective is important here. She might feel that the author isn't respecting her boundaries, even if the girl came on to them. Since the author was explicitly told not to hit on women, accepting an invitation that could be seen as leading to intimate situations might still break that promise. \n\nSo, considering the context, the author might be in the wrong because they didn't uphold the agreement they made with the bride, even if the other person initiated the contact. The key is whether the action aligns with the agreement. If the bride's rule was to not engage in any romantic advances, then accepting the invitation could be a violation. Therefore, the answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
