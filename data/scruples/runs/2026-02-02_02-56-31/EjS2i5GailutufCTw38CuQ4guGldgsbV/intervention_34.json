It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not turning down a girl at their ex's wedding. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, the context: They were invited to their ex's wedding, which they were close with the groom and family. The bride told them not to hit on any women, which they found weird but agreed. At the wedding, they were socializing, and a bridesmaid invited them to her hotel room. They accepted, and now the bride is upset.\n\nThe user's reasoning is that they didn't approach the girl; she approached them. So they didn't break their promise. The bride is upset, but they don't see why it's an issue.\n\nHmm. Let's consider the ethics here. Even if the girl initiated the invitation, being at a wedding where the bride made a specific request is important. The bride's direct request was to not hit on anyone. By accepting the invitation, the user might be seen as violating that request, even if they didn't approach her. The bride could feel disrespected or that the user is being insensitive, especially given the context of the ex relationship.\n\nAlso, weddings are about the couple. Even if the user is allowed to attend, their actions might be seen as disruptive. The user's defense is that they didn't break the promise, but maybe the act of accepting a romantic invitation, regardless of who made it, is what's problematic here. The user might not realize that the bride's request was a boundary to respect, and crossing it could be considered rude or inconsiderate.\n\nOn the other hand, if the user wasn't actively hitting on others and the invitation was spontaneous, maybe it's not their fault. But the key point is the bride's direct request. By accepting, they disregarded her wishes, which could be seen as a breach of trust and respect, especially in a sensitive setting like a wedding where emotions are high.\n\nSo, even if the user didn't start the interaction, the fact that they went along might be seen as violating the bride's terms. Therefore, the user might be in the wrong for not respecting the bride's request, leading to answer A.\n"
