It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user went to his ex's wedding where he was told not to hit on any women. He says he wasn't trying to pick anyone up but was just having fun. Then a bridesmaid invited him to her hotel room, and he accepted. The bride is upset now.\n\nSo, the question is whether he's in the wrong. He argues that he didn't initiate the invitation and that he didn't break his promise. But did he even have an agreement that he wouldn't go to someone's hotel room? The bride told him not to hit on women, which he took as a direct instruction. But hitting on someone is different from being invited. If he accepted the invitation, even if it was the other person who approached him, the bride might still see it as him complying with the advances, which could be seen as hitting on her. \n\nAlso, the context is an ex's wedding. The user might be close to the groom, but the bride's feelings need to be respected. Even if he didn't initiate, accepting could be seen as disrespectful to the bride's wishes. The key point is whether the invitation counts as \"hitting on\" as per the bride's definition. The user thought he was following the rule because she approached him, but maybe the bride's rule was to avoid any form of flirting or accepting invitations from others. \n\nIn social situations, respecting the host's wishes is important. The bride's request was direct, so the user's failure to comply\u2014even if it was a mutual invitation\u2014might be seen as disregarding her boundaries. Even if he didn't have a romantic intent, the action could be perceived as undermining the bride's authority in her own event. So, depending on how strict the rule was, the user might be in the wrong for not respecting her boundaries.\n"
