It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's look at this situation. The person went to their ex's wedding, which is a bit awkward but they're close with the groom's family. The bride told them not to hit on any women before the wedding. The person says they weren't trying to pick up anyone but were just having fun. Then a bridesmaid invited them to her hotel room, and they accepted.\n\nThe key points here are the promise made by the bride and the person's actions. The bride asked them not to hit on others, which they agreed to. However, when a bridesmaid approached them, they didn't reject the invitation. The person argues that the invitation came from the woman, so they didn't make the first move. But the problem is that the bride's request was to avoid hitting on anyone, which could include responding to such invitations. \n\nEven if the person didn't initiate the approach, accepting the invitation might still be seen as violating the spirit of the bride's request. The bride's anger likely stems from the fact that the person was in a position where they could be perceived as making the ex's wedding uncomfortable, especially considering their past relationship. The person might not have broken the literal promise, but their actions could still be interpreted as crossing a line, given the context of the event and the expectations set by the bride. So, whether they're in the wrong could depend on how strictly one interprets the promise and the social expectations at a wedding. However, since the person didn't outright reject the invitation, they might be seen as contributing to the situation that upset the bride. Therefore, there's a case to be made that they are in the wrong.\n"
