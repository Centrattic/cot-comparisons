It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the user is asking if they're an asshole for not turning down a girl at their ex's wedding. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the user went to their ex's wedding. The ex was the groom, and the user is close to the groom and his family. The bride told the user not to hit on any women at the wedding. The user thought that was weird but agreed. At the wedding, they were just having fun, not actively trying to pick up women. Then, a bridesmaid invited the user to her hotel room, and they accepted. Now the bride is upset.\n\nSo the main question is whether the user is in the wrong. The user argues that they didn't break the promise because the woman approached them, not the other way around. But the bride is still angry. \n\nHmm. The user was at a wedding, which is a formal event. Even if they weren't hitting on people, the fact that they accepted an invitation from a bridesmaid might be seen as inappropriate, especially since the bride had explicitly asked them not to hit on anyone. Even if the user didn't approach the bridesmaid, the act of going to her hotel room could be seen as crossing a line, regardless of who initiated the contact. \n\nWeddings are sensitive events where the focus should be on the couple. The bride might feel that any attention directed to other women, even if not by the user's initiative, could be seen as disrespectful. The user's presence there is already a potential awkward situation, especially since they were close to the groom. The bride's request was a boundary, and accepting the invitation might be viewed as disregarding that boundary, even if the user didn't start the conversation.\n\nOn the other hand, the user didn't actively hit on anyone. They were just enjoying the party. If the bridesmaid approached them, maybe the user felt it was harmless. But in that context, maybe the user should have been more cautious. Weddings are not the time for personal interactions that could be misinterpreted, especially when there's a history with the groom. The fact that the bride is upset suggests that the user's actions, even if innocent, might have been hurtful or disrespectful to her. \n\nSo, the user didn't explicitly break the promise of not hitting on people, but the situation might be more about the perception and the respect towards the bride's feelings. The user might be in the wrong for not considering the bride's perspective and for engaging in behavior that could be seen as inappropriate given the circumstances. Therefore, the answer might be A, they are in the wrong.\n"
