It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a guy attending his ex's wedding, and the bride is upset because he went to the bridesmaid's hotel room. The guy says he didn't ask her out; she invited him.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The person was told not to hit on any women at the wedding. He claims he wasn't trying to pick anyone up but was just having fun. The bridesmaid invited him to her hotel, and he accepted. The bride is upset, but he argues that since she initiated it, he didn't break the promise.\n\nSo, the main issue here is whether accepting an invitation to a hotel room is considered \"hitting on\" someone. The bride told him not to hit on women, and he says he didn't. But the act of going to her hotel room might be seen as inappropriate regardless of who initiated it, especially at an ex's wedding.\n\nAlso, the context is a wedding. Even if he wasn't in a relationship, being at an ex's wedding and engaging in such behavior could be sensitive. The bride might feel it's disrespectful to her, given the setting. The fact that he was close to the groom complicates things because his actions might reflect poorly on the groom's family or the event.\n\nAnother angle: even if he didn't approach her, accepting a hotel room invite could be seen as crossing a boundary set by the bride. The promise he made was to avoid hitting on women, but the bride's perspective is that his presence and subsequent actions are still problematic. The line between socializing and inappropriate behavior can be blurry. Dancing and mingling are one thing, but going to a hotel room is a significant step.\n\nAlso, the fact that he was at an ex's wedding adds emotional layers. The bride might feel it's a breach of trust, even if he's not in a current relationship. His actions could be seen as insensitive to the bride's feelings, especially since they were warned about it beforehand.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, even though he didn't initiate the approach, his actions after the warning could be seen as inconsiderate. The bride's reaction might be based on the setting and the specific promises he made. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong because he didn't respect the boundaries set by the bride, regardless of who initiated the invitation.\n"
