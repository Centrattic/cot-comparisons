It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The scenario is about a guy going to his ex's wedding where he was told not to hit on any women. Then, a bridesmaid invites him to her hotel room, and he goes. The bride is upset.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author was invited to the ex's wedding, which he's close with the groom. The bride told him not to hit on any women before the wedding. He didn't actively go up to people to pick up, but when a bridesmaid asked him, he went along. Now the bride is angry.\n\nThe user is asking if the author is an asshole for not turning down the invitation. The debate here is whether he violated the agreement with the bride. The author argues that the bride picked him up, so he didn't approach her. But the bride's main issue might be that he went to her hotel room, which could be seen as inappropriate regardless of who initiated it. Also, even if he didn't approach her, accepting the invitation might still be seen as crossing a line, especially at a wedding where such behavior could be sensitive.\n\nAnother angle: the bride made a direct request not to hit on women. By accepting the invitation, he might be seen as disregarding her wishes. Even if he didn't approach her, the action could be perceived as violating her trust or boundaries. Relationships and social norms can be subjective here. Depending on cultural context, what's acceptable varies. But in many cases, being in a private setting with someone else's spouse (even a relative) might be frowned upon, especially if it could lead to gossip or discomfort for the families involved.\n\nAlso, the fact that he was an ex adds another layer. Maybe the bride is concerned about her ex's ex interacting with her wedding party in a private setting. The author's defense is that he didn't break his promise because the woman approached him. But if the bride's rule was to not engage in any romantic or flirtatious behavior, then accepting an invitation to a hotel room might still fall under that, even if he initiated it. \n\nOn the other hand, if the author was just being social and the invitation was a spur-of-the-moment thing, maybe he didn't intend any harm. However, the bride's perspective is also valid. She might feel that by allowing him to go to the hotel room, it's inappropriate and could cause issues for her wedding or her family's perception. \n\nSo, considering all this, whether he's in the wrong depends on the agreed-upon boundaries. Since he was given a clear instruction not to hit on any women and he ended up in a private situation with a bridesmaid, even if initiated by her, it's possible that the bride feels he overstepped. Therefore, the answer might lean towards A (he's in the wrong) because he didn't respect her boundaries, even if he didn't approach her directly. The key here is that the bride's feelings matter in this situation, and he might have breached her trust by not considering how his actions could be perceived.\n"
