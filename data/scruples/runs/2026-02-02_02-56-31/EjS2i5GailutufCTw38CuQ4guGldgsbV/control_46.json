It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not rejecting a girl at their ex's wedding. The scenario is that the author's ex got married, and the author attended the wedding. The bride had told the author beforehand not to hit on any women there. The author was having a good time, and later a bridesmaid invited him to her hotel room, which he agreed to. The bride is now upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author was told not to hit on women, but they didn't explicitly hit on anyone. The bridesmaid approached him, not the other way around. So technically, the author didn't break the promise because he wasn't the one initiating. That could be a point in his favor.\n\nBut there's the context of attending an ex's wedding, which can be awkward. The author mentions they're close to the groom and his family, so maybe they feel it's acceptable to be there. However, the bride is upset because of the situation, even if the author didn't break her direct rule. There's an implicit expectation that at such events, especially with ex-partners, one should be careful about their actions to avoid discomfort.\n\nThe author's defense is that the invitation came from the bridesmaid. But does that matter? The bride's instruction was to not hit on any women, which the author could argue he didn't do. However, accepting an invitation to a hotel room might still be seen as inappropriate, regardless of who initiated it. It could be perceived as taking advantage of the situation, even if not directly hitting on someone.\n\nAnother angle: the author was at a wedding where they're an ex of the bride's current spouse. There's a potential for misinterpretation or causing discomfort. Even if the author didn't intend to act improperly, their actions might have caused issues. The bride's reaction is based on her feelings of being disrespected or that the author is being inappropriate in that context.\n\nBut the author didn't explicitly break the rule. The bride asked him not to hit on women, and he didn't. The invitation was from the bridesmaid. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong. However, the situation is sensitive. Attending the wedding of an ex's spouse, even if close to the groom, could lead to misunderstandings. The author's actions, while perhaps not violating the explicit rule, might still be seen as inconsiderate.\n\nIn terms of social norms, sometimes it's about perception. The bride might feel that the author was taking advantage of the setup, even if he didn't directly hit on someone. The fact that someone invited him to a hotel room could be seen as a problem, regardless of who initiated. So even if the author followed the rule technically, the action might still be viewed as wrong by others involved.\n\nAlternatively, if the author didn't initiate the contact, maybe he's not at fault. But the key is whether he should have known that accepting such an invitation would be inappropriate. Given that the bride had a rule in place, the author might have been expected to avoid any situations that could lead to that, even if not directly hitting on someone. So maybe he's in the wrong for not being more cautious.\n\nHmm. It's a bit of a gray area. The answer depends on whether the hotel room invitation is considered within the scope of the bride's warning. If the warning was to not proposition anyone, then the author didn't do that. But if the warning was to avoid any behavior that could be seen as inappropriate, then accepting a romantic invite might be in the wrong.\n\nI think the answer is that the author is not in the wrong because he didn't directly break the rule. The bride's instruction was not to hit on women, and the author didn't do that. The bridesmaid's invitation was separate. However, there's a case to be made that he should have been more considerate of the bride's feelings. But technically, he didn't violate the explicit rule. So answer B (No).\n"
