It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for not turning down a girl at their ex's wedding.\n\nFirst, the context: the person went to their ex's wedding. The bride had told them not to hit on any women there. The person claims they weren't hitting on anyone but ended up agreeing to go to a bridesmaid's hotel room. The bride is upset, and the person is wondering if they're an asshole for not rejecting the approach.\n\nSo, the key points here are the initial warning from the bride, the person's actions, and the resulting fallout. The person argues that they didn't initiate the situation and that they were just having a good time. They also mention that the bridesmaid approached them, not the other way around.\n\nBut let's think about social norms and expectations. Even if the person didn't actively seek to hit on someone, accepting an invitation to a hotel room from someone else at an ex's wedding could be seen as inconsiderate. The bride made it clear that the person shouldn't be hitting on others, so by agreeing to go to the hotel room, they might be inadvertently violating that boundary, even if they didn't start it. \n\nEven if the person wasn't the one approaching, the situation could still be perceived as crossing a line, especially in the context of a wedding where such behavior is generally frowned upon. The bride might feel that the person's presence and acceptance of the invitation could be hurtful or disrespectful, regardless of who initiated it. \n\nAlso, the person's defense that they weren't breaking their promise because the other person approached them might not fully address the bride's feelings. The fact remains that they went along with the invitation, which could be seen as contributing to the problem. \n\nSo, considering the social context, the initial warning, and the potential impact on the bride's feelings, the person might be at fault for not turning down the invitation, even if they weren't the one who initiated it. Therefore, they could be seen as in the wrong.\n"
