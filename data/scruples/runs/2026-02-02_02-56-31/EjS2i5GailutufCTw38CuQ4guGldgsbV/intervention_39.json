It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for not turning down a girl at their ex's wedding. The bride had told them not to hit on any women there. They went to the wedding, had a good time, and when a bridesmaid invited them to her hotel room, they accepted. Now the bride is upset.\n\nFirst, the key points: The ex's wedding, the bride's direct instruction not to hit on women, and the fact that the bridesmaid initiated the invitation. The person argues that since the woman approached them, they didn't violate the promise. But the bride is still upset.\n\nSo, the question is whether the person is in the wrong. The answer could depend on how one interprets the initial request. The bride said not to hit on any women, which implies not initiating attention. If someone else (like the bridesmaid) initiates, maybe they're not breaking the rule. But the person might have known the bride's feelings and still accepted the invitation, which could be seen as insensitive. Even if they didn't hit on anyone, accepting the invitation might have crossed a line, especially if the bride felt it was inappropriate regardless of who initiated. The person's actions might have caused unnecessary hurt, even if they didn't break the explicit rule. So maybe the answer is A (in the wrong) because they failed to consider the bride's feelings and the nature of the event, even if the action wasn't hitting on someone directly. Alternatively, B (not in the wrong) if the bride's demand was too broad and the person followed the letter but not the spirit of the request. It's a bit of a gray area. The person's intent was to have fun, but maybe they should have been more careful to avoid any situation that could upset the bride, even if it was initiated by someone else.\n"
