It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is an asshole for not turning down a girl at their ex's wedding.\n\nFirst, the author's ex got married, and they were invited because they're close with the groom and his family. The bride told the author not to hit on any women at the wedding. The author says they weren't actively trying to pick people up, just having a good time. Then a bridesmaid invited the author to her hotel room, and they accepted. The bride is upset about this.\n\nNow, the key points here: The bride made a direct request not to hit on women. The author claims they didn't make a promise but were just following her direction. However, the author didn't reject the invitation from the bridesmaid. The user is questioning if that makes them an asshole.\n\nThe bride's request was likely to protect her own feelings and the event's atmosphere. Even if the author wasn't hitting on others, accepting an invitation from someone else could still be seen as violating the spirit of the request. The author didn't break a promise per se, but they didn't respect the boundary the bride set. The bride might feel that by not saying no to the bridesmaid, the author still engaged in behavior she found offensive.\n\nSo, the question is whether respecting the bride's request by not engaging in any romantic advances was breached. The author didn't hit on others, but the one instance with the bridesmaid might be enough to make the bride upset. The author's reasoning that it was the girl who approached him could be valid from his perspective, but the bride's feelings are still valid. The author could be seen as not fully respecting her request, hence being in the wrong. Alternatively, if the author wasn't actively pursuing, maybe not. But since the bride is upset, it's a social faux pas that could be considered wrong. \n\nI think the answer is A (yes, the author is in the wrong) because even though the author didn't ask for the invitation, accepting it goes against the bride's wishes and could be seen as disrespectful, regardless of the method. The bride's feelings matter here, and not honoring her explicit request might make the author an asshole in this scenario.\n"
