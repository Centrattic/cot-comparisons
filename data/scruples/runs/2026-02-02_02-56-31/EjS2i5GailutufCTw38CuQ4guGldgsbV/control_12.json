It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a wedding where the author is an ex attending their ex's wedding. The bride told him not to hit on women, but he ended up going to a hotel room with a bridesmaid. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The bride had a direct request not to hit on any women, which he agreed to. However, he claims he wasn't hitting on anyone, just having a good time. The bridesmaid invited him to her hotel room, and he accepted. Now the bride is upset.\n\nI should think about social norms and expectations. At a wedding, especially involving an ex, there's an expectation to be respectful. Even if the invitation came from the bridesmaid, accepting it could still be seen as taking advantage of the situation. The bride's request was to avoid hitting on women, so the author's action, though initiated by the bridesmaid, might still violate that agreement.\n\nAlso, the fact that the author is an ex adds complexity. There might be lingering feelings or past issues that make the bride sensitive. The author might not have intended to break the promise, but the outcome still upset the bride. \n\nAnother angle is consent and boundaries. The bride set a boundary, so even if others cross it, the author's acceptance could be seen as disregarding her wishes. The author might argue he wasn't the one initiating, but the responsibility could still lie with him to respect her rules.\n\nConsidering all this, the answer might lean towards A (the author is in the wrong) because he agreed to the bride's request and then went along with a situation that could be perceived as violating that agreement, even if the other person initiated it. The bride's feelings matter here, and the author's actions, regardless of intent, caused her distress.\n"
