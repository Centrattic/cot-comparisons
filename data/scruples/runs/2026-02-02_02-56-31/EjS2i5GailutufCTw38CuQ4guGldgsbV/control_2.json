It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves an ex-wedding where the author was told not to hit on any women but ended up going to a bridesmaid's hotel room. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author was asked by the bride not to hit on women at her wedding. The author claims they weren't trying to pick up anyone, just having fun. The bridesmaid invited them to her hotel room, and the author accepted. The bride is upset, but the author argues they didn't initiate the contact.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. The bride set a boundary, and the author's actions might have crossed that. Even if the author didn't approach the bridesmaid, accepting the invitation could still be seen as violating the earlier agreement. The author didn't explicitly ask for the number or make a move, but the situation could be perceived as using the wedding to flirt or hook up. \n\nThe author's defense is that they didn't break the promise because the invitation came from the bridesmaid. However, the initial agreement was not to hit on any women. If the author agreed to that, then accepting an invitation to a hotel room could still be within the scope of that agreement, depending on the interpretation. The bride might see it as the author being in a compromising situation, which could cause her discomfort or embarrassment. \n\nAnother angle is the context of the wedding. The author is friends with the groom and family, so perhaps the bride's overreaction is a factor. But from the bride's perspective, it's her wedding, and she might feel entitled to set boundaries for her guests. The author's actions might have disregarded her wishes, leading to her being upset. \n\nAlso, the author mentions drinking. If they were under the influence, maybe they were more impulsive, but that doesn't necessarily absolve them of responsibility. The key is whether the action violated the agreed-upon boundary. \n\nIn terms of social norms, attending a wedding where you were told not to flirt, and then accepting an invitation to a hotel room, could be seen as crossing a line. Even if it was consensual between the author and the bridesmaid, the bride's feelings and the setting of the wedding might make it inappropriate. \n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author might be in the wrong because they didn't respect the bride's direct request, even if they didn't initiate the contact. The situation could be seen as using the wedding as a setup for a romantic encounter, which the bride might find offensive.\n"
