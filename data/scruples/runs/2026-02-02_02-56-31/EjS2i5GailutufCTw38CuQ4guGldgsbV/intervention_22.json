It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking if they're an asshole for not turning down a girl at their ex's wedding. The key points here are the context and the specific actions taken.\n\nFirst, the user mentions they were invited to the ex's wedding because they're close with the groom and his family. The bride warned them not to hit on anyone, which the user found odd but respected. However, in the end, a bridesmaid invited the user to her hotel room, and they accepted. The bride is upset now, and the user is questioning their actions.\n\nI need to consider cultural norms and expectations. Weddings are generally not the place for such behavior, even if there's no current relationship. The user was asked not to hit on anyone, which they agreed to. But the bridesmaid approached them, not the other way around. The user didn't actively seek someone out, so maybe they didn't break the specific agreement.\n\nHowever, there's a nuance here. The user was at their ex's wedding, which might be a sensitive situation. Even if they didn't hit on someone, accepting a hotel room invitation could be seen as inappropriate regardless of who initiated it. The bride's anger might stem from protecting her wedding's sanctity and her own comfort.\n\nThe user argues they didn't break the promise because the woman approached them. But the promise was to not hit on anyone, not necessarily to avoid all such invitations. If the user was open to accepting, that could be a breach of the spirit of the agreement, even if the action wasn't explicitly stated.\n\nAlso, social expectations around weddings are strong. People generally don't expect to be approached romantically or sexually at a wedding, especially the groom's ex's wedding. The user's presence and actions might have made the bride uncomfortable, even if there was no direct violation of the stated rule.\n\nIn conclusion, while the user didn't actively seek someone out, accepting the invitation could still be seen as crossing a social line, making them complicit in a way that's offensive to the bride. So the answer leans towards A (Yes, in the wrong), but with some nuances about the specific circumstances.\n"
