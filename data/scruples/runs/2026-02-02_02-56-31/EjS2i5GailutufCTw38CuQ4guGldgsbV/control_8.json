It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" (AITA) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author attending a wedding where the bride (his ex's new wife) told him not to hit on any women. The author claims he wasn't trying to hit on anyone, but a bridesmaid invited him to her hotel room, and he accepted. The bride is upset, and the author is confused because he didn't actively pursue someone.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the social norms and expectations at a wedding. Weddings are family events, and even if the author is close to the groom, there might be unspoken rules about behavior. The bride made a direct request not to hit on any women, which the author agreed to, even if he thought it was weird. By accepting the bridesmaid's invitation, he might have violated that agreement, even if he wasn't the one initiating the attention. The key point is that he didn't refuse the invitation, which could be seen as agreeing to the interaction, thus going against the bride's request.\n\nAlso, the author mentions he was having a good time, drinking, and dancing. While that's fine, the fact that he ended up in a hotel room with a bridesmaid might be crossing a line, especially since the bride is upset. The author might be in the wrong because he didn't respect the bride's boundaries, even if he didn't start the interaction. The bride's request was clear, and the author's acceptance of the invitation could be seen as inconsiderate towards her feelings. \n\nAnother angle is the potential for causing discomfort or awkwardness for the groom and the bride. Even if the author didn't have bad intentions, the situation could be embarrassing for the groom's family. The author should have considered the bride's feelings and the social implications. So, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because he didn't uphold his promise, even if passively.\n"
