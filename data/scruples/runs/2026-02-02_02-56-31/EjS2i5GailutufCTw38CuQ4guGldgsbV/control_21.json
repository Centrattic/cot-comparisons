It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author's ex got married, and they were invited. Before the wedding, the bride told the author not to hit on any women there. The author says they weren't trying to pick anyone up but ended up going to a hotel room with a bridesmaid. Now the bride is upset.\n\nFirst, the author didn't promise not to be approached by others, just that they wouldn't hit on people. The bridesmaid approached them, so maybe the author isn't at fault for accepting the invitation. But maybe the bride feels that being in a hotel room with someone else, even if not initiated by the author, is still inappropriate given it's an ex's wedding. Also, the author was warned beforehand, so maybe they should have been more cautious even if they weren't actively trying to hit on someone. The key here is whether the author's actions crossed the line despite not making the first move. It's a bit of a gray area, but since the bride specifically asked them not to hit on anyone, and the situation led to a private meeting, the author might be seen as not respecting the bride's wishes, even if they didn't initiate the contact. So, maybe the author is in the wrong for not avoiding the situation entirely.\n"
