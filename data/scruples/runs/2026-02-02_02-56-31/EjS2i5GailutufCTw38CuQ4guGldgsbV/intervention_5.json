It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not turning down a girl at their ex's wedding. The situation is a bit complicated.\n\nFirst, the user's ex got married, and they were invited because they're close with the groom and his family. The bride told them not to hit on any women at her wedding. The user says they were just having a good time, not actively trying to pick up anyone. Then a bridesmaid invited them to her hotel room, and they accepted. Now the bride is upset.\n\nSo the main points are: the bride's demand not to hit on anyone, the user's actions, and whether accepting the invitation was wrong. The user argues that they didn't break the promise because the girl approached them. But the bride is upset, so maybe there's an unspoken social rule here.\n\nIn social situations, especially at weddings, people often expect others to behave respectfully towards the couple. Even if the user wasn't actively hitting on someone, being invited to a hotel room by a bridesmaid might be seen as inappropriate, especially considering the bride's explicit request. The user might not have intended to disrespect the couple, but their actions could still cause offense. The key here is whether the user respected the bride's boundaries. Even if the invitation came from someone else, being in that situation might still be seen as crossing a line. So, maybe the answer is A, they're in the wrong because they didn't respect the bride's wishes, even if indirectly. Alternatively, if the user didn't approach the bridesmaid, maybe B. But I think the fact that the bride was clear about not hitting on anyone and the user ended up in a private setting with a bridesmaid could still be seen as violating that boundary. So, A.\n"
