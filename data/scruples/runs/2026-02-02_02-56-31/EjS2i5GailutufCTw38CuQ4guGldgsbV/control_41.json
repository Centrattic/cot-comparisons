It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for not turning down a girl at their ex's wedding. Let me go through the details step by step.\n\nFirst, the author attended their ex's wedding. They were close friends with the groom and his family, so the invitation makes sense. The bride had told them beforehand not to hit on any women at the wedding. The author thought that was a strange demand but agreed. At the reception, they were just mingling and having a good time, not actively trying to pick people up. Then, a bridesmaid invited the author to her hotel room, and they accepted. Now, the bride is upset, and the author is wondering if they're an asshole for not rejecting the invitation.\n\nThe key points here are the promise the author made to the bride and their actions. The bride specifically asked them not to hit on anyone. The author claims they weren't hitting on anyone but were approached by the bridesmaid. The question is whether accepting the invitation violates the promise. \n\nIf the author didn't initiate the contact and was approached by someone else, maybe they didn't break the promise. However, the bride might still be upset because even if they didn't start it, being in the hotel room with another woman at the wedding could be seen as inappropriate, especially with the ex-wife. The author's defense is that they didn't approach the bridesmaid, but the act of going to the hotel room might still be problematic regardless of who made the initial move.\n\nAnother angle is the social norms around weddings. Even if the author didn't break their direct promise, being in a hotel room with someone else's bridesmaid could be seen as crossing a line, especially since the author is an ex. The bride might feel that the author is disrespecting her or the wedding's sanctity. \n\nBut then again, if the author was just being social and accepted an invitation without initiating it, maybe they're not at fault. It's a bit of a gray area. The author might not have intended to break the promise, but the bride's feelings are valid, and the situation could be seen as insensitive. \n\nI think the main issue is whether the author's actions, regardless of intent, caused harm. The bride is upset, and the author might be in the wrong because they didn't consider the bride's perspective enough. Even if they didn't start it, the situation could be seen as inconsiderate. So perhaps the answer is A (they are in the wrong). But there's a counterargument that they didn't break the promise. Hmm.\n"
