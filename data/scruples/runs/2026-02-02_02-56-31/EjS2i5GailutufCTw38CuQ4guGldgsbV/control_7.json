It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that they went to an ex's wedding, were told not to hit on women there, and ended up going to a bridesmaid's hotel room. The bride is upset about it.\n\nFirst, the ex-wife told the author not to hit on anyone. The author says they weren't trying to pick people up, just having a good time. Then, a bridesmaid invited them to her hotel room, and they accepted. Now the bride is angry. \n\nThe key points here are whether the author broke the agreement not to hit on people, and if that's a valid reason for the bride to be upset. The author argues that the woman approached them, so they didn't initiate it. But the bride's demand was to not hit on anyone, which could include any romantic or sexual activity, even if invited by someone else. \n\nAlso, being at an ex's wedding is tricky. Even if the author isn't in a relationship now, the wedding is a sensitive event. The bride might feel that any attention from an ex's partner could be inappropriate, especially if it leads to something else. The author might not have intended to break the promise, but by accepting the invitation, they might have crossed a line the bride didn't expect. \n\nAnother angle: the author was warned beforehand. They chose to attend the wedding, so they knew the bride's expectations. Accepting the hotel room invitation could be seen as violating that trust, regardless of who initiated it. The bride's anger might stem from the breach of the agreement, not necessarily the action itself. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If they agreed not to hit on anyone, then going to a hotel room with someone else could be considered hitting on them, regardless of who extended the invitation. The intent versus the action matters here. The bride might see it as a direct violation, making the author responsible.\n"
