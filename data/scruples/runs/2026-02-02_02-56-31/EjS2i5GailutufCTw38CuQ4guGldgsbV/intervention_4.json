It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not turning down a girl at their ex's wedding. The bride told them not to hit on anyone, and then later the user went to a bridesmaid's hotel room. The user says they didn't initiate the contact, but the bride is upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. They were at their ex's wedding, which is a sensitive setting. Even though they're not dating anymore, the ex is marrying someone else, so the social etiquette might be different. The bride asked them not to hit on any women, which is a direct request. The user claims they weren't trying to pick people up, just enjoying themselves. However, when a bridesmaid approached them, they went to her hotel room. \n\nEven if the user didn't initiate the contact, the fact that they went to her hotel room could be seen as participating in something that the bride found inappropriate. The bride's concern might be about the reputation of her wedding and feeling that someone is treating the event as a place for their own romantic pursuits. The user didn't violate the direct rule of hitting on others, but perhaps the situation crossed a line that the bride didn't define clearly. \n\nAlso, the user's ex is the groom, so there might be existing tensions. The bride's reaction could be more about control and setting boundaries in her event. The user might not have realized the sensitivity of the situation. Even if they didn't break any explicit rule, the implicit social norms at a wedding might consider engaging in such behavior as inappropriate, regardless of who initiated it. \n\nSo, while the user didn't technically break the rule, their actions could still be offensive to the bride because they went to the hotel room. The key point is whether the action was respectful to the bride's wishes and the context of the wedding. If the bride felt uncomfortable, the user's responsibility is to respect her feelings, even if they didn't think they did anything wrong. Therefore, the user might be in the wrong for not considering the bride's perspective and the appropriateness of their actions in that setting.\n"
