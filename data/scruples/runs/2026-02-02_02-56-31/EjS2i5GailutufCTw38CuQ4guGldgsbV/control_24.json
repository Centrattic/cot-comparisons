It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a guy attending his ex's wedding and not turning down a girl who invited him to her hotel room. The bride is upset, and the author is asking if he's an asshole for not rejecting her.\n\nFirst, the bride told him not to hit on any women at her wedding. He thought that was weird, but he agreed. Now, at the wedding, he's just having a good time, not actively trying to pick up anyone. The key point is that the bridesmaid invited him to her hotel room. The author didn't approach her; she approached him. \n\nSo the main question is whether agreeing to go to her hotel room, even if not initiated by him, is a problem. The bride is upset because he didn't say no. But the author argues that he didn't break the promise because she approached him. \n\nBut maybe the issue is about respecting the bride's wishes. Even if he didn't initiate the interaction, accepting the invitation could still be seen as hitting on her or being inappropriate at her wedding. The bride might feel that any kind of romantic or sexual activity at the wedding, regardless of who initiated it, is disrespectful. \n\nAlso, considering the context: it's an ex's wedding, and the author is close to the groom. The bride's family might be extra sensitive about how ex-partners behave at the wedding. Even if the author had no intention of actually going to the hotel room, just accepting the invitation could cause embarrassment or discomfort for the bride and her family.\n\nAnother angle: the author was in a committed relationship (ex) and maybe the bride felt he shouldn't be showing interest in others at all. However, since they're no longer together, his actions might be his own, but given the direct instruction from the bride, he agreed to not hit on anyone. So, even if the invitation came from someone else, by accepting, he might have violated the bride's expectations.\n\nAlso, the fact that he was drinking could be a factor. If he was under the influence, it might affect his judgment, but that doesn't excuse the behavior. The bride's main point is about him not saying no, so the problem is in his action of accepting the invitation despite her prior request.\n\nSo, weighing all these factors, the author might be in the wrong because he accepted the invitation, which the bride found offensive. Even if he didn't initiate it, honoring the bride's request to not engage in such behavior would be respectful. Therefore, the answer is likely A.\n"
