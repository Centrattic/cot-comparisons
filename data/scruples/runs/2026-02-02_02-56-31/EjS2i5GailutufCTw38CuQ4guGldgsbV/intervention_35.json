It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not turning down a girl at their ex's wedding. The bride told him not to hit on women, but he didn't actually approach anyone. A bridesmaid invited him to her hotel room, and he accepted. The bride is upset now.\n\nFirst, the main points: The user was at his ex's wedding, which he's close with the groom. The bride asked him not to hit on anyone. He wasn't hitting on anyone but accepted an invitation from a bridesmaid. The bride is mad. The user's argument is that he didn't break the promise because she approached him.\n\nSo, the question is whether he's in the wrong. The possible angles here are consent, respect for the bride's request, and social norms. Even if he didn't initiate, accepting the invitation might still upset her. Maybe she felt uncomfortable or that it's inappropriate. The user's defense is that he didn't approach her, but the bride might still be upset regardless of who started the interaction.\n\nBut the user didn't explicitly break the promise of not hitting on women. He was approached, so maybe he's not at fault. However, some might argue that he should have turned down the invitation to avoid making the bride uncomfortable. But others might say it's his personal choice unless there was an explicit agreement to avoid any interactions.\n\nThe key here is whether the user's actions violated the bride's boundaries. If the invitation to the hotel room made the bride upset, even if the user didn't approach the girl, he might be seen as contributing to the situation. On the other hand, if the user was respectful and didn't solicit attention, maybe he's not in the wrong. It's a bit ambiguous, but the fact that he accepted the invitation could be seen as crossing a line, especially in the context of a wedding where such behavior might be frowned upon. Maybe the answer depends on cultural norms or the specific expectations. The user might not be in the wrong if he didn't initiate, but it's possible he should have considered the bride's feelings more. Hmm.\n"
