It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the guy is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that he went to his ex's wedding. The bride had told him beforehand not to hit on any women there. He went to the wedding, had a good time, and ended up going to a bridesmaid's hotel room. Now the bride is upset.\n\nFirst, the user is asking if he's in the wrong. The key points here are the bride's request and his actions. She told him not to hit on women, but he didn't explicitly hit on someone. The bridesmaid invited him to her room, and he accepted. He claims he didn't break the promise because she initiated it. \n\nBut wait, even if the bride said he shouldn't hit on anyone, maybe the act of accepting an invitation to a hotel room, regardless of who initiated it, could still be seen as inappropriate. Weddings are sensitive, especially when he's the ex of the groom. The bride might feel uncomfortable seeing her friends or family being pursued by the ex of her husband. \n\nAlso, maybe the issue isn't just about hitting on someone but about being respectful to the bride and her guests. Even if he didn't approach her, going to a hotel room with a bridesmaid could be seen as crossing a line. The fact that he was at his ex's wedding adds another layer of complexity. The bride might feel he's being disrespectful to the groom by being close to other people. \n\nBut he argues that he didn't break the promise because she came to him. However, the bride's request was a general warning, not just about him initiating. Maybe she expected him to avoid any romantic situations entirely. So even if she invited him, accepting might be against her wishes. \n\nOn the other hand, if the invitation was genuine and he accepted without pressure, perhaps it's not his fault. But considering the context\u2014his ex's wedding\u2014it's a delicate situation. The bride might have a right to be upset, especially if it affects her event or relationships. \n\nI think the answer might be A (he's in the wrong) because even if she initiated, the context of the wedding and the bride's prior request should have been respected. It's about being considerate of the bride's feelings and the event's appropriateness.\n"
