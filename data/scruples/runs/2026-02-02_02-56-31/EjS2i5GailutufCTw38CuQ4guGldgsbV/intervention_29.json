It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the person in the scenario is in the wrong. Let me break down the details.\n\nThe user went to their ex's wedding. They were invited because they're close to the groom and his family. The bride told them beforehand not to hit on any women at the wedding. The user claims they weren't trying to hit on anyone but were just having a good time. Then, a bridesmaid invited them to her hotel room, and they accepted. Now the bride is upset. The user argues that they didn't break the promise because the girl approached them, not the other way around.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The user was at their ex's wedding. Even though they're not in a relationship anymore, attending a wedding can be a sensitive situation. The bride specifically asked them not to hit on women, which they agreed to. The user says they weren't actively trying to pick up anyone but were just socializing. However, the fact that a bridesmaid invited them to her hotel room and they accepted might be problematic.\n\nThe key points here are consent and boundaries. The bride set a boundary by telling the user not to hit on anyone. The user might argue they didn't initiate the interaction, but the problem is that even if the bridesmaid invited them, the user's acceptance could still be seen as crossing a line. The bride's request was to avoid hitting on women, not necessarily to avoid any social interaction. However, in the context of a wedding, inviting someone to a hotel room might be considered inappropriate, especially if there's an ex involved.\n\nAlso, the fact that the user was at the wedding of their ex adds another layer. Even if they're not in a relationship anymore, showing up and engaging in potentially romantic situations could be seen as awkward or disrespectful, depending on the circumstances of their breakup. But the user says they were close to the groom and family, so maybe it's not entirely their fault.\n\nAnother angle is the perception of the bride. She's the one who told them not to hit on anyone, and now she's upset. Whether or not the user actually intended to hit on someone, the action of going to the hotel room with a bridesmaid could be perceived as hitting on her, which violates the bride's request. The user might not have broken the letter of the promise (since it was the girl who invited them), but the spirit of the request was to avoid any advances, which might include accepting such an invitation.\n\nAlso, social norms at weddings usually encourage guests to not make romantic moves, especially on other guests. Even if it's not a direct \"hit on,\" being in a private setting could be seen as inappropriate. The user might be in the wrong because they didn't respect the implied boundaries set by the bride, even if they didn't take the initiative. The bride's request was a clear boundary, and the user's actions, while perhaps consensual between them and the bridesmaid, might still be considered disrespectful to the bride and her event.\n\nSo considering all that, the answer could be that the user is in the wrong. They accepted an invitation that could be seen as crossing a social boundary, even if not explicitly initiating it. Therefore, the answer would be A (Yes, they are in the wrong).\n"
