It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a person attending their ex's wedding, where the bride told them not to hit on any women. The author ended up going to a hotel room with a bridesmaid, which made the bride angry.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author was warned by the bride not to hit on anyone. The author claims they weren't actively trying to pick up women but were just having a good time. The bridesmaid approached them, and they went along. Now the bride is upset, and the author is asking if they're an asshole for not turning down the advances.\n\nSo, the main question is: Did the author violate the bride's rules? The bride specifically told them not to hit on any women. The author says they didn't initiate; the bridesmaid did. But the problem is whether accepting someone's invitation counts as \"hitting on\" them. The author might argue they weren't the one approaching, but the bride's perspective is that they didn't refuse the invitation, which could be seen as still engaging in behavior she forbade.\n\nAnother angle: The bride's request was a direct instruction. Even if the author wasn't the one approaching, accepting an invitation to a hotel room could be seen as violating the spirit of that request. The author might not have broken the letter of the rule (they didn't approach anyone), but the action might still upset the bride.\n\nAlso, considering the context of an ex's wedding. The author might not be in a relationship, but being at an ex's wedding and then accepting a hotel room invite could be sensitive. Even if there's no romantic involvement, the bride might feel it's inappropriate regardless.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the bride's rule was not to engage in any romantic interactions, then accepting an invitation to a hotel room would go against that. The author didn't refuse the invitation, which could be seen as complicit in the behavior the bride asked them to avoid. Therefore, the author might be at fault for not respecting the bride's boundaries, even if they didn't initiate the contact. The answer could be A (Yes), because they didn't honor the bride's explicit request by agreeing to go with the bridesmaid.\n"
