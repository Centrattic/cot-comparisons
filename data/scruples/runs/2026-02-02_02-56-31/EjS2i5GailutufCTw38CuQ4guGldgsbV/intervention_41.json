It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not turning down a girl at their ex's wedding. So, first, the context: they went to their ex's wedding, which is a sensitive situation. The soon-to-be bride had told them beforehand not to hit on any women there. The user says they weren't trying to pick people up but were just having fun. Then a bridesmaid invited them to her hotel room, and they accepted. Now the bride is upset.\n\nHmm, the user argues that they didn't break the promise because the girl invited them, not the other way around. But the bride is upset. So the question is whether the user did something wrong by accepting the invitation.\n\nFrom the bride's perspective, even if the user didn't actively approach someone, accepting an invitation from a bridesmaid might still be seen as inappropriate. Weddings are about the couple, and guests are expected to be respectful. The bride's request was to not hit on anyone, which the user might have interpreted as not initiating, but the bridesmaid's invitation could be seen as a situation that the user didn't need to engage in. \n\nAlso, considering the user's relationship with the groom and the family, maybe the bride expected more discretion. The user might not have realized that even accepting an invitation could be problematic. But the key point is that the bride feels hurt, even if the user didn't break the specific rule. \n\nSo, while the user didn't explicitly break the rule (since they didn't initiate), their actions might still have caused discomfort. The bride's feelings matter here, and the user might have been too focused on their own enjoyment without considering her perspective. Therefore, there's a case to be made that the user was in the wrong for not considering the bride's feelings, even if they followed the letter of the rule.\n"
