It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The person went to their ex's wedding, which they were close to the groom and family. The bride told them beforehand not to hit on any women, which they thought was odd but agreed to. At the wedding, they were just having fun, not actively trying to pick up anyone. Then a bridesmaid invited them to her hotel room, and they accepted. Now the bride is upset.\n\nFirst, the key points here. The person didn't go up to someone to hit on them; instead, someone approached them. The bride's anger might stem from the context of the wedding, which is a sensitive event with her ex's partner. Even if the person didn't approach, accepting an invitation to a hotel room could be seen as inappropriate, especially at a wedding where such behavior might be considered disrespectful to the newlyweds.\n\nThe fact that the person was at an ex's wedding adds another layer. The bride might feel it's a breach of trust or boundaries, even if there's no current relationship. The person might argue they didn't break the promise since they didn't initiate the interaction. However, the situation could still be viewed as crossing a line, depending on cultural or personal expectations.\n\nIt's also worth considering the bride's perspective. She explicitly asked not to hit on anyone, and even if the person didn't act on it, accepting an invitation could undermine that request. The person might not be in the wrong legally or morally, but socially, it's a gray area. The answer hinges on whether accepting a third party's invitation is considered as hitting on someone, which could vary by context and perceptions.\n"
