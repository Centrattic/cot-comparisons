It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not turning down a girl at their ex's wedding. The key points here are the context of the wedding, the bride's direct request, and the user's actions.\n\nFirst, the user was at their ex's wedding. The bride had explicitly told them not to hit on any women there. The user claims they weren't trying to pick up anyone, just having a good time. However, a bridesmaid invited them to her hotel room, and they accepted. The bride is upset, but the user argues that he didn't initiate the contact and that the bride's anger is misplaced.\n\nNow, considering social norms and expectations. Weddings are sensitive events, especially with ex-partners. The bride had made her expectations clear, so even if the user didn't go out of their way to flirt, accepting an invitation from a bridesmaid could be seen as a breach of that unspoken agreement. The user didn't break the rule of hitting on others because he didn't approach, but by accepting the invitation, he might have crossed a line. \n\nAlso, the bride's perspective is important. She might feel that any interaction with the ex, especially in a romantic context, is a violation. The user's action of going to the hotel room could be seen as participating in behavior she specifically requested to avoid. Even if the user didn't initiate, the act of accepting could be viewed as disregarding her wishes. \n\nSocially, there's an expectation to respect the host's wishes in such events. The user might not be intentionally malicious, but by accepting the invitation, they ignored the bride's explicit request, which could make them at least partially responsible. The answer isn't black and white, but leaning towards the user being in the wrong because they didn't respect the boundaries set by the bride, even if they didn't start the interaction themselves.\n"
