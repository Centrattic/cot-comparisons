It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not turning down a girl at their ex's wedding. The bride told them not to hit on anyone, but a bridesmaid invited them to her hotel room, and they accepted. The user is confused because the bride is upset and they think the bridesmaid approached them.\n\nFirst, the user was at their ex's wedding, which is a sensitive situation. Even though they were close with the groom, they were still at their ex's event. The bride explicitly told them not to hit on anyone, which they agreed to. However, the user didn't actively approach someone; instead, a bridesmaid initiated the invitation. So technically, they didn't break their promise to the bride. But the issue is that accepting the invitation could still be seen as crossing a line, especially in the context of the wedding.\n\nThe user argues they weren't trying to pick people up, just having a good time. But even if the invitation was mutual, going to a hotel room with someone else's family member (the bridesmaid) might be considered inappropriate, especially at a wedding where boundaries are important. The bride's reaction is based on the fact that it happened at her wedding, which is her event, and she might feel her authority or the event's atmosphere was disrespected.\n\nThe user might not be in the wrong if they didn't violate the specific rule about hitting on others, since the invitation was from the other person. But socially, accepting such an invitation in that context could be seen as insensitive or disrespectful to the bride's wishes. The answer might hinge on whether the promise was to avoid any interaction or just initiating it. Since the user didn't start it, they might not be in the wrong, but the situation is tricky. The bride's perspective is valid because she might feel violated regardless of who initiated it. So it's a gray area, but the user might not be the asshole here.\n"
