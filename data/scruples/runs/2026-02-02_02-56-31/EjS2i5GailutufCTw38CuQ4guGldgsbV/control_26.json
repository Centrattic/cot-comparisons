It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a wedding where the author went as a friend of the groom and ex of the bride. The bride told him not to hit on women, but he ended up going to a hotel room with a bridesmaid. The question is whether he's at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the details. The author is at his ex's wedding, which he attended because he's close with the groom and his family. The bride told him beforehand not to flirt with anyone. But during the reception, a bridesmaid invited him to her hotel room, and he accepted. Now the bride is upset. The author argues that he didn't initiate the contact and didn't break his promise.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the bride's request, the author's actions, and the social norms around weddings. The bride made a direct demand, which the author found odd but agreed to. However, he ended up accepting an invitation from a bridesmaid. The main issue is whether accepting an invitation from someone else counts as \"hitting on women,\" as per the bride's rule.\n\nSocially, weddings are events where the couple wants to avoid unwanted attention. Even if the author didn't approach the bridesmaid, accepting her invitation could still be seen as inappropriate because it's a wedding, and such behavior might make the bride uncomfortable. The author might argue that he was just being cordial, but the bride's request was specific, and by attending the wedding, he should have respected her wishes, even if they were strict.\n\nAlso, the fact that he's an ex adds another layer. The bride might feel that his presence is already sensitive, and his actions could be perceived as disrespectful, regardless of whether he initiated the contact. Even if the bridesmaid invited him, being in a private setting like a hotel room could be seen as crossing a line, especially in the context of a wedding.\n\nOn the other hand, the author didn't explicitly flirt or hit on the women. He was just socializing and accepted an invitation. But the problem is that the bride's rules were about not hitting on anyone, and accepting an invitation to a hotel room might be considered beyond just socializing. The line between friendly interaction and something more personal is blurry here.\n\nSo, considering the bride's request and the social context of a wedding, the author's actions might be seen as disregarding her wishes. Even if he didn't break the exact wording of the promise, the spirit of it was to avoid any romantic or flirtatious behavior. Accepting an invitation to a hotel room could be interpreted as violating that spirit. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong because he didn't take the bride's request seriously, leading to her upset.\n"
