It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit-style post is in the wrong for not turning down a girl at their ex's wedding. The situation is that they were told by the bride not to hit on any women at her wedding. The person says they didn't go out of their way to pick up women but were having a good time. Then a bridesmaid invited them to her hotel room, and they accepted. The bride is upset now.\n\nFirst, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). Let me break this down.\n\nThe key points are: The author was told by the bride not to hit on any women. They didn't go out of their way to pick up women but were just socializing. A bridesmaid invited them to her hotel, and the author accepted. The bride is upset. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author argues that they didn't initiate the interaction; the bridesmaid did. But does that matter? \n\nIn social contexts, especially at someone else's event like a wedding, there's an expectation to respect the host's wishes. The bride directly told the author not to hit on women. Even if the author didn't approach others, accepting an invitation from someone else could be seen as participating in behavior that the bride finds inappropriate. \n\nThe author's defense is that they weren't actively seeking to hit on others, but they still went to the hotel with the bridesmaid. That might be seen as crossing a line, regardless of initiation. The bride might feel uncomfortable or betrayed, especially as the event is her wedding. \n\nAlso, the author is the ex of the groom. That relationship could add complexity. Even if the author is close to the groom, being at the wedding as an ex might mean they need to be more careful. The bride's request is about maintaining her comfort and setting boundaries for her event.\n\nAnother angle: The author was told not to hit on women. The fact that a bridesmaid approached them doesn't negate the previous instruction. The author could have declined the invitation to avoid conflict. \n\nSo, even if the author didn't initiate the interaction, accepting the invitation might still violate the bride's clear instruction. The bride's discomfort is valid, and the author's action could be seen as disregarding her wishes, making them in the wrong. \n\nTherefore, the answer would likely be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
