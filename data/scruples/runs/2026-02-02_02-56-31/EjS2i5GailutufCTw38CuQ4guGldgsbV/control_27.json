It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not turning down a girl at their ex's wedding. The situation involves the author attending a wedding where the ex got married, and the bride had warned him not to hit on any women there. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author was told beforehand not to hit on any women, which they agreed to. However, at the wedding, a bridesmaid invited him to her hotel room, and he went along with it. The bride is upset now, and the author is questioning if they did something wrong.\n\nThe main issue here is whether the author violated the agreement they made with the bride. The bride asked him not to hit on anyone, and the author claims they weren't trying to pick people up, just having fun. The critical detail is that the bridesmaid initiated the invitation. The author didn't approach her; she approached him. So technically, he didn't break the promise because he wasn't \"hitting on\" anyone\u2014it was the other way around.\n\nBut there's also the aspect of attending an ex's wedding and the social norms around that. Even if there's no romantic involvement, attending a wedding can be a sensitive situation. The bride might feel uncomfortable knowing that someone close to the groom is interacting with other people in a way that could be seen as inappropriate, regardless of the initiator. The fact that the author is close with the groom and his family might add pressure, as the bride could be concerned about perceptions or past relationships affecting the event.\n\nHowever, the author's actions were a direct response to an invitation from the bridesmaid. They didn't seek out women to flirt with. The bride's anger might stem from the fact that the interaction happened at all, even if the author didn't initiate it. But the original agreement was about the author not hitting on anyone, not about preventing others from approaching him. \n\nIn terms of social etiquette, it's generally considered respectful to honor the wishes of the host, especially in a sensitive setting like a wedding. If the bride made a direct request, even if it's not legally binding, there's an expectation to respect boundaries. However, the line between social expectations and actual agreement can be blurry here. The author might not have intended to violate any rules, but the outcome caused hurt feelings.\n\nAnother angle is the dynamic of the ex relationship. If the author and the ex had a past relationship, there could be unspoken expectations or sensitivities. The bride might be projecting her own insecurities or the author's past behavior onto this situation. \n\nIn conclusion, while the author didn't explicitly break the agreement by not initiating contact, the situation could still be seen as crossing a boundary the bride set. However, since the interaction was initiated by the bridesmaid and the author didn't seek it out, it's debatable whether they are in the wrong. The answer might hinge on whether the agreement was more about the author's behavior regardless of others' actions. If the agreement was to avoid any romantic interactions regardless of initiation, then the author might be in the wrong. But if it was only about the author approaching others, then they might not be. The key point is the interpretation of the original agreement.\n"
