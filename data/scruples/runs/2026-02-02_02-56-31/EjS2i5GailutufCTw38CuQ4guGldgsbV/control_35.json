It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not turning down a girl at their ex's wedding. The key points here are the context and the promises made.\n\nFirst, the author's ex got married. The author is close with the groom and family, so attending makes sense. The bride told the author before the wedding not to hit on any women. The author thought it was weird but agreed. \n\nAt the wedding, the author is just having a good time, not actively trying to hit on anyone. Then a bridesmaid invites the author to her hotel room, and the author accepts. The bride is upset now. The author is confused because they didn't go looking for someone; the invitation was from the bridesmaid.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether the author broke their promise. The bride's rule was to not hit on women, but the author didn't initiate. The question is whether accepting an invitation from someone else counts as breaking that promise. \n\nSome might argue that even accepting could be seen as leading someone on or being inconsiderate, especially in the context of a wedding. Others might say the author didn't make a move, so it's not their fault. But there's the context of the ex's wedding and the prior agreement with the bride. \n\nThe author's actions could be seen as disrespectful to the bride's request, even if they didn't approach the bridesmaid. The bride might feel that the author is still causing problems, even if passive. Also, the wedding setting is a sensitive place for the ex and bride, so the author's presence and actions might be more scrutinized. \n\nSo, maybe the answer is A (yes, in the wrong) because they didn't honor the bride's request, even if they didn't initiate. But if the author didn't go out of their way to hit on someone, maybe it's B. But the key is the prior agreement. The author was told not to hit on women, and by accepting the invitation, they might have broken that promise, even if not initiating. So the answer could be A.\n"
