It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the person is in the wrong here. So the situation is that they went to their ex's wedding. The bride had told them beforehand not to hit on any women at the wedding. The person didn't actively try to pick up anyone, but when a bridesmaid invited them to her hotel room, they accepted. The bride is upset about this.\n\nFirst, the question is about whether they broke the promise they made to the bride. The key point here is that the bride asked them not to hit on anyone. The person claims they didn't break the promise because the bridesmaid approached them, not the other way around. But does that matter? If the bride's instruction was a general prohibition on hitting on anyone, then accepting an invitation from someone else might still be considered as engaging in that behavior. The line between being friendly and hitting on someone can be blurry, especially at a social event like a wedding.\n\nAlso, the context is an ex's wedding. Even if they're not in a relationship anymore, there might be an expectation of restraint, especially when the bride is making a specific request. The person might argue that they weren't actively pursuing anyone, but the fact that they accepted the invitation could still be seen as violating the bride's wishes. \n\nAnother angle is the perception of the bride. She's the one who made the rule, and she's upset because of what happened. Even if the person didn't intend to cross the line, their actions might have caused her discomfort. The question is whether respecting the bride's request is more important than their own actions. \n\nI think the key factors are: 1) Did they knowingly break a specific request made by the bride? 2) Was there any intention to hit on someone, even if someone else initiated? 3) How does the social context (ex's wedding) affect expectations? \n\nIf the bride explicitly told them not to hit on anyone, then accepting an invitation from someone else at the wedding could be seen as violating that request. The fact that the bridesmaid approached them doesn't negate the action if the overall effect was to engage in behavior the bride wanted to avoid. Even if they didn't initiate the contact, being in a situation where they're going to a hotel room with someone else could be seen as hitting on them. \n\nSo, maybe the person is in the wrong because they didn't adhere to the bride's request, regardless of who initiated the interaction. The bride's feelings and expectations are valid here, and not respecting that could be seen as inconsiderate or disrespectful. Therefore, the answer might be A (they are in the wrong).\n"
