It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not turning down a girl at their ex's wedding. The bride told him not to hit on anyone, but a bridesmaid invited him to her hotel room. He went along.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. He was at his ex's wedding. The bride made a direct request, which he thought was weird. He didn't actively hit on anyone but was just having fun. The bridesmaid approached him, not the other way around.\n\nThe main question is whether he broke the bride's rule. He didn't initiate the interaction; the bridesmaid did. So maybe he didn't violate the agreement. But some might argue that accepting the invitation could still be seen as inappropriate, especially in the context of a wedding where expectations are high.\n\nAlso, the fact that it's a wedding, a formal event, and the bride's specific request adds to the situation. Even if he didn't approach her, accepting an invitation from someone else might still upset the bride. But since the invite was from a bridesmaid, maybe it's not his fault for not rejecting it.\n\nI think the key points are: did he break the promise? The bride said not to hit on any women. If he didn't approach her, and she approached him, then technically he didn't break the promise. However, the bride might still be upset because the situation is awkward. But in terms of right or wrong, he might not be at fault. So the answer is B.\n"
