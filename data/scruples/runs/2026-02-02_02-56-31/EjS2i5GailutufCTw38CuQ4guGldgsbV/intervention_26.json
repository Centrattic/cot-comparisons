It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not turning down a girl at their ex's wedding. The bride told them not to hit on anyone, but he didn't actively approach someone\u2014someone approached him. \n\nFirst, the context: it's an ex's wedding. The user is close to the groom and his family, so attending is understandable. The bride set a direct boundary, which he found odd but agreed to. At the wedding, he was just having a good time, drinking, dancing. As the reception ends, a bridesmaid invites him to her hotel room, and he accepts. The bride is upset now.\n\nSo the key points are: Did he break the promise? He didn't approach anyone; someone initiated. The bride's anger seems misplaced because he followed her rule (he didn't hit on others). But maybe she's upset because he accepted the invitation, regardless of who initiated. \n\nIs he in the wrong? Legally, no. But socially, maybe. Even if he didn't hit on others, accepting an invitation from someone else could still make the bride feel uncomfortable. The fact that he was at an ex's wedding might add to that. The bride's demand was to not hit on anyone, but perhaps she also expected him not to be flirted with, even if it's mutual. \n\nBut the user's position is that he didn't break the promise because it was the other person who approached. If the initial agreement was not to hit on women, but he didn't initiate, technically he didn't break it. However, maybe the bride considered any interaction as violating the spirit of the rule. \n\nSo, the answer depends on whether the rule was strictly about initiating contact or any form of romantic interaction. If it's the former, he's okay. If it's the latter, he might be in the wrong. Since the user didn't break the explicit rule (he didn't hit on others), but accepted an invitation, which the bride might see as violating the spirit, the answer could be B (No), but there's a gray area. The bride's reaction might be over the top, but the user's actions might have been insensitive. Alternatively, maybe not his fault since he followed the explicit rule.\n"
