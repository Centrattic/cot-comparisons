It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not turning down a girl at their ex's wedding. They were told not to hit on anyone, but they didn't initiate; the bridesmaid invited them. Hmm.\n\nFirst, the main point is the bride's request. She told him not to hit on women. So even if it was an ex's wedding, the bride made a direct request. He agreed to not hit on anyone, right? But the girl in question was a bridesmaid and invited him to her hotel. He went along. So the key here is whether he violated the agreement.\n\nHe says he didn't initiate, but by accepting the invitation, is he responsible? The bride is upset because he went there. The user's reasoning is that he didn't break the promise since the girl approached him. But maybe the bride saw any interaction as hitting on. Also, the context is a wedding where he's an ex's guest. Even if they're close to the groom, the bride's feelings matter here.\n\nIs there a standard expectation? If someone is told not to hit on people, even if another person initiates, going along with it could be seen as violating the agreement. Because even if the other person approached, he didn't reject them. The bride's anger might stem from trust issues or wanting the wedding to be focused on the couple, not others. So perhaps he is in the wrong for not respecting her boundaries, even if he didn't start it. So answer A.\n"
