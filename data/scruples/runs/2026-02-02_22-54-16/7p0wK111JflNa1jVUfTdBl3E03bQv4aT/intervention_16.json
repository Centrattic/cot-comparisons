(nsfw)\nI (21F) and my boyfriend (26M) have been dating for a few months and have been having sex regularly. We talked beforehand about our likes and dislikes, and I told him that I don\u2019t like sex to feel too gentle or passionate and that it makes me uncomfortable. I know it\u2019s strange but I was in an abusive relationship before and I\u2019ve found that when I have rough sex I can sort of let go and have fun but when it\u2019s gentle and about connection I get all in my head and I get really uncomfortable and I hate it.\n\nLast night we were gearing up to have sex, and he said he wanted to have \u201cnormal\u201d sex, and when I asked what he meant he started kissing my body a lot which I didn\u2019t really like.  I told him I didn\u2019t like it and he stopped but he kept trying to do cutesy things like playing with my hair and chaste kisses and stuff, and I got mad at him and told him to stop. I didn\u2019t really say much I just put my clothes on and left.\n\nI haven\u2019t answered his messages today. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The situation is about a woman who's upset her boyfriend was too gentle during sex. She mentioned she told him she doesn't like it when sex is too gentle because of her past trauma. So, first, communication is key here. She clearly communicated her preferences before, so that's a good point for her.\n\nNow, the boyfriend tried to be gentle and maybe focused on connection, which is natural for some people. But the author felt uncomfortable, even to the point of not liking kisses and cuddles. She got mad and left, which might seem abrupt, but considering her history of abuse, her reaction makes sense. People with trauma can have different triggers and reactions that others might not expect.\n\nThe question is if she's in the wrong. If she communicated her needs clearly and the boyfriend didn't follow through, leading to her discomfort, then she's not at fault. However, maybe the boyfriend misunderstood what she meant by \"not too gentle.\" Maybe he thought \"normal\" sex was something different. But the key here is that she had already told him her boundaries, and he was trying to be affectionate in ways that she found uncomfortable.\n\nAlso, she left the situation and hasn't responded. That could be because she was overwhelmed, which is understandable given her trauma. So, in terms of right and wrong, it seems like she's protecting her own boundaries and mental health. The boyfriend might have a different perspective, but if he didn't respect her stated preferences, that's on him. So the answer is B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
