(nsfw)\nI (21F) and my boyfriend (26M) have been dating for a few months and have been having sex regularly. We talked beforehand about our likes and dislikes, and I told him that I don\u2019t like sex to feel too gentle or passionate and that it makes me uncomfortable. I know it\u2019s strange but I was in an abusive relationship before and I\u2019ve found that when I have rough sex I can sort of let go and have fun but when it\u2019s gentle and about connection I get all in my head and I get really uncomfortable and I hate it.\n\nLast night we were gearing up to have sex, and he said he wanted to have \u201cnormal\u201d sex, and when I asked what he meant he started kissing my body a lot which I didn\u2019t really like.  I told him I didn\u2019t like it and he stopped but he kept trying to do cutesy things like playing with my hair and chaste kisses and stuff, and I got mad at him and told him to stop. I didn\u2019t really say much I just put my clothes on and left.\n\nI haven\u2019t answered his messages today. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a 21-year-old woman and her 26-year-old boyfriend. They've been dating for a few months and have sex regularly. The woman mentioned she doesn't like when sex is too gentle or passionate because of a previous abusive relationship. She prefers rough sex to feel comfortable.\n\nNow, the boyfriend wanted to have \"normal\" sex, which the woman interpreted as being gentle and cutesy. She told him she didn't like it, he stopped but tried other things like playing with her hair and chaste kisses. She got mad, put her clothes on, and left. She hasn't replied to his messages.\n\nFirst, I need to consider communication. She had already told him her preferences before, so he should have known she doesn't want gentle sex. If he went against that, he's the one being wrong. But maybe she didn't specify all the cutesy stuff like playing with hair and chaste kisses. She told him to stop when he did the body kissing, which she didn't like. Then he kept trying other things. But she hadn't mentioned those things being a problem before, maybe? So perhaps he was trying to be affectionate but not following her explicit instructions.\n\nShe got mad and left, which is a reaction. But she had already communicated her dislikes. If he kept doing things she asked to stop, he's at fault. However, maybe there was a misunderstanding about what \"normal\" sex meant. She thought he meant the gentle/passionate approach, which she doesn't like, but maybe he meant something else. But if he had prior knowledge of her preferences, he should adjust accordingly.\n\nHer previous abusive experience might affect her current needs. She's trying to communicate that she needs different things. If the boyfriend isn't respecting her boundaries after being told, that's his issue. However, if she's not allowing him to express his way, but in this case, she clearly stated her preferences.\n\nSo, the author is not in the wrong because she communicated her boundaries, and when he continued with things she didn't like, she had the right to express her discomfort. The boyfriend might be at fault for not respecting her boundaries after she told him. The answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
