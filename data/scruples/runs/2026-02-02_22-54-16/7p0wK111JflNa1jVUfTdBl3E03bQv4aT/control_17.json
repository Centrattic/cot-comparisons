(nsfw)\nI (21F) and my boyfriend (26M) have been dating for a few months and have been having sex regularly. We talked beforehand about our likes and dislikes, and I told him that I don\u2019t like sex to feel too gentle or passionate and that it makes me uncomfortable. I know it\u2019s strange but I was in an abusive relationship before and I\u2019ve found that when I have rough sex I can sort of let go and have fun but when it\u2019s gentle and about connection I get all in my head and I get really uncomfortable and I hate it.\n\nLast night we were gearing up to have sex, and he said he wanted to have \u201cnormal\u201d sex, and when I asked what he meant he started kissing my body a lot which I didn\u2019t really like.  I told him I didn\u2019t like it and he stopped but he kept trying to do cutesy things like playing with my hair and chaste kisses and stuff, and I got mad at him and told him to stop. I didn\u2019t really say much I just put my clothes on and left.\n\nI haven\u2019t answered his messages today. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author (21F) is in the wrong for getting mad at her boyfriend (26M) for being too gentle during sex. They had previously discussed their preferences, and she told him she didn't like gentle or passionate sex, which made her uncomfortable due to past abuse. The boyfriend tried to be gentle and romantic, but she got upset and left.\n\nFirst, I need to consider communication. The author clearly communicated her boundaries and preferences beforehand. That's a good point in her favor because she's not just suddenly getting angry without any prior discussion. The boyfriend might not have fully understood her needs, but she did set those expectations. \n\nNext, the context of past abuse is important. Trauma can significantly affect someone's comfort levels in intimate situations. Her preference for rough sex as a way to feel in control or safe makes sense in that context. The boyfriend's actions, while well-intentioned, might have triggered uncomfortable feelings she wasn't expecting. \n\nThen, the boyfriend's reaction. When she told him to stop, he did, but continued with other actions. Maybe he didn't realize how much she was uncomfortable. But she did ask him to stop, so continuing even if it's in a different form might be an issue. However, he might have thought he was being considerate, not realizing her boundaries were about any gentle touch.\n\nThe author left and hasn't responded. Her anger is justified because the boyfriend didn't respect her stated boundaries. However, communication post-incident is lacking. She didn't explain her feelings after the fact, which might have helped him understand better. But the initial issue was his actions not aligning with her communicated preferences. \n\nIs she in the wrong? Probably not. She set clear boundaries and expressed discomfort. The boyfriend didn't heed those boundaries properly, leading to her frustration. The problem might be more on his side for not respecting her preferences, but she has a right to be upset. The answer is likely B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
