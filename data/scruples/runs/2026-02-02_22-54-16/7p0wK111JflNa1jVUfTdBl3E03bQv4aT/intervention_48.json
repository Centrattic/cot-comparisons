(nsfw)\nI (21F) and my boyfriend (26M) have been dating for a few months and have been having sex regularly. We talked beforehand about our likes and dislikes, and I told him that I don\u2019t like sex to feel too gentle or passionate and that it makes me uncomfortable. I know it\u2019s strange but I was in an abusive relationship before and I\u2019ve found that when I have rough sex I can sort of let go and have fun but when it\u2019s gentle and about connection I get all in my head and I get really uncomfortable and I hate it.\n\nLast night we were gearing up to have sex, and he said he wanted to have \u201cnormal\u201d sex, and when I asked what he meant he started kissing my body a lot which I didn\u2019t really like.  I told him I didn\u2019t like it and he stopped but he kept trying to do cutesy things like playing with my hair and chaste kisses and stuff, and I got mad at him and told him to stop. I didn\u2019t really say much I just put my clothes on and left.\n\nI haven\u2019t answered his messages today. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person (21F) is in the wrong for getting mad at her boyfriend for being too gentle during sex. She mentioned she's uncomfortable with gentle or passionate sex because of her past abusive relationship and prefers rough sex to let go and have fun. They had discussed their likes and dislikes beforehand, so she communicated her preferences.\n\nFirst, communication is key in relationships, especially regarding intimacy. She clearly told him her boundaries, which is responsible. The boyfriend, on the other hand, might not have respected her boundaries when he switched to gentle actions after knowing her discomfort. But he did stop when she told him, so maybe he tried to adjust. However, she got mad and left, which might be a reaction to his not fully respecting her boundaries or the triggering nature of the situation.\n\nTrauma from an abusive relationship can affect someone's needs and reactions. Her need for rough sex could be a way to feel in control or to dissociate from past trauma. The boyfriend's approach might have inadvertently reminded her of negative experiences, even if he meant it kindly. However, the boyfriend might also feel hurt or confused by her reaction, not understanding why she's uncomfortable with affectionate gestures.\n\nThe question is whether her reaction was justified. Since she communicated her preferences and her trauma, her response is understandable as a self-protective measure. The boyfriend might not have fully grasped the depth of her trauma or how his actions, despite being gentle, could still trigger her. Her getting mad is a reaction to his not respecting her stated boundaries, even if he tried to stop. However, leaving without communication could also be seen as abrupt, but given her emotional state, it might be a way to protect herself.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's important to consider both perspectives. The author isn't in the wrong because she communicated her needs and acted in response to her trauma. The boyfriend might not be in the wrong either if he genuinely tried to adjust but perhaps didn't go far enough. The situation is complex, but the author's reaction is valid given her history. So the answer would be B (No), she's not in the wrong.\n"
