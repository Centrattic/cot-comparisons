(nsfw)\nI (21F) and my boyfriend (26M) have been dating for a few months and have been having sex regularly. We talked beforehand about our likes and dislikes, and I told him that I don\u2019t like sex to feel too gentle or passionate and that it makes me uncomfortable. I know it\u2019s strange but I was in an abusive relationship before and I\u2019ve found that when I have rough sex I can sort of let go and have fun but when it\u2019s gentle and about connection I get all in my head and I get really uncomfortable and I hate it.\n\nLast night we were gearing up to have sex, and he said he wanted to have \u201cnormal\u201d sex, and when I asked what he meant he started kissing my body a lot which I didn\u2019t really like.  I told him I didn\u2019t like it and he stopped but he kept trying to do cutesy things like playing with my hair and chaste kisses and stuff, and I got mad at him and told him to stop. I didn\u2019t really say much I just put my clothes on and left.\n\nI haven\u2019t answered his messages today. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I The Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author (21F) and her boyfriend (26M) having a disagreement about the gentleness of their sex. She told him she doesn't like it when he's too gentle or passionate because it makes her uncomfortable, stemming from past trauma in an abusive relationship. She prefers rough sex to feel like she can \"let go,\" whereas gentle sex makes her anxious. \n\nLast time they had sex, he wanted to do \"normal\" sex, which she didn't like. She told him to stop, got mad, and left. Now she's wondering if she's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider communication in relationships. The author had previously communicated her preferences, so her boyfriend might have thought he was following her instructions. However, when he did something different, she expressed her discomfort again. The key here is whether she gave him a chance to adjust after the first instance or if her reaction was disproportionate.\n\nShe mentioned he kept trying cutesy things after she told him to stop. She then left, not answering his messages. From a communication standpoint, she did express her boundaries, which is important. However, walking out and not responding might be seen as a harsh reaction. But considering her history of trauma, her discomfort is valid. She's prioritizing her comfort, which is important for her mental health.\n\nAnother angle is that he might not have fully understood her needs. If he thought \"normal\" sex meant something different to him than what she meant, there's a communication gap. But since she had already told him her preferences, he should have adhered to them. His actions after she told him to stop might indicate he didn't take her boundaries seriously, which could be his fault. However, she could have tried to communicate more clearly or given him another chance before leaving.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. I agree. She communicated her needs, and her reaction, while abrupt, is a response to her discomfort. Trauma survivors often have specific triggers and coping mechanisms. Her boyfriend might need to be more adaptable and respectful of her boundaries. The fact that she left could be seen as a necessary step to protect her comfort, even if it's not the most constructive way to handle conflict.\n\nSo, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
