(nsfw)\nI (21F) and my boyfriend (26M) have been dating for a few months and have been having sex regularly. We talked beforehand about our likes and dislikes, and I told him that I don\u2019t like sex to feel too gentle or passionate and that it makes me uncomfortable. I know it\u2019s strange but I was in an abusive relationship before and I\u2019ve found that when I have rough sex I can sort of let go and have fun but when it\u2019s gentle and about connection I get all in my head and I get really uncomfortable and I hate it.\n\nLast night we were gearing up to have sex, and he said he wanted to have \u201cnormal\u201d sex, and when I asked what he meant he started kissing my body a lot which I didn\u2019t really like.  I told him I didn\u2019t like it and he stopped but he kept trying to do cutesy things like playing with my hair and chaste kisses and stuff, and I got mad at him and told him to stop. I didn\u2019t really say much I just put my clothes on and left.\n\nI haven\u2019t answered his messages today. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this situation. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for getting mad at her boyfriend for being too gentle during sex. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the key points: The author is 21F, her boyfriend is 26M. They've been dating a few months and have regular sex. They discussed likes and dislikes beforehand. The author specifically mentioned she doesn't like gentle or passionate sex; it makes her uncomfortable. She has a history of an abusive relationship, which affects her comfort with rough sex. In the recent incident, the boyfriend wanted \"normal\" sex, which involved gentle touches like kissing her body, playing with her hair, chaste kisses. She told him she didn't like it, he stopped but kept trying cutesy stuff. She got mad, put on clothes, and left. She hasn't responded to messages.\n\nNow, considering consent and communication. The author communicated her boundaries clearly beforehand. The boyfriend didn't respect those boundaries by continuing with actions she disliked after she told him to stop. Even though he initially stopped, continuing with other cutesy things suggests he didn't fully respect her limits. \n\nHer reaction: she got mad, left, and stopped responding. Is that justified? Well, she had communicated her discomfort, and he continued. Her boundaries were not respected. In a healthy relationship, partners should respect each other's boundaries. If one partner disregards the other's stated preferences, that's a problem.\n\nPossible counterarguments: Maybe the boyfriend thought he was being affectionate and didn't realize it was crossing a boundary. But the author had already told him. If he didn't listen, that's his fault. Also, her getting mad and leaving might be seen as a reaction to not having her needs met, which is valid. The fact that she has a history of abuse adds context\u2014her triggers are legitimate and need to be respected.\n\nAnother point: The boyfriend's definition of \"normal\" might differ from the author's. But since they had discussed preferences, it's his responsibility to honor that. If he went against what was agreed, he's at fault. The author's response was to set a boundary by leaving, which is a way to enforce her needs. Not responding to messages might be part of her needing space, which is understandable.\n\nIn terms of AITA, the author isn't in the wrong because she communicated her boundaries and the boyfriend didn't respect them. Her reaction is a consequence of his actions. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
