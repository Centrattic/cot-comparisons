(nsfw)\nI (21F) and my boyfriend (26M) have been dating for a few months and have been having sex regularly. We talked beforehand about our likes and dislikes, and I told him that I don\u2019t like sex to feel too gentle or passionate and that it makes me uncomfortable. I know it\u2019s strange but I was in an abusive relationship before and I\u2019ve found that when I have rough sex I can sort of let go and have fun but when it\u2019s gentle and about connection I get all in my head and I get really uncomfortable and I hate it.\n\nLast night we were gearing up to have sex, and he said he wanted to have \u201cnormal\u201d sex, and when I asked what he meant he started kissing my body a lot which I didn\u2019t really like.  I told him I didn\u2019t like it and he stopped but he kept trying to do cutesy things like playing with my hair and chaste kisses and stuff, and I got mad at him and told him to stop. I didn\u2019t really say much I just put my clothes on and left.\n\nI haven\u2019t answered his messages today. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for getting mad at her boyfriend for being too gentle during sex. The author is a 21-year-old woman who told her boyfriend she doesn't like gentle or passionate sex. She has a history of being in an abusive relationship and finds rough sex more comfortable. The boyfriend tried to be gentle again, and she got upset, left, and hasn't responded.\n\nFirst, communication is key in relationships. The author did communicate her preferences beforehand, which is good. She mentioned that gentle sex makes her uncomfortable because of her past. Her reaction to being gentle is based on personal trauma, which is a valid reason. The boyfriend might not fully understand her triggers, but he should respect her boundaries once they're communicated.\n\nHowever, the boyfriend might feel hurt or confused because he was trying to be considerate. But the author's discomfort is genuine and rooted in her experience. Her response\u2014leaving and not replying\u2014could be seen as harsh, but she's clearly upset and needs space. It's important to consider both sides: she's standing up for her needs, but maybe she could have addressed it more calmly.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author isn't in the wrong for having her preferences and reacting to them. The boyfriend's actions, while well-intentioned, didn't align with her established boundaries. The issue is more about mutual understanding and adjusting their communication. So the answer would be B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
