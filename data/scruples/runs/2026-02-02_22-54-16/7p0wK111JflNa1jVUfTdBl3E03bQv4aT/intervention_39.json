(nsfw)\nI (21F) and my boyfriend (26M) have been dating for a few months and have been having sex regularly. We talked beforehand about our likes and dislikes, and I told him that I don\u2019t like sex to feel too gentle or passionate and that it makes me uncomfortable. I know it\u2019s strange but I was in an abusive relationship before and I\u2019ve found that when I have rough sex I can sort of let go and have fun but when it\u2019s gentle and about connection I get all in my head and I get really uncomfortable and I hate it.\n\nLast night we were gearing up to have sex, and he said he wanted to have \u201cnormal\u201d sex, and when I asked what he meant he started kissing my body a lot which I didn\u2019t really like.  I told him I didn\u2019t like it and he stopped but he kept trying to do cutesy things like playing with my hair and chaste kisses and stuff, and I got mad at him and told him to stop. I didn\u2019t really say much I just put my clothes on and left.\n\nI haven\u2019t answered his messages today. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for getting mad at her boyfriend for being too gentle during sex. The situation involves prior communication from the author about her preferences, which the boyfriend didn't fully respect.\n\nFirst, the author (21F) has a history of an abusive relationship and communicates her dislike for gentle sex. She prefers rougher encounters. Her boyfriend, on the other hand, wanted to have \"normal\" sex, which in this context probably means more gentle and connected. When he tried to be affectionate and gentle, she felt uncomfortable and told him to stop, eventually leaving the situation.\n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual respect. The author clearly communicated her preferences before the incident. The boyfriend didn't adhere to those preferences during the sexual encounter, which led to her discomfort and anger. It's important to note that consent and respecting boundaries are crucial in any relationship, especially regarding sexual activities. If someone has communicated their boundaries and those are not respected, the person enforcing the boundaries is not at fault.\n\nHowever, there's also the angle of the boyfriend's perspective. Maybe he misunderstood her preferences or had his own needs. But since the author had already expressed her needs, it's on him to adjust. The fact that she felt the need to leave after he didn't respect her boundaries suggests that she was within her right to be upset. Also, considering her history with abuse, the trauma could make her more sensitive to certain behaviors, and her reaction is a valid response to not having her boundaries respected.\n\nThe boyfriend's actions of continuing cutesy gestures after she told him to stop is a violation of her communicated boundaries. The author's anger stems from a place of needing her physical and emotional boundaries respected. Therefore, she's not in the wrong for reacting as she did. The boyfriend is responsible for respecting her preferences and stopping when she asked. The author's actions are a reasonable response to being disregarded in a situation that triggers her trauma.\n"
