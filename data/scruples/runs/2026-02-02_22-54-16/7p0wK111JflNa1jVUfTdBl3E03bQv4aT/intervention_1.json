(nsfw)\nI (21F) and my boyfriend (26M) have been dating for a few months and have been having sex regularly. We talked beforehand about our likes and dislikes, and I told him that I don\u2019t like sex to feel too gentle or passionate and that it makes me uncomfortable. I know it\u2019s strange but I was in an abusive relationship before and I\u2019ve found that when I have rough sex I can sort of let go and have fun but when it\u2019s gentle and about connection I get all in my head and I get really uncomfortable and I hate it.\n\nLast night we were gearing up to have sex, and he said he wanted to have \u201cnormal\u201d sex, and when I asked what he meant he started kissing my body a lot which I didn\u2019t really like.  I told him I didn\u2019t like it and he stopped but he kept trying to do cutesy things like playing with my hair and chaste kisses and stuff, and I got mad at him and told him to stop. I didn\u2019t really say much I just put my clothes on and left.\n\nI haven\u2019t answered his messages today. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a 21-year-old woman who's upset because her boyfriend was too gentle during sex. She mentioned she doesn't like gentle or passionate sex because of past trauma from an abusive relationship. She communicated her preferences before, but when he tried to be affectionate with cutesy actions like playing with her hair and chaste kisses, she got mad and left.\n\nFirst, communication is key in relationships, especially regarding intimacy. She did communicate her needs beforehand, so she's not at fault there. Her discomfort stems from a past abusive relationship, which is valid. People have different needs, especially those with trauma. It's important for partners to respect each other's boundaries.\n\nThe boyfriend wanted to have \"normal\" sex, but that's a bit vague. He might have different expectations of what \"normal\" means, but he should have considered her preferences she already shared. When she expressed discomfort, he stopped but kept trying affectionate gestures she didn't like. That's a problem. If you're told something makes the other person uncomfortable, you should avoid it, even if you think they're overreacting.\n\nThe author getting mad and leaving is a reaction to his not respecting her boundaries. She didn't lash out physically or verbally, just left. She hasn't responded to messages, which might be a communication issue on her end, but given the context, it's understandable. She might need time to process.\n\nSo, who's at fault? The boyfriend ignored her previously stated preferences and continued actions she disliked. The author stood up for herself when her boundaries were crossed. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
