(nsfw)\nI (21F) and my boyfriend (26M) have been dating for a few months and have been having sex regularly. We talked beforehand about our likes and dislikes, and I told him that I don\u2019t like sex to feel too gentle or passionate and that it makes me uncomfortable. I know it\u2019s strange but I was in an abusive relationship before and I\u2019ve found that when I have rough sex I can sort of let go and have fun but when it\u2019s gentle and about connection I get all in my head and I get really uncomfortable and I hate it.\n\nLast night we were gearing up to have sex, and he said he wanted to have \u201cnormal\u201d sex, and when I asked what he meant he started kissing my body a lot which I didn\u2019t really like.  I told him I didn\u2019t like it and he stopped but he kept trying to do cutesy things like playing with my hair and chaste kisses and stuff, and I got mad at him and told him to stop. I didn\u2019t really say much I just put my clothes on and left.\n\nI haven\u2019t answered his messages today. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is a 21-year-old woman who's been in a relationship with her 26-year-old boyfriend for a few months. They've had sex regularly, and she communicated her preferences beforehand: she doesn't like gentle or passionate sex and finds it uncomfortable due to a past abusive relationship. She mentioned that she prefers rougher sex because it helps her relax, unlike gentle, emotionally connected sex.\n\nLast night, the boyfriend said he wanted to have \"normal\" sex, which led him to start kissing her body, which she didn't like. She told him to stop, he did but kept doing cutesy things like playing with her hair and chaste kisses. She got mad, put on her clothes, and left. Now, she's not responding to his messages and is asking if she's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, communication is key in relationships, especially regarding sexual preferences. The user did communicate her boundaries, so if the boyfriend didn't respect those boundaries and continued with actions she disliked, that's a problem. However, the boyfriend might have had his own preferences and tried to adjust, but perhaps misread the situation. The user's reaction was to get angry and leave, which can be seen as a valid response if her boundaries were violated. However, not responding to messages might be cutting off communication, which could be the issue. The boyfriend might feel hurt or confused, but the user's comfort and safety are also important, especially considering her history of abuse. It's a tricky situation where both parties might have valid points, but the main issue is whether the user was in the wrong for her reaction. Since she communicated her preferences and the boyfriend didn't fully respect them, leading to her discomfort, she's not entirely at fault. However, her immediate withdrawal might hinder resolving the issue. Still, given her history, her reaction is understandable. So, the answer is B.\n"
