(nsfw)\nI (21F) and my boyfriend (26M) have been dating for a few months and have been having sex regularly. We talked beforehand about our likes and dislikes, and I told him that I don\u2019t like sex to feel too gentle or passionate and that it makes me uncomfortable. I know it\u2019s strange but I was in an abusive relationship before and I\u2019ve found that when I have rough sex I can sort of let go and have fun but when it\u2019s gentle and about connection I get all in my head and I get really uncomfortable and I hate it.\n\nLast night we were gearing up to have sex, and he said he wanted to have \u201cnormal\u201d sex, and when I asked what he meant he started kissing my body a lot which I didn\u2019t really like.  I told him I didn\u2019t like it and he stopped but he kept trying to do cutesy things like playing with my hair and chaste kisses and stuff, and I got mad at him and told him to stop. I didn\u2019t really say much I just put my clothes on and left.\n\nI haven\u2019t answered his messages today. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a 21-year-old woman who's been in a relationship with her boyfriend for a few months. They've had sex regularly. She mentioned her preferences to him before: she doesn't like gentle or passionate sex; it makes her uncomfortable. She has a history of being in an abusive relationship, which she connects to her current preferences. When her boyfriend tried to be gentle and affectionate\u2014like kissing her body, playing with her hair, chaste kisses\u2014she got upset and left.\n\nFirst, communication is key here. She did tell him her preferences beforehand, so if he didn't take that into account, he might be at fault. But maybe he misunderstood what she meant by \"normal\" sex. If she said she doesn't like gentle sex, but he still went for a gentle approach, that's a problem. However, boundaries can be complex, especially with past trauma. She has the right to set her boundaries, even if they're different from what's typical. \n\nHer reaction: she told him she didn't like it, he stopped but kept trying, so she got mad and left. Her actions are within her right if she's respecting her own boundaries. He should have respected her preferences from the start. The fact that she hasn't answered his messages might be because she's upset, but that's her choice. \n\nSo, considering she communicated her needs, and he didn't fully respect them even after she expressed discomfort, the author isn't in the wrong. The boyfriend's actions were the issue here. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
