(nsfw)\nI (21F) and my boyfriend (26M) have been dating for a few months and have been having sex regularly. We talked beforehand about our likes and dislikes, and I told him that I don\u2019t like sex to feel too gentle or passionate and that it makes me uncomfortable. I know it\u2019s strange but I was in an abusive relationship before and I\u2019ve found that when I have rough sex I can sort of let go and have fun but when it\u2019s gentle and about connection I get all in my head and I get really uncomfortable and I hate it.\n\nLast night we were gearing up to have sex, and he said he wanted to have \u201cnormal\u201d sex, and when I asked what he meant he started kissing my body a lot which I didn\u2019t really like.  I told him I didn\u2019t like it and he stopped but he kept trying to do cutesy things like playing with my hair and chaste kisses and stuff, and I got mad at him and told him to stop. I didn\u2019t really say much I just put my clothes on and left.\n\nI haven\u2019t answered his messages today. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a 21-year-old woman and her 26-year-old boyfriend. They've been dating a few months and having regular sex. She told him upfront that she doesn't like gentle or passionate sex because it makes her uncomfortable, stemming from a past abusive relationship. She prefers rougher sex where she can let go, whereas gentle intimacy makes her anxious.\n\nThe issue here is that the boyfriend wanted to have \"normal\" sex, which led to him doing things she didn't like, like gentle touching and cutesy gestures. She got mad and left. Now she's wondering if she's at fault.\n\nFirst, communication is key in relationships. The author did communicate her preferences beforehand, which is good. But maybe the boyfriend misunderstood \"normal\" sex in this context. She might have expected him to respect her boundaries, and he might have thought he was being considerate. However, when she expressed discomfort again during the encounter, he didn't stop completely but tried to continue with what she didn't like. That's a problem because her preferences were already stated, and he didn't adjust adequately.\n\nEmotionally, she has trauma from an abusive relationship, which affects her current preferences. Her reaction of getting angry and leaving could be a result of feeling her boundaries were crossed again. It's important to consider her mental health and how past experiences influence her present reactions.\n\nOn the boyfriend's side, if he was trying to be gentle because of his own understanding of intimacy, but didn't take her feedback into account during the act, that's a failure in communication and respect. However, the fact that he stopped when she told him shows he wasn't ignoring her completely, but continued with other gestures she didn't like. That's a gray area.\n\nThe author not answering his messages might be a communication issue, but if she's still processing her feelings, it's understandable. The question is whether her anger and withdrawal were justified. Since she communicated her needs and he didn't fully comply, she's not necessarily wrong. But maybe she could have handled it differently, like discussing it calmly instead of leaving.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, both have roles. She could have been clearer during the encounter, and he could have respected her feedback more thoroughly. But given her history, her reaction is valid. The key points are communication and respect for boundaries. Since she had already mentioned her preferences, and he didn't adjust properly even after she told him to stop, the onus is more on him for not heeding her wishes. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
