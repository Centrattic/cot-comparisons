(nsfw)\nI (21F) and my boyfriend (26M) have been dating for a few months and have been having sex regularly. We talked beforehand about our likes and dislikes, and I told him that I don\u2019t like sex to feel too gentle or passionate and that it makes me uncomfortable. I know it\u2019s strange but I was in an abusive relationship before and I\u2019ve found that when I have rough sex I can sort of let go and have fun but when it\u2019s gentle and about connection I get all in my head and I get really uncomfortable and I hate it.\n\nLast night we were gearing up to have sex, and he said he wanted to have \u201cnormal\u201d sex, and when I asked what he meant he started kissing my body a lot which I didn\u2019t really like.  I told him I didn\u2019t like it and he stopped but he kept trying to do cutesy things like playing with my hair and chaste kisses and stuff, and I got mad at him and told him to stop. I didn\u2019t really say much I just put my clothes on and left.\n\nI haven\u2019t answered his messages today. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a 21-year-old woman who's upset with her boyfriend for being too gentle during sex. She mentioned that she prefers rougher sex because of her past abusive relationship. They had previously discussed her preferences, so she expected him to follow that. Last night, he wanted to have \"normal\" sex, which involved gentle actions like kissing her body, playing with her hair, and chaste kisses. She didn't like it, told him to stop, and left. Now she's wondering if she's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, communication is key here. She had already told him her preferences, so he should have respected that. If he went against what she said, that's a problem. But maybe he misunderstood or thought he was being considerate. However, she did tell him to stop, and he kept trying, which led to her getting upset. \n\nHer reaction of getting mad and leaving might be intense, but given her history of abuse, her discomfort with gentleness makes sense. People have different needs based on their past experiences. The boyfriend might need to be more aware of her triggers. \n\nOn the other hand, she didn't explain her feelings clearly again when he was doing the things she didn't like. She just told him to stop and left, which could be seen as abrupt. Maybe she should have communicated her needs more explicitly that night. However, she had already communicated her preferences before, so he should have known.\n\nThe boyfriend's actions of trying to be gentle might be his way of showing affection, but if that's not what she wants, he's not respecting her boundaries. Her leaving could be a defensive reaction due to her trauma. It's important to consider both sides, but since she had set clear boundaries and he didn't adhere, she's not necessarily in the wrong. The answer is B.\n"
