(nsfw)\nI (21F) and my boyfriend (26M) have been dating for a few months and have been having sex regularly. We talked beforehand about our likes and dislikes, and I told him that I don\u2019t like sex to feel too gentle or passionate and that it makes me uncomfortable. I know it\u2019s strange but I was in an abusive relationship before and I\u2019ve found that when I have rough sex I can sort of let go and have fun but when it\u2019s gentle and about connection I get all in my head and I get really uncomfortable and I hate it.\n\nLast night we were gearing up to have sex, and he said he wanted to have \u201cnormal\u201d sex, and when I asked what he meant he started kissing my body a lot which I didn\u2019t really like.  I told him I didn\u2019t like it and he stopped but he kept trying to do cutesy things like playing with my hair and chaste kisses and stuff, and I got mad at him and told him to stop. I didn\u2019t really say much I just put my clothes on and left.\n\nI haven\u2019t answered his messages today. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that she's a 21-year-old female in a relationship with a 26-year-old male they've been dating for a few months. They have a regular sex life. She mentioned before that she doesn't like sex that's too gentle or passionate, which makes her uncomfortable. She has a history of being in an abusive relationship, and she finds rough sex helps her let go and have fun, whereas gentle and emotional sex makes her anxious and uncomfortable.\n\nLast night, when they were about to have sex, the boyfriend said he wanted to have \"normal\" sex. She asked what he meant, and he started kissing her body, which she didn't like. When she told him to stop, he stopped but kept doing things like playing with her hair and giving chaste kisses. She got mad and left, not responding to his messages. Now she's asking if she's in the wrong (AITA).\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether she did something wrong. She communicated her preferences beforehand. She told him she doesn't like gentle or passionate sex. He, however, decided to go ahead with what he considered \"normal\" sex, which in his interpretation included gentle actions. She tried to communicate again when he was doing things she didn't like, and he adjusted but then continued with other gentle behaviors. She then expressed her frustration by getting angry and leaving.\n\nFrom a communication standpoint, she had already set clear boundaries. The boyfriend didn't fully respect those boundaries when he continued with actions she didn't like after she told him to stop. Her reaction, while maybe intense, could be seen as a result of feeling her boundaries were not respected. However, communication is a two-way street. Maybe he should have checked in more or asked if his actions were okay after she initially told him to stop. But since she had already communicated her preferences, he might have been responsible for respecting them without needing to be reminded every time. \n\nHer emotional response is understandable given her history of abuse. The trauma from that might make her sensitive to certain types of physical interaction. Her leaving the situation and not responding could be her way of coping, but not engaging further without communication might also be seen as cutting off dialogue. \n\nOn the other hand, if the boyfriend felt that \"normal\" sex meant something different to him, maybe there was a misunderstanding. But he was the one who initiated the actions she didn't like, and after she told him to stop, he continued with other gentle acts. That could be a breach of her boundaries. \n\nSo, considering all that, the main issue is whether she was wrong for reacting to his actions. Since she communicated her preferences and he didn't fully respect them, her reaction might not be in the wrong. However, maybe she could have handled it differently, but the core of the problem is his not respecting her boundaries. Therefore, she's not in the wrong.\n"
