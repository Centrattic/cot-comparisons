(nsfw)\nI (21F) and my boyfriend (26M) have been dating for a few months and have been having sex regularly. We talked beforehand about our likes and dislikes, and I told him that I don\u2019t like sex to feel too gentle or passionate and that it makes me uncomfortable. I know it\u2019s strange but I was in an abusive relationship before and I\u2019ve found that when I have rough sex I can sort of let go and have fun but when it\u2019s gentle and about connection I get all in my head and I get really uncomfortable and I hate it.\n\nLast night we were gearing up to have sex, and he said he wanted to have \u201cnormal\u201d sex, and when I asked what he meant he started kissing my body a lot which I didn\u2019t really like.  I told him I didn\u2019t like it and he stopped but he kept trying to do cutesy things like playing with my hair and chaste kisses and stuff, and I got mad at him and told him to stop. I didn\u2019t really say much I just put my clothes on and left.\n\nI haven\u2019t answered his messages today. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (21F) is in the wrong for getting angry at her boyfriend (26M) for being too gentle during sex. They had discussed their preferences beforehand. The key points here are communication, consent, and understanding each other's boundaries.\n\nFirst, the author explicitly told her boyfriend that she doesn't like gentle or passionate sex and finds it uncomfortable due to past trauma. So, she communicated her preferences. However, the boyfriend still went ahead with gentle actions like kissing her body and cutesy gestures, which upset her. \n\nThe boyfriend's intention was to have \"normal\" sex, which he interpreted as gentle, but the author had different needs. The fact that she had to tell him to stop shows that his actions were not respecting her boundaries. She then left in anger, which is a reaction to her discomfort. \n\nIt's important to note her history of an abusive relationship, which might make her more sensitive to certain behaviors. The boyfriend's actions, while perhaps meant to be affectionate, were counter to what she had communicated. So, in this scenario, the boyfriend might be at fault for not adhering to her established boundaries. \n\nHowever, the author's response was to get angry and leave without much communication. While her feelings are valid, maybe a better approach would be to discuss the issue immediately rather than letting it escalate. But the main issue here is the boyfriend not respecting her boundaries. So, the answer would likely be that the author isn't in the wrong. But I need to check if there's any nuance I'm missing. Like, did she give him enough context about her past? But she did mention the abusive relationship, so he should understand. Therefore, the boyfriend's actions were inappropriate, so the answer is B.\n"
