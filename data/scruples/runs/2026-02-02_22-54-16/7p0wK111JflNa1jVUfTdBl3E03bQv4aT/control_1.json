(nsfw)\nI (21F) and my boyfriend (26M) have been dating for a few months and have been having sex regularly. We talked beforehand about our likes and dislikes, and I told him that I don\u2019t like sex to feel too gentle or passionate and that it makes me uncomfortable. I know it\u2019s strange but I was in an abusive relationship before and I\u2019ve found that when I have rough sex I can sort of let go and have fun but when it\u2019s gentle and about connection I get all in my head and I get really uncomfortable and I hate it.\n\nLast night we were gearing up to have sex, and he said he wanted to have \u201cnormal\u201d sex, and when I asked what he meant he started kissing my body a lot which I didn\u2019t really like.  I told him I didn\u2019t like it and he stopped but he kept trying to do cutesy things like playing with my hair and chaste kisses and stuff, and I got mad at him and told him to stop. I didn\u2019t really say much I just put my clothes on and left.\n\nI haven\u2019t answered his messages today. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author (21F) getting upset with her boyfriend (26M) for being too gentle during sex. She mentioned they discussed their preferences beforehand, and she told him she doesn't like gentle or passionate sex because of her past abusive relationship. She prefers rough sex to feel comfortable, which is the opposite of what he did.\n\nFirst, communication is key in relationships. The author clearly communicated her preferences to her boyfriend before, so he should have been aware. However, when they had sex, he went against what she had previously told him, leading to her discomfort. The boyfriend's actions here might be seen as not respecting her boundaries, even if his intention was to be caring. \n\nThe author got mad and left, which could be seen as a reaction to her discomfort, which is valid. But did she handle it poorly? She didn't communicate her feelings during the moment, just left after telling him to stop. Maybe she could have explained why she was uncomfortable again, instead of just leaving. However, considering her past trauma, her reaction might be justified. \n\nThe boyfriend's approach of trying to be gentle could be his default, but he should prioritize her stated needs. The fact that he didn't remember or follow her preferences despite prior discussion might place some blame on him. The author's response, while abrupt, is a reaction to not being respected. \n\nSo, considering both sides, the author isn't in the wrong. Her boyfriend didn't follow her boundaries, and her reaction, though perhaps not the most communicative, is understandable given her trauma. The answer should be B (No).\n"
