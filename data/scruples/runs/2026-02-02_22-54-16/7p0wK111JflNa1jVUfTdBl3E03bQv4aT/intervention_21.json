(nsfw)\nI (21F) and my boyfriend (26M) have been dating for a few months and have been having sex regularly. We talked beforehand about our likes and dislikes, and I told him that I don\u2019t like sex to feel too gentle or passionate and that it makes me uncomfortable. I know it\u2019s strange but I was in an abusive relationship before and I\u2019ve found that when I have rough sex I can sort of let go and have fun but when it\u2019s gentle and about connection I get all in my head and I get really uncomfortable and I hate it.\n\nLast night we were gearing up to have sex, and he said he wanted to have \u201cnormal\u201d sex, and when I asked what he meant he started kissing my body a lot which I didn\u2019t really like.  I told him I didn\u2019t like it and he stopped but he kept trying to do cutesy things like playing with my hair and chaste kisses and stuff, and I got mad at him and told him to stop. I didn\u2019t really say much I just put my clothes on and left.\n\nI haven\u2019t answered his messages today. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a girl getting mad at her boyfriend for being too gentle during sex. She mentioned they had discussed their preferences beforehand, and she told him she doesn't like gentle or passionate sex because of her past abusive relationship. Now, the boyfriend tried to be gentle, which made her uncomfortable, and she got angry, left, and hasn't responded.\n\nFirst, I need to consider communication. The author did tell him her preferences initially. But maybe she didn't communicate it clearly enough during the actual situation. When he started being gentle, she told him to stop, so that's direct communication. But maybe she could have been more specific or reminded him of her preferences again during the encounter.\n\nNext, the boyfriend's perspective. He might have thought he was being considerate or trying to connect, which is a common approach in relationships. If he's always been told to be gentle, maybe he didn't realize it was causing discomfort unless she explicitly said so. But she did tell him before, so maybe he should have remembered.\n\nThe author's reaction: getting mad and leaving. Is that an appropriate response? It's understandable if she's uncomfortable and needs to set boundaries. However, walking out and not responding might be seen as harsh. The boyfriend might feel rejected or hurt if she didn't explain her feelings after the fact. Maybe she should have discussed it later instead of cutting off communication.\n\nAlso, considering her past with an abusive relationship, her preference for rough sex as a way to feel safe makes sense. But the boyfriend might not understand that unless she explains it to him. The key here is whether communication was clear and if both parties are respecting each other's boundaries.\n\nSo, was the author in the wrong? If she communicated her needs before and during, then no. But her reaction of getting angry and leaving without further discussion might be seen as not considering his feelings. However, her discomfort is valid given her history. It's a balance between respecting each other's boundaries and addressing the situation constructively. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) because she communicated her needs, but there's room for improvement in how she handles the conflict.\n"
