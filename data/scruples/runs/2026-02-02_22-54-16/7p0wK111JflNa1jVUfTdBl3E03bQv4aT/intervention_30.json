(nsfw)\nI (21F) and my boyfriend (26M) have been dating for a few months and have been having sex regularly. We talked beforehand about our likes and dislikes, and I told him that I don\u2019t like sex to feel too gentle or passionate and that it makes me uncomfortable. I know it\u2019s strange but I was in an abusive relationship before and I\u2019ve found that when I have rough sex I can sort of let go and have fun but when it\u2019s gentle and about connection I get all in my head and I get really uncomfortable and I hate it.\n\nLast night we were gearing up to have sex, and he said he wanted to have \u201cnormal\u201d sex, and when I asked what he meant he started kissing my body a lot which I didn\u2019t really like.  I told him I didn\u2019t like it and he stopped but he kept trying to do cutesy things like playing with my hair and chaste kisses and stuff, and I got mad at him and told him to stop. I didn\u2019t really say much I just put my clothes on and left.\n\nI haven\u2019t answered his messages today. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for getting mad at her boyfriend for being too gentle during sex. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the situation. The author, a 21-year-old woman, has a history of being in an abusive relationship. She's communicated her preferences to her boyfriend: she doesn't like gentle or passionate sex because it makes her uncomfortable. She mentioned that rough sex helps her let go, but gentle stuff makes her anxious. \n\nHer boyfriend, on the other hand, wanted to have \"normal\" sex, which led to her discomfort. When he tried to be affectionate with kisses and touching her hair, she told him to stop and left. Now she's wondering if she's in the wrong.\n\nThe key points here are communication and boundaries. The author clearly stated her preferences beforehand, which is important. The boyfriend might not have fully understood or respected her boundaries during the encounter, leading to her frustration. \n\nBut wait, does the boyfriend's actions count as not respecting boundaries? He did stop when she told him, but maybe he didn't take her initial communication seriously enough. Also, the author left abruptly, which might affect how the situation is perceived. \n\nHowever, considering her past trauma from an abusive relationship, her reaction is understandable. She's trying to navigate her needs in a healthy relationship, and her boundaries are valid. The boyfriend might need to be more attentive to her specific needs instead of his own expectations of \"normal\" sex. \n\nBut there's a nuance here. If the boyfriend was following her previous communication but she changed her mind, maybe there's a miscommunication. However, she specified that gentle sex makes her uncomfortable, so his actions might not align with her established boundaries. \n\nIn terms of accountability, the author isn't wrong for expressing her discomfort and setting boundaries. The boyfriend might need to adjust his approach, but the author's response (getting mad and leaving) could be seen as a reaction to his not respecting her boundaries. \n\nSo, based on the information, the author isn't in the wrong because she communicated her needs and acted to protect her comfort. The boyfriend might have misinterpreted or not fully respected her boundaries, which is on him. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
