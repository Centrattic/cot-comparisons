(nsfw)\nI (21F) and my boyfriend (26M) have been dating for a few months and have been having sex regularly. We talked beforehand about our likes and dislikes, and I told him that I don\u2019t like sex to feel too gentle or passionate and that it makes me uncomfortable. I know it\u2019s strange but I was in an abusive relationship before and I\u2019ve found that when I have rough sex I can sort of let go and have fun but when it\u2019s gentle and about connection I get all in my head and I get really uncomfortable and I hate it.\n\nLast night we were gearing up to have sex, and he said he wanted to have \u201cnormal\u201d sex, and when I asked what he meant he started kissing my body a lot which I didn\u2019t really like.  I told him I didn\u2019t like it and he stopped but he kept trying to do cutesy things like playing with my hair and chaste kisses and stuff, and I got mad at him and told him to stop. I didn\u2019t really say much I just put my clothes on and left.\n\nI haven\u2019t answered his messages today. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this scenario. The situation is about a 21-year-old woman and her 26-year-old boyfriend who's been dating a few months. They've talked about their likes and dislikes in sex, and she mentioned she doesn't like it to be too gentle or passionate because of past abuse. She prefers rough sex to feel comfortable. The boyfriend wanted to have \"normal\" sex, which involved gentle actions like kissing and playing with her hair. She got mad, told him to stop, put her clothes on, and left. He's been messaging her, and she hasn't responded.\n\nFirst, I need to consider consent and communication. The woman communicated her preferences clearly beforehand. That's a key point. If she told him she doesn't like gentle and prefers rough, and he still tried to engage in gentle actions, maybe he's not respecting her boundaries. However, he might have thought \"normal\" sex was his default, not realizing she wanted something different. But she did mention her preferences before, so he should know.\n\nHer getting mad and leaving could be a reaction to him not respecting her boundaries. She has a history of abuse, which makes her feel uncomfortable with gentle sex. Her response might be emotional because of past trauma. On the other hand, he might feel hurt that she left so abruptly and hasn't responded. \n\nBut the key here is that she communicated her needs, and he didn't adhere to them. Even if he meant well, not following through on her stated preferences could be a problem. However, maybe he misunderstood what \"normal\" meant in her context. But since she had already told him her preferences, he should adjust accordingly. \n\nThe author's actions are a reaction to her boundaries not being respected. She's in discomfort because of the gentleness, so she's not in the wrong for expressing that. He might need to work on understanding her needs better. \n\nBut the user is asking if she's in the wrong. The answer would depend on whether her communication was sufficient and if he ignored it. Since she did communicate and he didn't adjust, she's not in the wrong. However, her abrupt departure and not responding might be seen as harsh. But given her trauma, her reaction is understandable. \n\nSo the answer is B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
