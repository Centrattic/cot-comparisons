(nsfw)\nI (21F) and my boyfriend (26M) have been dating for a few months and have been having sex regularly. We talked beforehand about our likes and dislikes, and I told him that I don\u2019t like sex to feel too gentle or passionate and that it makes me uncomfortable. I know it\u2019s strange but I was in an abusive relationship before and I\u2019ve found that when I have rough sex I can sort of let go and have fun but when it\u2019s gentle and about connection I get all in my head and I get really uncomfortable and I hate it.\n\nLast night we were gearing up to have sex, and he said he wanted to have \u201cnormal\u201d sex, and when I asked what he meant he started kissing my body a lot which I didn\u2019t really like.  I told him I didn\u2019t like it and he stopped but he kept trying to do cutesy things like playing with my hair and chaste kisses and stuff, and I got mad at him and told him to stop. I didn\u2019t really say much I just put my clothes on and left.\n\nI haven\u2019t answered his messages today. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for getting mad at her boyfriend for being too gentle during sex. The situation involves the author (21F) having communicated to her boyfriend (26M) that she doesn't like gentle or passionate sex, having a history of abuse, and getting upset when he didn't follow her preferences. The boyfriend tried to be gentle, even after she expressed discomfort again during the encounter.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author had previously communicated her preferences, which is important. The boyfriend didn't heed her feedback during the actual interaction, even after she told him to stop. The author then left and hasn't responded. The question is whether she's in the wrong.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. Let me analyze. Communication is a big factor here. The author did inform her boyfriend of her needs. When he didn't respect that and continued with actions she didn't like, she expressed her displeasure. Her reaction (getting mad, leaving) might be seen as justified if her boundaries were crossed. However, not responding to messages could be seen as cutting off communication, which might be a separate issue.\n\nBut the main issue is about respecting boundaries. If the boyfriend didn't follow through on her stated preferences, then the author isn't wrong for being upset. However, the way she handled it (leaving and not responding) might affect the perception. But given her history of abuse, her sensitivity is understandable. The boyfriend's approach of \"normal\" sex as cutesy might not align with her needs, and she had a right to express that.\n\nSo, the answer would likely be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. The key factors are prior communication, the boyfriend not respecting her boundaries during the interaction, and her history affecting her comfort.\n"
