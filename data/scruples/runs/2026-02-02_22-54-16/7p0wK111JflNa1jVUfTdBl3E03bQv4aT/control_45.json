(nsfw)\nI (21F) and my boyfriend (26M) have been dating for a few months and have been having sex regularly. We talked beforehand about our likes and dislikes, and I told him that I don\u2019t like sex to feel too gentle or passionate and that it makes me uncomfortable. I know it\u2019s strange but I was in an abusive relationship before and I\u2019ve found that when I have rough sex I can sort of let go and have fun but when it\u2019s gentle and about connection I get all in my head and I get really uncomfortable and I hate it.\n\nLast night we were gearing up to have sex, and he said he wanted to have \u201cnormal\u201d sex, and when I asked what he meant he started kissing my body a lot which I didn\u2019t really like.  I told him I didn\u2019t like it and he stopped but he kept trying to do cutesy things like playing with my hair and chaste kisses and stuff, and I got mad at him and told him to stop. I didn\u2019t really say much I just put my clothes on and left.\n\nI haven\u2019t answered his messages today. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for getting mad at her boyfriend for being too gentle during sex. So the situation is that the author, a 21-year-old woman, has a boyfriend who's 26. They've been dating a few months and have had sex regularly. They discussed their preferences beforehand, and she told him she doesn't like it when it's too gentle or passionate because it makes her uncomfortable. She mentions a past abusive relationship, and she prefers rough sex to let go and have fun. \n\nLast night, her boyfriend wanted to have \"normal\" sex, which she didn't like because he started doing things like kissing her body, playing with her hair, and chaste kisses. She told him to stop, got mad, put her clothes on, and left. Now she hasn't responded to his messages and is asking if she's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author communicated her boundaries clearly before. She told him her preferences, so he should have respected that. However, he didn't follow through and instead did things that made her uncomfortable. She reacted by getting angry and leaving. \n\nBut wait, the boyfriend's intention was to be gentle, which she had said she didn't like. So maybe he misunderstood what \"normal\" meant here. Maybe \"normal\" to him was gentle, but the author considered \"normal\" to be more rough. There's a miscommunication. However, she had already told him she didn't like gentle, so why did he proceed with that? \n\nShe had a history of an abusive relationship, which complicates things. She might have trauma that makes her prefer rough sex as a way to feel in control. On the other hand, her reaction was to get angry and leave without communication. Maybe she could have handled it differently, like discussing her feelings more calmly. \n\nBut the main point is whether she was wrong for getting mad. Since she communicated her boundaries, and he didn't respect them, her reaction might be justified. She felt uncomfortable and tried to stop him, but he kept trying. So she had a right to be upset. However, leaving without responding might be seen as cutting off communication, which isn't helpful. \n\nThe question is about whether she's in the wrong. If she followed her boundaries and he didn't, then she's not in the wrong. But if she overreacted, maybe she is. The community usually looks at clear communication and mutual respect. Since she told him her preferences, and he didn't comply, her reaction is understandable. So the answer would be B (No, she's not in the wrong).\n"
