(nsfw)\nI (21F) and my boyfriend (26M) have been dating for a few months and have been having sex regularly. We talked beforehand about our likes and dislikes, and I told him that I don\u2019t like sex to feel too gentle or passionate and that it makes me uncomfortable. I know it\u2019s strange but I was in an abusive relationship before and I\u2019ve found that when I have rough sex I can sort of let go and have fun but when it\u2019s gentle and about connection I get all in my head and I get really uncomfortable and I hate it.\n\nLast night we were gearing up to have sex, and he said he wanted to have \u201cnormal\u201d sex, and when I asked what he meant he started kissing my body a lot which I didn\u2019t really like.  I told him I didn\u2019t like it and he stopped but he kept trying to do cutesy things like playing with my hair and chaste kisses and stuff, and I got mad at him and told him to stop. I didn\u2019t really say much I just put my clothes on and left.\n\nI haven\u2019t answered his messages today. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (a 21-year-old woman) is in the wrong for getting mad at her boyfriend for being too gentle during sex. The situation involves past trauma from an abusive relationship, which affects her current preferences. She communicated her dislike for gentle sex before, but he still went ahead with it, leading to her anger and her leaving the situation. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author clearly communicated her boundaries and preferences before the incident. Her boyfriend, however, interpreted \"normal\" sex in a way that she didn't like. She tried to communicate again during the encounter but he didn't stop, continuing with actions that made her uncomfortable. Her reaction was to get angry and leave, then not respond to his messages.\n\nFrom a communication standpoint, she did her part by setting expectations. The boyfriend didn't respect her boundaries during the actual event, which led to her distress. Trauma survivors often have specific needs, and in this case, rougher sex helps her disconnect from negative emotions. The boyfriend's actions, despite prior communication, could be seen as dismissive of her needs. \n\nThe author's anger is a valid response to her boundaries being ignored. Leaving and not replying might be her way of processing the situation. However, the boyfriend's intention might have been to show affection, but he didn't adjust when she indicated discomfort. \n\nLegally and ethically, respecting boundaries is crucial. The boyfriend's actions could be seen as a failure to respect her consent as modified during the encounter. The author isn't in the wrong for protecting her emotional well-being. So, the answer should be B (No).\n"
