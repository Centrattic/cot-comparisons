(nsfw)\nI (21F) and my boyfriend (26M) have been dating for a few months and have been having sex regularly. We talked beforehand about our likes and dislikes, and I told him that I don\u2019t like sex to feel too gentle or passionate and that it makes me uncomfortable. I know it\u2019s strange but I was in an abusive relationship before and I\u2019ve found that when I have rough sex I can sort of let go and have fun but when it\u2019s gentle and about connection I get all in my head and I get really uncomfortable and I hate it.\n\nLast night we were gearing up to have sex, and he said he wanted to have \u201cnormal\u201d sex, and when I asked what he meant he started kissing my body a lot which I didn\u2019t really like.  I told him I didn\u2019t like it and he stopped but he kept trying to do cutesy things like playing with my hair and chaste kisses and stuff, and I got mad at him and told him to stop. I didn\u2019t really say much I just put my clothes on and left.\n\nI haven\u2019t answered his messages today. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for getting mad at her boyfriend for being too gentle during sex. \n\nFirst, the author is 21F, her boyfriend is 26M. They've been dating a few months and have been having sex regularly. She had previously communicated her preferences, saying she doesn't like gentle or passionate sex because of her past abusive relationship. She prefers rough sex to feel comfortable. \n\nLast night, the boyfriend wanted to have \"normal\" sex, which she interpreted as gentle. He started kissing her body, which she didn't like, and then did cutesy things like playing with her hair and chaste kisses. She got mad, told him to stop, put her clothes on, and left. She hasn't responded to his messages since.\n\nThe user is asking if she's at fault. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nI need to consider communication and consent. She had already told him her preferences. If he went against what she told him, that's his fault. But maybe he misunderstood \"normal\" sex? However, she clarified she didn't like his actions, so he should have adjusted. Her reaction might be valid if he didn't respect her boundaries. But getting mad and leaving without communication could also be seen as not handling it well. \n\nHer past trauma might affect her comfort, so her needs are valid. If he wasn't respecting her boundaries despite her communication, she's not in the wrong for being upset. On the other hand, if there was a miscommunication, maybe she should have discussed it more. But given she already told him, and he continued, she's justified in her reaction. \n\nSo the answer might be B (not in the wrong). But I should check if there are other factors. The boyfriend might have had his own preferences, but he should prioritize her communicated needs. Her getting mad is a reaction to him not respecting her boundaries. Therefore, she's not in the wrong.\n"
