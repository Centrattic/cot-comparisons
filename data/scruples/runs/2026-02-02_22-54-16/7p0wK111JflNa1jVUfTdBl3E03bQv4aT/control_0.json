(nsfw)\nI (21F) and my boyfriend (26M) have been dating for a few months and have been having sex regularly. We talked beforehand about our likes and dislikes, and I told him that I don\u2019t like sex to feel too gentle or passionate and that it makes me uncomfortable. I know it\u2019s strange but I was in an abusive relationship before and I\u2019ve found that when I have rough sex I can sort of let go and have fun but when it\u2019s gentle and about connection I get all in my head and I get really uncomfortable and I hate it.\n\nLast night we were gearing up to have sex, and he said he wanted to have \u201cnormal\u201d sex, and when I asked what he meant he started kissing my body a lot which I didn\u2019t really like.  I told him I didn\u2019t like it and he stopped but he kept trying to do cutesy things like playing with my hair and chaste kisses and stuff, and I got mad at him and told him to stop. I didn\u2019t really say much I just put my clothes on and left.\n\nI haven\u2019t answered his messages today. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves her getting mad at her boyfriend for being too gentle during sex, which she previously told him she didn't like.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. She mentioned they had talked about her preferences beforehand. She has a history of abuse, which affects her comfort with gentle sex. When the boyfriend tried to be gentle, she got uncomfortable and left. Now she's wondering if she's at fault.\n\nSo, she communicated her needs, right? But maybe the boyfriend misunderstood or didn't take her preferences seriously enough. However, she did get angry and left, not responding. The question is whether her reaction is justified. \n\nSince she had already set boundaries and the boyfriend didn't adhere to them, her frustration makes sense. But maybe she could have handled it differently, like discussing it during the moment instead of leaving abruptly. However, given her trauma history, her need for rough sex is a valid part of her healing. The boyfriend might not realize the depth of her discomfort. \n\nThe user might be looking for validation that she's not wrong for standing up for her needs, especially after abuse. But there's also a consideration of effective communication. Maybe she's in the right for expressing her needs, but her method of handling it could be improved. But the main issue is whether she's in the wrong. Since she communicated her preferences and the boyfriend didn't respect them, her reaction is understandable. So the answer might be B (No), she's not in the wrong. But I need to check if there's any nuance I'm missing. Maybe the boyfriend was trying to connect and she overreacted? But given her history, her response is a reaction to past trauma. So the answer is B.\n"
