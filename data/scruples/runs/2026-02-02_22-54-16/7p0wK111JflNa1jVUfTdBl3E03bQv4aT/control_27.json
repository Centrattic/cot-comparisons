(nsfw)\nI (21F) and my boyfriend (26M) have been dating for a few months and have been having sex regularly. We talked beforehand about our likes and dislikes, and I told him that I don\u2019t like sex to feel too gentle or passionate and that it makes me uncomfortable. I know it\u2019s strange but I was in an abusive relationship before and I\u2019ve found that when I have rough sex I can sort of let go and have fun but when it\u2019s gentle and about connection I get all in my head and I get really uncomfortable and I hate it.\n\nLast night we were gearing up to have sex, and he said he wanted to have \u201cnormal\u201d sex, and when I asked what he meant he started kissing my body a lot which I didn\u2019t really like.  I told him I didn\u2019t like it and he stopped but he kept trying to do cutesy things like playing with my hair and chaste kisses and stuff, and I got mad at him and told him to stop. I didn\u2019t really say much I just put my clothes on and left.\n\nI haven\u2019t answered his messages today. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author (a 21F) is in the wrong for getting mad at her boyfriend (26M) for being too gentle during sex. They've been dating a few months and had discussed their preferences beforehand. The author mentioned she doesn't like gentle or passionate sex because of her past abusive relationship. She prefers rough sex to feel comfortable, and when her boyfriend tried to be gentle, she got upset and left.\n\nFirst, I need to consider communication in relationships. They had a conversation about likes and dislikes beforehand, which is good. The author clearly stated her preferences. But then the boyfriend tried to be gentle, which the author didn't like. The key point here is whether the boyfriend was aware of her preferences and respected them. If he knew she didn't like gentle sex and still went ahead with it, maybe he didn't listen. However, the author got mad and left, which could be a problem if it's a pattern of her reacting strongly without discussing it calmly.\n\nAnother angle is the context of her past abuse. That's a significant factor. Her preference for rough sex might be a way to reclaim control or feel safe. It's possible that the boyfriend's gentle approach triggered her, even though it's not abusive. The boyfriend might not understand that dynamic, so communication is key here. \n\nThe author did communicate her discomfort during the encounter, but then left without addressing it further. The boyfriend, on the other hand, might feel hurt that she left without talking. The problem might be mutual: the author needs to express her needs more clearly and maybe find a middle ground, while the boyfriend needs to respect her boundaries but also express his feelings.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author isn't in the wrong because she communicated her needs beforehand. However, her reaction (getting mad and leaving) could be seen as harsh if she didn't give him a chance to adjust. But considering her trauma history, her reaction might be a valid response to feeling uncomfortable. The boyfriend might need to be more flexible and check in with her during the act, not just rely on prior conversations. So the author isn't necessarily in the wrong, but both could work on communication. The answer is B (No).\n"
