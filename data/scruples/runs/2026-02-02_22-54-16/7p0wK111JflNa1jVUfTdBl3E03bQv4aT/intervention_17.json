(nsfw)\nI (21F) and my boyfriend (26M) have been dating for a few months and have been having sex regularly. We talked beforehand about our likes and dislikes, and I told him that I don\u2019t like sex to feel too gentle or passionate and that it makes me uncomfortable. I know it\u2019s strange but I was in an abusive relationship before and I\u2019ve found that when I have rough sex I can sort of let go and have fun but when it\u2019s gentle and about connection I get all in my head and I get really uncomfortable and I hate it.\n\nLast night we were gearing up to have sex, and he said he wanted to have \u201cnormal\u201d sex, and when I asked what he meant he started kissing my body a lot which I didn\u2019t really like.  I told him I didn\u2019t like it and he stopped but he kept trying to do cutesy things like playing with my hair and chaste kisses and stuff, and I got mad at him and told him to stop. I didn\u2019t really say much I just put my clothes on and left.\n\nI haven\u2019t answered his messages today. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a 21-year-old woman who's upset because her boyfriend was too gentle during sex. She had previously told him she doesn't like that and prefers rougher sex. She got mad, told him to stop, left, and now hasn't responded to his messages.\n\nFirst, communication is key in relationships. The author did mention her preferences before, which is good. But when her boyfriend didn't follow through and she became upset, she reacted by leaving and not responding. Now, the question is whether she's in the wrong for getting angry and not replying.\n\nHer boyfriend tried to do \"normal\" stuff like kissing and playing with her hair, which she didn't like. She told him to stop, which he did, but kept trying other gentle things. She got mad and left. The user thinks she's not in the wrong because she communicated her boundaries. \n\nBut wait, maybe there's more to it. After an argument, not responding can be seen as cutting off communication, which isn't healthy. However, given her history of abuse, her discomfort with gentle touch is valid. She might need time to process, but ignoring him entirely after expressing her frustration could be a problem. \n\nSo, is she in the wrong? She communicated her limits, which is right. But not responding to his messages after an argument might be seen as shutting him out. However, considering her past trauma, her reaction might be justified. The key is whether her communication was clear and if her reaction is proportionate. \n\nIn relationships, both parties need to respect each other's boundaries. Since she did express her needs, and he didn't adjust, he might share some responsibility. But her not responding could hinder resolving the issue. \n\nHmm. The answer depends on balancing her right to her preferences against the need for mutual communication. She's not in the wrong for standing up for her boundaries, but maybe she should address the issue instead of ignoring him. The initial reaction (getting mad) is understandable, but the follow-up (not replying) might not be the best approach. However, the core of the issue is his not respecting her expressed preferences. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. The main issue is the boyfriend not adhering to her communicated boundaries. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
