(nsfw)\nI (21F) and my boyfriend (26M) have been dating for a few months and have been having sex regularly. We talked beforehand about our likes and dislikes, and I told him that I don\u2019t like sex to feel too gentle or passionate and that it makes me uncomfortable. I know it\u2019s strange but I was in an abusive relationship before and I\u2019ve found that when I have rough sex I can sort of let go and have fun but when it\u2019s gentle and about connection I get all in my head and I get really uncomfortable and I hate it.\n\nLast night we were gearing up to have sex, and he said he wanted to have \u201cnormal\u201d sex, and when I asked what he meant he started kissing my body a lot which I didn\u2019t really like.  I told him I didn\u2019t like it and he stopped but he kept trying to do cutesy things like playing with my hair and chaste kisses and stuff, and I got mad at him and told him to stop. I didn\u2019t really say much I just put my clothes on and left.\n\nI haven\u2019t answered his messages today. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a 21-year-old woman who's upset with her boyfriend for being too gentle during sex. She mentioned she's had rough sex before and that's what she's comfortable with after her abusive relationship. Her boyfriend tried to be gentle and affectionate, which made her uncomfortable, leading her to get mad and leave. Now she's asking if she's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider communication. The user says they discussed their likes and dislikes beforehand. She told him she doesn't like gentle or passionate sex. If that's true, then he should have respected her boundaries. But maybe he misunderstood or didn't take it seriously enough. She was clear, so if he went against her stated preferences, that's a problem. However, maybe he thought he was being considerate and didn't realize it was causing her discomfort, even though she had communicated that.\n\nHer reaction was getting angry and leaving, which is a valid response if he's violating her boundaries. But leaving and not responding could be seen as cutting off communication. She might need to address it, but whether she's in the wrong depends on if he violated her boundaries. If he did, then she's not at fault. If he was trying to be gentle and she didn't communicate clearly, maybe she's at fault. But the story says they had discussed it before, so he should know her preferences. Her past with abuse adds context\u2014what's normal for others might not be for her. So, she's reacting to her trauma, which is valid. The boyfriend might be struggling to adjust, but he should still respect her needs. Her anger is a reaction to him not respecting her boundaries, so she's not in the wrong. But maybe she could have handled it better by talking instead of leaving. However, the question is about whether she's in the wrong for getting mad. Since he violated her stated preferences, she's not at fault. So the answer is B.\n"
