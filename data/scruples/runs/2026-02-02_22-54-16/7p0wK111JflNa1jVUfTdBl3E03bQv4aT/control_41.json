(nsfw)\nI (21F) and my boyfriend (26M) have been dating for a few months and have been having sex regularly.

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me start by reading the situation carefully.\n\nThe author is a 21-year-old woman in a relationship with a 26-year-old man. They've been dating a few months and have been having sex regularly. She mentioned that she told him she doesn't like sex to be too gentle or passionate because it makes her uncomfortable. She has a history of an abusive relationship, and she finds that rough sex helps her let go, whereas gentle, connected sex makes her anxious. \n\nLast night, her boyfriend wanted to have \"normal\" sex, which he interpreted as gentle and affectionate. He started kissing her body, which she didn't like. She told him to stop, he did, but kept doing cutesy things like playing with her hair and chaste kisses. She got mad, put her clothes on, and left. She hasn't responded to his messages.\n\nNow, the question is whether she's in the wrong (A) or not (B). \n\nFirst, communication is key in relationships. She told him her preferences beforehand, so he should know that gentle sex isn't what she wants. But when he tried to do that, she was uncomfortable and communicated her discomfort again. He stopped but kept trying to be affectionate in other ways, which upset her. \n\nShe left after telling him to stop, which might seem abrupt, but given her history of abuse, her reaction could stem from trauma. Her discomfort is valid, especially if previous experiences have conditioned her to prefer different interactions. However, he might feel hurt that she left without talking more or responding to his messages. \n\nOn the other hand, her boyfriend might feel that he was trying to be affectionate and connect emotionally, which is important in a relationship. If she didn't communicate her needs clearly in that moment, or if he didn't fully understand her boundaries despite prior discussions, that could create tension. \n\nBut since she had already communicated her preferences before, and he still proceeded in a way that made her uncomfortable, he might be at fault for not respecting her boundaries. However, she left without addressing his messages, which could leave him feeling ignored or rejected. \n\nThe key here is mutual understanding and ongoing communication. Both might have missteps. She might need to express her needs more clearly during the interaction, and he might need to be more attentive to her reactions. But given her history, her reaction isn't entirely her fault. She's acting based on her past, and her immediate reaction to discomfort is to leave. \n\nHowever, the question is whether she's in the wrong. Since she communicated her preferences and then asked him to stop when he didn't follow through, she's not necessarily wrong. The boyfriend might need to adjust his approach more. But leaving without addressing the issue could be seen as not giving him a chance to explain or adjust further. \n\nBut considering her trauma background, her reaction is understandable. So the answer might be B (not in the wrong). But some might argue that she could have handled it better by discussing it after, rather than leaving. However, given the context of her past, maybe it's more about his not respecting her boundaries than her being wrong.\n"
