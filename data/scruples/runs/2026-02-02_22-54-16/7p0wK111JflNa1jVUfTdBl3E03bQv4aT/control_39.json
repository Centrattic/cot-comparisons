(nsfw)\nI (21F) and my boyfriend (26M) have been dating for a few months and have been having sex regularly. We talked beforehand about our likes and dislikes, and I told him that I don\u2019t like sex to feel too gentle or passionate and that it makes me uncomfortable. I know it\u2019s strange but I was in an abusive relationship before and I\u2019ve found that when I have rough sex I can sort of let go and have fun but when it\u2019s gentle and about connection I get all in my head and I get really uncomfortable and I hate it.\n\nLast night we were gearing up to have sex, and he said he wanted to have \u201cnormal\u201d sex, and when I asked what he meant he started kissing my body a lot which I didn\u2019t really like.  I told him I didn\u2019t like it and he stopped but he kept trying to do cutesy things like playing with my hair and chaste kisses and stuff, and I got mad at him and told him to stop. I didn\u2019t really say much I just put my clothes on and left.\n\nI haven\u2019t answered his messages today. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a 21-year-old woman who's upset with her boyfriend for being too gentle during sex. She mentioned they had discussed their preferences beforehand, and she told him she doesn't like it when it's gentle or passionate because it makes her uncomfortable. She has a history of being in an abusive relationship and found that rough sex helps her let go, whereas gentle sex makes her anxious.\n\nSo, the key points here are communication and past trauma. She clearly communicated her boundaries and preferences to her boyfriend. He tried to be affectionate with things like kissing her body, playing with her hair, and chaste kisses, which she didn't like. When she told him to stop and left, he continued trying, which led her to walk out.\n\nNow, the question is whether she's in the wrong. From what's given, she set clear expectations. Her discomfort is rooted in past abuse, which is a valid reason for her preferences. If he didn't respect her boundaries after she told him to stop, that's on him. But she also left without responding to his messages, which might be part of the conflict. However, the main issue is whether she's wrong for getting upset. Since she communicated her needs and he didn't honor them, her reaction seems justified. Her trauma history adds context that makes her response understandable. So, the answer should be B (No), she's not in the wrong.\n"
