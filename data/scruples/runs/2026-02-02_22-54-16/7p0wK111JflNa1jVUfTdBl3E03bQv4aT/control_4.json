(nsfw)\nI (21F) and my boyfriend (26M) have been dating for a few months and have been having sex regularly. We talked beforehand about our likes and dislikes, and I told him that I don\u2019t like sex to feel too gentle or passionate and that it makes me uncomfortable. I know it\u2019s strange but I was in an abusive relationship before and I\u2019ve found that when I have rough sex I can sort of let go and have fun but when it\u2019s gentle and about connection I get all in my head and I get really uncomfortable and I hate it.\n\nLast night we were gearing up to have sex, and he said he wanted to have \u201cnormal\u201d sex, and when I asked what he meant he started kissing my body a lot which I didn\u2019t really like.  I told him I didn\u2019t like it and he stopped but he kept trying to do cutesy things like playing with my hair and chaste kisses and stuff, and I got mad at him and told him to stop. I didn\u2019t really say much I just put my clothes on and left.\n\nI haven\u2019t answered his messages today. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that she's a 21-year-old woman in a relationship with a 26-year-old boyfriend. They've been dating for a few months and have been having sex regularly. She mentioned to him before that she doesn't like sex that's too gentle or passionate because it makes her uncomfortable. She has a history of being in an abusive relationship and found that rough sex helps her let go, whereas gentle, emotional sex makes her anxious. \n\nLast night, the boyfriend wanted to have \"normal\" sex, which she interprets as the gentle, cutesy stuff. He started kissing her body, which she didn't like. She told him to stop, and he did, but kept doing things like playing with her hair and chaste kisses. She got mad, put her clothes on, and left. Now she's avoiding his messages and wondering if she's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider communication. The user says she communicated her preferences beforehand. If she told him she doesn't like gentle or passionate sex, then he should respect that. But maybe \"normal\" for him isn't what she expects. Maybe there was a misunderstanding. However, she did tell him she didn't like the kissing, and he stopped but continued with other actions. That could be a problem. He might not be respecting her boundaries after she's given clear signals.\n\nHer reaction was to get mad and leave. Is that excessive? If he crossed the line after she told him to stop, then her reaction is justified. But maybe he was trying to be affectionate in ways she didn't like. But since she explicitly stated her preferences before, he should know what's acceptable. Also, she has a history of abuse, which might make her more sensitive to certain behaviors. Her emotional response could be valid because of that trauma.\n\nOn the other hand, he might have felt rejected or confused. But the key point is whether he was respecting her boundaries. If he continued after she told him to stop, then he's at fault. However, she left without explaining, which might make it harder for him to understand. Still, she initiated the communication, and he didn't adjust. \n\nI think the main issue is about respecting boundaries. If he was aware of her preferences and still proceeded with actions she didn't like, he's in the wrong. Her reaction is a response to him not respecting her, so she's not in the wrong. But maybe there's a need for better communication. However, based on the information, she followed up on her initial communication, and he didn't adjust. So Answer B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
