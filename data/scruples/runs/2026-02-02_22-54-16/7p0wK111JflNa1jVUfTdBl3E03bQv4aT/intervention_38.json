(nsfw)\nI (21F) and my boyfriend (26M) have been dating for a few months and have been having sex regularly. We talked beforehand about our likes and dislikes, and I told him that I don\u2019t like sex to feel too gentle or passionate and that it makes me uncomfortable. I know it\u2019s strange but I was in an abusive relationship before and I\u2019ve found that when I have rough sex I can sort of let go and have fun but when it\u2019s gentle and about connection I get all in my head and I get really uncomfortable and I hate it.\n\nLast night we were gearing up to have sex, and he said he wanted to have \u201cnormal\u201d sex, and when I asked what he meant he started kissing my body a lot which I didn\u2019t really like.  I told him I didn\u2019t like it and he stopped but he kept trying to do cutesy things like playing with my hair and chaste kisses and stuff, and I got mad at him and told him to stop. I didn\u2019t really say much I just put my clothes on and left.\n\nI haven\u2019t answered his messages today. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for getting mad at her boyfriend for being too gentle during sex. The situation involves the author (21F) and her boyfriend (26M) who've been dating for months. They discussed their preferences before, and she mentioned she doesn't like gentle or passionate sex, which makes her uncomfortable due to her past abusive relationship. She prefers rough sex to relax, while gentle sex makes her anxious.\n\nIn the recent incident, the boyfriendsaid he wanted \"normal\" sex, which led to him doing things like kissing her body, playing with her hair, and chaste kisses, which she didn't like. She told him to stop, got mad, and left. She hasn't responded to his messages since.\n\nFirst, the user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. I need to assess both sides. The key points are communication and boundaries. The author clearly communicated her preferences before. The boyfriend might have misunderstood or not taken her preferences seriously enough. However, \"normal\" sex could be subjective. The author's reaction was getting angry and leaving, then not responding. \n\nBut considering her past trauma and her explicit communication, she has valid reasons for her discomfort. The boyfriend's actions might have triggered her anxiety again. While it's important to address communication issues, the author isn't necessarily wrong for setting boundaries. However, her response of getting angry and cutting off communication without explanation could be seen as abrupt. \n\nBut given her history and clear communication, her actions are more about protecting her emotional state. The boyfriend should have respected her boundaries and adjusted accordingly. So the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
