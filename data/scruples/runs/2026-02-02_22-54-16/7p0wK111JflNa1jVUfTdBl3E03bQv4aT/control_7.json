(nsfw)\nI (21F) and my boyfriend (26M) have been dating for a few months and have been having sex regularly. We talked beforehand about our likes and dislikes, and I told him that I don\u2019t like sex to feel too gentle or passionate and that it makes me uncomfortable. I know it\u2019s strange but I was in an abusive relationship before and I\u2019ve found that when I have rough sex I can sort of let go and have fun but when it\u2019s gentle and about connection I get all in my head and I get really uncomfortable and I hate it.\n\nLast night we were gearing up to have sex, and he said he wanted to have \u201cnormal\u201d sex, and when I asked what he meant he started kissing my body a lot which I didn\u2019t really like.  I told him I didn\u2019t like it and he stopped but he kept trying to do cutesy things like playing with my hair and chaste kisses and stuff, and I got mad at him and told him to stop. I didn\u2019t really say much I just put my clothes on and left.\n\nI haven\u2019t answered his messages today. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author (21F) getting mad at her boyfriend (26M) for being too gentle during sex. They had previously discussed their preferences, with her stating she doesn't like gentle or passionate sex, preferring rougher encounters. He tried to be gentle again, she got uncomfortable, told him to stop, left, and hasn't responded to his messages.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether the author is in the wrong. The key points here are communication and boundaries. They had a prior discussion about her preferences, so the boyfriend should have known her limits. However, when she asked him to stop during the encounter, it's possible he didn't adjust quickly enough. The author's reaction was to get angry and leave, which might be seen as a valid response if her boundaries were being crossed. \n\nBut there's also the aspect of his actions. If he had agreed to her preferences beforehand but still proceeded to be gentle, maybe he wasn't respecting her boundaries. However, he did stop when she told him, which shows he tried to listen. The problem is that she got mad and left, and hasn't responded to his messages. Is that inconsiderate? Maybe. She might be avoiding communication, which could be unhealthy. However, given her past with an abusive relationship, her sensitivity is understandable. \n\nAnother angle: the boyfriend's comment about wanting \"normal\" sex might be a clue. If \"normal\" for him is gentle and not what she wanted, then perhaps he didn't fully understand her needs. But since they had discussed this, maybe he should have been more accommodating. His actions after she told him to stop\u2014like the cutesy stuff\u2014might not align with her needs, leading to her frustration. \n\nThe author's anger stems from discomfort due to past trauma. Her reaction, while abrupt, might be a result of her trying to protect herself. However, not responding to his messages could be seen as cutting off communication, which isn't healthy. The boyfriend, on the other hand, might not be at fault for trying to be gentle, as that's part of his style unless she made it clear it's a deal-breaker. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, both might share some. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since she communicated her needs and he didn't fully respect them despite the prior discussion, he might have some responsibility. However, her reaction (leaving and not responding) could be seen as not giving him a chance to adjust. But given her history, her reaction is also a valid self-defense mechanism. \n\nI think the answer isn't straightforward. If the boyfriend truly agreed to her preferences beforehand and still didn't act on them, he's not respecting her boundaries. But if he thought he was being accommodating and she's overreacting, maybe she's in the wrong. However, the key is that she had already communicated her discomfort. If he didn't adjust, he's at fault. Her leaving could be a justified response given the circumstances. So, probably the answer is B (she's not in the wrong) because he should have respected her boundaries more effectively.\n"
