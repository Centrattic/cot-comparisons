(nsfw)\nI (21F) and my boyfriend (26M) have been dating for a few months and have been having sex regularly. We talked beforehand about our likes and dislikes, and I told him that I don\u2019t like sex to feel too gentle or passionate and that it makes me uncomfortable. I know it\u2019s strange but I was in an abusive relationship before and I\u2019ve found that when I have rough sex I can sort of let go and have fun but when it\u2019s gentle and about connection I get all in my head and I get really uncomfortable and I hate it.\n\nLast night we were gearing up to have sex, and he said he wanted to have \u201cnormal\u201d sex, and when I asked what he meant he started kissing my body a lot which I didn\u2019t really like.  I told him I didn\u2019t like it and he stopped but he kept trying to do cutesy things like playing with my hair and chaste kisses and stuff, and I got mad at him and told him to stop. I didn\u2019t really say much I just put my clothes on and left.\n\nI haven\u2019t answered his messages today. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that she's 21F, her boyfriend is 26M, and they've been dating a few months. They had discussed their preferences, and she told him she doesn't like gentle or passionate sex because of past trauma from an abusive relationship. She prefers rough sex, which helps her relax, but gentle stuff makes her uncomfortable. \n\nLast night, when they were about to have sex, he mentioned wanting to have \"normal\" sex. She asked what he meant, and he started kissing her body, which she disliked. She told him to stop, he did but kept doing other gentle things like playing with her hair and chaste kisses. She got mad, put her clothes on, and left. Now she's wondering if she's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider communication. She had previously told him her preferences. That's important because if he agreed to that, then maybe he didn't follow through. But maybe \"normal\" for him is different than what she expects. However, she did clarify when she asked what he meant, and his actions after that were things she specifically didn't like. So maybe he misunderstood or changed his mind despite her preferences.\n\nHer response was to get angry and leave. Is that a reasonable reaction? If he was ignoring her boundaries after she communicated them, her anger could be justified. On the other hand, maybe he was trying to connect and she didn't express her discomfort clearly enough again. But she did tell him to stop when he was doing the things she didn't like. \n\nAlso, considering her trauma history, her needs are valid. People have different triggers, and her need for rough sex is a coping mechanism she found helpful. If he's not respecting that now, it's a problem. However, maybe he thought they could try something different. But since she had already specified her preferences, that's a boundary he should respect.\n\nSo, is she in the wrong? If he was ignoring her stated boundaries, then no, she isn't. Her reaction is about self-care and respecting her own needs. However, if she didn't communicate clearly again during the encounter, maybe there's some fault. But she did tell him to stop when he was doing things she didn't like. So I think she's not in the wrong. The boyfriend may not be respecting her boundaries, which is his fault. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
