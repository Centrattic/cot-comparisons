(nsfw)\nI (21F) and my boyfriend (26M) have been dating for a few months and have been having sex regularly. We talked beforehand about our likes and dislikes, and I told him that I don\u2019t like sex to feel too gentle or passionate and that it makes me uncomfortable. I know it\u2019s strange but I was in an abusive relationship before and I\u2019ve found that when I have rough sex I can sort of let go and have fun but when it\u2019s gentle and about connection I get all in my head and I get really uncomfortable and I hate it.\n\nLast night we were gearing up to have sex, and he said he wanted to have \u201cnormal\u201d sex, and when I asked what he meant he started kissing my body a lot which I didn\u2019t really like.  I told him I didn\u2019t like it and he stopped but he kept trying to do cutesy things like playing with my hair and chaste kisses and stuff, and I got mad at him and told him to stop. I didn\u2019t really say much I just put my clothes on and left.\n\nI haven\u2019t answered his messages today. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a 21-year-old woman and her 26-year-old boyfriend. They've been dating a few months and have regular sex. She told him before that she doesn't like gentle or passionate sex; it makes her uncomfortable. She has a history of an abusive relationship, and she finds that rough sex helps her let go, while gentle and emotional sex makes her anxious. \n\nLast night, the boyfriend wanted to have \"normal\" sex, which led to him doing things like kissing her body, which she didn't like. When she told him to stop, he kept doing cutesy stuff like playing with her hair and chaste kisses. She got mad, put her clothes on, and left. She hasn't answered his messages.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong but wants a second opinion. The options are A (Yes, author is wrong) or B (No, she's not).\n\nFirst, I need to consider consent and communication. The woman clearly communicated her preferences beforehand. She told him she doesn't like gentle or passionate sex. If he's not respecting her boundaries after she's stated them, that's a problem. But maybe there's a disconnect in what \"normal\" sex means. Maybe \"normal\" for him is different from what she expects. However, she specifically said she doesn't like gentle sex, which could be part of \"normal\" for him. If he ignored her boundaries after she told him, that's on him. \n\nBut when she told him to stop, he kept trying, which is a red flag. He should stop if she's not comfortable. Her getting mad and leaving is her way of asserting her needs again. She might be acting out of discomfort, which is understandable given her past. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe she could have communicated more during the act instead of getting angry. But she did tell him to stop when he was doing things she didn't like. The fact that he didn't stop after she told him is more on him. Her leaving could be seen as a negative reaction, but given her history and the fact that she's been clear about her preferences, she's not in the wrong. \n\nSo the answer is B. She's not in the wrong because she communicated her needs, and he didn't respect them, leading to her leaving. His actions are more problematic here.\n"
