(nsfw)\nI (21F) and my boyfriend (26M) have been dating for a few months and have been having sex regularly. We talked beforehand about our likes and dislikes, and I told him that I don\u2019t like sex to feel too gentle or passionate and that it makes me uncomfortable. I know it\u2019s strange but I was in an abusive relationship before and I\u2019ve found that when I have rough sex I can sort of let go and have fun but when it\u2019s gentle and about connection I get all in my head and I get really uncomfortable and I hate it.\n\nLast night we were gearing up to have sex, and he said he wanted to have \u201cnormal\u201d sex, and when I asked what he meant he started kissing my body a lot which I didn\u2019t really like.  I told him I didn\u2019t like it and he stopped but he kept trying to do cutesy things like playing with my hair and chaste kisses and stuff, and I got mad at him and told him to stop. I didn\u2019t really say much I just put my clothes on and left.\n\nI haven\u2019t answered his messages today. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for getting mad at her boyfriend for being too gentle during sex. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The woman, 21F, has a history of being in an abusive relationship. She specifically told her boyfriend, 26M, that she prefers rough sex and doesn't like gentle or passionate sex because it makes her uncomfortable. They had talked about their likes and dislikes beforehand. Last time, when he tried to be gentle, she got upset, told him to stop, and left. Now she's wondering if she's the asshole here.\n\nSo, the key points here are communication and boundaries. She communicated her preferences clearly. The boyfriend, however, didn't follow through with what she asked for. He tried to be gentle, which she had previously said made her uncomfortable. She got upset because he wasn't respecting her boundaries, even though she had already given feedback.\n\nBut wait, when she told him she didn't like the gentle stuff, maybe he was trying to adjust but misunderstood? Or maybe he didn't take her communication seriously. She mentioned that he kept doing cutesy things even after she told him to stop. That's a boundary violation. \n\nHer reaction was to get mad and leave. Is that justified? She had a valid reason\u2014she was uncomfortable and had communicated that. His actions disregarded her boundaries, so her response could be seen as a self-defense mechanism. However, leaving and not responding might be seen as cutting off communication, which is a problem. \n\nBut considering her history of abuse, her discomfort with gentle sex might be trauma-related. It's important to validate her feelings. If she had already told him, and he continued, he's at fault for not respecting her wishes. Her getting upset is a natural response to someone not respecting her boundaries. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe she could have handled it better by talking more instead of leaving, but the question is about whether she's in the wrong. The main issue is his lack of adherence to her communicated preferences and her reaction to that. So, she's not in the wrong here. The boyfriend is the one who didn't follow her instructions. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
