(nsfw)\nI (21F) and my boyfriend (26M) have been dating for a few months and have been having sex regularly. We talked beforehand about our likes and dislikes, and I told him that I don\u2019t like sex to feel too gentle or passionate and that it makes me uncomfortable. I know it\u2019s strange but I was in an abusive relationship before and I\u2019ve found that when I have rough sex I can sort of let go and have fun but when it\u2019s gentle and about connection I get all in my head and I get really uncomfortable and I hate it.\n\nLast night we were gearing up to have sex, and he said he wanted to have \u201cnormal\u201d sex, and when I asked what he meant he started kissing my body a lot which I didn\u2019t really like.  I told him I didn\u2019t like it and he stopped but he kept trying to do cutesy things like playing with my hair and chaste kisses and stuff, and I got mad at him and told him to stop. I didn\u2019t really say much I just put my clothes on and left.\n\nI haven\u2019t answered his messages today. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a 21F and her 26M boyfriend. They've been dating for a few months and have been having regular sex. The girl mentioned she doesn't like gentle or passionate sex because of past abuse, and prefers rough sex to feel comfortable. Last night, the boyfriend tried to be gentle with \"normal\" sex, which she didn't like. She told him, he stopped but kept doing cutesy things. She got mad, put clothes on, left, and hasn't replied.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the main points. She communicated her preferences before. The boyfriend tried to do gentle things, which she didn't like. She expressed her discomfort, he stopped but continued with other things. She reacted by getting angry and leaving. The question is whether she's in the wrong.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. She did communicate her needs, but maybe he misunderstood. However, after she told him to stop, he kept trying, which isn't good. But she also reacted with anger and left, not responding. So, is she in the wrong? Well, she had a reason due to past trauma. But her reaction might have been abrupt. However, she did communicate her needs. The boyfriend should have respected her boundaries. If he tried again after she told him to stop, that's an issue. Her reaction, though, might be a valid response to her discomfort. So, maybe she's not in the wrong. But maybe there's a middle ground. However, the question is about whether she's in the wrong. The answer is B (No). Because she communicated her needs and the boyfriend didn't fully respect them after being told. Her reaction is understandable given her history. The blame isn't entirely hers.\n"
