(nsfw)\nI (21F) and my boyfriend (26M) have been dating for a few months and have been having sex regularly. We talked beforehand about our likes and dislikes, and I told him that I don\u2019t like sex to feel too gentle or passionate and that it makes me uncomfortable. I know it\u2019s strange but I was in an abusive relationship before and I\u2019ve found that when I have rough sex I can sort of let go and have fun but when it\u2019s gentle and about connection I get all in my head and I get really uncomfortable and I hate it.\n\nLast night we were gearing up to have sex, and he said he wanted to have \u201cnormal\u201d sex, and when I asked what he meant he started kissing my body a lot which I didn\u2019t really like.  I told him I didn\u2019t like it and he stopped but he kept trying to do cutesy things like playing with my hair and chaste kisses and stuff, and I got mad at him and told him to stop. I didn\u2019t really say much I just put my clothes on and left.\n\nI haven\u2019t answered his messages today. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for getting mad at her boyfriend for being too gentle during sex. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author is a 21-year-old female in a relationship with a 26-year-old male. They've been dating a few months and have been having regular sex. They discussed their preferences beforehand, and the author made it clear she doesn't like gentle or passionate sex\u2014it makes her uncomfortable. She has a history of being in an abusive relationship, which might be affecting her current preferences. She finds rough sex more comfortable, allowing her to let go, while gentle, emotional sex makes her anxious and uncomfortable.\n\nThe incident in question happened when the boyfriend wanted to have \"normal\" sex. The author interpreted this as the gentle, emotional approach. When he kissed her body and did cutesy things like playing with her hair and giving chaste kisses, she got mad and left. She hasn't responded to his messages since.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but wants to know if the AI agrees. The options are A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no, not in the wrong).\n\nSo, key points to consider: communication, past trauma, consent, and mutual respect. The author communicated her preferences upfront. However, the boyfriend's actions during the encounter didn't align with her preferences. The author got upset and left. But did she overreact?\n\nWait, but the boyfriend said he wanted \"normal\" sex. What does that mean exactly? The author might have assumed he meant rough sex, but maybe in his mind, \"normal\" is different. However, the author had already communicated her dislikes. The boyfriend might not have adhered to her boundaries, leading her to feel uncomfortable. If he didn't adjust after she told him to stop, that's a problem. She then left, which is her right if she feels violated or uncomfortable.\n\nHer history of abuse might influence her current preferences. It's important to validate her feelings. She wasn't okay with the gentle approach, so her reaction is understandable. However, the boyfriend might have felt hurt or confused, leading to him sending messages and her not responding. But the initial issue was his failure to respect her communicated boundaries once she expressed them again during the encounter.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? She followed up on her boundaries and left when he didn't stop. That's a form of self-protection. If he continued after she told him to stop, that's a breach of consent. Her getting mad is a reasonable response to being disregarded. So, B (not in the wrong) seems correct. The boyfriend might be at fault for not respecting her boundaries after she asked him to stop.\n"
