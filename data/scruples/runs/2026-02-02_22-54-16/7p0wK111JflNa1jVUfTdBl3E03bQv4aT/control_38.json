(nsfw)\nI (21F) and my boyfriend (26M) have been dating for a few months and have been having sex regularly. We talked beforehand about our likes and dislikes, and I told him that I don\u2019t like sex to feel too gentle or passionate and that it makes me uncomfortable. I know it\u2019s strange but I was in an abusive relationship before and I\u2019ve found that when I have rough sex I can sort of let go and have fun but when it\u2019s gentle and about connection I get all in my head and I get really uncomfortable and I hate it.\n\nLast night we were gearing up to have sex, and he said he wanted to have \u201cnormal\u201d sex, and when I asked what he meant he started kissing my body a lot which I didn\u2019t really like.  I told him I didn\u2019t like it and he stopped but he kept trying to do cutesy things like playing with my hair and chaste kisses and stuff, and I got mad at him and told him to stop. I didn\u2019t really say much I just put my clothes on and left.\n\nI haven\u2019t answered his messages today. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a 21-year-old woman and her 26-year-old boyfriend. They've been dating a few months and have been having sex regularly. The woman mentioned she doesn't like sex to be too gentle or passionate because it makes her uncomfortable, and she prefers rough sex. She had an abusive relationship before, which probably influences her preferences. \n\nNow, during their last interaction, the boyfriend wanted to have \"normal\" sex. The author asked what he meant, and he started kissing her body, which she didn't like. She told him to stop, he did, but kept doing cutesy things like playing with her hair and chaste kisses. She got mad, put her clothes on, and left. She's now ignoring his messages and is asking if she's in the wrong (AITA).\n\nFirst, I need to consider consent and communication. The woman had previously communicated her preferences. She told him she doesn't like gentle or passionate sex. So, if he started doing something she didn't like, that's a problem. But maybe he didn't fully understand her boundaries? However, she did tell him she didn't like it when he kissed her body, so he should have respected that. \n\nBut wait, when she told him to stop, he stopped but continued with other cutesy actions. Maybe he was trying to be affectionate, but she found those actions uncomfortable too. The key here is whether she communicated her boundaries clearly. She said she didn't like the gentle/passionate approach, and she told him to stop when he started kissing her body. \n\nHer reaction was to get mad and leave, and not respond to his messages. Is that justified? Well, if he was ignoring her boundaries after she told him to stop, then she has a right to be upset. But maybe he was trying to adjust? Or maybe he thought the cutesy stuff was okay? Without more context, it's a bit ambiguous. \n\nHowever, the woman had already communicated her preferences. If she told him that gentle stuff makes her uncomfortable and he proceeded anyway, even after she asked him to stop, that's a breach of her boundaries. In that case, she's not in the wrong. However, her leaving and not responding might be seen as harsh, but given her trauma history, it's understandable. \n\nAnother angle is the concept of mutual consent and adjusting. If both partners have different preferences, they need to find a middle ground. But the woman has specific needs due to her past. If he's not respecting those, then she's justified in her reaction. \n\nSo considering all that, the answer is likely B (No, she's not in the wrong). She communicated her boundaries, he didn't respect them after she told him to stop, and her reaction, while abrupt, is a response to her discomfort and past trauma. The boyfriend might have misread the situation, but the onus is on him to follow through with her stated preferences.\n"
