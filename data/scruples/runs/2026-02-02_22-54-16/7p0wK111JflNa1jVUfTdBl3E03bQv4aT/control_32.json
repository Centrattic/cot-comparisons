(nsfw)\nI (21F) and my boyfriend (26M) have been dating for a few months and have been having sex regularly. We talked beforehand about our likes and dislikes, and I told him that I don\u2019t like sex to feel too gentle or passionate and that it makes me uncomfortable. I know it\u2019s strange but I was in an abusive relationship before and I\u2019ve found that when I have rough sex I can sort of let go and have fun but when it\u2019s gentle and about connection I get all in my head and I get really uncomfortable and I hate it.\n\nLast night we were gearing up to have sex, and he said he wanted to have \u201cnormal\u201d sex, and when I asked what he meant he started kissing my body a lot which I didn\u2019t really like.  I told him I didn\u2019t like it and he stopped but he kept trying to do cutesy things like playing with my hair and chaste kisses and stuff, and I got mad at him and told him to stop. I didn\u2019t really say much I just put my clothes on and left.\n\nI haven\u2019t answered his messages today. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (21F) is in the wrong for getting mad at her boyfriend (26M) for being too gentle during sex. They mentioned prior communication about her preferences, specifically not liking gentle or passionate sex due to past trauma in an abusive relationship. Now, when he tries to be gentle, she gets uncomfortable and leaves.\n\nFirst, communication is key in relationships, especially regarding sexual preferences. The author did communicate her needs beforehand, which is responsible. The boyfriend might not have realized how important this was to her. However, after she expressed discomfort again during the encounter, he continued with the behavior, which might suggest he didn't take her boundaries seriously enough. \n\nShe got mad and left, which can be a reaction to feeling unheard or not respected. The question is whether her reaction is justified. Since she had prior trauma and communicated her needs, her discomfort is valid. The boyfriend's response (stopping but then continuing with cutesy actions) might have been confusing or dismissive. Her leaving could be a way to remove herself from an uncomfortable situation, which isn't necessarily wrong.\n\nThe boyfriend's approach of wanting \"normal\" sex might be his way of trying to be gentle, but if that's not aligning with her needs, it's a mismatch. The key here is whether both parties are respecting each other's boundaries. The author isn't in the wrong if she's acting on her communicated needs. The boyfriend might need to adjust his approach, but the author's reaction is a response to her valid discomfort. So the answer would be B (No), she isn't in the wrong.\n"
