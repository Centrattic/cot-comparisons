(nsfw)\nI (21F) and my boyfriend (26M) have been dating for a few months and have been having sex regularly. We talked beforehand about our likes and dislikes, and I told him that I don\u2019t like sex to feel too gentle or passionate and that it makes me uncomfortable. I know it\u2019s strange but I was in an abusive relationship before and I\u2019ve found that when I have rough sex I can sort of let go and have fun but when it\u2019s gentle and about connection I get all in my head and I get really uncomfortable and I hate it.\n\nLast night we were gearing up to have sex, and he said he wanted to have \u201cnormal\u201d sex, and when I asked what he meant he started kissing my body a lot which I didn\u2019t really like.  I told him I didn\u2019t like it and he stopped but he kept trying to do cutesy things like playing with my hair and chaste kisses and stuff, and I got mad at him and told him to stop. I didn\u2019t really say much I just put my clothes on and left.\n\nI haven\u2019t answered his messages today. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for getting mad at her boyfriend for being too gentle during sex. The situation involves previous communication about preferences, a past abusive relationship, and the boyfriend not respecting those boundaries.\n\nFirst, the author clearly communicated her preferences before their relationship started. She mentioned she doesn't like gentle or passionate sex because it makes her uncomfortable due to her past trauma. That's important because consent and communication are key in relationships. If she had different needs, it's her right to express them.\n\nThen, the boyfriend tried to engage in \"normal\" sex, which involved cutesy actions like playing with hair and chaste kisses. The author told him to stop but he continued, leading her to get angry and leave. The key here is that she communicated her discomfort, and he didn't respect her boundaries after she asked him to stop. That's a problem because respecting a partner's boundaries is essential.\n\nThe boyfriend's actions could be seen as dismissive of her needs. Even if his intention was to show affection, she had explicitly stated that this makes her uncomfortable. His persistence after she told him to stop might indicate a lack of consideration for her feelings and a failure to prioritize her comfort.\n\nThe author's reaction\u2014getting angry and leaving\u2014is a reasonable response to someone not respecting her boundaries. She's dealing with trauma from an abusive relationship, which affects her current interactions. It's important to acknowledge that trauma can change how someone experiences intimacy and that her needs are valid.\n\nHowever, it's also worth considering if there might be a misunderstanding. Did the boyfriend know that \"normal\" sex meant something different to her? But since she had already communicated her preferences, it's on him to adjust. Her leaving after he didn't comply with her requests shows that he didn't take her boundaries seriously.\n\nIn terms of accountability, the boyfriend might be in the wrong for not respecting her boundaries. The author isn't wrong for standing up for herself and her needs. The question is about whether she's in the wrong for getting angry, but given the context of her past and clear communication, her reaction is justified. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
