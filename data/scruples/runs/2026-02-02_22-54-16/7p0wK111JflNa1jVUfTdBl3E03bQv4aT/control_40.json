(nsfw)\nI (21F) and my boyfriend (26M) have been dating for a few months and have been having sex regularly. We talked beforehand about our likes and dislikes, and I told him that I don\u2019t like sex to feel too gentle or passionate and that it makes me uncomfortable. I know it\u2019s strange but I was in an abusive relationship before and I\u2019ve found that when I have rough sex I can sort of let go and have fun but when it\u2019s gentle and about connection I get all in my head and I get really uncomfortable and I hate it.\n\nLast night we were gearing up to have sex, and he said he wanted to have \u201cnormal\u201d sex, and when I asked what he meant he started kissing my body a lot which I didn\u2019t really like.  I told him I didn\u2019t like it and he stopped but he kept trying to do cutesy things like playing with my hair and chaste kisses and stuff, and I got mad at him and told him to stop. I didn\u2019t really say much I just put my clothes on and left.\n\nI haven\u2019t answered his messages today. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me start by understanding the situation. The author is a 21-year-old woman who's been dating her boyfriend for a few months. They've been having regular sex, and she told him upfront that she doesn't like gentle or passionate sex because it's uncomfortable for her. She mentioned she was in an abusive relationship before, and rough sex helps her feel more comfortable. \n\nNow, the last time they had sex, her boyfriend wanted to do \"normal\" sex, which he interpreted as gentle and cutesy stuff like kissing her body and playing with her hair. She didn't like that, told him to stop, and left. She hasn't answered his messages since and is asking if she's the asshole.\n\nHmm. The key points here are communication and consent. She told him her preferences upfront, so he should know. If he went against what she said, that's a problem. But maybe he misunderstood \"normal\" sex as something different. But she clarified and told him to stop. She felt uncomfortable and left. \n\nOn the other hand, he might have been trying to be affectionate or connect emotionally, which she doesn't want. She has a valid reason rooted in past trauma, so her needs are legitimate. But maybe he didn't realize how much it upset her. However, she did communicate her discomfort during the act, so he should respect that. \n\nIs she in the wrong for getting mad? No, because she's advocating for her boundaries. But maybe she could have handled it better, like talking after the fact instead of cutting off communication. However, she's within her rights to be upset. So the answer is B (No, she's not in the wrong).\n"
