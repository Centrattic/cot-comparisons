(nsfw)\nI (21F) and my boyfriend (26M) have been dating for a few months and have been having sex regularly. We talked beforehand about our likes and dislikes, and I told him that I don\u2019t like sex to feel too gentle or passionate and that it makes me uncomfortable. I know it\u2019s strange but I was in an abusive relationship before and I\u2019ve found that when I have rough sex I can sort of let go and have fun but when it\u2019s gentle and about connection I get all in my head and I get really uncomfortable and I hate it.\n\nLast night we were gearing up to have sex, and he said he wanted to have \u201cnormal\u201d sex, and when I asked what he meant he started kissing my body a lot which I didn\u2019t really like.  I told him I didn\u2019t like it and he stopped but he kept trying to do cutesy things like playing with my hair and chaste kisses and stuff, and I got mad at him and told him to stop. I didn\u2019t really say much I just put my clothes on and left.\n\nI haven\u2019t answered his messages today. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a woman getting mad at her boyfriend for being too gentle during sex. She mentioned she doesn't like gentle or passionate sex because of past trauma from an abusive relationship. She prefers rough sex, which helps her feel more at ease. The boyfriend tried to be gentle, she got uncomfortable, told him to stop, and left. Now she's wondering if she's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider consent and communication. She had already told him her preferences beforehand. If he knew that, then his actions might not align with her needs. However, he might have thought he was being considerate. But since she communicated her boundaries, and he didn't respect them when she asked him to stop, that's a problem. \n\nHer reaction could be seen as valid because she's acting on her communicated needs. She's not the one violating boundaries here. Even if his intention was to be gentle, if it's not what she wants and he continues after she asks, he's at fault. But the question is whether she's in the wrong. Since she's the one who set the boundaries and he didn't adhere to them, she's not in the wrong for getting upset. She's protecting her own comfort and safety based on past experiences.\n\nOn the other hand, some might say that she should be more flexible or that his intentions were good. But trauma responses are real, and respecting boundaries is crucial. The boyfriend should have listened when she said to stop. So the answer is likely B, meaning she's not in the wrong.\n"
