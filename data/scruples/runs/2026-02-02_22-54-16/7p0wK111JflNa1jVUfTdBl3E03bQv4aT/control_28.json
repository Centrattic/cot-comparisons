(nsfw)\nI (21F) and my boyfriend (26M) have been dating for a few months and have been having sex regularly. We talked beforehand about our likes and dislikes, and I told him that I don\u2019t like sex to feel too gentle or passionate and that it makes me uncomfortable. I know it\u2019s strange but I was in an abusive relationship before and I\u2019ve found that when I have rough sex I can sort of let go and have fun but when it\u2019s gentle and about connection I get all in my head and I get really uncomfortable and I hate it.\n\nLast night we were gearing up to have sex, and he said he wanted to have \u201cnormal\u201d sex, and when I asked what he meant he started kissing my body a lot which I didn\u2019t really like.  I told him I didn\u2019t like it and he stopped but he kept trying to do cutesy things like playing with my hair and chaste kisses and stuff, and I got mad at him and told him to stop. I didn\u2019t really say much I just put my clothes on and left.\n\nI haven\u2019t answered his messages today. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author getting mad at her boyfriend for being too gentle during sex. She mentioned that she doesn't like gentle or passionate sex because of her past abusive relationship. She told him her preferences beforehand, but he still went ahead with gentle actions, leading her to get upset and leave.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context of her past. She has a history of abuse, which might make her more sensitive to certain types of physical interactions. She communicated her boundaries to him initially, so he was aware of her dislikes. When he didn't follow those boundaries during their recent encounter, she reacted by getting angry and leaving. \n\nNow, the key points are: did she communicate her preferences? Yes. Did he not follow them? It seems like it. Her reaction was to get mad and leave, which might be seen as overreacting, but given her trauma, it's understandable. The boyfriend's actions might have disregarded her boundaries, which is a problem. However, she didn't explain her discomfort during the encounter, just told him to stop. Maybe she could have handled it differently, like discussing her feelings in the moment instead of leaving. \n\nBut considering her trauma, her reaction is valid. She's not in the wrong for expressing her needs and being upset when they're not respected. The boyfriend should have adhered to her boundaries. However, the question is about her being in the wrong. Since she communicated her preferences and he didn't follow them, her anger is justified. The answer should be B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
