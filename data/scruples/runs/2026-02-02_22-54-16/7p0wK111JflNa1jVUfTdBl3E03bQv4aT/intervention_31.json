(nsfw)\nI (21F) and my boyfriend (26M) have been dating for a few months and have been having sex regularly. We talked beforehand about our likes and dislikes, and I told him that I don\u2019t like sex to feel too gentle or passionate and that it makes me uncomfortable. I know it\u2019s strange but I was in an abusive relationship before and I\u2019ve found that when I have rough sex I can sort of let go and have fun but when it\u2019s gentle and about connection I get all in my head and I get really uncomfortable and I hate it.\n\nLast night we were gearing up to have sex, and he said he wanted to have \u201cnormal\u201d sex, and when I asked what he meant he started kissing my body a lot which I didn\u2019t really like.  I told him I didn\u2019t like it and he stopped but he kept trying to do cutesy things like playing with my hair and chaste kisses and stuff, and I got mad at him and told him to stop. I didn\u2019t really say much I just put my clothes on and left.\n\nI haven\u2019t answered his messages today. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves a 21-year-old woman and her 26-year-old boyfriend. They've been dating a few months and have been having regular sex. She mentioned to him before that she doesn't like gentle or passionate sex, which makes her uncomfortable. She has a history of an abusive relationship and finds rough sex more comfortable. \n\nThe recent incident: the boyfriend wanted to have \"normal\" sex, which led to him kissing her body, which she didn't like. She told him to stop, he kept doing cutesy things like playing with her hair and chaste kisses. She got mad, put on clothes, and left. She hasn't responded to his messages.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong but wants a second opinion. The answer should be A (Yes, in the wrong) or B (No, not in the wrong). \n\nFirst, I need to consider consent and communication. The woman communicated her preferences before, so the boyfriend should have respected that. If he didn't take her previous statements seriously, that's on him. However, during the interaction, she told him to stop, and he continued. That's a red flag. She then left the situation, which is a valid response to feeling uncomfortable. \n\nBut, there's the aspect of her not responding to messages. Maybe she's being abrupt or not giving him a chance to explain. But given her past trauma, her reaction is understandable. The key points are: she communicated her boundaries, he didn't respect them when she told him again, she took action to remove herself from the situation. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong because she followed up on her initial communication, tried to stop the behavior as it happened, and left. The boyfriend is at fault for not respecting her boundaries. Therefore, answer B.\n"
