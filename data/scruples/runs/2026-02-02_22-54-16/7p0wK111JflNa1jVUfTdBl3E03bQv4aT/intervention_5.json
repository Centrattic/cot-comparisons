(nsfw)\nI (21F) and my boyfriend (26M) have been dating for a few months and have been having sex regularly. We talked beforehand about our likes and dislikes, and I told him that I don\u2019t like sex to feel too gentle or passionate and that it makes me uncomfortable. I know it\u2019s strange but I was in an abusive relationship before and I\u2019ve found that when I have rough sex I can sort of let go and have fun but when it\u2019s gentle and about connection I get all in my head and I get really uncomfortable and I hate it.\n\nLast night we were gearing up to have sex, and he said he wanted to have \u201cnormal\u201d sex, and when I asked what he meant he started kissing my body a lot which I didn\u2019t really like.  I told him I didn\u2019t like it and he stopped but he kept trying to do cutesy things like playing with my hair and chaste kisses and stuff, and I got mad at him and told him to stop. I didn\u2019t really say much I just put my clothes on and left.\n\nI haven\u2019t answered his messages today. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a 21-year-old woman and her 26-year-old boyfriend who has been having sex regularly. She had previously communicated that she doesn't like gentle or passionate sex and prefers rougher sex. However, when he tried to be gentle, she got mad and left.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the communication aspect. She told him her preferences before, so he should know. But when he chose to be gentle again, maybe he thought he was following her earlier advice. Wait, she said she doesn't like gentle or passionate. So \"normal\" sex for her is rough. He might have misunderstood \"normal\" as his usual way, which is gentle. That's a possible miscommunication.\n\nThen, when she asked him to stop, he did but kept doing cutesy things. She got mad and left. The question is whether her reaction is justified. She mentioned a history of abuse, which affects her comfort in certain types of intimacy. That's a key point. Trauma can influence sexual preferences and boundaries, so her discomfort with gentle sex might be valid for her, even if it's unexpected. \n\nHowever, walking out and not responding to messages might be seen as extreme. The boyfriend might feel hurt or rejected because he was trying to connect, and she didn't explain her feelings clearly. But she had already communicated her preferences, so maybe she's frustrated because he's not respecting that. \n\nIt's important to assess if she gave him a chance to adjust after the initial request. He stopped but continued with other actions. She might feel that he's not taking her boundaries seriously. On the other hand, his actions could be non-sexual and he might not see them as part of the same preference. \n\nAlso, the fact that she hasn't answered his messages could be seen as dismissive. Maybe she needs time to process, but the boyfriend might feel ignored. The core issue is about respecting communication and boundaries. If she clearly stated her preferences and he still proceeded, he's in the wrong. But if there was a misunderstanding, then it's a communication problem on both sides. \n\nSince she had already communicated her dislike of gentle sex, her getting mad when he's doing that again could be justified. The key here is whether he respected her boundaries after she told him. If he didn't, then she's not in the wrong. But if there was a miscommunication, maybe both are at fault. The answer might depend on the clarity of her communication and his response. Given the context, I think she's not in the wrong because she communicated her needs, and the situation might require better understanding from both sides. Answer B.\n"
