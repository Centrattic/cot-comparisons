(nsfw)\nI (21F) and my boyfriend (26M) have been dating for a few months and have been having sex regularly. We talked beforehand about our likes and dislikes, and I told him that I don\u2019t like sex to feel too gentle or passionate and that it makes me uncomfortable. I know it\u2019s strange but I was in an abusive relationship before and I\u2019ve found that when I have rough sex I can sort of let go and have fun but when it\u2019s gentle and about connection I get all in my head and I get really uncomfortable and I hate it.\n\nLast night we were gearing up to have sex, and he said he wanted to have \u201cnormal\u201d sex, and when I asked what he meant he started kissing my body a lot which I didn\u2019t really like.  I told him I didn\u2019t like it and he stopped but he kept trying to do cutesy things like playing with my hair and chaste kisses and stuff, and I got mad at him and told him to stop. I didn\u2019t really say much I just put my clothes on and left.\n\nI haven\u2019t answered his messages today. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The 21-year-old woman (21F) and her 26-year-old boyfriend (26M) have been dating a few months. They've had sex regularly. She told him upfront that she doesn't like gentle or passionate sex because of her past abusive relationship. She prefers rough sex, which helps her feel more comfortable. Last night, he wanted to do \"normal\" sex, which he interpreted as gentle and affectionate, like kissing her body and playing with her hair. She told him she didn't like it, he stopped but kept trying cutesy stuff. She got mad, left, and hasn't responded to his messages.\n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong. The user wants a yes or no answer based on the given info.\n\nLet me analyze. The key points here are communication, consent, and boundaries. She communicated her preferences clearly beforehand. He didn't stick to those preferences and tried to do things she didn't like. When she told him to stop, he didn't comply. She then expressed her frustration by leaving, which is a valid reaction when someone isn't respecting her boundaries. \n\nHer emotional response is influenced by a past abusive relationship. That context is important because it explains why she's uncomfortable with gentle sex. She's not being irrational; it's a personal trauma response. He, on the other hand, didn't respect her boundaries after she told him to stop. Even after she became upset and left, he continued with the affectionate gestures, which shows a lack of respect for her comfort zone.\n\nIn relationships, respecting each other's boundaries is crucial. Since he didn't adhere to what she communicated, his actions were problematic. Her reaction, while perhaps abrupt, is understandable given her history and the fact that he wasn't respecting her wishes. She has the right to set her boundaries and express her discomfort. The boyfriend's actions led to her leaving, so he's more at fault here. The author isn't in the wrong for standing up for her needs and safety.\n"
