(nsfw)\nI (21F) and my boyfriend (26M) have been dating for a few months and have been having sex regularly. We talked beforehand about our likes and dislikes, and I told him that I don\u2019t like sex to feel too gentle or passionate and that it makes me uncomfortable. I know it\u2019s strange but I was in an abusive relationship before and I\u2019ve found that when I have rough sex I can sort of let go and have fun but when it\u2019s gentle and about connection I get all in my head and I get really uncomfortable and I hate it.\n\nLast night we were gearing up to have sex, and he said he wanted to have \u201cnormal\u201d sex, and when I asked what he meant he started kissing my body a lot which I didn\u2019t really like.  I told him I didn\u2019t like it and he stopped but he kept trying to do cutesy things like playing with my hair and chaste kisses and stuff, and I got mad at him and told him to stop. I didn\u2019t really say much I just put my clothes on and left.\n\nI haven\u2019t answered his messages today. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for getting mad at her boyfriend for being too gentle during sex. The situation is that the author, a 21-year-old woman, has a history of being in an abusive relationship. She mentioned to her boyfriend that she doesn't like gentle or passionate sex because it makes her uncomfortable, preferring rougher sex to feel like she can let go. Now, her boyfriend wanted to do \"normal\" sex, which involved more gentle actions like kissing and chaste kisses, which she didn't like. She told him to stop and left, then ignored his messages.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if she's in the wrong. The key points here are communication and boundaries. She had previously communicated her preferences to her boyfriend, so if he didn't take that into account, maybe he's at fault. However, he might have misunderstood or tried to adjust in a different way. Also, her history of abuse plays a role in her current preferences. Her reaction\u2014getting mad and leaving\u2014could be seen as a way to enforce her boundaries, but maybe there's a way to handle it better.\n\nBut the question is about whether she's in the wrong. If she clearly communicated her needs and he still proceeded in a way that made her uncomfortable, then she's not in the wrong for being upset. On the other hand, if she didn't give him a chance to adjust or communicate her discomfort effectively, maybe there's some fault. However, she did tell him she didn't like it and he kept trying, so she's within her rights to be upset. Also, her trauma history is a significant factor here. People have different needs, especially after trauma, and her reaction is a boundary-setting action. So I think she's not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
