(nsfw)\nI (21F) and my boyfriend (26M) have been dating for a few months and have been having sex regularly. We talked beforehand about our likes and dislikes, and I told him that I don\u2019t like sex to feel too gentle or passionate and that it makes me uncomfortable. I know it\u2019s strange but I was in an abusive relationship before and I\u2019ve found that when I have rough sex I can sort of let go and have fun but when it\u2019s gentle and about connection I get all in my head and I get really uncomfortable and I hate it.\n\nLast night we were gearing up to have sex, and he said he wanted to have \u201cnormal\u201d sex, and when I asked what he meant he started kissing my body a lot which I didn\u2019t really like.  I told him I didn\u2019t like it and he stopped but he kept trying to do cutesy things like playing with my hair and chaste kisses and stuff, and I got mad at him and told him to stop. I didn\u2019t really say much I just put my clothes on and left.\n\nI haven\u2019t answered his messages today. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for getting mad at her boyfriend for being too gentle during sex. The scenario involves a 21-year-old woman who's had a previous abusive relationship. She told her boyfriend she doesn't like gentle or passionate sex because it makes her uncomfortable. She prefers rough sex to feel like she can \"let go,\" but when he was gentle, she got upset, told him to stop, and left.\n\nFirst, I need to consider consent and communication. The author clearly communicated her preferences beforehand. The boyfriend, however, didn't follow those preferences, which could be an issue. If she had told him her likes and dislikes, and he still proceeded with what she found uncomfortable, that's a problem. Communication is key in any relationship, especially regarding sexual preferences. If he didn't respect her boundaries, that's on him.\n\nBut then, the question is whether she's in the wrong for getting angry. She expressed her discomfort and he continued with the behavior she asked to stop. Her reaction might be a result of her past trauma. Getting upset in that situation could be a valid response given her history. However, walking out and not responding could be seen as abrupt. But considering the context, maybe she felt overwhelmed and needed space. Her actions might be a way to cope with the discomfort.\n\nAnother angle: the boyfriend's intention to have \"normal\" sex might imply he had his own preferences. But if the author already communicated her needs, his approach could be dismissive of hers. However, maybe he thought he was being considerate, but misread her signals. Still, if she had given explicit instructions and he didn't follow them, that's a red flag.\n\nAlso, the fact that she's in a new relationship (a few months) might mean they're still figuring out each other's boundaries. She might need to work on expressing her needs more clearly, but the initial communication was there. The boyfriend's failure to adjust could be an issue of not respecting her boundaries, which would place responsibility on him.\n\nIn terms of accountability, the author isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries and reacting to their violation. Trauma survivors often have specific needs, and those should be respected. The boyfriend's actions of continuing with the unwanted behavior after she told him to stop could be the real issue here. The author's anger is a reaction to her needs not being met, which is understandable.\n\nBut there's also the aspect of communication breakdown. They might need to talk more about how to meet each other's needs. However, the question is about who is in the wrong. Since the author communicated her preferences and the boyfriend didn't respect them, the onus is on him for not following through. The author's reaction, while perhaps intense, is a response to her discomfort, which isn't her fault. So the answer would be B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
