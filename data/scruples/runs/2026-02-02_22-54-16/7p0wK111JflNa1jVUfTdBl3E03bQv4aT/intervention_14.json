(nsfw)\nI (21F) and my boyfriend (26M) have been dating for a few months and have been having sex regularly. We talked beforehand about our likes and dislikes, and I told him that I don\u2019t like sex to feel too gentle or passionate and that it makes me uncomfortable. I know it\u2019s strange but I was in an abusive relationship before and I\u2019ve found that when I have rough sex I can sort of let go and have fun but when it\u2019s gentle and about connection I get all in my head and I get really uncomfortable and I hate it.\n\nLast night we were gearing up to have sex, and he said he wanted to have \u201cnormal\u201d sex, and when I asked what he meant he started kissing my body a lot which I didn\u2019t really like.  I told him I didn\u2019t like it and he stopped but he kept trying to do cutesy things like playing with my hair and chaste kisses and stuff, and I got mad at him and told him to stop. I didn\u2019t really say much I just put my clothes on and left.\n\nI haven\u2019t answered his messages today. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a 21-year-old woman who's upset because her boyfriend was too gentle during sex. She mentioned having discussed her preferences beforehand, saying she doesn't like gentle or passionate sex because of her past abusive relationship. She found that rough sex helps her let go, while gentle stuff makes her uncomfortable. The boyfriend tried to be affectionate with kisses and playing with her hair, leading her to get mad and leave.\n\nFirst, the key points here are communication and consent. She had already told him her preferences, so he should have taken that into account. However, when he changed his approach, maybe he thought he was being considerate. But she's clearly uncomfortable now. Her reaction was to leave and not respond, which is a valid way to set a boundary if she needs space.\n\nThe boyfriend might not have realized that his actions were crossing her boundaries again, even if they were intended to be nice. Since she had communicated her needs, he should have respected that. Her getting upset is understandable given her history. The fact that she tried to communicate her discomfort again during the encounter shows she's trying to be clear.\n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong. Since she communicated her boundaries and the boyfriend didn't adhere to them despite her previous input, she's not at fault. She's acting to protect her comfort and mental health. The boyfriend might need to work on understanding her specific needs better. So the answer is B.\n"
