(nsfw)\nI (21F) and my boyfriend (26M) have been dating for a few months and have been having sex regularly. We talked beforehand about our likes and dislikes, and I told him that I don\u2019t like sex to feel too gentle or passionate and that it makes me uncomfortable. I know it\u2019s strange but I was in an abusive relationship before and I\u2019ve found that when I have rough sex I can sort of let go and have fun but when it\u2019s gentle and about connection I get all in my head and I get really uncomfortable and I hate it.\n\nLast night we were gearing up to have sex, and he said he wanted to have \u201cnormal\u201d sex, and when I asked what he meant he started kissing my body a lot which I didn\u2019t really like.  I told him I didn\u2019t like it and he stopped but he kept trying to do cutesy things like playing with my hair and chaste kisses and stuff, and I got mad at him and told him to stop. I didn\u2019t really say much I just put my clothes on and left.\n\nI haven\u2019t answered his messages today. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (21F) is in the wrong for getting mad at her boyfriend (26M) for being too gentle during sex. She mentioned they had discussed their preferences beforehand, and she specifically told him she doesn't like gentle or passionate sex. Her past abusive relationship might affect her comfort with certain types of intimacy.\n\nSo, the boyfriend wanted to have \"normal\" sex, which he interpreted as gentle, and even after she told him she didn't like the cutesy things, he kept doing them. The author got upset and left, ignoring his messages since. \n\nFirst, communication is key in relationships, especially regarding sexual preferences. The author communicated her boundaries, so if the boyfriend didn't respect them, that's on him. However, the boyfriend might have misunderstood what \"normal\" sex meant here. The author's discomfort is rooted in her past, which is a valid reason for her preferences. \n\nBut the author left abruptly without addressing the issue further. She might need to reflect on whether her response was proportional. However, given her history and the fact that he didn't heed her requests, her reaction could be justified. \n\nThe main point is that the boyfriend didn't respect her boundaries after she communicated them. That's a significant issue. The author isn't in the wrong for expressing her discomfort, especially after prior discussions. So, the answer should be B (No).\n"
