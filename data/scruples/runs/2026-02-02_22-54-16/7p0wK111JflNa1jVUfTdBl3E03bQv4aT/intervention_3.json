(nsfw)\nI (21F) and my boyfriend (26M) have been dating for a few months and have been having sex regularly. We talked beforehand about our likes and dislikes, and I told him that I don\u2019t like sex to feel too gentle or passionate and that it makes me uncomfortable. I know it\u2019s strange but I was in an abusive relationship before and I\u2019ve found that when I have rough sex I can sort of let go and have fun but when it\u2019s gentle and about connection I get all in my head and I get really uncomfortable and I hate it.\n\nLast night we were gearing up to have sex, and he said he wanted to have \u201cnormal\u201d sex, and when I asked what he meant he started kissing my body a lot which I didn\u2019t really like.  I told him I didn\u2019t like it and he stopped but he kept trying to do cutesy things like playing with my hair and chaste kisses and stuff, and I got mad at him and told him to stop. I didn\u2019t really say much I just put my clothes on and left.\n\nI haven\u2019t answered his messages today. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a 21-year-old woman and her 26-year-old boyfriend. They've been dating a few months and have regular sex. She told him she doesn't like gentle or passionate sex because of a past abusive relationship and prefers rough sex to feel comfortable. Last night, he tried to be gentle, kissing her body and doing cutesy things, which she didn't like. She got mad, told him to stop, put her clothes on, and left. Now she's not responding to his messages.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether she's in the wrong. The key points here are communication and mutual consent. She had previously communicated her preferences, so if the boyfriend didn't heed that, maybe he's at fault. But the boyfriend might have thought he was expressing normal sex, and perhaps there was a misunderstanding. However, she clearly stated her preferences, so if he ignored them after being told, that's a problem. Her reaction was to get mad and leave, which could be seen as a valid response to his not respecting her boundaries. The fact that she mentioned her past abuse adds context to her discomfort with gentle sex. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the boyfriend was trying to connect more emotionally, which is a common aspect of intimacy. But since she already communicated her discomfort with that, he should adjust. The question is whether her reaction was justified. She did tell him to stop, so she's standing up for her boundaries, which is important. The boyfriend might need to reflect on why he didn't follow her previous instructions. \n\nIn terms of AITA, the user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. I need to decide if that's the case. The main factors are communication, respect for boundaries, and mutual consent. Since she was clear and he didn't respect that, she's not in the wrong. Her reaction is a response to his non-compliance. So the answer should be B.\n"
