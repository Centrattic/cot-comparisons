(nsfw)\nI (21F) and my boyfriend (26M) have been dating for a few months and have been having sex regularly. We talked beforehand about our likes and dislikes, and I told him that I don\u2019t like sex to feel too gentle or passionate and that it makes me uncomfortable. I know it\u2019s strange but I was in an abusive relationship before and I\u2019ve found that when I have rough sex I can sort of let go and have fun but when it\u2019s gentle and about connection I get all in my head and I get really uncomfortable and I hate it.\n\nLast night we were gearing up to have sex, and he said he wanted to have \u201cnormal\u201d sex, and when I asked what he meant he started kissing my body a lot which I didn\u2019t really like.  I told him I didn\u2019t like it and he stopped but he kept trying to do cutesy things like playing with my hair and chaste kisses and stuff, and I got mad at him and told him to stop. I didn\u2019t really say much I just put my clothes on and left.\n\nI haven\u2019t answered his messages today. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about getting mad at her boyfriend for being too gentle during sex. She mentioned she doesn't like gentle or passionate sex because of her past in an abusive relationship. She told him this before, but he still went with a gentler approach, leading to her getting upset and leaving.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author communicated her preferences beforehand. Her boyfriend might not have taken that into account, but maybe he misunderstood or thought he was being considerate. She felt uncomfortable because of her past trauma, which is a valid reason for her preferences. However, she reacted by getting angry and leaving, not responding to his messages.\n\nIs she in the wrong? Well, she had communicated her needs, so he should respect them. If he didn't adjust after being told, that's on him. But her reaction of getting mad and cutting off communication could be seen as not addressing the issue calmly. However, given her trauma, her emotional response might be justified. The boyfriend's actions might have been a mistake, but she also needs to communicate clearly. Maybe both have some responsibility. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since she had communicated her needs and he didn't follow through, maybe the blame isn't solely on her. But her reaction could be seen as over the top. Hmm. I think the answer is B (not in the wrong) because she had valid reasons and communicated, and the boyfriend should have respected her preferences. But her not responding to messages might be a problem. However, the main issue is his not following her boundaries, so she's not at fault.\n"
