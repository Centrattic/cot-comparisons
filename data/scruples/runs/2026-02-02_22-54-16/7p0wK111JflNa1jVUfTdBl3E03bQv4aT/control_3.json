(nsfw)\nI (21F) and my boyfriend (26M) have been dating for a few months and have been having sex regularly. We talked beforehand about our likes and dislikes, and I told him that I don\u2019t like sex to feel too gentle or passionate and that it makes me uncomfortable. I know it\u2019s strange but I was in an abusive relationship before and I\u2019ve found that when I have rough sex I can sort of let go and have fun but when it\u2019s gentle and about connection I get all in my head and I get really uncomfortable and I hate it.\n\nLast night we were gearing up to have sex, and he said he wanted to have \u201cnormal\u201d sex, and when I asked what he meant he started kissing my body a lot which I didn\u2019t really like.  I told him I didn\u2019t like it and he stopped but he kept trying to do cutesy things like playing with my hair and chaste kisses and stuff, and I got mad at him and told him to stop. I didn\u2019t really say much I just put my clothes on and left.\n\nI haven\u2019t answered his messages today. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a 21-year-old woman and her 26-year-old boyfriend. They've been dating a few months and have sex regularly. She's told him before that she doesn't like gentle or passionate sex because of her past abusive relationship. She prefers rough sex to feel more comfortable. Last night, he wanted to have \"normal\" sex, which involved gentle actions like kissing her body and playing with her hair. She got uncomfortable, told him to stop, left, and hasn't responded to his messages. Now she's asking if she's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider communication. She mentioned she had already told him her preferences. If he didn't respect that, maybe he's at fault. But he might not have understood \"normal\" sex meaning something different than what she expected. However, she clarified her discomfort during the act. So he should have adjusted his actions once she expressed she didn't like it. He stopped when she told him but kept doing things she didn't like, which might be his fault.\n\nHer reaction: she got mad, put clothes on, and left. Then ignored messages. Is this reasonable? She was clear about her needs, and he didn't fully respect them. Her emotional response is valid given her trauma. Leaving the situation to avoid further discomfort makes sense. Ignoring messages could be seen as cutting off communication, but she might need space. However, it's also important to communicate after. Maybe she should reach out, but in terms of being in the wrong, she's not necessarily at fault. She communicated her boundaries and tried to stop the behavior when he didn't follow. So the answer is B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
