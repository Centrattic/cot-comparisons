(nsfw)\nI (21F) and my boyfriend (26M) have been dating for a few months and have been having sex regularly. We talked beforehand about our likes and dislikes, and I told him that I don\u2019t like sex to feel too gentle or passionate and that it makes me uncomfortable. I know it\u2019s strange but I was in an abusive relationship before and I\u2019ve found that when I have rough sex I can sort of let go and have fun but when it\u2019s gentle and about connection I get all in my head and I get really uncomfortable and I hate it.\n\nLast night we were gearing up to have sex, and he said he wanted to have \u201cnormal\u201d sex, and when I asked what he meant he started kissing my body a lot which I didn\u2019t really like.  I told him I didn\u2019t like it and he stopped but he kept trying to do cutesy things like playing with my hair and chaste kisses and stuff, and I got mad at him and told him to stop. I didn\u2019t really say much I just put my clothes on and left.\n\nI haven\u2019t answered his messages today. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author is a 21-year-old woman in a relationship with a 26-year-old boyfriend. They've been dating a few months and have had sex regularly. She mentioned to him before that she doesn't like sex to be too gentle or passionate because it makes her uncomfortable. She has a history of being in an abusive relationship, and she finds that rough sex helps her let go and have fun, whereas gentle, affectionate sex makes her anxious and uncomfortable. \n\nLast night, her boyfriend wanted to have \"normal\" sex. He explained this by doing things like kissing her body, which she didn't like. When she told him to stop, he did, but then continued with \"cutesy\" things like playing with her hair and chaste kisses. She got mad, put her clothes on, and left. She hasn't replied to his messages since and is asking if she's at fault.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but wants to know my opinion. The options are A (yes, she's in the wrong) or B (no, she's not).\n\nFirst, I need to consider communication. The author had already told her boyfriend her preferences. That seems like good communication on her part. However, the boyfriend's actions didn't align with what she had communicated. If he didn't take her preferences into account, that's on him. But maybe there's a misunderstanding here?\n\nThe boyfriend's idea of \"normal\" sex might be different from what the author considers normal. If she had communicated her boundaries clearly and he still didn't respect them, then he's at fault. But she also stopped him when he was doing things she didn't like, which is appropriate.\n\nHer reaction of getting mad and leaving could be seen as a valid response to someone not respecting her boundaries. However, not responding to his messages might be seen as cutting off communication, which could be problematic. But given her emotional state, maybe that's just her needing space.\n\nHer history of trauma is important here. Trauma can affect how someone experiences intimacy, and it's possible that her preferences are a coping mechanism. The boyfriend should be understanding of that, especially since she had communicated it to him before.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend might be trying to connect emotionally, which is a normal part of intimacy. If he felt that the sex should be more about connection, but she's not comfortable with that, there's a mismatch in their needs. However, he should respect her boundaries even if they differ from his. \n\nThe key point here is whether the boyfriend respected her boundaries. She told him her preferences, and he didn't follow through. She had a right to be upset. Her leaving might have been abrupt, but given her discomfort, it's a way to remove herself from an uncomfortable situation. \n\nThe fact that she hasn't replied to his messages could be her needing time to process, which is understandable. However, not communicating at all might not be the healthiest approach long-term, but in the immediate situation, it's not necessarily wrong.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. The boyfriend didn't respect her boundaries, and her reaction is a valid response to that. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
