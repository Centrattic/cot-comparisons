(nsfw)\nI (21F) and my boyfriend (26M) have been dating for a few months and have been having sex regularly. We talked beforehand about our likes and dislikes, and I told him that I don\u2019t like sex to feel too gentle or passionate and that it makes me uncomfortable. I know it\u2019s strange but I was in an abusive relationship before and I\u2019ve found that when I have rough sex I can sort of let go and have fun but when it\u2019s gentle and about connection I get all in my head and I get really uncomfortable and I hate it.\n\nLast night we were gearing up to have sex, and he said he wanted to have \u201cnormal\u201d sex, and when I asked what he meant he started kissing my body a lot which I didn\u2019t really like.  I told him I didn\u2019t like it and he stopped but he kept trying to do cutesy things like playing with my hair and chaste kisses and stuff, and I got mad at him and told him to stop. I didn\u2019t really say much I just put my clothes on and left.\n\nI haven\u2019t answered his messages today. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the person in the \"Am I the Asshole\" (AITA) story is in the wrong. Let me break this down. The situation is about the author (21F) being upset with her boyfriend (26M) for being too gentle during sex. She mentioned she doesn't like gentle or passionate sex because of her past in an abusive relationship. She prefers rough sex as it helps her let go and have fun, whereas gentle acts make her uncomfortable. Last night, he tried to do things she didn't like, like playing with her hair and chaste kisses, which she told him to stop. She then got mad and left. She hasn't responded to his messages.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author has communicated her preferences clearly before. She's in a relationship where she feels safe to express her boundaries. The boyfriend, on the other hand, might be trying to be affectionate or connect emotionally, which is a common approach in romantic relationships. However, the author's past trauma affects her current preferences. \n\nThe key points here are communication and respect of boundaries. The author told him her dislikes, so he should know that. But when she asked him to stop during the interaction, he kept trying cutesy things, which could be seen as not respecting her boundaries after she made them known. That's a red flag because even if he didn't understand her reasons, he should have stopped once she said so. \n\nHowever, the boyfriend's actions might stem from a place of caring or trying to be loving. If he's used to a certain way of intimacy and she's different, maybe he's trying to adjust but not effectively. But since she had already expressed her discomfort with gentle sex, his not stopping after she told him again points to a lack of respect for her boundaries. \n\nThe author's reaction is understandable in that she felt uncomfortable and needed to leave. But how she handled it\u2014leaving without much explanation, not responding to messages\u2014might be perceived as harsh or not engaging in a discussion. The boyfriend might feel hurt or confused, not knowing how to adjust. \n\nIn terms of being in the wrong, the person who is at fault is the one who doesn't respect boundaries. The author communicated her needs, and the boyfriend continued despite her telling him to stop. So, he's the one violating her boundaries. However, the author could have been more proactive in addressing his actions during the moment, perhaps by explaining further or guiding him. But she did tell him to stop, which he didn't. \n\nAnother angle: rough sex can be consensual, but it's important that both partners are comfortable with it. The boyfriend might not be into rough sex, so if she wants that, maybe they need to discuss it more. However, the author has already mentioned that. \n\nSo, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for getting mad and leaving when he didn't respect her boundaries. The boyfriend might be the one at fault here. But the author could be seen as not explaining her needs enough, leading to misunderstandings. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since she communicated her preferences and he still continued, she's not in the wrong for being upset. Her leaving might be a reaction to her discomfort, which is valid. The boyfriend's actions of not respecting her boundaries after being told are the issue. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The boyfriend didn't respect her boundaries, so her reaction is justified. The author's right to feel safe and respected in her preferences is key here. Even if her method of handling it (leaving and ignoring messages) isn't the healthiest, it doesn't make her in the wrong. The boyfriend's actions are the problem.\n"
