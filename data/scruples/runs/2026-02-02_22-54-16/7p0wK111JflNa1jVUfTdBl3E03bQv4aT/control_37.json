(nsfw)\nI (21F) and my boyfriend (26M) have been dating for a few months and have been having sex regularly. We talked beforehand about our likes and dislikes, and I told him that I don\u2019t like sex to feel too gentle or passionate and that it makes me uncomfortable. I know it\u2019s strange but I was in an abusive relationship before and I\u2019ve found that when I have rough sex I can sort of let go and have fun but when it\u2019s gentle and about connection I get all in my head and I get really uncomfortable and I hate it.\n\nLast night we were gearing up to have sex, and he said he wanted to have \u201cnormal\u201d sex, and when I asked what he meant he started kissing my body a lot which I didn\u2019t really like.  I told him I didn\u2019t like it and he stopped but he kept trying to do cutesy things like playing with my hair and chaste kisses and stuff, and I got mad at him and told him to stop. I didn\u2019t really say much I just put my clothes on and left.\n\nI haven\u2019t answered his messages today. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that she's 21, her boyfriend is 26, and they've been dating a few months. They've been having sex regularly. She told him before that she doesn't like it when sex is too gentle or passionate because it makes her uncomfortable. She mentions she was in an abusive relationship before, and rough sex helps her let go and have fun, whereas gentle and emotional sex makes her anxious.\n\nLast night, the boyfriend wanted to have \"normal\" sex, which led to him being more affectionate with kisses and touching her hair. She got uncomfortable, told him to stop, and left. Now she's wondering if she's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider consent and communication. She had previously communicated her boundaries. The boyfriend tried to engage in activities she had said she didn't like. Even though he stopped when she told him, he continued with other \"cutesy\" things. That's a problem because he didn't fully respect her boundaries after she expressed discomfort. \n\nHer reaction was to get mad and leave, which is understandable given her history. She hasn't responded to his messages, which might be because she's still upset or processing her feelings. \n\nKey points: Did she communicate her boundaries? Yes. Did he respect them? Initially, he stopped when she told him, but then continued with other actions. Is her reaction justified? Given her trauma, it's valid. She's not wrong for being upset when her boundaries are crossed. \n\nThe boyfriend might have misinterpreted her previous communication, thinking \"normal\" sex meant gentle, but she had specified she didn't want that. So he's also at fault for not fully understanding or respecting her preferences. The author isn't in the wrong for standing up for her boundaries. \n\nSo the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
