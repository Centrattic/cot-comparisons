(nsfw)\nI (21F) and my boyfriend (26M) have been dating for a few months and have been having sex regularly. We talked beforehand about our likes and dislikes, and I told him that I don\u2019t like sex to feel too gentle or passionate and that it makes me uncomfortable. I know it\u2019s strange but I was in an abusive relationship before and I\u2019ve found that when I have rough sex I can sort of let go and have fun but when it\u2019s gentle and about connection I get all in my head and I get really uncomfortable and I hate it.\n\nLast night we were gearing up to have sex, and he said he wanted to have \u201cnormal\u201d sex, and when I asked what he meant he started kissing my body a lot which I didn\u2019t really like.  I told him I didn\u2019t like it and he stopped but he kept trying to do cutesy things like playing with my hair and chaste kisses and stuff, and I got mad at him and told him to stop. I didn\u2019t really say much I just put my clothes on and left.\n\nI haven\u2019t answered his messages today. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is at fault for getting angry at her boyfriend for being too gentle during sex. The key points here are communication and prior discussions.\n\nThe author mentioned that they had already talked about her preferences, and she explicitly told him she doesn't like gentle or passionate sex because of her past. So he was aware of her boundaries. However, when they had sex, he tried things that she found uncomfortable, like \"normal\" sex and cutesy gestures. She got mad and left, then didn't respond to his messages.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend should have respected her boundaries. Even if \"normal\" sex is his default, she had communicated her needs. If he couldn't adjust, maybe there's an issue there. But he tried to stop when she asked, which is a positive step. However, if he kept pushing the cutesy stuff after she asked him to stop, that's a problem. He might not have fully respected her limits after she expressed discomfort.\n\nThe author's reaction was to get angry and leave. She did communicate her discomfort, which is important. But not responding to his messages might be cutting off communication, which isn't helpful. However, given her history of abuse, her emotional response is understandable. She might be processing trauma, so her reaction isn't unreasonable.\n\nBut is she in the wrong? If he knew her preferences and still tried to engage in behaviors she had specified she didn't like, he's at fault for not respecting her boundaries. The author's anger is a justified response to him not honoring her boundaries. However, her not responding to messages could be seen as not giving him a chance to address the issue. But considering the context of her past, maybe she's in a place where she needs space. \n\nSo, the boyfriend's actions were inconsiderate. The author's reaction is valid given her history. Neither is entirely in the wrong, but the main fault lies with the boyfriend for not respecting her boundaries. However, the author's response (leaving and not communicating) might not be the best approach for resolving the issue. But given the trauma context, it's a complex situation. The answer might be that the author isn't in the wrong (B) because he should have respected her boundaries, but her response could be seen as part of her healing process.\n"
