(nsfw)\nI (21F) and my boyfriend (26M) have been dating for a few months and have been having sex regularly. We talked beforehand about our likes and dislikes, and I told him that I don\u2019t like sex to feel too gentle or passionate and that it makes me uncomfortable. I know it\u2019s strange but I was in an abusive relationship before and I\u2019ve found that when I have rough sex I can sort of let go and have fun but when it\u2019s gentle and about connection I get all in my head and I get really uncomfortable and I hate it.\n\nLast night we were gearing up to have sex, and he said he wanted to have \u201cnormal\u201d sex, and when I asked what he meant he started kissing my body a lot which I didn\u2019t really like.  I told him I didn\u2019t like it and he stopped but he kept trying to do cutesy things like playing with my hair and chaste kisses and stuff, and I got mad at him and told him to stop. I didn\u2019t really say much I just put my clothes on and left.\n\nI haven\u2019t answered his messages today. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a woman (21F) and her boyfriend (26M) who've been dating a few months. She told him beforehand that she doesn't like gentle or passionate sex; she prefers rough sex because of her past abusive relationship. During a recent encounter, the boyfriend tried to be gentle, doing things like kissing her body, playing with her hair, and chaste kisses, which made her uncomfortable. She got mad, left, and hasn't replied to his messages.\n\nFirst, I need to consider consent and communication. She had already communicated her preferences to him. He should have respected that. But he went ahead with what he wanted, ignoring her boundaries. That's a red flag. His actions could be seen as dismissive of her needs, especially given her history of abuse. \n\nHowever, it's also important to note that healthy communication in relationships is crucial. If he misunderstood her preferences or thought he was respecting them but she still felt uncomfortable, there's room for discussion. But since she had already told him her dislikes, and he proceeded anyway, that's a problem. \n\nHer reaction: she got mad and left. That's a valid emotional response. She felt her boundaries were crossed. Leaving might seem abrupt, but given her past trauma, it's a protective mechanism. The boyfriend's attempt to connect through gentle actions might have triggered her, and her reaction is understandable. \n\nNow, is she in the wrong? If he didn't respect her communicated boundaries, then no. She's acting to protect her own comfort and mental health. However, if there was a misunderstanding or if he thought he was being respectful but she still felt uncomfortable, maybe there's a need for more open dialogue. But based on the info given, she had stated her preferences clearly, and he didn't follow them. So, she's not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
