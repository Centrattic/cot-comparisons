(nsfw)\nI (21F) and my boyfriend (26M) have been dating for a few months and have been having sex regularly. We talked beforehand about our likes and dislikes, and I told him that I don\u2019t like sex to feel too gentle or passionate and that it makes me uncomfortable. I know it\u2019s strange but I was in an abusive relationship before and I\u2019ve found that when I have rough sex I can sort of let go and have fun but when it\u2019s gentle and about connection I get all in my head and I get really uncomfortable and I hate it.\n\nLast night we were gearing up to have sex, and he said he wanted to have \u201cnormal\u201d sex, and when I asked what he meant he started kissing my body a lot which I didn\u2019t really like.  I told him I didn\u2019t like it and he stopped but he kept trying to do cutesy things like playing with my hair and chaste kisses and stuff, and I got mad at him and told him to stop. I didn\u2019t really say much I just put my clothes on and left.\n\nI haven\u2019t answered his messages today. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a woman getting mad at her boyfriend for being too gentle during sex. She mentioned she doesn't like gentle or passionate sex because of past trauma from an abusive relationship. She told him her preferences before, but he still did gentle things, and she got upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider communication between partners. The author did communicate her needs beforehand, which is important. The boyfriend, however, might not have understood or followed through correctly. He said he wanted \"normal\" sex, but his actions didn't align with her preferences. Maybe he didn't take her previous communication seriously enough. \n\nThe author getting mad is a reaction to her discomfort. Since she has a history of abuse, certain behaviors might trigger her. It's important to validate her feelings here. The boyfriend's actions, while possibly well-intentioned, might not consider her trauma's impact. \n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend might have thought he was being affectionate or trying to connect. But if the author explicitly stated her dislikes, he should respect that. The fact that she left and hasn't responded could be a communication breakdown on both sides. \n\nSo, who's at fault? The author isn't wrong for setting boundaries and reacting to triggers. The boyfriend might be at fault for not respecting her communicated preferences. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
