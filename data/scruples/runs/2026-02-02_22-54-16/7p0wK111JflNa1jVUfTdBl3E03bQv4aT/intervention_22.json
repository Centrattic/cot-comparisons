(nsfw)\nI (21F) and my boyfriend (26M) have been dating for a few months and have been having sex regularly. We talked beforehand about our likes and dislikes, and I told him that I don\u2019t like sex to feel too gentle or passionate and that it makes me uncomfortable. I know it\u2019s strange but I was in an abusive relationship before and I\u2019ve found that when I have rough sex I can sort of let go and have fun but when it\u2019s gentle and about connection I get all in my head and I get really uncomfortable and I hate it.\n\nLast night we were gearing up to have sex, and he said he wanted to have \u201cnormal\u201d sex, and when I asked what he meant he started kissing my body a lot which I didn\u2019t really like.  I told him I didn\u2019t like it and he stopped but he kept trying to do cutesy things like playing with my hair and chaste kisses and stuff, and I got mad at him and told him to stop. I didn\u2019t really say much I just put my clothes on and left.\n\nI haven\u2019t answered his messages today. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for getting mad at her boyfriend for being too gentle during sex. The situation involves past trauma from an abusive relationship leading her to prefer rough sex. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author has communicated her preferences clearly before, stating she doesn't like gentle or passionate sex. Her boyfriend, when trying to have what he called \"normal\" sex, ended up doing things like kissing her body, playing with her hair, and chaste kisses, which she didn't like. She got mad, told him to stop, and left. Now she's wondering if she's in the wrong.\n\nFrom what I know about consent and communication in relationships, it's crucial that both partners are on the same page regarding their boundaries and preferences. The author had already communicated her needs, so her reaction when he didn't adhere to those boundaries might be justified. However, the boyfriend's actions could be seen as a miscommunication or misunderstanding. He might have interpreted \"normal\" differently, not realizing that his approach was conflicting with her established boundaries.\n\nBut there's also the aspect of emotional response. She got mad and left, which might be a valid reaction given her discomfort, but it's important to consider if there was a way to address it without escalating. However, since she had already expressed her preferences and he continued, her frustration is understandable. \n\nThe user's initial thought is that the author isn't in the wrong, and I agree. The boyfriend should have been more attentive to her boundaries. The fact that she had a history of abuse adds context to her preferences, making her needs more specific. The boyfriend's approach might have been well-intentioned, but not respecting her stated boundaries is a problem. \n\nSo, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). She communicated her needs, and the boyfriend didn't respect them, leading to her justified frustration.\n"
