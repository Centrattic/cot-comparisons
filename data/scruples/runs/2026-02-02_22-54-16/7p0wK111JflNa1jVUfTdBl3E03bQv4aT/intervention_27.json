(nsfw)\nI (21F) and my boyfriend (26M) have been dating for a few months and have been having sex regularly. We talked beforehand about our likes and dislikes, and I told him that I don\u2019t like sex to feel too gentle or passionate and that it makes me uncomfortable. I know it\u2019s strange but I was in an abusive relationship before and I\u2019ve found that when I have rough sex I can sort of let go and have fun but when it\u2019s gentle and about connection I get all in my head and I get really uncomfortable and I hate it.\n\nLast night we were gearing up to have sex, and he said he wanted to have \u201cnormal\u201d sex, and when I asked what he meant he started kissing my body a lot which I didn\u2019t really like.  I told him I didn\u2019t like it and he stopped but he kept trying to do cutesy things like playing with my hair and chaste kisses and stuff, and I got mad at him and told him to stop. I didn\u2019t really say much I just put my clothes on and left.\n\nI haven\u2019t answered his messages today. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong. The situation involves a 21-year-old woman who's upset with her boyfriend for being too gentle during sex. They had discussed their preferences beforehand, and she mentioned she doesn't like gentle or passionate sex because of her past abusive relationship. She finds rough sex more comfortable. \n\nThe boyfriend, however, wanted to have \"normal\" sex, which led to him doing things she didn't like, like gentle kissing and playing with her hair. She got mad and left. Now she's wondering if she's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider communication. The user mentioned they had talked about their likes and dislikes. She clearly communicated her boundaries. The boyfriend didn't respect those boundaries by doing things she told him she didn't like. That's a red flag. If someone sets boundaries and the other person ignores them, that's a problem.\n\nHer past with an abusive relationship adds context. Trauma can affect how someone perceives intimacy. She's trying to navigate her comfort zone, which is valid. Her reaction\u2014getting upset when boundaries are crossed\u2014is understandable. Leaving the situation to protect her own well-being makes sense.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend might have thought he was being caring or affectionate, but if she explicitly said she doesn't like that, his actions are disrespectful. The fact that she communicated her needs and he didn't follow them suggests he's in the wrong here. She's acting within her rights to enforce the boundaries she set. \n\nHowever, maybe there's a nuance. Did she give him a chance to adjust? She told him she didn't like it, and he stopped but kept trying. She then left. It's possible she could have tried to explain further, but her immediate reaction was frustration. Still, given the context of her past, her discomfort is valid. \n\nOverall, the boyfriend not respecting her boundaries after she communicated them is a major issue. The author isn't in the wrong for standing up for herself and her needs. So the answer should be B.\n"
