(nsfw)\nI (21F) and my boyfriend (26M) have been dating for a few months and have been having sex regularly. We talked beforehand about our likes and dislikes, and I told him that I don\u2019t like sex to feel too gentle or passionate and that it makes me uncomfortable. I know it\u2019s strange but I was in an abusive relationship before and I\u2019ve found that when I have rough sex I can sort of let go and have fun but when it\u2019s gentle and about connection I get all in my head and I get really uncomfortable and I hate it.\n\nLast night we were gearing up to have sex, and he said he wanted to have \u201cnormal\u201d sex, and when I asked what he meant he started kissing my body a lot which I didn\u2019t really like.  I told him I didn\u2019t like it and he stopped but he kept trying to do cutesy things like playing with my hair and chaste kisses and stuff, and I got mad at him and told him to stop. I didn\u2019t really say much I just put my clothes on and left.\n\nI haven\u2019t answered his messages today. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is a 21-year-old woman who's asking if she's in the wrong for getting mad at her boyfriend because he was too gentle during sex. She mentioned they had talked about their preferences beforehand, and she told him she doesn't like gentle or passionate sex because of her past abusive relationship. She prefers rough sex to feel comfortable, and when he tried to be gentle with cutesy stuff, she got upset and left.\n\nFirst, I need to consider communication. She did communicate her boundaries and preferences, which is important. He might not have understood or followed through, which could be an issue. But does that make her in the wrong? She's acting based on her communicated needs. However, her reaction\u2014getting mad and leaving\u2014might be seen as a valid response to someone not respecting her boundaries.\n\nHer past trauma with abuse complicates things. People's preferences can be shaped by past experiences, even if others don't understand them. If she's honest about her needs, she's not necessarily wrong for having them. But there's also the aspect of mutual respect in the relationship. Is her reaction proportionate? She did tell him she didn't like it, and he continued, which could mean he wasn't respecting her boundaries after she set them. Her leaving might be a way to remove herself from the situation, which could be a healthy boundary. \n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend's intention to have \"normal\" sex might be his way of trying to be considerate, but he didn't take her communication seriously. If he kept trying after she asked him to stop, that's a problem. The question is whether she's in the wrong for being upset. Since she communicated her needs and he didn't follow through, her anger could be justified. However, the way she resolved it by leaving and not responding might affect how others perceive her actions. But given the context of her trauma and prior communication, she's probably not in the wrong here.\n"
