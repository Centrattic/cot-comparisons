(nsfw)\nI (21F) and my boyfriend (26M) have been dating for a few months and have been having sex regularly. We talked beforehand about our likes and dislikes, and I told him that I don\u2019t like sex to feel too gentle or passionate and that it makes me uncomfortable. I know it\u2019s strange but I was in an abusive relationship before and I\u2019ve found that when I have rough sex I can sort of let go and have fun but when it\u2019s gentle and about connection I get all in my head and I get really uncomfortable and I hate it.\n\nLast night we were gearing up to have sex, and he said he wanted to have \u201cnormal\u201d sex, and when I asked what he meant he started kissing my body a lot which I didn\u2019t really like.  I told him I didn\u2019t like it and he stopped but he kept trying to do cutesy things like playing with my hair and chaste kisses and stuff, and I got mad at him and told him to stop. I didn\u2019t really say much I just put my clothes on and left.\n\nI haven\u2019t answered his messages today. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The scenario involves the author (21F) getting upset with her boyfriend (26M) for being too gentle during sex. She mentioned they had a conversation beforehand about her preferences, where she told him she doesn't like gentle or passionate sex because it makes her uncomfortable due to past trauma from an abusive relationship. She prefers rough sex to feel at ease. However, when they had sex and he was being gentle, she got mad and left, not responding to his messages.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the key points. She communicated her preferences upfront, which is important. The boyfriend tried to follow her guidance but perhaps misinterpreted what \"normal\" sex meant. The user is concerned whether getting angry and leaving is justified.\n\nHer reasoning is rooted in her past trauma, which affects her current behavior. That's a valid factor to consider because trauma can significantly influence a person's reactions and needs. The boyfriend might have intended to be considerate based on her previous statement, but maybe he didn't fully understand the nuances of what she meant by \"rough\" sex or how to adjust his approach appropriately. \n\nHowever, the issue arises in how the author handled the situation. She told him to stop, but when he continued with gentle actions, she reacted by getting angry and leaving. While her discomfort is legitimate, the way she responded could be seen as abrupt. Effective communication in such situations is crucial. Instead of just leaving, perhaps discussing her feelings in a calm manner after the fact might have been more constructive. \n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend's actions, while intended to be gentle, might not have aligned with her needs. He should have been more attuned to her cues during the interaction. Since she had communicated her preferences, his persistent gentle behavior despite her discomfort might indicate a lack of attentiveness to her current needs during the act. \n\nIn relationships, it's important for both partners to continuously communicate and adjust based on real-time feedback. The author's reaction, while understandable given her trauma, could have been handled differently. However, considering her past and the communication she provided, it's not entirely her fault. The boyfriend also has a responsibility to ensure he's meeting her needs as they evolve. \n\nSo, putting it all together, neither party is entirely at fault. The author is not in the wrong because her response was a reaction to her uncomfortable situation, and she did communicate her needs beforehand. However, the way she handled the aftermath could be improved. The boyfriend might also need to adjust his approach. Since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, the answer would lean towards \"B\" (No).\n"
