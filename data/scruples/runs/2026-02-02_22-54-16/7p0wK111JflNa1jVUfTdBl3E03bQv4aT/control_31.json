(nsfw)\nI (21F) and my boyfriend (26M) have been dating for a few months and have been having sex regularly. We talked beforehand about our likes and dislikes, and I told him that I don\u2019t like sex to feel too gentle or passionate and that it makes me uncomfortable. I know it\u2019s strange but I was in an abusive relationship before and I\u2019ve found that when I have rough sex I can sort of let go and have fun but when it\u2019s gentle and about connection I get all in my head and I get really uncomfortable and I hate it.\n\nLast night we were gearing up to have sex, and he said he wanted to have \u201cnormal\u201d sex, and when I asked what he meant he started kissing my body a lot which I didn\u2019t really like.  I told him I didn\u2019t like it and he stopped but he kept trying to do cutesy things like playing with my hair and chaste kisses and stuff, and I got mad at him and told him to stop. I didn\u2019t really say much I just put my clothes on and left.\n\nI haven\u2019t answered his messages today. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that she's a 21-year-old woman in a relationship with her 26-year-old boyfriend. They've been dating for a few months and have been having regular sex. She mentioned that she told him she doesn't like sex that's too gentle or passionate because it makes her uncomfortable. Her reason is that she was in an abusive relationship before, and rough sex helps her feel more comfortable. When they had sex last night, he wanted to do \"normal\" sex, which she found too gentle. He started doing things like kissing her body and doing cutesy stuff, which she didn't like. She told him to stop, he did but kept trying, she got mad, left the room, and hasn't replied to his messages.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if she's in the wrong. She communicated her preferences beforehand. That's a key point. When she told him she doesn't like gentle or passionate sex, he should have respected that. But when he went ahead and did the gentle stuff despite her communication, that's where the problem might be. She told him to stop, and he kept trying, which led to her getting upset. Her reaction was to leave and not respond, which might be seen as cutting off communication. \n\nBut from her perspective, she was clear about her boundaries. He didn't follow them, leading to her discomfort. Her history of abuse complicates things because her needs might be different from someone without that background. However, the boyfriend's intention to be gentle might be his way of showing care, but if she communicated that it's not what she wants, then he's at fault for not respecting her wishes.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the boyfriend was trying to connect in a way he thought was appropriate, but didn't realize the impact of his actions. However, the fact that she had already told him made it clear. So, the responsibility is on him to listen. Her reaction of getting mad might be a valid response to his not respecting her boundaries. Leaving and not responding could be seen as a way to process things, but it's also cutting off communication, which isn't ideal. But given the context of her past trauma, her emotional reaction is understandable.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong because she communicated her needs, and the boyfriend didn't respect them. The issue is more on his side for not following her instructions. Her reaction, while maybe not the best approach, is a result of his failure to comply. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, she's not in the wrong).\n"
