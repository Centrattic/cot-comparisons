(nsfw)\nI (21F) and my boyfriend (26M) have been dating for a few months and have been having sex regularly. We talked beforehand about our likes and dislikes, and I told him that I don\u2019t like sex to feel too gentle or passionate and that it makes me uncomfortable. I know it\u2019s strange but I was in an abusive relationship before and I\u2019ve found that when I have rough sex I can sort of let go and have fun but when it\u2019s gentle and about connection I get all in my head and I get really uncomfortable and I hate it.\n\nLast night we were gearing up to have sex, and he said he wanted to have \u201cnormal\u201d sex, and when I asked what he meant he started kissing my body a lot which I didn\u2019t really like.  I told him I didn\u2019t like it and he stopped but he kept trying to do cutesy things like playing with my hair and chaste kisses and stuff, and I got mad at him and told him to stop. I didn\u2019t really say much I just put my clothes on and left.\n\nI haven\u2019t answered his messages today. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for getting mad at her boyfriend for being too gentle during sex. Let me start by reading the scenario again carefully.\n\nThe girl (21F) and her boyfriend (26M) have been dating for a few months and have regular sex. She told him before that she doesn't like it when it's too gentle or passionate because it makes her uncomfortable. She has a history of an abusive relationship and mentions that rough sex helps her let go, whereas gentle, connected sex makes her anxious. \n\nLast night, he said he wanted to have \"normal\" sex, which led to him doing things like kissing her body and cutesy stuff. She told him to stop, got mad, put her clothes on, and left. She hasn't replied to his messages. Now she's asking if she's the asshole here.\n\nFirst, I need to consider communication. She did communicate her preferences to him beforehand. That's a key point. She told him what she likes and dislikes. So if he didn't heed her boundaries, that's on him. But wait, he might have misunderstood \"normal\" sex. Maybe he thought that was his version of normal, which is more gentle. But she already told him her preference. So if he went against that without checking in again, that's a problem.\n\nThen, when she told him to stop and he kept trying, she got mad and left. Her reaction seems to be a result of him not respecting her boundaries. But is getting angry and leaving a reasonable response? Well, she did tell him she's uncomfortable with gentle sex because of her past. If he continued, maybe he should have respected that more.\n\nBut also, when she told him to stop, maybe he was trying to be affectionate and she felt it wasn't working. Her leaving could be seen as cutting off communication, which might not help resolve the issue. However, given her trauma from an abusive relationship, her sensitivity is understandable. \n\nIs she in the wrong for getting upset? Since she communicated her preferences and he didn't follow them, her reaction seems justified. However, leaving without communication might not be the best approach, but it doesn't necessarily make her in the wrong. The main issue is whether she violated any norms. In terms of consent and communication, she did communicate, so the boyfriend might be at fault for not respecting her boundaries. Therefore, the answer might be B (she's not in the wrong). But I need to check if there's a nuance I'm missing. Maybe the boyfriend was trying to connect in a different way, but she already told him she doesn't like that. So he should have adjusted. Her anger is a response to his not respecting her stated preferences. So yes, she's not in the wrong.\n"
