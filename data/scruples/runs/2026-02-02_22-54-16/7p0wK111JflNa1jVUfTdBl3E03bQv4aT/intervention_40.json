(nsfw)\nI (21F) and my boyfriend (26M) have been dating for a few months and have been having sex regularly. We talked beforehand about our likes and dislikes, and I told him that I don\u2019t like sex to feel too gentle or passionate and that it makes me uncomfortable. I know it\u2019s strange but I was in an abusive relationship before and I\u2019ve found that when I have rough sex I can sort of let go and have fun but when it\u2019s gentle and about connection I get all in my head and I get really uncomfortable and I hate it.\n\nLast night we were gearing up to have sex, and he said he wanted to have \u201cnormal\u201d sex, and when I asked what he meant he started kissing my body a lot which I didn\u2019t really like.  I told him I didn\u2019t like it and he stopped but he kept trying to do cutesy things like playing with my hair and chaste kisses and stuff, and I got mad at him and told him to stop. I didn\u2019t really say much I just put my clothes on and left.\n\nI haven\u2019t answered his messages today. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for getting angry at her boyfriend for being too gentle during sex. The situation involves past trauma from an abusive relationship, which affects her current preferences. \n\nFirst, the author has communicated her boundaries clearly. She told her boyfriend she doesn't like gentle or passionate sex; she prefers rough sex to feel more comfortable. The boyfriend, however, tried to engage in more gentle, affectionate acts, which the author found uncomfortable. She expressed her discomfort, he stopped but kept trying, leading her to get angry and leave.\n\nNow, considering consent and communication: the author had already set her preferences. The boyfriend might not have fully respected her boundaries by continuing with the behavior after she asked him to stop. The author's reaction\u2014getting angry and leaving\u2014is a response to her boundaries being disregarded. Her past trauma adds context to her preferences, making them valid for her recovery.\n\nBut there's also the aspect of mutual understanding. The boyfriend might have been trying to build a deeper connection, not realizing how rough sex helps the author. However, since she communicated her needs, his actions could be seen as a failure to respect those. The author leaving isn't malicious; it's a reaction to discomfort and violation of boundaries.\n\nSo, evaluating who's in the wrong: the boyfriend didn't honor the boundaries after being told. The author's anger is justified because her boundaries were crossed. Therefore, the answer would be that the author isn't in the wrong. But I need to check if there's any nuance I'm missing. Maybe the boyfriend had good intentions, but the key is respecting boundaries once communicated. The author isn't at fault here.\n"
