(nsfw)\nI (21F) and my boyfriend (26M) have been dating for a few months and have been having sex regularly. We talked beforehand about our likes and dislikes, and I told him that I don\u2019t like sex to feel too gentle or passionate and that it makes me uncomfortable. I know it\u2019s strange but I was in an abusive relationship before and I\u2019ve found that when I have rough sex I can sort of let go and have fun but when it\u2019s gentle and about connection I get all in my head and I get really uncomfortable and I hate it.\n\nLast night we were gearing up to have sex, and he said he wanted to have \u201cnormal\u201d sex, and when I asked what he meant he started kissing my body a lot which I didn\u2019t really like.  I told him I didn\u2019t like it and he stopped but he kept trying to do cutesy things like playing with my hair and chaste kisses and stuff, and I got mad at him and told him to stop. I didn\u2019t really say much I just put my clothes on and left.\n\nI haven\u2019t answered his messages today. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for getting mad at her boyfriend for being too gentle during sex.\n\nFirst, the key points from the scenario: The woman is 21, her boyfriend is 26, they've been dating a few months and have had sex regularly. She mentioned to him before that she doesn't like gentle or passionate sex, which makes her uncomfortable. She has a history of being in an abusive relationship and finds that rough sex helps her let go and be comfortable. Last night, the boyfriend wanted to have \"normal\" sex, which involved gentle actions like kissing her body and playing with her hair. She told him she didn't like it, he stopped but kept trying cutesy things. She got mad, put clothes on, and left. Now she's not responding to his messages and is asking if she's the asshole.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. So, I need to evaluate if she's in the wrong (A) or not (B). \n\nFrom a communication standpoint, she did express her preferences to him before, which is good. However, when he tried to adjust (even if she still disliked it), maybe she could have communicated more effectively during the moment. She told him to stop, which he did, but then continued with other actions. She got mad and left, which might be a strong reaction, but considering her past trauma, her feelings are valid. The key here is consent and communication. She had the right to express her discomfort, and he should respect that. However, abruptly leaving and not responding might be seen as dismissive or not engaging in further dialogue. \n\nBut given her traumatic background, her reactions are a result of her experiences. The boyfriend's intention was to have \"normal\" sex, which he might interpret differently. There's a communication gap here. She's not wrong for feeling uncomfortable and acting on her boundaries. The boyfriend might need to be more sensitive and check in with her during intimacy. However, the author's reaction (getting mad and leaving) might not be the most constructive way to handle it. But she's not in the wrong for having those feelings and setting boundaries. \n\nIn terms of consent and communication, she's within her rights. The boyfriend might be trying to connect in a way that's not working for her, but she's not at fault for her response. So the answer is B.\n"
