(nsfw)\nI (21F) and my boyfriend (26M) have been dating for a few months and have been having sex regularly. We talked beforehand about our likes and dislikes, and I told him that I don\u2019t like sex to feel too gentle or passionate and that it makes me uncomfortable. I know it\u2019s strange but I was in an abusive relationship before and I\u2019ve found that when I have rough sex I can sort of let go and have fun but when it\u2019s gentle and about connection I get all in my head and I get really uncomfortable and I hate it.\n\nLast night we were gearing up to have sex, and he said he wanted to have \u201cnormal\u201d sex, and when I asked what he meant he started kissing my body a lot which I didn\u2019t really like.  I told him I didn\u2019t like it and he stopped but he kept trying to do cutesy things like playing with my hair and chaste kisses and stuff, and I got mad at him and told him to stop. I didn\u2019t really say much I just put my clothes on and left.\n\nI haven\u2019t answered his messages today. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author (21F) getting upset with her boyfriend (26M) for being too gentle during sex. They had previously discussed preferences, and she mentioned she doesn't like gentle or passionate sex because of past abuse. She found that rough sex helps her feel more comfortable. \n\nThe boyfriend wanted to have \"normal\" sex, which led to him doing things like kissing her body, playing with her hair, and chaste kisses. She told him she didn't like it, he stopped but kept trying, and she got mad, left, and hasn't responded. The user thinks the author isn't wrong, but wants to confirm.\n\nFirst, I need to consider communication. The author had already told her boyfriend her preferences. If he didn't respect that, maybe he's at fault. But she got angry and left. Did she handle it appropriately? She did communicate her discomfort again, which is good. He might have been trying to be affectionate, but if she said she didn't like it, he should have stopped entirely. \n\nHer past trauma could affect her current reactions. It's important to consider that her discomfort is valid given her history. The boyfriend might not have been aware of how his actions were triggering, even if they were meant to be kind. \n\nHowever, the author left abruptly and hasn't responded. Maybe she could have discussed it calmly instead of cutting off communication. But in the moment, people react emotionally. \n\nOn the other hand, if the boyfriend continued after she told him to stop, that's a problem. He might not have respected her boundaries. The fact that she had to repeat her requests shows he didn't listen. \n\nSo, the main points are: clear communication from her, his failure to respect her boundaries, and her emotional response. The author isn't in the wrong because she had communicated her needs, and he didn't honor them despite her telling him. Her reaction is understandable given her past. The boyfriend might be more at fault here. Therefore, the answer is B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
