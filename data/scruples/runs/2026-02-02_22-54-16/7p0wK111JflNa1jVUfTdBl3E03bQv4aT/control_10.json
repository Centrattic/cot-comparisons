(nsfw)\nI (21F) and my boyfriend (26M) have been dating for a few months and have been having sex regularly. We talked beforehand about our likes and dislikes, and I told him that I don\u2019t like sex to feel too gentle or passionate and that it makes me uncomfortable. I know it\u2019s strange but I was in an abusive relationship before and I\u2019ve found that when I have rough sex I can sort of let go and have fun but when it\u2019s gentle and about connection I get all in my head and I get really uncomfortable and I hate it.\n\nLast night we were gearing up to have sex, and he said he wanted to have \u201cnormal\u201d sex, and when I asked what he meant he started kissing my body a lot which I didn\u2019t really like.  I told him I didn\u2019t like it and he stopped but he kept trying to do cutesy things like playing with my hair and chaste kisses and stuff, and I got mad at him and told him to stop. I didn\u2019t really say much I just put my clothes on and left.\n\nI haven\u2019t answered his messages today. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this post is in the wrong. Let me read through their situation again.\n\nThe user is a 21-year-old female in a relationship with a 26-year-old male boyfriend. They've been dating a few months and have sex regularly. They discussed their preferences beforehand, and she told him she doesn't like gentle or passionate sex\u2014it makes her uncomfortable. She mentioned she has a history of an abusive relationship and finds rough sex more comfortable because it helps her let go, whereas gentle and emotional sex makes her anxious. \n\nLast night, the boyfriend wanted to have \"normal\" sex, which she didn't like. When she asked what he meant, he started kissing her body, which she didn't like. She told him to stop, he did but kept doing cutesy things like playing with her hair and chaste kisses. She got mad, put on clothes, and left. She hasn't responded to his messages and is asking if she's in the wrong (AITA).\n\nFirst, the key points here are communication and consent. She had already communicated her preferences to her boyfriend. He was aware that she didn't like gentle or emotional sex. However, during their encounter, he didn't respect her boundaries and continued with actions she found uncomfortable. She tried to stop him, he stopped but then continued with other cutesy behaviors. She then left in a huff and hasn't responded.\n\nIn a healthy relationship, if someone communicates their boundaries, the partner should respect them. If he wasn't respecting her boundaries after she told him, that's a problem. The fact that he kept doing things she didn't like even after she told him to stop suggests he wasn't respecting her consent. She then reacted by getting angry and leaving, which is a common reaction when someone's boundaries are not respected.\n\nBut wait, she also hasn't responded to his messages. Maybe he's trying to talk it out, and she's cutting him off. Is that inconsiderate? Or is it a valid response given the situation? If he's the one who wasn't respecting her boundaries, maybe her response is justified. However, cutting off communication entirely without explanation could be seen as harsh, but if he was the one at fault, she might be within her rights.\n\nAnother angle: The boyfriend might be trying to be affectionate or connect, but she's not in the mood for that. Maybe he should have checked in more with her during the encounter. But she had already told him her preferences, so he should have known. \n\nIn terms of being in the wrong, the main issue is whether she overreacted. She was clear about her boundaries, he didn't respect them, and she got angry. That's a reasonable reaction. However, leaving and not responding could be a problem. But considering the context of her past abuse, her sensitivity might be justified. She's trying to navigate her trauma, and if her partner isn't respecting her needs, she's not in the wrong for reacting as she did.\n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because she communicated her boundaries, he didn't respect them, and her reaction was a response to that disrespect. She's also dealing with past trauma, which complicates things. The boyfriend is more likely in the wrong for not respecting her preferences after being told.\n"
