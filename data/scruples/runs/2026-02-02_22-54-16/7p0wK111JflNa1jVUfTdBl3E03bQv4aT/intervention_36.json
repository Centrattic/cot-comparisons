(nsfw)\nI (21F) and my boyfriend (26M) have been dating for a few months and have been having sex regularly. We talked beforehand about our likes and dislikes, and I told him that I don\u2019t like sex to feel too gentle or passionate and that it makes me uncomfortable. I know it\u2019s strange but I was in an abusive relationship before and I\u2019ve found that when I have rough sex I can sort of let go and have fun but when it\u2019s gentle and about connection I get all in my head and I get really uncomfortable and I hate it.\n\nLast night we were gearing up to have sex, and he said he wanted to have \u201cnormal\u201d sex, and when I asked what he meant he started kissing my body a lot which I didn\u2019t really like.  I told him I didn\u2019t like it and he stopped but he kept trying to do cutesy things like playing with my hair and chaste kisses and stuff, and I got mad at him and told him to stop. I didn\u2019t really say much I just put my clothes on and left.\n\nI haven\u2019t answered his messages today. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for getting mad at her boyfriend for being too gentle during sex. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the key points: the author is a 21-year-old woman who's been dating a 26-year-old man for a few months. They've had sex regularly. She told him before that she doesn't like gentle or passionate sex because it makes her uncomfortable. She mentioned her past abusive relationship and that rough sex helps her feel more comfortable. Last night, the boyfriend wanted to have \"normal\" sex, which involved more gentle, affectionate acts like kissing her body, playing with her hair, chaste kisses. She told him she didn't like it, he stopped but kept trying, leading her to get angry, put on clothes, and leave. She hasn't responded to his messages since.\n\nSo the question is whether she's at fault here. The user thinks she's not, but wants my opinion. Let me think about consent, communication, and boundaries. She had communicated her preferences before. The boyfriend didn't respect her boundaries after she told him to stop. Even though he might be trying to be affectionate, if she's told him that's uncomfortable, then he's overstepping. Her reaction, while maybe intense, is a response to him not respecting her boundaries. \n\nHowever, is there a nuance where she could have communicated better? Maybe she could have explained again or tried to work through it calmly. But given her history, her discomfort is valid. The boyfriend should have respected her initial communication. The fact that he continued after she told him to stop is a problem. \n\nAlso, the term \"AITA\" is a common Reddit question, so the context is from a Reddit post. In such cases, often the person is seeking validation that they're not wrong for standing up for their boundaries, especially after trauma. \n\nSo considering all that, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The boyfriend didn't honor her boundaries after she communicated them, and her reaction, while perhaps abrupt, is a response to his continued actions. Her history adds context to her discomfort, making her reaction understandable.\n"
