(nsfw)\nI (21F) and my boyfriend (26M) have been dating for a few months and have been having sex regularly. We talked beforehand about our likes and dislikes, and I told him that I don\u2019t like sex to feel too gentle or passionate and that it makes me uncomfortable. I know it\u2019s strange but I was in an abusive relationship before and I\u2019ve found that when I have rough sex I can sort of let go and have fun but when it\u2019s gentle and about connection I get all in my head and I get really uncomfortable and I hate it.\n\nLast night we were gearing up to have sex, and he said he wanted to have \u201cnormal\u201d sex, and when I asked what he meant he started kissing my body a lot which I didn\u2019t really like.  I told him I didn\u2019t like it and he stopped but he kept trying to do cutesy things like playing with my hair and chaste kisses and stuff, and I got mad at him and told him to stop. I didn\u2019t really say much I just put my clothes on and left.\n\nI haven\u2019t answered his messages today. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author, a 21-year-old woman, is upset with her boyfriend for being too gentle during sex. She mentioned they talked about their preferences before, and she told him she doesn't like it when it's too gentle or passionate because of her past abusive relationship. She finds rough sex more comfortable, which is a bit unusual, but she explains that with her history. \n\nHer boyfriend tried to do things she didn't like, like gentle kissing and playing with her hair, which made her uncomfortable. She told him to stop, he did, but kept trying, leading her to get angry and leave. Now she's wondering if she's at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider communication. She did communicate her preferences upfront. That's important because consent and communication are key in relationships. Her boyfriend might not have fully respected her boundaries after she asked him to stop. If he continued despite her telling him to stop, that's a problem. \n\nHer reaction\u2014getting mad and leaving\u2014could be seen as a valid response to her discomfort. She's trying to set boundaries based on her trauma. However, cutting off communication by not replying to his messages might be seen as abrupt. But given her emotional state, maybe it's understandable.\n\nThe boyfriend's actions after she told him to stop might be the main issue here. Even if he had good intentions, not heeding her requests after she expressed discomfort is a breach of her boundaries. \n\nSo, the author communicated her needs, tried to address the situation, and then reacted emotionally. The boyfriend's part is not respecting her wishes post-communication. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
