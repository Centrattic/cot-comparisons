(nsfw)\nI (21F) and my boyfriend (26M) have been dating for a few months and have been having sex regularly. We talked beforehand about our likes and dislikes, and I told him that I don\u2019t like sex to feel too gentle or passionate and that it makes me uncomfortable. I know it\u2019s strange but I was in an abusive relationship before and I\u2019ve found that when I have rough sex I can sort of let go and have fun but when it\u2019s gentle and about connection I get all in my head and I get really uncomfortable and I hate it.\n\nLast night we were gearing up to have sex, and he said he wanted to have \u201cnormal\u201d sex, and when I asked what he meant he started kissing my body a lot which I didn\u2019t really like.  I told him I didn\u2019t like it and he stopped but he kept trying to do cutesy things like playing with my hair and chaste kisses and stuff, and I got mad at him and told him to stop. I didn\u2019t really say much I just put my clothes on and left.\n\nI haven\u2019t answered his messages today. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for getting mad at her boyfriend for being too gentle during sex. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author is a 21-year-old female in a relationship with a 26-year-old male. They've been dating a few months and have been having sex regularly. She communicated her preferences beforehand, stating she doesn't like gentle or passionate sex because of past trauma from an abusive relationship. She enjoys rough sex, which helps her feel in control and have fun, whereas gentle sex makes her uncomfortable and anxious. \n\nLast night, the boyfriend wanted to have \"normal\" sex, which the author interprets as gentle. He started kissing her body, which she didn't like. She told him to stop, he did, but then continued with cutesy gestures like playing with her hair and chaste kisses. She got mad, put her clothes on, and left. Now she hasn't responded to his messages and is asking if she's at fault.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't wrong, but wants to know my take. So, do I think her reaction is justified?\n\nCommunication is key in relationships, especially regarding intimacy. The author did communicate her preferences initially, but maybe not the specifics of what \"normal\" means to her boyfriend. However, when he tried to engage in behaviors she disliked, she expressed her discomfort. The boyfriend might not have fully understood her needs or adjusted accordingly after she told him to stop. \n\nHer past trauma could influence her current preferences. It's not strange to have different needs post-trauma; people process things differently. The boyfriend's actions might have triggered her, leading to her emotional response. Getting mad is a natural reaction when someone's boundaries are not respected, even if unintentionally. \n\nHowever, walking out and not responding could be seen as abrupt. The author might need to address this in a constructive way, but the initial anger isn't necessarily wrong if he didn't heed her boundaries. The boyfriend should have respected her preferences after she communicated them, even if he didn't fully understand. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. Her reaction stems from past experiences and communicated boundaries that weren't respected. The boyfriend might need to better understand her needs and adjust his actions accordingly. Therefore, the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
