(nsfw)\nI (21F) and my boyfriend (26M) have been dating for a few months and have been having sex regularly. We talked beforehand about our likes and dislikes, and I told him that I don\u2019t like sex to feel too gentle or passionate and that it makes me uncomfortable. I know it\u2019s strange but I was in an abusive relationship before and I\u2019ve found that when I have rough sex I can sort of let go and have fun but when it\u2019s gentle and about connection I get all in my head and I get really uncomfortable and I hate it.\n\nLast night we were gearing up to have sex, and he said he wanted to have \u201cnormal\u201d sex, and when I asked what he meant he started kissing my body a lot which I didn\u2019t really like.  I told him I didn\u2019t like it and he stopped but he kept trying to do cutesy things like playing with my hair and chaste kisses and stuff, and I got mad at him and told him to stop. I didn\u2019t really say much I just put my clothes on and left.\n\nI haven\u2019t answered his messages today. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. So the question is whether the person who wrote the Ask AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a woman being upset with her boyfriend because he's being too gentle during sex. She mentioned they had previously discussed her preferences, and she told him she doesn't like gentle or passionate sex because of past trauma from an abusive relationship. She prefers rough sex to feel like she can let go, whereas gentle sex makes her uncomfortable.\n\nSo the key points here are communication and mutual respect. The woman communicated her preferences to her boyfriend beforehand. He then tried to have \"normal\" sex, which, from his perspective, might mean his usual style, but she had already told him that her comfort zone is different. When he started doing things like kissing her body and being affectionate, she told him to stop, and when he kept attempting cutesy actions, she got mad and left.\n\nNow, the question is whether she was wrong. From a standard of consent and communication, if someone has clearly communicated their boundaries and the other person is not respecting those, even after being told to stop, then the person not respecting the boundary is in the wrong. However, here the woman is the one who set the boundary. She told him she doesn't like gentle sex. When he didn't adhere to that and continued, she was upset. So, in that case, her being upset is a reasonable reaction. She's within her right to be angry if her boundaries are being ignored. \n\nBut there's also the part where the boyfriend might have different preferences or might not understand why she's uncomfortable. However, the woman explained it's due to past trauma, so it's not just a personal preference but something tied to her emotional well-being. The boyfriend's actions, even if well-intentioned, were causing her distress, which is a significant issue. \n\nThe AITA (Am I the A**hole) aspect usually looks at whether the person's actions were justified. The woman set clear boundaries, her boyfriend didn't respect them, and she reacted to protect her comfort. So she's not in the wrong. The boyfriend is the one who didn't respect her previously stated preferences, which is more of an issue. Therefore, the answer should be B for No, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
