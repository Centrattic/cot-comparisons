(nsfw)\nI (21F) and my boyfriend (26M) have been dating for a few months and have been having sex regularly. We talked beforehand about our likes and dislikes, and I told him that I don\u2019t like sex to feel too gentle or passionate and that it makes me uncomfortable. I know it\u2019s strange but I was in an abusive relationship before and I\u2019ve found that when I have rough sex I can sort of let go and have fun but when it\u2019s gentle and about connection I get all in my head and I get really uncomfortable and I hate it.\n\nLast night we were gearing up to have sex, and he said he wanted to have \u201cnormal\u201d sex, and when I asked what he meant he started kissing my body a lot which I didn\u2019t really like.  I told him I didn\u2019t like it and he stopped but he kept trying to do cutesy things like playing with my hair and chaste kisses and stuff, and I got mad at him and told him to stop. I didn\u2019t really say much I just put my clothes on and left.\n\nI haven\u2019t answered his messages today. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author (21F) being upset with her boyfriend (26M) for being too gentle during sex. She mentioned they had discussed their preferences beforehand, and she told him she doesn't like gentle or passionate sex because of her past abusive relationship. Now, when he tries to be gentle, she gets uncomfortable and leaves.\n\nFirst, I need to consider communication. The author did communicate her boundaries clearly to her boyfriend. She told him her preferences and reasons. That's a key point because consent and communication are crucial in relationships. If he was aware of her dislikes, then his actions might be seen as not respecting her boundaries. However, he might have his own preferences or ways of showing intimacy, but he should respect hers.\n\nThen there's the aspect of past trauma. The author mentioned an abusive relationship, which can affect how someone experiences intimacy. People with trauma might have different needs in sexual situations. It's important for partners to be sensitive to that. If he tried to be gentle but she found it uncomfortable, even after discussing it, maybe he needs to adjust more. However, maybe there's a misunderstanding. Did she express her needs clearly enough? The user says she told him, so that's covered.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction is also important. When she asked him to stop, he stopped but then continued with other actions. That might indicate he wasn't fully respecting her immediate boundaries. If she told him to stop and he kept trying things, that's a problem. But maybe he was trying to be affectionate in other ways thinking it would help her relax. However, if she said she didn't like that, he should stop.\n\nThe author leaving and not responding to messages could be seen as a reaction to her discomfort. It's understandable if after being in an abusive relationship, she struggles with being in situations where she feels uncomfortable. However, not responding might be seen as cutting off communication, which isn't healthy. But given the context, it's her way of dealing with stress.\n\nSo, considering all that: the author communicated her needs, the boyfriend didn't respect her boundaries upon her request, and she's reacting to trauma. The boyfriend might be at fault for not adjusting properly. The author isn't in the wrong because she communicated her boundaries and didn't consent to the actions he took. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
