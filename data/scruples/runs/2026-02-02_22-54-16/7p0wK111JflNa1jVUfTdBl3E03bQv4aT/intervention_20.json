(nsfw)\nI (21F) and my boyfriend (26M) have been dating for a few months and have been having sex regularly. We talked beforehand about our likes and dislikes, and I told him that I don\u2019t like sex to feel too gentle or passionate and that it makes me uncomfortable. I know it\u2019s strange but I was in an abusive relationship before and I\u2019ve found that when I have rough sex I can sort of let go and have fun but when it\u2019s gentle and about connection I get all in my head and I get really uncomfortable and I hate it.\n\nLast night we were gearing up to have sex, and he said he wanted to have \u201cnormal\u201d sex, and when I asked what he meant he started kissing my body a lot which I didn\u2019t really like.  I told him I didn\u2019t like it and he stopped but he kept trying to do cutesy things like playing with my hair and chaste kisses and stuff, and I got mad at him and told him to stop. I didn\u2019t really say much I just put my clothes on and left.\n\nI haven\u2019t answered his messages today. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who posted the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a 21-year-old woman and her 26-year-old boyfriend who've been dating a few months. She told him she doesn't like gentle or passionate sex because of past trauma, but he still tried to be gentle, leading her to get angry and leave.\n\nFirst, I need to consider consent and communication. She had already communicated her preferences about sex. That's a key point. If someone has been told their actions are unwanted, continuing those actions can be problematic. However, the boyfriend might not have understood the extent or the reasons behind her request. But she mentioned the past abuse, which adds context.\n\nShe says she got mad and left. Is that in the wrong? Well, she had the right to express her boundaries. If he continued after she told him to stop, that's on him. But maybe he was trying to be affectionate in a way she didn't want at that moment. The key is that she had already communicated her boundaries. If he respected them when she first told him, then her getting upset is justified. However, the way she handled it\u2014just leaving and not answering messages\u2014might be seen as abrupt, but it's her right to set limits.\n\nAnother angle: past trauma affects people's comfort levels. Her needing rough sex to feel okay is important. If he's not meeting her needs and she's communicating that, it's about mutual adjustment. But if she's not allowing him to find a middle ground, maybe there's a communication issue. However, the question is whether she's in the wrong. Since she followed up on her initial communication by telling him to stop again, her reaction seems valid. The boyfriend might need to adjust more, but her getting mad isn't wrong when her boundaries are crossed.\n"
