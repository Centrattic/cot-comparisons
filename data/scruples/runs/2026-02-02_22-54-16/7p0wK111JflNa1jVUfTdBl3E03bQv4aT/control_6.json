(nsfw)\nI (21F) and my boyfriend (26M) have been dating for a few months and have been having sex regularly. We talked beforehand about our likes and dislikes, and I told him that I don\u2019t like sex to feel too gentle or passionate and that it makes me uncomfortable. I know it\u2019s strange but I was in an abusive relationship before and I\u2019ve found that when I have rough sex I can sort of let go and have fun but when it\u2019s gentle and about connection I get all in my head and I get really uncomfortable and I hate it.\n\nLast night we were gearing up to have sex, and he said he wanted to have \u201cnormal\u201d sex, and when I asked what he meant he started kissing my body a lot which I didn\u2019t really like.  I told him I didn\u2019t like it and he stopped but he kept trying to do cutesy things like playing with my hair and chaste kisses and stuff, and I got mad at him and told him to stop. I didn\u2019t really say much I just put my clothes on and left.\n\nI haven\u2019t answered his messages today. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for getting mad at her boyfriend for being too gentle during sex. The situation is that she mentioned she doesn't like gentle or passionate sex because of her past abuse. She told him her preferences, but during the encounter, he tried to be gentle and connect, which made her uncomfortable. She got mad and left.\n\nFirst, I need to consider her background. She had an abusive relationship before, so her preference for rough sex might be a way to feel in control. It's important that she communicated her needs to him beforehand. If he was aware, then his actions might not be in line with her boundaries.\n\nBut wait, when she told him she doesn't like gentle or passionate sex, maybe he misinterpreted it. He might have thought \"normal\" sex meant something else. However, she clarified that she wanted rough sex to feel comfortable. If he still proceeded with gentle actions after she told him, that's a problem. He should respect her boundaries.\n\nShe got mad and left, which is a reaction to her discomfort. Since she communicated her needs, it's reasonable for her to expect him to follow them. If he didn't listen after she expressed discomfort, then she's not wrong for getting upset. However, maybe there's a communication gap. Did she clearly explain that gentle is uncomfortable? Maybe she needs to be more specific. But given her history, her reaction is understandable. So, she's not in the wrong. The answer would be B.\n"
