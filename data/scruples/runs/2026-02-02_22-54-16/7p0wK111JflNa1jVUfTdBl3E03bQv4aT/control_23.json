(nsfw)\nI (21F) and my boyfriend (26M) have been dating for a few months and have been having sex regularly. We talked beforehand about our likes and dislikes, and I told him that I don\u2019t like sex to feel too gentle or passionate and that it makes me uncomfortable. I know it\u2019s strange but I was in an abusive relationship before and I\u2019ve found that when I have rough sex I can sort of let go and have fun but when it\u2019s gentle and about connection I get all in my head and I get really uncomfortable and I hate it.\n\nLast night we were gearing up to have sex, and he said he wanted to have \u201cnormal\u201d sex, and when I asked what he meant he started kissing my body a lot which I didn\u2019t really like.  I told him I didn\u2019t like it and he stopped but he kept trying to do cutesy things like playing with my hair and chaste kisses and stuff, and I got mad at him and told him to stop. I didn\u2019t really say much I just put my clothes on and left.\n\nI haven\u2019t answered his messages today. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nThe author is a 21-year-old woman in a relationship with a 26-year-old boyfriend. They've been dating a few months and have been having regular sex. She mentioned she doesn't like gentle or passionate sex because of her past in an abusive relationship. She prefers rough sex to feel comfortable. \n\nLast night, the boyfriend wanted to have \"normal\" sex and started doing gentle things like kissing her body, which she didn't like. She told him to stop, he did, but kept trying other gentle gestures like playing with her hair and chaste kisses. She got mad, put on clothes, and left. She hasn't replied to his messages.\n\nSo, the key points here are communication and boundaries. She had already told him her preferences. He tried to be gentle, which she explicitly said she didn't like. Even after she told him to stop, he continued with other gentle actions. She then left and hasn't responded. \n\nNow, considering her past abuse, her discomfort with gentle sex makes sense. She's communicating her needs, which is good. The boyfriend, however, might not fully understand her triggers. But he was aware of her preferences, so when she told him to stop and he kept doing cutesy things, that's a problem. He should respect her boundaries. \n\nHer reaction\u2014getting mad and leaving\u2014is a response to him ignoring her boundaries after she communicated them. She's not in the wrong for being upset. However, cutting off communication entirely without addressing the issue might be an overreaction. But given her history, her emotional response is valid. \n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong. Since she communicated her needs and the boyfriend didn't respect them after being told, she's not in the wrong. The boyfriend's actions were the issue. Her leaving is a reaction to his not respecting her, so she's not at fault. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
