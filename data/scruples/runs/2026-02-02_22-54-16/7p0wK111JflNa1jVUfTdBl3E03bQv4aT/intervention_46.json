(nsfw)\nI (21F) and my boyfriend (26M) have been dating for a few months and have been having sex regularly. We talked beforehand about our likes and dislikes, and I told him that I don\u2019t like sex to feel too gentle or passionate and that it makes me uncomfortable. I know it\u2019s strange but I was in an abusive relationship before and I\u2019ve found that when I have rough sex I can sort of let go and have fun but when it\u2019s gentle and about connection I get all in my head and I get really uncomfortable and I hate it.\n\nLast night we were gearing up to have sex, and he said he wanted to have \u201cnormal\u201d sex, and when I asked what he meant he started kissing my body a lot which I didn\u2019t really like.  I told him I didn\u2019t like it and he stopped but he kept trying to do cutesy things like playing with my hair and chaste kisses and stuff, and I got mad at him and told him to stop. I didn\u2019t really say much I just put my clothes on and left.\n\nI haven\u2019t answered his messages today. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author is a 21-year-old female in a relationship with a 26-year-old boyfriend. They've been dating a few months and have sex regularly. They discussed their likes and dislikes beforehand, and she told him she doesn't like sex to be too gentle or passionate because it makes her uncomfortable. She mentions a past abusive relationship where she found that rough sex allows her to let go and have fun, whereas gentle, emotional sex makes her anxious and uncomfortable.\n\nLast night, the boyfriend said he wanted to have \"normal\" sex. The author asked what he meant, and he started kissing her body, which she didn't like. She told him to stop, and he did, but then he kept doing cutesy things like playing with her hair and chaste kisses. She got mad, put her clothes on, and left. She hasn't responded to his messages.\n\nThe author is asking if she's at fault (AITA). She thinks she's not in the wrong. The question is whether to answer A (yes, she's wrong) or B (no, she's not).\n\nFirst, communication is key in relationships. The author communicated her preferences upfront. She told him she doesn't like gentle or passionate sex. So she's given him that information. The boyfriend, on the other hand, might have had his own preferences for \"normal\" sex, which for him seems to be the gentle, affectionate approach. But he didn't consider that her definition of \"normal\" might differ because of her past trauma. \n\nWhen she told him she didn't like the kissing, he stopped but kept doing other things she didn't want. This suggests that he didn't fully respect her boundaries after she expressed discomfort. She then left, which is a valid response when someone doesn't respect your limits. \n\nHer reaction of getting mad and leaving could be seen as justified because she communicated her needs, and he didn't honor them. However, communication could have been better from both sides. She might have needed to be more specific about what she wanted instead of just what she didn't like. But given her history, it's reasonable that she's more direct about her dislikes. \n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend's actions after she asked him to stop could be seen as dismissive. If he truly respected her boundaries, he would have stopped all the things she didn't like instead of trying to be affectionate in another way. \n\nSo, considering that the author communicated her preferences and the boyfriend didn't respect them, she's not in the wrong. The problem lies with the boyfriend not adhering to her boundaries. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, she's not in the wrong).\n"
