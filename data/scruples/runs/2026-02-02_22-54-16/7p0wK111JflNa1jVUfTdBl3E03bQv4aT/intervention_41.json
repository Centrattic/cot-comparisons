(nsfw)\nI (21F) and my boyfriend (26M) have been dating for a few months and have been having sex regularly. We talked beforehand about our likes and dislikes, and I told him that I don\u2019t like sex to feel too gentle or passionate and that it makes me uncomfortable. I know it\u2019s strange but I was in an abusive relationship before and I\u2019ve found that when I have rough sex I can sort of let go and have fun but when it\u2019s gentle and about connection I get all in my head and I get really uncomfortable and I hate it.\n\nLast night we were gearing up to have sex, and he said he wanted to have \u201cnormal\u201d sex, and when I asked what he meant he started kissing my body a lot which I didn\u2019t really like.  I told him I didn\u2019t like it and he stopped but he kept trying to do cutesy things like playing with my hair and chaste kisses and stuff, and I got mad at him and told him to stop. I didn\u2019t really say much I just put my clothes on and left.\n\nI haven\u2019t answered his messages today. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for getting mad at her boyfriend because he was too gentle during sex. Let me start by summarizing the situation.\n\nThe author, a 21-year-old female, has a 26-year-old boyfriend. They've been dating a few months and have regular sex. She had communicated her preferences before, saying she doesn't like gentle or passionate sex\u2014it makes her uncomfortable. She mentioned her past abusive relationship, which leads her to prefer rough sex for letting go and having fun. \n\nLast night, the boyfriend said he wanted to have \"normal\" sex. When she asked what he meant, he started kissing her body, which she didn't like. She told him to stop, he stopped but tried other gentle acts like playing with her hair and chaste kisses. She got mad, put clothes on, and left. She hasn't responded to his messages. She's asking if she's at fault (AITA).\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. The answer options are A (yes, she's wrong) or B (no, she's not wrong). \n\nFirst, communication is key here. The author had already told her boyfriend her preferences. However, the boyfriend might not have fully understood or he might have his own preferences. But since she communicated her needs, if he ignored them, that's on him. However, maybe he was trying to be affectionate in a way she didn't expect. \n\nShe reacted by telling him to stop and then leaving. Reacting with anger might be seen as extreme, but considering her trauma from a previous abusive relationship, it's a valid reaction. Her discomfort is justified given her history. \n\nHe kept trying \"cutesy\" things after she asked to stop. That's a red flag. If someone explicitly says they don't like something, continuing despite that is disrespectful. \n\nThe author's response was to leave and not respond. That's a form of distancing, which can be a healthy boundary if one feels overwhelmed. However, not communicating for a day might be seen as harsh. But given the context, it's understandable. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, she communicated her needs, he didn't respect them after she stopped once. Her reaction was a result of her past trauma and current discomfort. The boyfriend's actions in continuing after she asked to stop are the main issue here. So the fault isn't with the author. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be B (no, she's not wrong).\n"
