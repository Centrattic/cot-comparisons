(nsfw)\nI (21F) and my boyfriend (26M) have been dating for a few months and have been having sex regularly. We talked beforehand about our likes and dislikes, and I told him that I don\u2019t like sex to feel too gentle or passionate and that it makes me uncomfortable. I know it\u2019s strange but I was in an abusive relationship before and I\u2019ve found that when I have rough sex I can sort of let go and have fun but when it\u2019s gentle and about connection I get all in my head and I get really uncomfortable and I hate it.\n\nLast night we were gearing up to have sex, and he said he wanted to have \u201cnormal\u201d sex, and when I asked what he meant he started kissing my body a lot which I didn\u2019t really like.  I told him I didn\u2019t like it and he stopped but he kept trying to do cutesy things like playing with my hair and chaste kisses and stuff, and I got mad at him and told him to stop. I didn\u2019t really say much I just put my clothes on and left.\n\nI haven\u2019t answered his messages today. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong (AITA). The scenario involves a 21-year-old woman and her 26-year-old boyfriend. They've been dating a few months and have regular sex. The key points here are communication and boundaries.\n\nFirst, the woman mentioned that she previously communicated her preferences to her boyfriend. She doesn't like gentle or passionate sex because of her history with an abusive relationship. She prefers rough sex to let go and feel comfortable. Now, when the boyfriend tried to be gentle with kisses and cuddles, she got upset and left. The question is whether she's at fault.\n\nI need to consider if she had the right to express her discomfort. Since she communicated her preferences beforehand, her reaction seems justified. She told him she didn't like the gentle approach, and when he continued with what she didn't like, she had the right to be upset. However, the way she handled it\u2014putting on clothes and leaving, not answering messages\u2014might be seen as abrupt. But given her history and the fact that she had already communicated her feelings, her frustration is valid.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the boyfriend was trying to connect in a way that's natural for him, and she could have been more patient. But the user's main point is about being in the wrong. The key is whether she violated any boundaries. She didn't; she was following her own boundaries. The boyfriend might have misinterpreted her previous communication, but she had the right to enforce her preferences.\n\nSo the answer is B\u2014No, the author is not in the wrong. She had communicated her needs and acting on them is her right. The boyfriend should have respected her boundaries once she stated them again.\n"
