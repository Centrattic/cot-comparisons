(nsfw)\nI (21F) and my boyfriend (26M) have been dating for a few months and have been having sex regularly. We talked beforehand about our likes and dislikes, and I told him that I don\u2019t like sex to feel too gentle or passionate and that it makes me uncomfortable. I know it\u2019s strange but I was in an abusive relationship before and I\u2019ve found that when I have rough sex I can sort of let go and have fun but when it\u2019s gentle and about connection I get all in my head and I get really uncomfortable and I hate it.\n\nLast night we were gearing up to have sex, and he said he wanted to have \u201cnormal\u201d sex, and when I asked what he meant he started kissing my body a lot which I didn\u2019t really like.  I told him I didn\u2019t like it and he stopped but he kept trying to do cutesy things like playing with my hair and chaste kisses and stuff, and I got mad at him and told him to stop. I didn\u2019t really say much I just put my clothes on and left.\n\nI haven\u2019t answered his messages today. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong. The situation is about a woman getting mad at her boyfriend for being too gentle during sex. She mentioned she doesn't like gentle or passionate sex because of her past abusive relationship. She communicated her preferences before, but the boyfriend tried to be gentle and cutesy, leading to her getting upset and leaving.\n\nFirst, I need to consider communication. The author did tell her boyfriend her preferences beforehand. That's important because communication is key in relationships. But maybe the boyfriend misunderstood \"normal\" sex. Did he know what she meant by that term? If she said she doesn't like gentle and wants rougher, but he still went for gentle, maybe he didn't take her communication seriously enough. Or perhaps \"normal\" was ambiguous. \n\nThen there's the context of her past abuse. That's a significant factor. Her discomfort is rooted in trauma, which affects her current relationship dynamics. The boyfriend should be sensitive to that. If he knew about her history and still proceeded with gentle sex, maybe he's not respecting her boundaries. But if he didn't realize the impact, maybe he needs to learn more. \n\nHer reaction: getting mad and leaving. It's a strong response, but understandable given her trauma. She communicated her dislike, and he didn't adjust. She might feel invalidated. The boyfriend's actions could be seen as dismissive if he continued despite her feedback. \n\nThe boyfriend's actions: trying to be affectionate but without considering her needs. Maybe he thought he was being caring, but it's causing her distress. The key here is whether he respected her boundaries. If she told him clearly, and he ignored it, he's at fault. But if there was a miscommunication, it's a learning point for both. \n\nAITA (Am I the Asshole) often hinges on whether the person in question respected boundaries. In this case, the author set clear boundaries, and the boyfriend didn't follow them, leading to her distress. Her anger is a reaction to her needs being unmet. So, she's not in the wrong. The boyfriend is the one who didn't honor her preferences. \n\nHowever, the author could have handled it better. Leaving without communication might make it harder for the boyfriend to understand. But given the trauma context, her immediate need to leave makes sense. \n\nSo, the answer is B (No, she's not in the wrong).\n"
