(nsfw)\nI (21F) and my boyfriend (26M) have been dating for a few months and have been having sex regularly. We talked beforehand about our likes and dislikes, and I told him that I don\u2019t like sex to feel too gentle or passionate and that it makes me uncomfortable. I know it\u2019s strange but I was in an abusive relationship before and I\u2019ve found that when I have rough sex I can sort of let go and have fun but when it\u2019s gentle and about connection I get all in my head and I get really uncomfortable and I hate it.\n\nLast night we were gearing up to have sex, and he said he wanted to have \u201cnormal\u201d sex, and when I asked what he meant he started kissing my body a lot which I didn\u2019t really like.  I told him I didn\u2019t like it and he stopped but he kept trying to do cutesy things like playing with my hair and chaste kisses and stuff, and I got mad at him and told him to stop. I didn\u2019t really say much I just put my clothes on and left.\n\nI haven\u2019t answered his messages today. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author is a 21-year-old woman in a relationship with a 26-year-old boyfriend. They've been dating a few months and have had regular sex. She mentioned to him before that she doesn't like gentle or passionate sex\u2014it makes her uncomfortable. She explains this is because of past abuse, and she finds rough sex more comfortable because it helps her let go, whereas gentle sex makes her anxious and in her head. \n\nLast night, her boyfriend wanted to have \"normal\" sex. When she asked what he meant, he started kissing her body, which she didn't like. She told him to stop, he did but then kept doing things like playing with her hair and chaste kisses. She got mad, put on her clothes, and left. Now she hasn't replied to his messages and is asking if she's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider communication. She had previously communicated her preferences. That's important. If he was aware of her dislikes, then maybe he's at fault for not respecting that. But she also said he did stop when she told him to. However, after stopping, he continued with other actions that she didn't like. So maybe he didn't fully respect her boundaries after the initial stop.\n\nShe got mad and left. Is that a reasonable response? If someone is trying to be affectionate in ways you've communicated you don't like, and you tell them to stop, but they keep doing other things that are still cutesy or gentle, leading to frustration, then getting upset seems valid. She might be in her right to express her discomfort. \n\nBut leaving and not responding could be seen as cutting off communication. However, she might need space, especially given her history. Her emotional response is tied to trauma, so her reaction isn't just about preferences but deeper issues. \n\nOn the other hand, he might have been trying to be affectionate and not realizing that his actions were crossing boundaries after she initially told him to stop. Maybe he didn't fully understand her needs. But since she had already communicated her dislikes before, this might be a case of him not respecting her boundaries adequately, leading to her justified frustration.\n\nThe key points here are communication, past trauma, and respecting boundaries. If he knew her preferences and still proceeded with actions she found uncomfortable after she told him to stop, then he's partly at fault. However, if she could have communicated more clearly during the situation, maybe that's a factor. But given her past, her emotional response is valid. So overall, she might not be in the wrong here. The answer could be B (not in the wrong).\n"
