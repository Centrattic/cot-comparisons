(nsfw)\nI (21F) and my boyfriend (26M) have been dating for a few months and have been having sex regularly. We talked beforehand about our likes and dislikes, and I told him that I don\u2019t like sex to feel too gentle or passionate and that it makes me uncomfortable. I know it\u2019s strange but I was in an abusive relationship before and I\u2019ve found that when I have rough sex I can sort of let go and have fun but when it\u2019s gentle and about connection I get all in my head and I get really uncomfortable and I hate it.\n\nLast night we were gearing up to have sex, and he said he wanted to have \u201cnormal\u201d sex, and when I asked what he meant he started kissing my body a lot which I didn\u2019t really like.  I told him I didn\u2019t like it and he stopped but he kept trying to do cutesy things like playing with my hair and chaste kisses and stuff, and I got mad at him and told him to stop. I didn\u2019t really say much I just put my clothes on and left.\n\nI haven\u2019t answered his messages today. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong for getting mad at her boyfriend for being too gentle during sex. Let's break down the details.\n\nFirst, the author is a 21-year-old female in a relationship with a 26-year-old male. They've been dating for a few months and have been having sex regularly. She mentioned that she had already communicated her preferences to him: she doesn't like gentle or passionate sex because it makes her uncomfortable. Her background includes being in an abusive relationship before, and she finds that rough sex helps her let go, whereas the gentle stuff makes her anxious. \n\nLast night, the boyfriend wanted to have \"normal\" sex. When she asked what he meant, he started kissing her body, which she didn't like. She told him to stop, he did, but then kept doing cutesy things like playing with her hair and chaste kisses. She got mad, put her clothes on, and left. She hasn't replied to his messages. Now she's asking if she's in the wrong.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. I need to decide if the answer is A (Yes, she's in the wrong) or B (No, she's not). \n\nLet's consider communication. The author had already told her boyfriend about her preferences. He might not have fully understood or respected her boundaries. If he had communicated that he wanted to have a different type of sex than what was agreed, maybe that's on him. But she's reacting to his actions not matching her boundaries. She told him to stop, and he tried again with other things. She got upset and left. \n\nHer past with an abusive relationship could influence her current preferences. Trauma can affect how someone experiences intimacy. If she's clear about her needs, and he's not respecting them, even after she tells him, that's a problem. \n\nBut maybe the boyfriend was trying to connect in a way that's natural for him, and she was resistant. However, since she had communicated her discomfort with gentle sex, his actions could be seen as disregarding her boundaries. \n\nThe fact that she left and hasn't answered messages might be a reaction to her frustration. Whether that's wrong depends on context. If she needed time to cool off, that's reasonable. But if she's avoiding communication, that's an issue. The question is about who is in the wrong in the situation described. \n\nThe key points are: prior communication of preferences, the boyfriend's actions not aligning with those preferences despite being told, and the author's response. Since she had communicated her boundaries and he didn't respect them, her anger is a valid reaction. The author isn't in the wrong for asserting her needs and being upset when they're not respected. So the answer should be B.\n"
