(nsfw)\nI (21F) and my boyfriend (26M) have been dating for a few months and have been having sex regularly. We talked beforehand about our likes and dislikes, and I told him that I don\u2019t like sex to feel too gentle or passionate and that it makes me uncomfortable. I know it\u2019s strange but I was in an abusive relationship before and I\u2019ve found that when I have rough sex I can sort of let go and have fun but when it\u2019s gentle and about connection I get all in my head and I get really uncomfortable and I hate it.\n\nLast night we were gearing up to have sex, and he said he wanted to have \u201cnormal\u201d sex, and when I asked what he meant he started kissing my body a lot which I didn\u2019t really like.  I told him I didn\u2019t like it and he stopped but he kept trying to do cutesy things like playing with my hair and chaste kisses and stuff, and I got mad at him and told him to stop. I didn\u2019t really say much I just put my clothes on and left.\n\nI haven\u2019t answered his messages today. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about a woman getting upset with her boyfriend for being too gentle during sex. She mentioned she had previously told him she doesn't like gentle or passionate sex because of her past abusive relationship. Now, when he goes for a \"normal\" approach with more gentle actions like kissing and chaste kisses, she gets uncomfortable and angry.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the communication aspect. She did communicate her preferences beforehand, so the boyfriend might not have fully understood or remembered. But she also mentioned that she gets uncomfortable when it's gentle, which is the opposite of her previous experience. Maybe the boyfriend was trying to be more considerate, but she's still reacting negatively. \n\nThen there's her history of abuse, which is a significant factor. Trauma can affect how someone experiences intimacy, so her reaction might be a result of that. The boyfriend might not be aware of the depth of her trauma, but she did explain it. However, he might have wanted to connect emotionally, which she's not comfortable with because of her past.\n\nThe author left the situation abruptly and hasn't responded to messages. That could be seen as not addressing the issue directly. But given her discomfort, maybe she needed time to process. The question is whether her reaction was justified. Since she communicated her needs and the situation still led to conflict, it's possible the boyfriend didn't adjust enough. But she also might have handled the conflict better instead of leaving and not replying. \n\nConsidering all that, the author isn't in the wrong because she had valid reasons based on her trauma and had communicated her preferences. The boyfriend might need to be more adaptable, but her reaction stems from her needs. So, answer B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
