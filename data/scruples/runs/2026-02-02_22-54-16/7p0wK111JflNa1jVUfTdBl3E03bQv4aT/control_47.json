(nsfw)\nI (21F) and my boyfriend (26M) have been dating for a few months and have been having sex regularly. We talked beforehand about our likes and dislikes, and I told him that I don\u2019t like sex to feel too gentle or passionate and that it makes me uncomfortable. I know it\u2019s strange but I was in an abusive relationship before and I\u2019ve found that when I have rough sex I can sort of let go and have fun but when it\u2019s gentle and about connection I get all in my head and I get really uncomfortable and I hate it.\n\nLast night we were gearing up to have sex, and he said he wanted to have \u201cnormal\u201d sex, and when I asked what he meant he started kissing my body a lot which I didn\u2019t really like.  I told him I didn\u2019t like it and he stopped but he kept trying to do cutesy things like playing with my hair and chaste kisses and stuff, and I got mad at him and told him to stop. I didn\u2019t really say much I just put my clothes on and left.\n\nI haven\u2019t answered his messages today. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a woman getting mad at her boyfriend for being too gentle during sex. They had talked about their preferences before, and she had mentioned she doesn't like it when it's too gentle or passionate because of her past abusive relationship. Now, the boyfriend tried to be gentle again, and she got upset, told him to stop, and left.\n\nFirst, the key points here are communication and mutual respect. The author had clearly communicated her boundaries and preferences. She mentioned her discomfort with gentle sex due to her history. The boyfriend, however, tried to be gentle again, which the author found uncomfortable. Even though he tried to stop when she told him, she felt upset and left. \n\nNow, the question is whether she's in the wrong. The boyfriend might argue he was trying to be considerate, but the author had already set her boundaries. If he knew that being gentle triggered her, he should have respected that and adjusted his approach. However, the author also left the situation and didn't respond to his messages. That might be seen as dismissive or not giving him a chance to explain or adjust. \n\nBut considering her past trauma and her clear communication, her reaction might be justified. She's prioritizing her comfort and safety. The boyfriend should have listened and adapted to her needs. However, the author's response of getting angry and leaving could be seen as not addressing the issue constructively. Maybe she could have discussed it instead of withdrawing. But given the context of her trauma, her actions might be understandable. \n\nOn the other hand, if he had tried to be gentle after they discussed it, maybe he should have asked again what she preferred or tried a different approach. The fact that he continued with cutesy things after she told him to stop might show he wasn't respecting her boundaries. \n\nSo, weighing both sides, the author isn't in the wrong because she communicated her needs and acted to protect her mental health. The boyfriend, however, didn't fully honor her boundaries. The author's response, while maybe not ideal, is a reaction to her discomfort. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
