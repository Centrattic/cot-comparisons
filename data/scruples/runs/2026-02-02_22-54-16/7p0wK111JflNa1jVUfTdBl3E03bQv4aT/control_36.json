(nsfw)\nI (21F) and my boyfriend (26M) have been dating for a few months and have been having sex regularly. We talked beforehand about our likes and dislikes, and I told him that I don\u2019t like sex to feel too gentle or passionate and that it makes me uncomfortable. I know it\u2019s strange but I was in an abusive relationship before and I\u2019ve found that when I have rough sex I can sort of let go and have fun but when it\u2019s gentle and about connection I get all in my head and I get really uncomfortable and I hate it.\n\nLast night we were gearing up to have sex, and he said he wanted to have \u201cnormal\u201d sex, and when I asked what he meant he started kissing my body a lot which I didn\u2019t really like.  I told him I didn\u2019t like it and he stopped but he kept trying to do cutesy things like playing with my hair and chaste kisses and stuff, and I got mad at him and told him to stop. I didn\u2019t really say much I just put my clothes on and left.\n\nI haven\u2019t answered his messages today. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading the situation carefully.\n\nThe author is a 21-year-old female in a relationship with a 26-year-old male. They've been dating a few months and have been having regular sex. She mentioned to him before that she doesn't like sex that's too gentle or passionate and finds it uncomfortable. Her reason is that she was in an abusive relationship before, and rough sex helps her let go and have fun. Gentle, connected sex makes her anxious and uncomfortable.\n\nLast night, he wanted to have \"normal\" sex, which she didn't like. When he started doing things like kissing her body and cutesy stuff like playing with her hair and chaste kisses, she told him to stop. She got mad, put her clothes on, and left. She hasn't responded to his messages. She's asking if she's the one at fault.\n\nFirst, I should consider communication. She did communicate her preferences to him. She told him that gentle sex is uncomfortable for her. So he was aware. But when he went ahead and tried to have what he considered \"normal\" sex, which she interpreted as too gentle, that's a problem. He might not have understood or respected her boundaries. But maybe he thought he was being respectful by trying to be gentle because of her past.\n\nBut she explicitly said she didn't like that. So if he didn't take her communication seriously, then he's at fault. However, she did get mad and left, and hasn't responded. So is her reaction justified? She's been clear, and when he continued doing things she didn't like, she tried to stop him. He kept doing them, so she got upset. Her action of leaving and not replying might be an overreaction, but maybe it's because she's not handling her discomfort well.\n\nBut the main point is whether she's in the wrong. Since she communicated her needs and he didn't respect them, he might be at fault. However, she could have handled the situation better by expressing her feelings more calmly. But the question is about her being in the wrong. If she communicated her boundaries and he didn't follow through, she's not necessarily wrong for being upset. She might need to take some responsibility for her reaction, but he also needs to respect her boundaries. So maybe the answer is B (No, she's not in the wrong), because he didn't respect her communication.\n"
