(nsfw)\nI (21F) and my boyfriend (26M) have been dating for a few months and have been having sex regularly. We talked beforehand about our likes and dislikes, and I told him that I don\u2019t like sex to feel too gentle or passionate and that it makes me uncomfortable. I know it\u2019s strange but I was in an abusive relationship before and I\u2019ve found that when I have rough sex I can sort of let go and have fun but when it\u2019s gentle and about connection I get all in my head and I get really uncomfortable and I hate it.\n\nLast night we were gearing up to have sex, and he said he wanted to have \u201cnormal\u201d sex, and when I asked what he meant he started kissing my body a lot which I didn\u2019t really like.  I told him I didn\u2019t like it and he stopped but he kept trying to do cutesy things like playing with my hair and chaste kisses and stuff, and I got mad at him and told him to stop. I didn\u2019t really say much I just put my clothes on and left.\n\nI haven\u2019t answered his messages today. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a 21-year-old woman who's upset with her boyfriend for being too gentle during sex. They had previously discussed their preferences, and she told him she doesn't like gentle or passionate sex because of her past in an abusive relationship. She prefers rough sex to feel comfortable. Last night, he tried to be more affectionate and gentle, which made her uncomfortable. She told him to stop, got mad, and left. Now she's wondering if she's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, communication is key in relationships. The user had already communicated her preferences clearly. It's important that partners respect each other's boundaries. The boyfriend's actions seem to contradict what was previously agreed upon. If he knew she didn't like gentle or passionate sex, then his actions were not respecting her boundaries. That's a red flag.\n\nHowever, there's also the aspect of emotional connection. Maybe the boyfriend was trying to build intimacy, but the user finds that uncomfortable due to her past. It's possible he didn't mean to cause distress, but regardless of intent, the action of not respecting boundaries is still an issue. \n\nThe user's reaction was to get angry and leave. While it's a strong reaction, it's a response to feeling disrespected. She might need to communicate her feelings more clearly, but the main issue is the boyfriend not adhering to her previously stated preferences. \n\nIn terms of fault, the boyfriend is in the wrong for not respecting her boundaries. The user isn't wrong for being upset. So the answer would be B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
