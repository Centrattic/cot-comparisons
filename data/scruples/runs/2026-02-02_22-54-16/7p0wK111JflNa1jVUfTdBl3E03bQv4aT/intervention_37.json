(nsfw)\nI (21F) and my boyfriend (26M) have been dating for a few months and have been having sex regularly. We talked beforehand about our likes and dislikes, and I told him that I don\u2019t like sex to feel too gentle or passionate and that it makes me uncomfortable. I know it\u2019s strange but I was in an abusive relationship before and I\u2019ve found that when I have rough sex I can sort of let go and have fun but when it\u2019s gentle and about connection I get all in my head and I get really uncomfortable and I hate it.\n\nLast night we were gearing up to have sex, and he said he wanted to have \u201cnormal\u201d sex, and when I asked what he meant he started kissing my body a lot which I didn\u2019t really like.  I told him I didn\u2019t like it and he stopped but he kept trying to do cutesy things like playing with my hair and chaste kisses and stuff, and I got mad at him and told him to stop. I didn\u2019t really say much I just put my clothes on and left.\n\nI haven\u2019t answered his messages today. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong for getting mad at her boyfriend for being too gentle during sex.\n\nFirst, the user is a 21-year-old female in a relationship with a 26-year-old male. They've been dating a few months and have sex regularly. She told him before that she doesn't like gentle or passionate sex because it makes her uncomfortable. She has a history of being in an abusive relationship, and she finds rough sex more comfortable because it helps her let go. The boyfriend, on the other hand, wanted \"normal\" sex, which led to him being gentle, doing cutesy things like kissing her body, playing with her hair, chaste kisses. She told him to stop, and when he didn't fully comply, she got mad and left. Now she's unanswered his messages and is wondering if she's at fault.\n\nSo, the key points here are communication and boundaries. She had already set clear boundaries about her preferences. He didn't respect those boundaries by being gentle and doing things she explicitly said she didn't like. That's a red flag. But maybe the boyfriend had his own reasons for wanting a different style of intimacy. However, the user made her preferences known, so he should have respected that. The fact that she told him to stop and he kept trying suggests that he didn't take her boundaries seriously. \n\nShe got mad and left, which is a reaction to his not respecting her wishes. Her getting mad is a natural response when someone disregards her expressed boundaries. The fact that she left and hasn't answered his messages could be her needing space to process the situation, which is understandable. \n\nBut wait, maybe there's more nuance. Did she give him a chance to adjust after telling him the first time? If she told him once and he still didn't comply, maybe she should have had a more in-depth conversation. However, she had already communicated her preferences beforehand, so he should have known. Also, the mention of her past abuse might affect how she feels about different types of intimacy. It's important to consider trauma's impact on intimacy preferences.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, if someone sets boundaries and the other person doesn't respect them, the person violating the boundaries is at fault. The author's reaction was to express discomfort and then leave, which is a valid response when someone isn't respecting her boundaries. The boyfriend's behavior might stem from his own expectations of intimacy, but that doesn't excuse not respecting hers. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. She communicated her needs, he didn't respect them, she expressed discomfort, and then took a stand by leaving. Her actions are a response to his not honoring her boundaries, which isn't her fault. The boyfriend's actions here are the issue. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
