(nsfw)\nI (21F) and my boyfriend (26M) have been dating for a few months and have been having sex regularly. We talked beforehand about our likes and dislikes, and I told him that I don\u2019t like sex to feel too gentle or passionate and that it makes me uncomfortable. I know it\u2019s strange but I was in an abusive relationship before and I\u2019ve found that when I have rough sex I can sort of let go and have fun but when it\u2019s gentle and about connection I get all in my head and I get really uncomfortable and I hate it.\n\nLast night we were gearing up to have sex, and he said he wanted to have \u201cnormal\u201d sex, and when I asked what he meant he started kissing my body a lot which I didn\u2019t really like.  I told him I didn\u2019t like it and he stopped but he kept trying to do cutesy things like playing with my hair and chaste kisses and stuff, and I got mad at him and told him to stop. I didn\u2019t really say much I just put my clothes on and left.\n\nI haven\u2019t answered his messages today. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the situation described is in the wrong. So, the scenario is about a 21-year-old woman and her 26-year-old boyfriend who's been dating a few months. They've had sex regularly, and she told him she doesn't like gentle or passionate sex because of her past abusive relationship. She prefers rough sex to feel comfortable, and when he tried to be gentle, she got mad and left.\n\nFirst, I need to consider communication. The author mentioned she told him her preferences upfront. That's good because open communication is key in relationships. But then, when he tried to do what she didn't like, she got upset. However, she also reacted by getting angry and leaving, not answering his messages. \n\nThe boyfriend might not have realized that his approach was making her uncomfortable again. Even if he meant well, if he's not respecting her boundaries after she's communicated them, that's a problem. But on the other hand, if he was trying to adjust based on his understanding of what's normal or caring, maybe there's a miscommunication here.\n\nHer reaction of getting angry and leaving might seem harsh, but given her history of abuse, it's possible that her discomfort is valid. People have different needs and triggers, and it's important for partners to be flexible and understanding. \n\nIs she in the wrong? Well, she did communicate her needs, so if he didn't follow through, maybe he's at fault. But her reaction could be seen as not handling it calmly. However, considering her history, her emotional response is understandable. \n\nSo, the key points are: communication of preferences, the boyfriend's actions not aligning with those preferences, and how they both handled the situation. If the boyfriend didn't respect her boundaries, he's in the wrong. If she overreacted, she might be. But given her traumatic background, her discomfort is more about her needs than his actions being inherently wrong. The answer likely hinges on whether he truly didn't understand her needs or ignored them. Since she had told him, he should have known. So, maybe the author isn't in the wrong here.\n"
