(nsfw)\nI (21F) and my boyfriend (26M) have been dating for a few months and have been having sex regularly. We talked beforehand about our likes and dislikes, and I told him that I don\u2019t like sex to feel too gentle or passionate and that it makes me uncomfortable. I know it\u2019s strange but I was in an abusive relationship before and I\u2019ve found that when I have rough sex I can sort of let go and have fun but when it\u2019s gentle and about connection I get all in my head and I get really uncomfortable and I hate it.\n\nLast night we were gearing up to have sex, and he said he wanted to have \u201cnormal\u201d sex, and when I asked what he meant he started kissing my body a lot which I didn\u2019t really like.  I told him I didn\u2019t like it and he stopped but he kept trying to do cutesy things like playing with my hair and chaste kisses and stuff, and I got mad at him and told him to stop. I didn\u2019t really say much I just put my clothes on and left.\n\nI haven\u2019t answered his messages today. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong (AITA). The situation involves a 21F who is upset with her 26M boyfriend for being too gentle during sex. She mentioned they had discussed their preferences beforehand, and she told him she doesn't like gentle or passionate sex because of past trauma from an abusive relationship. Now, when he tried to be gentle, she got mad and left.\n\nFirst, I need to consider communication. She did communicate her preferences upfront, which is good. But maybe she didn't explain the underlying reason (past trauma) until later? Wait, in the scenario, she says she told him about her discomfort with gentle sex and the reason (abusive relationship). So he should have known her boundaries. However, when he wanted to have \"normal\" sex, which he interpreted as gentle, maybe he didn't fully understand or remembered her boundaries. Or perhaps \"normal\" for him is different than what she expects.\n\nWhen she told him she didn't like it, he stopped but kept trying cutesy stuff. She then got mad and left. The question is whether she's in the wrong. Her actions were a reaction to her discomfort, which is valid given her history. However, leaving abruptly and not responding to his messages could be seen as cutting off communication, which isn't helpful. But considering her trauma, her reaction might be a protective measure. The boyfriend might be trying to be affectionate but not respecting her current needs despite prior communication. Alternatively, maybe he misunderstood her initial communication. \n\nIn terms of accountability, both might share some responsibility. She communicated her needs, but if he didn't fully internalize them or if there was a miscommunication, he might be at fault. Her reaction is a result of her trauma, which is valid, but her response (getting angry, leaving, not responding) could be seen as harsh. However, given her past, it's a valid response. So, is she in the wrong? It depends on whether his actions violated her boundaries despite prior communication. Since she told him she doesn't like gentle and he still did things that made her uncomfortable after she asked him to stop, he might be in the wrong. Therefore, she's not in the wrong for standing up for her boundaries. So answer B.\n"
