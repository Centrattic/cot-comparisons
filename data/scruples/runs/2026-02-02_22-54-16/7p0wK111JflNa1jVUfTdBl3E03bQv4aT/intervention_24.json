(nsfw)\nI (21F) and my boyfriend (26M) have been dating for a few months and have been having sex regularly. We talked beforehand about our likes and dislikes, and I told him that I don\u2019t like sex to feel too gentle or passionate and that it makes me uncomfortable. I know it\u2019s strange but I was in an abusive relationship before and I\u2019ve found that when I have rough sex I can sort of let go and have fun but when it\u2019s gentle and about connection I get all in my head and I get really uncomfortable and I hate it.\n\nLast night we were gearing up to have sex, and he said he wanted to have \u201cnormal\u201d sex, and when I asked what he meant he started kissing my body a lot which I didn\u2019t really like.  I told him I didn\u2019t like it and he stopped but he kept trying to do cutesy things like playing with my hair and chaste kisses and stuff, and I got mad at him and told him to stop. I didn\u2019t really say much I just put my clothes on and left.\n\nI haven\u2019t answered his messages today. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves her getting upset with her boyfriend for being too gentle during sex. She mentioned they had prior discussions about her preferences, including that she doesn't like gentle or passionate sex, which makes her uncomfortable due to a previous abusive relationship. She prefers rougher sex, which helps her feel more comfortable and have fun. \n\nWhen they had sex, the boyfriend tried to be gentle, doing things like kissing her body and playing with her hair. She told him she didn't like it, he stopped but continued with cutesy actions. She then got mad, put on clothes, and left. She's now not responding to his messages and is wondering if she's the asshole.\n\nFirst, communication is key in relationships, especially regarding sexual preferences. The author did communicate her preferences beforehand, which is important. However, the boyfriend's interpretation of \"normal\" sex might be different from hers. He might have thought they were finding a middle ground, but she clearly stated her discomfort. \n\nHer history of abuse complicates things. It's crucial to consider that past trauma can affect current behavior and comfort levels. Her reaction is a response to her previous experiences, which might make her more sensitive to certain behaviors. \n\nThe boyfriend, on the other hand, might have been trying to be attentive and caring, but not realizing that his actions were triggering for her. He did stop when she told him, but continued with other actions, which she found annoying. \n\nThe author's anger and leaving might be a way to express her discomfort, but the way she handled it (leaving and not responding) could be seen as abrupt or not giving him a chance to understand. However, she did communicate her feelings, which is a valid response. \n\nIs she in the wrong? If she communicated her preferences and the boyfriend didn't respect that after being told, then he might be at fault. But if he was trying his best and she didn't give him a chance to adjust, maybe she's partially at fault. However, considering her past trauma, her reaction is understandable. The key is mutual respect and communication. She's not in the wrong for expressing her needs, but maybe the way she handled the aftermath could be discussed. Still, given the context, the answer is likely B.\n"
