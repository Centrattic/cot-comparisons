(nsfw)\nI (21F) and my boyfriend (26M) have been dating for a few months and have been having sex regularly. We talked beforehand about our likes and dislikes, and I told him that I don\u2019t like sex to feel too gentle or passionate and that it makes me uncomfortable. I know it\u2019s strange but I was in an abusive relationship before and I\u2019ve found that when I have rough sex I can sort of let go and have fun but when it\u2019s gentle and about connection I get all in my head and I get really uncomfortable and I hate it.\n\nLast night we were gearing up to have sex, and he said he wanted to have \u201cnormal\u201d sex, and when I asked what he meant he started kissing my body a lot which I didn\u2019t really like.  I told him I didn\u2019t like it and he stopped but he kept trying to do cutesy things like playing with my hair and chaste kisses and stuff, and I got mad at him and told him to stop. I didn\u2019t really say much I just put my clothes on and left.\n\nI haven\u2019t answered his messages today. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again.\n\nThe author is a 21-year-old female in a relationship with a 26-year-old male. They've been dating a few months and have regular sex. The author told her boyfriend before that she doesn't like gentle or passionate sex because it makes her uncomfortable. She explains that her past abusive relationship makes her prefer rough sex, which helps her \"let go and have fun,\" whereas gentle, connected sex makes her anxious and she ends up not liking it. \n\nLast night, the boyfriend wanted to have \"normal\" sex, which involved kissing her body, something she didn't like. She told him to stop, he did, but kept doing cutesy things like playing with her hair and chaste kisses. Then she got mad and left. She hasn't responded to his messages today and is asking if she's in the wrong (AITA).\n\nFirst, communication is key in relationships, especially regarding sexual preferences. The author did communicate her dislike for gentle sex upfront. However, the boyfriend might not fully understand her specific needs, especially if he's not had that kind of experience before. He tried to engage in affectionate acts, which she found uncomfortable. She gave him feedback to stop, but he continued with other gentle gestures, leading her to end the interaction and leave.\n\nNow, the question is whether she's in the wrong. From her perspective, she had already communicated her boundaries, and when they weren't respected (even if he stopped the specific act but continued with other things she didn't like), she felt justified in reacting. Her past trauma might make certain types of intimacy triggering, so her response is rooted in that experience.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend might feel that he was trying to be affectionate and that she overreacted. But since she had already stated her preferences, he should be respecting those. If he's not sure why she's uncomfortable, he might not know how to adjust properly. However, continuing after she told him to stop could be an issue.\n\nThe key points are: prior communication about preferences, the boyfriend's actions post-communication, and the author's reaction. Since she had already told him, and he didn't fully comply, her frustration is understandable. Leaving when she felt uncomfortable is a way to set a boundary. Whether that's wrong depends on the context. If he was trying to readjust and she left without further communication, maybe he needed more explanation. But if she clearly stated her discomfort and he kept doing things she didn't like, her reaction is justified.\n\nI think the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong. She communicated her needs, and if the boyfriend is having trouble respecting them, it's on him to adjust. Her response was about maintaining her comfort, which is important, especially with trauma history.\n"
