(nsfw)\nI (21F) and my boyfriend (26M) have been dating for a few months and have been having sex regularly. We talked beforehand about our likes and dislikes, and I told him that I don\u2019t like sex to feel too gentle or passionate and that it makes me uncomfortable. I know it\u2019s strange but I was in an abusive relationship before and I\u2019ve found that when I have rough sex I can sort of let go and have fun but when it\u2019s gentle and about connection I get all in my head and I get really uncomfortable and I hate it.\n\nLast night we were gearing up to have sex, and he said he wanted to have \u201cnormal\u201d sex, and when I asked what he meant he started kissing my body a lot which I didn\u2019t really like.  I told him I didn\u2019t like it and he stopped but he kept trying to do cutesy things like playing with my hair and chaste kisses and stuff, and I got mad at him and told him to stop. I didn\u2019t really say much I just put my clothes on and left.\n\nI haven\u2019t answered his messages today. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for getting angry at her boyfriend for being too gentle during sex. The author, a 21-year-old woman, has a history of being in an abusive relationship. She told her boyfriend she doesn't like gentle sex because it makes her uncomfortable, preferring rougher sex where she can \"let go.\" The boyfriend tried to be gentle after saying he wanted \"normal\" sex, which she didn't like. She got mad, put clothes on, and left. Now she's MIA.\n\nFirst, I need to assess communication. The author had previously communicated her preferences. The boyfriend might not have fully understood or respected her boundaries, given his past actions. But he did stop when she told him. However, she might need him to adjust more. But she also reacted by leaving, which is a strong response. \n\nHer history of abuse complicates things. Trauma can affect how someone experiences intimacy. What's normal for others might trigger her. The boyfriend might not realize the depth of her discomfort. But he tried to stop when she said so, so maybe he's trying to be responsive.\n\nThe question is whether her reaction is justified. She was clear about her needs. If he can't meet those, there's a miscommunication. But she also left without addressing it. Maybe she should have discussed it after. But considering her trauma, maybe her reaction is a form of self-protection.\n\nI think she's not in the wrong because she communicated her needs and reacted based on trauma. The boyfriend should have been more accommodating. Her anger is a valid response to discomfort. So answer B.\n"
