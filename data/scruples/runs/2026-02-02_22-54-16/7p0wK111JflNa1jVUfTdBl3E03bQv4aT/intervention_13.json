(nsfw)\nI (21F) and my boyfriend (26M) have been dating for a few months and have been having sex regularly. We talked beforehand about our likes and dislikes, and I told him that I don\u2019t like sex to feel too gentle or passionate and that it makes me uncomfortable. I know it\u2019s strange but I was in an abusive relationship before and I\u2019ve found that when I have rough sex I can sort of let go and have fun but when it\u2019s gentle and about connection I get all in my head and I get really uncomfortable and I hate it.\n\nLast night we were gearing up to have sex, and he said he wanted to have \u201cnormal\u201d sex, and when I asked what he meant he started kissing my body a lot which I didn\u2019t really like.  I told him I didn\u2019t like it and he stopped but he kept trying to do cutesy things like playing with my hair and chaste kisses and stuff, and I got mad at him and told him to stop. I didn\u2019t really say much I just put my clothes on and left.\n\nI haven\u2019t answered his messages today. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The author is a 21-year-old woman who gets upset when her boyfriend is too gentle during sex. They had discussed their preferences beforehand, and she mentioned she doesn't like gentle or passionate sex. She has a history of being in an abusive relationship, which makes her prefer rough sex to feel more comfortable. \n\nThe situation is that her boyfriend wanted to have \"normal\" sex, which led to him being gentle and affectionate, things she doesn't like. She told him to stop, got mad, and left. Now she's wondering if she's at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider communication. The author did communicate her preferences upfront, which is good. Her boyfriend might not have fully understood or respected her boundaries after the discussion. However, when she told him to stop during the interaction, he didn't comply immediately, which could be a problem. \n\nEmotionally, her reaction is influenced by past trauma. That's a significant factor. People's past experiences can affect their current behavior and comfort levels in relationships. It's important that her partner is aware of this and respects it. \n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend might be trying to connect emotionally, which is a valid need too. But if he's not respecting her stated boundaries, that's an issue. The fact that he continued despite her asking him to stop suggests he wasn't respecting her comfort zone. \n\nThe author's actions\u2014getting upset and leaving\u2014might seem harsh, but given her history and the communication she had already provided, her reaction is understandable. She's prioritizing her comfort and safety, which is crucial, especially after trauma. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, both parties have roles. The author communicated her needs but could have handled the situation with more patience or explained her feelings further. However, the boyfriend's main fault is not respecting her boundaries once they were clearly stated. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong because she communicated her needs and tried to address the issue when it wasn't respected. Her history adds context to her reactions. The boyfriend might need to adjust his approach and ensure he's meeting her needs based on their prior discussion.\n"
