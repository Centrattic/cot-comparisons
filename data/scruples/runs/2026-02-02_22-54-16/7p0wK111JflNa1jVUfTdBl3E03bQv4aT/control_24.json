(nsfw)\nI (21F) and my boyfriend (26M) have been dating for a few months and have been having sex regularly. We talked beforehand about our likes and dislikes, and I told him that I don\u2019t like sex to feel too gentle or passionate and that it makes me uncomfortable. I know it\u2019s strange but I was in an abusive relationship before and I\u2019ve found that when I have rough sex I can sort of let go and have fun but when it\u2019s gentle and about connection I get all in my head and I get really uncomfortable and I hate it.\n\nLast night we were gearing up to have sex, and he said he wanted to have \u201cnormal\u201d sex, and when I asked what he meant he started kissing my body a lot which I didn\u2019t really like.  I told him I didn\u2019t like it and he stopped but he kept trying to do cutesy things like playing with my hair and chaste kisses and stuff, and I got mad at him and told him to stop. I didn\u2019t really say much I just put my clothes on and left.\n\nI haven\u2019t answered his messages today. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves her getting mad at her boyfriend for being too gentle during sex. She mentioned that she had previously told him she doesn't like gentle or passionate sex because of an abusive relationship. She prefers rough sex, which helps her let go, but gentle stuff makes her uncomfortable. Last night, when he wanted to have \"normal\" sex and did some gentle things like kissing her body and playing with her hair, she told him to stop and left. Now she's wondering if she's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider communication. The user had already communicated her preferences to her boyfriend. That's important. If he had followed her previous instructions, maybe the situation wouldn't have escalated. But he chose to go for something she didn't like. So, he might have ignored her boundaries, which could make him at least partially responsible.\n\nHowever, the user's reaction is also a factor. She got mad and left without addressing the issue further. Even though she communicated her preferences, maybe she could have handled it more constructively. For example, explaining again why she felt uncomfortable and discussing their differing needs. But given her history, her reaction might be a valid response to feeling triggered.\n\nAnother angle is consent and mutual respect. Both need to respect each other's boundaries. If he had respected her prior communication, he wouldn't have done the things that made her uncomfortable. On the other hand, she could have communicated her discomfort again during the encounter instead of reacting with anger and leaving.\n\nThe boyfriend's actions after she asked him to stop are important. If he kept trying after she told him no, that's a problem. It suggests he didn't take her boundaries seriously. She then left, which is a way to remove herself from the situation, but not necessarily the best way to resolve it.\n\nConsidering all this, the user isn't in the wrong because she communicated her needs, and her boyfriend didn't follow through. Her reaction, while perhaps not ideal, is a response to her past trauma and her current discomfort. The boyfriend's actions might be more at fault here for not respecting her previously stated preferences and continuing after she asked to stop. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
