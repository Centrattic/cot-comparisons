(nsfw)\nI (21F) and my boyfriend (26M) have been dating for a few months and have been having sex regularly. We talked beforehand about our likes and dislikes, and I told him that I don\u2019t like sex to feel too gentle or passionate and that it makes me uncomfortable. I know it\u2019s strange but I was in an abusive relationship before and I\u2019ve found that when I have rough sex I can sort of let go and have fun but when it\u2019s gentle and about connection I get all in my head and I get really uncomfortable and I hate it.\n\nLast night we were gearing up to have sex, and he said he wanted to have \u201cnormal\u201d sex, and when I asked what he meant he started kissing my body a lot which I didn\u2019t really like.  I told him I didn\u2019t like it and he stopped but he kept trying to do cutesy things like playing with my hair and chaste kisses and stuff, and I got mad at him and told him to stop. I didn\u2019t really say much I just put my clothes on and left.\n\nI haven\u2019t answered his messages today. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a 21-year-old woman who's upset because her 26-year-old boyfriend was too gentle during sex. She mentioned that she doesn't like gentle or passionate sex because of a previous abusive relationship. She prefers rough sex to feel comfortable. The boyfriend tried to be affectionate with things like kissing her body, playing with her hair, and chaste kisses, which she didn't like. She got mad, told him to stop, put on her clothes, and left. Now she's wondering if she's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, communication is key in relationships, especially around sex. She did tell him her preferences beforehand, so he should have known. But when he went ahead with what she didn't like, that's a problem. He didn't respect her boundaries in the moment. However, she also didn't communicate clearly during the act. She told him to stop but didn't explain why or what she needed. Maybe she could have asked for something different instead of getting upset. \n\nHer reaction of getting angry and leaving might be a bit abrupt, but considering her past trauma, it's understandable. She's dealing with emotional triggers from abuse, which affects how she wants to experience intimacy. The boyfriend's actions might have been his way of showing affection, but he didn't adjust based on her feedback. \n\nSo, both sides have some responsibility. She could have communicated better during the act, and he should have respected her boundaries more. But since she had already told him her preferences, his actions were a breach. Therefore, the author isn't entirely in the wrong. The answer would be B.\n"
