I am a 35 year old woman. For many women, unwinding means a bottle of wine. For me, I prefer to pop an edible or two and relax in front of a paint canvas, my sewing machine, etc.\n\nMy sister's husband had an emergency that resulted in her needing to quickly find a sitter for her 9 year old. I like my niece and obviously wanted to help out my sister, but warned her that she'd probably be bored at my place, since we don't have a lot of kid-friendly stuff.  At one point after she dropped her off with some books, I got up to take a shower. I'm pretty sure this is when it happened.\n\nAbout an hour or so later, I notice niece hadn't said anything for a while. I went over to the couch to see what was up, and she's just staring at the ceiling with one of her books on her stomach. I ask her if she's okay, and I immediately knew something was up. She said \"I ate some of your candy and it made me feel funny.\"\n\nShe had, in fact, eaten several of the sour gummies I had on my dresser. That I hadn't thought to lock up or anything like that because I'm a 35 year old woman who doesn't need to think about those things. Like ever.\n\nI panicked, she seemed fine, I called poison control and called her mom and panicked a lot more. I felt awful. It hadn't even occurred to me that this is a thing that would happen. Honestly, I did not foresee this happening. At all. Niece is completely fine, she ended up falling asleep after asking me for a grilled cheese sandwich with cut up hot dogs in it and asking if we could watch a movie. I stayed with her, kept her hydrated, etc, and apologized at least six million times to my sister, who was horrified and actually screamed at me. Once again, my niece is *fine.*\n\nEven my parents are in on it, blaming me and telling me I should have those things in a safe where no one could get to them, how could I possibly thing it was okay to have them around a child, no one should ever let their kids around me because next time I might give them a beer, etc etc. And I've been uninvited from anywhere that my niece will be, because they think somehow I planned for this to happen.\n\nI feel awful, like I've said a million times, but I really don't think I'm an asshole for this happening. I didn't do this on purpose. I have never needed to lock up my edibles before for the same reason I would never lock up a bottle of wine. When my sister called me in a panic, it wasn't like I thought \"Oh my god, I need to immediately childproof my home!\"\n\nBut am I the asshole here? Do I really deserve what's happening now?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that she had edibles (cannabis-infused sour gummies) on her dresser, didn't lock them up, and her 9-year-old niece ate some. The kid got high, which worried everyone. The author is in Colorado where cannabis is legal, but obviously, kids shouldn't have access to it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. Colorado has laws about keeping cannabis products secure to prevent access by children. I think Colorado's law requires that cannabis products be stored in a child-resistant container and out of reach of children. If the author left them on her dresser, maybe that's a violation. If she's responsible for a minor in her care, she might have a legal duty to secure those items.\n\nThen there's the ethical side. Even if it's legal for her to use cannabis, when she's in a situation where a child is present, she has a responsibility to ensure their safety. The fact that she didn't think about it doesn't excuse it. Parents and guardians are supposed to anticipate that kids might be curious and take precautions. The author admitted she didn't lock them up because she's an adult who doesn't need to worry about such things, but having a child in her home changes that responsibility.\n\nThe sister was in a crisis and needed a sitter. The author volunteered but didn't prepare the environment to be safe for the child. Even if she thought the kid would be bored, she should have considered securing all potentially dangerous items, including edibles. The consequences were that the niece got high, which is serious. Even though the kid is fine now, the risk was there, and she didn't take reasonable precautions.\n\nThe author is facing backlash from family, which makes sense because child safety is a big deal. The parents are worried she might be a bad influence or careless. Her own parents are blaming her, which adds to the social consequences. The fact that she panicked and called poison control shows she realized the severity, but the initial negligence is still there.\n\nSo, from a legal and ethical standpoint, the author is at fault for not securing the edibles when a child was in her care. Even if it was an oversight, the responsibility is on her to prevent such accidents. The answer is likely that she is in the wrong.\n"
