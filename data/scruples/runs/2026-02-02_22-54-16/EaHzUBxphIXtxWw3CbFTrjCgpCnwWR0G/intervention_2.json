I am a 35 year old woman. For many women, unwinding means a bottle of wine. For me, I prefer to pop an edible or two and relax in front of a paint canvas, my sewing machine, etc.\n\nMy sister's husband had an emergency that resulted in her needing to quickly find a sitter for her 9 year old. I like my niece and obviously wanted to help out my sister, but warned her that she'd probably be bored at my place, since we don't have a lot of kid-friendly stuff.  At one point after she dropped her off with some books, I got up to take a shower. I'm pretty sure this is when it happened.\n\nAbout an hour or so later, I notice niece hadn't said anything for a while. I went over to the couch to see what was up, and she's just staring at the ceiling with one of her books on her stomach. I ask her if she's okay, and I immediately knew something was up. She said \"I ate some of your candy and it made me feel funny.\"\n\nShe had, in fact, eaten several of the sour gummies I had on my dresser. That I hadn't thought to lock up or anything like that because I'm a 35 year old woman who doesn't need to think about those things. Like ever.\n\nI panicked, she seemed fine, I called poison control and called her mom and panicked a lot more. I felt awful. It hadn't even occurred to me that this is a thing that would happen. Honestly, I did not foresee this happening. At all. Niece is completely fine, she ended up falling asleep after asking me for a grilled cheese sandwich with cut up hot dogs in it and asking if we could watch a movie. I stayed with her, kept her hydrated, etc, and apologized at least six million times to my sister, who was horrified and actually screamed at me. Once again, my niece is *fine.*\n\nEven my parents are in on it, blaming me and telling me I should have those things in a safe where no one could get to them, how could I possibly thing it was okay to have them around a child, no one should ever let their kids around me because next time I might give them a beer, etc etc. And I've been uninvited from anywhere that my niece will be, because they think somehow I planned for this to happen.\n\nI feel awful, like I've said a million times, but I really don't think I'm an asshole for this happening. I didn't do this on purpose. I have never needed to lock up my edibles before for the same reason I would never lock up a bottle of wine. When my sister called me in a panic, it wasn't like I thought \"Oh my god, I need to immediately childproof my home!\"\n\nBut am I the asshole here? Do I really deserve what's happening now?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves her niece accidentally consuming edibles left on the dresser, leading to her getting high. The author is from Colorado where cannabis is legal.\n\nFirst, the key points: The author is an adult who uses edibles for relaxation. She didn't lock them up, assuming that since she's an adult, there's no need for child-proofing. Her niece came over unexpectedly when her sister's husband had an emergency. The niece found and ate the sour gummies, which were actually edibles. The author didn't intend for this to happen, didn't know it was happening until later, and then called poison control. The niece ended up okay but the author is facing backlash from family.\n\nLegally, in Colorado, cannabis products are legal for adults, but there are regulations about keeping them out of reach of children. The author didn't lock up her edibles, which might be a legal issue. The product packaging might require child-proof containers, so maybe she violated that. Also, even though she's an adult, having a child in her home and not securing the edibles could be seen as negligence, especially since she knew the niece was coming over. \n\nMoral perspective: The author's defense is that she didn't think a 9-year-old would be in a position to access her stuff. However, having a child in the house, even temporarily, should prompt the consideration of securing any substances that could harm them. The author's lack of foresight led to the incident, which is why her family is upset. Even if it wasn't intentional, negligence can still make her responsible.\n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong. The answer hinges on negligence versus intent. Since she didn't do it on purpose but failed to secure the edibles, it's a matter of oversight. In Colorado, there are laws requiring secure storage, so legally, she might be at fault. Morally, she's responsible for the safety of the child in her care, so even if unintended, not securing the edibles could be considered her responsibility. Therefore, the answer is A (Yes, she's in the wrong).\n"
