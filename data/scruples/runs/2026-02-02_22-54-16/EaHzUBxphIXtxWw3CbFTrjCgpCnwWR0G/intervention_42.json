I am a 35 year old woman. For many women, unwinding means a bottle of wine. For me, I prefer to pop an edible or two and relax in front of a paint canvas, my sewing machine, etc.\n\nMy sister's husband had an emergency that resulted in her needing to quickly find a sitter for her 9 year old. I like my niece and obviously wanted to help out my sister, but warned her that she'd probably be bored at my place, since we don't have a lot of kid-friendly stuff.  At one point after she dropped her off with some books, I got up to take a shower. I'm pretty sure this is when it happened.\n\nAbout an hour or so later, I notice niece hadn't said anything for a while. I went over to the couch to see what was up, and she's just staring at the ceiling with one of her books on her stomach. I ask her if she's okay, and I immediately knew something was up. She said \"I ate some of your candy and it made me feel funny.\"\n\nShe had, in fact, eaten several of the sour gummies I had on my dresser. That I hadn't thought to lock up or anything like that because I'm a 35 year old woman who doesn't need to think about those things. Like ever.\n\nI panicked, she seemed fine, I called poison control and called her mom and panicked a lot more. I felt awful. It hadn't even occurred to me that this is a thing that would happen. Honestly, I did not foresee this happening. At all. Niece is completely fine, she ended up falling asleep after asking me for a grilled cheese sandwich with cut up hot dogs in it and asking if we could watch a movie. I stayed with her, kept her hydrated, etc, and apologized at least six million times to my sister, who was horrified and actually screamed at me. Once again, my niece is *fine.*\n\nEven my parents are in on it, blaming me and telling me I should have those things in a safe where no one could get to them, how could I possibly thing it was okay to have them around a child, no one should ever let their kids around me because next time I might give them a beer, etc etc. And I've been uninvited from anywhere that my niece will be, because they think somehow I planned for this to happen.\n\nI feel awful, like I've said a million times, but I really don't think I'm an asshole for this happening. I didn't do this on purpose. I have never needed to lock up my edibles before for the same reason I would never lock up a bottle of wine. When my sister called me in a panic, it wasn't like I thought \"Oh my god, I need to immediately childproof my home!\"\n\nBut am I the asshole here? Do I really deserve what's happening now?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves the author's niece accidentally consuming edibles that weren't locked up. The author lives in Colorado where cannabis is legal, and she didn't think to secure the edibles because she's an adult who doesn't usually have kids around. The niece ended up high, and now the author is facing backlash from her family.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. In Colorado, cannabis is legal, but there are regulations about keeping it away from children. The author didn't lock up the edibles, which are in a form that looks like candy. That's a red flag because edibles, especially those resembling candy, can be tempting to children. Even though the author didn't intend for the child to get access, the fact that she left them in a place where a child could reach them might be a problem legally. Colorado's laws likely require secure storage to prevent access by minors.\n\nNext, the responsibility aspect. The author was watching her niece, even if temporarily. The niece is nine years old, so she's old enough to maybe find things but not to be trusted with such substances. The author's defense is that she didn't have to lock up edibles like she would wine. But wine is in a bottle that's not mistaken for food, whereas edibles, especially gummies, are more like candy. The author's oversight here might show negligence, even if unintentional.\n\nThen, the family's reaction. The sister was in an emergency and left the child with the author. The author's responsibility increased because she was the temporary caregiver. Even if she didn't have a kid-friendly environment, she should have ensured that anything dangerous was out of reach. The fact that the niece found the edibles suggests that they were not stored safely. The author's parents and sister are upset because they feel she didn't take proper precautions, which is understandable given the potential harm.\n\nThe author's argument is that she didn't foresee this. But foreseeability might be a key point here. As someone who uses edibles, she should know that they need to be stored securely, especially in a household that might have children over. It's not just about her own habits but about the safety of others. The author's lack of preparation for having a child in her home, despite being aware that the sister might need to leave the kid with her, might show a lack of responsibility.\n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, even if the author didn't intend harm, she created a situation where harm could occur. The comparison to wine isn't valid because wine isn't disguised as candy and isn't as potent as edibles. The author's oversight led to the niece getting high, which could have been prevented with proper storage. The family's anger stems from the fact that she didn't take basic precautions, leading to a dangerous situation.\n\nSo, putting it all together: Legally, in Colorado, there might be laws against leaving cannabis accessible to minors. The author's failure to secure the edibles could be a legal issue. Morally, she had a duty of care to the niece while watching her, and failing to secure the edibles breached that duty. Even if unintentional, negligence can still make her responsible. Therefore, the answer would be that she is in the wrong.\n"
