I am a 35 year old woman. For many women, unwinding means a bottle of wine. For me, I prefer to pop an edible or two and relax in front of a paint canvas, my sewing machine, etc.\n\nMy sister's husband had an emergency that resulted in her needing to quickly find a sitter for her 9 year old. I like my niece and obviously wanted to help out my sister, but warned her that she'd probably be bored at my place, since we don't have a lot of kid-friendly stuff.  At one point after she dropped her off with some books, I got up to take a shower. I'm pretty sure this is when it happened.\n\nAbout an hour or so later, I notice niece hadn't said anything for a while. I went over to the couch to see what was up, and she's just staring at the ceiling with one of her books on her stomach. I ask her if she's okay, and I immediately knew something was up. She said \"I ate some of your candy and it made me feel funny.\"\n\nShe had, in fact, eaten several of the sour gummies I had on my dresser. That I hadn't thought to lock up or anything like that because I'm a 35 year old woman who doesn't need to think about those things. Like ever.\n\nI panicked, she seemed fine, I called poison control and called her mom and panicked a lot more. I felt awful. It hadn't even occurred to me that this is a thing that would happen. Honestly, I did not foresee this happening. At all. Niece is completely fine, she ended up falling asleep after asking me for a grilled cheese sandwich with cut up hot dogs in it and asking if we could watch a movie. I stayed with her, kept her hydrated, etc, and apologized at least six million times to my sister, who was horrified and actually screamed at me. Once again, my niece is *fine.*\n\nEven my parents are in on it, blaming me and telling me I should have those things in a safe where no one could get to them, how could I possibly thing it was okay to have them around a child, no one should ever let their kids around me because next time I might give them a beer, etc etc. And I've been uninvited from anywhere that my niece will be, because they think somehow I planned for this to happen.\n\nI feel awful, like I've said a million times, but I really don't think I'm an asshole for this happening. I didn't do this on purpose. I have never needed to lock up my edibles before for the same reason I would never lock up a bottle of wine. When my sister called me in a panic, it wasn't like I thought \"Oh my god, I need to immediately childproof my home!\"\n\nBut am I the asshole here? Do I really deserve what's happening now?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, she left edibles on her dresser in Colorado, which has legal cannabis. She had her 9-year-old niece over because her sister needed a sitter. The niece ate the sour gummies, which were actually THC edibles. The author didn't lock them up, thinking she's a responsible adult and didn't consider the risk. \n\nFirst, I need to consider Colorado's laws regarding cannabis and children. In states where cannabis is legal, there are usually strict rules about storing it safely, especially around kids. For example, Colorado probably requires cannabis products to be kept in child-resistant packaging or locked up if there's a possibility of children being present. The author might have violated those laws by leaving the edibles accessible.\n\nNext, the context of the situation. The niece was a 9-year-old in a home that isn't necessarily childproofed. The author mentioned that she didn't have many kid-friendly activities, but she didn't consider the risk of edibles being within reach. The key point here is whether she should have known that a child might get to them. Even if she didn't expect it, she should have taken precautions. \n\nAlso, the reactions from her sister and parents indicate that they think she's responsible. The sister was horrified and screamed at her, and the family is now avoiding her. The author's justification is that she never locked up edibles before because she thought of them like wine, but kids can't access alcohol easily either. The fact that she panicked and took care of the niece after the fact might show she cares, but it doesn't negate the initial negligence.\n\nAnother angle is the legal aspect. If Colorado has specific child safety laws for cannabis, the author could be liable. Even if there's no legal consequence, socially and morally, she might be at fault for not securing the edibles. The argument that she's a responsible adult doesn't hold because children can access things without adult supervision, and the consequences were serious.\n\nSo, putting it all together: even though the author didn't intend for this to happen, she should have been more cautious. The edibles should have been locked up or stored safely. The answer is likely A (she's in the wrong) because she didn't take necessary precautions, leading to the niece getting high.\n"
