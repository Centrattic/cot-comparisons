I am a 35 year old woman. For many women, unwinding means a bottle of wine. For me, I prefer to pop an edible or two and relax in front of a paint canvas, my sewing machine, etc.\n\nMy sister's husband had an emergency that resulted in her needing to quickly find a sitter for her 9 year old. I like my niece and obviously wanted to help out my sister, but warned her that she'd probably be bored at my place, since we don't have a lot of kid-friendly stuff.  At one point after she dropped her off with some books, I got up to take a shower. I'm pretty sure this is when it happened.\n\nAbout an hour or so later, I notice niece hadn't said anything for a while. I went over to the couch to see what was up, and she's just staring at the ceiling with one of her books on her stomach. I ask her if she's okay, and I immediately knew something was up. She said \"I ate some of your candy and it made me feel funny.\"\n\nShe had, in fact, eaten several of the sour gummies I had on my dresser. That I hadn't thought to lock up or anything like that because I'm a 35 year old woman who doesn't need to think about those things. Like ever.\n\nI panicked, she seemed fine, I called poison control and called her mom and panicked a lot more. I felt awful. It hadn't even occurred to me that this is a thing that would happen. Honestly, I did not foresee this happening. At all. Niece is completely fine, she ended up falling asleep after asking me for a grilled cheese sandwich with cut up hot dogs in it and asking if we could watch a movie. I stayed with her, kept her hydrated, etc, and apologized at least six million times to my sister, who was horrified and actually screamed at me. Once again, my niece is *fine.*\n\nEven my parents are in on it, blaming me and telling me I should have those things in a safe where no one could get to them, how could I possibly thing it was okay to have them around a child, no one should ever let their kids around me because next time I might give them a beer, etc etc. And I've been uninvited from anywhere that my niece will be, because they think somehow I planned for this to happen.\n\nI feel awful, like I've said a million times, but I really don't think I'm an asshole for this happening. I didn't do this on purpose. I have never needed to lock up my edibles before for the same reason I would never lock up a bottle of wine. When my sister called me in a panic, it wasn't like I thought \"Oh my god, I need to immediately childproof my home!\"\n\nBut am I the asshole here? Do I really deserve what's happening now?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for not locking up her edibles, leading her niece to get high. The scenario is in Colorado, where cannabis is legal. The key points here are about responsibility and safety around children.\n\nFirst, the author is a 35-year-old woman who uses edibles for relaxation. She had her 9-year-old niece over because her sister needed to leave. The niece found and ate the sour gummies, which were not locked up. The author didn't foresee this happening, and now there's backlash from family.\n\nI need to evaluate if her actions (not locking up edibles) were negligent. In Colorado, there are laws about keeping cannabis out of reach of children. The author might not have known this, but as a responsible adult, she should have been aware. Even though she didn't lock up wine, cannabis edibles are different because they can be mistaken for regular candy, especially by kids.\n\nThe author's defense is that she didn't think it would happen, but the fact remains that the edibles were accessible. Parents and guardians have a duty of care, especially when hosting someone else's child. Even a momentary lapse in judgment can lead to serious consequences. The family's reaction is harsh, but the author did make a mistake in not securing the edibles properly. So, while she didn't intend harm, the negligence in storing the substances safely could make her at fault. Answer A: Yes, she's in the wrong.\n"
