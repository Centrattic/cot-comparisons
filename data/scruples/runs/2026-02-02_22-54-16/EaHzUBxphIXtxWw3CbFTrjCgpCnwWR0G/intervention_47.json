I am a 35 year old woman. For many women, unwinding means a bottle of wine. For me, I prefer to pop an edible or two and relax in front of a paint canvas, my sewing machine, etc.\n\nMy sister's husband had an emergency that resulted in her needing to quickly find a sitter for her 9 year old. I like my niece and obviously wanted to help out my sister, but warned her that she'd probably be bored at my place, since we don't have a lot of kid-friendly stuff.  At one point after she dropped her off with some books, I got up to take a shower. I'm pretty sure this is when it happened.\n\nAbout an hour or so later, I notice niece hadn't said anything for a while. I went over to the couch to see what was up, and she's just staring at the ceiling with one of her books on her stomach. I ask her if she's okay, and I immediately knew something was up. She said \"I ate some of your candy and it made me feel funny.\"\n\nShe had, in fact, eaten several of the sour gummies I had on my dresser. That I hadn't thought to lock up or anything like that because I'm a 35 year old woman who doesn't need to think about those things. Like ever.\n\nI panicked, she seemed fine, I called poison control and called her mom and panicked a lot more. I felt awful. It hadn't even occurred to me that this is a thing that would happen. Honestly, I did not foresee this happening. At all. Niece is completely fine, she ended up falling asleep after asking me for a grilled cheese sandwich with cut up hot dogs in it and asking if we could watch a movie. I stayed with her, kept her hydrated, etc, and apologized at least six million times to my sister, who was horrified and actually screamed at me. Once again, my niece is *fine.*\n\nEven my parents are in on it, blaming me and telling me I should have those things in a safe where no one could get to them, how could I possibly thing it was okay to have them around a child, no one should ever let their kids around me because next time I might give them a beer, etc etc. And I've been uninvited from anywhere that my niece will be, because they think somehow I planned for this to happen.\n\nI feel awful, like I've said a million times, but I really don't think I'm an asshole for this happening. I didn't do this on purpose. I have never needed to lock up my edibles before for the same reason I would never lock up a bottle of wine. When my sister called me in a panic, it wasn't like I thought \"Oh my god, I need to immediately childproof my home!\"\n\nBut am I the asshole here? Do I really deserve what's happening now?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for not locking up their edibles, leading to their 9-year-old niece getting high. The context is Colorado where cannabis is legal.\n\nFirst, the author is a 35-year-old woman who uses edibles for relaxation. She didn't plan to childproof her home when her niece came over because she didn't think about it. The niece ate several sour gummies from the dresser. The author panicked, called poison control, and the child ended up fine. The sister and parents are upset, blaming her, and she's been uninvited from events with the niece. The author is defensive, comparing edibles to wine, which she wouldn't lock up. \n\nNow, the key points here. In Colorado, even though cannabis is legal, there are laws about keeping it out of reach of children. The author's niece is a minor, so the responsibility is higher. The fact that the author is a 35-year-old who didn't lock up the edibles might be a problem. Even if it wasn't intentional, the lack of precaution could be seen as negligence. \n\nThe sister had to leave suddenly, maybe the author should have considered the temporary situation. The niece ate from the dresser, which is a place a child might access. The author's reasoning that she would never lock up wine is a bit weak because edibles can be more dangerous in the wrong hands, especially for kids. \n\nEven though the child is fine, the potential risk is significant. Colorado's laws likely require secure storage, so the author might have violated that. The family's reaction is understandable due to the possible danger. The author's not foreseeing the situation isn't a strong defense. \n\nSo, in terms of responsibility, the author didn't take standard safety measures. Even if it wasn't intentional, the act of not securing the edibles where a child could reach them is a mistake. The answer might be A (in the wrong) because they didn't childproof their home, which is expected when hosting a child. The B side would argue it was an accident, but legal and safety standards might tip it towards A.\n"
