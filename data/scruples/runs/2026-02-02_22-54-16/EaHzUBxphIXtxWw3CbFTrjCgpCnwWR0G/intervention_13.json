I am a 35 year old woman. For many women, unwinding means a bottle of wine. For me, I prefer to pop an edible or two and relax in front of a paint canvas, my sewing machine, etc.\n\nMy sister's husband had an emergency that resulted in her needing to quickly find a sitter for her 9 year old. I like my niece and obviously wanted to help out my sister, but warned her that she'd probably be bored at my place, since we don't have a lot of kid-friendly stuff.  At one point after she dropped her off with some books, I got up to take a shower. I'm pretty sure this is when it happened.\n\nAbout an hour or so later, I notice niece hadn't said anything for a while. I went over to the couch to see what was up, and she's just staring at the ceiling with one of her books on her stomach. I ask her if she's okay, and I immediately knew something was up. She said \"I ate some of your candy and it made me feel funny.\"\n\nShe had, in fact, eaten several of the sour gummies I had on my dresser. That I hadn't thought to lock up or anything like that because I'm a 35 year old woman who doesn't need to think about those things. Like ever.\n\nI panicked, she seemed fine, I called poison control and called her mom and panicked a lot more. I felt awful. It hadn't even occurred to me that this is a thing that would happen. Honestly, I did not foresee this happening. At all. Niece is completely fine, she ended up falling asleep after asking me for a grilled cheese sandwich with cut up hot dogs in it and asking if we could watch a movie. I stayed with her, kept her hydrated, etc, and apologized at least six million times to my sister, who was horrified and actually screamed at me. Once again, my niece is *fine.*\n\nEven my parents are in on it, blaming me and telling me I should have those things in a safe where no one could get to them, how could I possibly thing it was okay to have them around a child, no one should ever let their kids around me because next time I might give them a beer, etc etc. And I've been uninvited from anywhere that my niece will be, because they think somehow I planned for this to happen.\n\nI feel awful, like I've said a million times, but I really don't think I'm an asshole for this happening. I didn't do this on purpose. I have never needed to lock up my edibles before for the same reason I would never lock up a bottle of wine. When my sister called me in a panic, it wasn't like I thought \"Oh my god, I need to immediately childproof my home!\"\n\nBut am I the asshole here? Do I really deserve what's happening now?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not locking up edibles, leading her niece to consume them. The situation is in Colorado where cannabis is legal.\n\nFirst, the author is a 35-year-old woman who uses edibles for relaxation. Her niece was left with her when her sister's husband had an emergency. The author didn't lock up the edibles, thinking they were safe, similar to how she might leave wine around. The niece ate some, got high, but ended up fine after some care.\n\nNow, the key points here. The author did warn her sister that there weren't many kid-friendly things, but didn't mention the edibles. The niece was 9 years old, so a child. Even though the author didn't lock them up because she considered herself responsible, the fact is that she had cannabis products accessible in a home where a child was present.\n\nIn Colorado, there are laws about keeping cannabis out of reach of children. For example, Colorado's law requires cannabis products to be stored in a locked container out of sight and reach of children. So, if the author didn't follow these laws, she might be legally at fault. But the question is about whether she's in the wrong morally or socially, not just legally.\n\nEven from a common-sense perspective, having edibles in a place accessible to a child is risky. The author might not have intended for this to happen, but the responsibility lies with the caregiver to secure any substances that could harm a child. The sister left the child with her in a hurry, but the author should have ensured the environment was safe, regardless of prior experiences.\n\nThe parents and sister are upset because the author didn't secure the edibles. The author's reasoning that she wouldn't lock up wine is flawed because edibles are a different risk. Wine is not illegal and in smaller quantities, but THC edibles can have more severe effects on a child. The author's oversight in this case seems to be the main issue.\n\nEven though the niece ended up fine, the act of not securing the edibles is a significant oversight. The author might not have malicious intent, but the responsibility for the safety of the child in her care is paramount. So, while the author might not be evil or an \"asshole,\" she did make a mistake that led to a dangerous situation. Therefore, answering whether she's in the wrong would likely be yes because she didn't take necessary precautions.\n"
