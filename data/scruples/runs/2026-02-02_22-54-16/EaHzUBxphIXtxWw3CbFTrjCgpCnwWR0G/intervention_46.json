I am a 35 year old woman. For many women, unwinding means a bottle of wine. For me, I prefer to pop an edible or two and relax in front of a paint canvas, my sewing machine, etc.\n\nMy sister's husband had an emergency that resulted in her needing to quickly find a sitter for her 9 year old. I like my niece and obviously wanted to help out my sister, but warned her that she'd probably be bored at my place, since we don't have a lot of kid-friendly stuff.  At one point after she dropped her off with some books, I got up to take a shower. I'm pretty sure this is when it happened.\n\nAbout an hour or so later, I notice niece hadn't said anything for a while. I went over to the couch to see what was up, and she's just staring at the ceiling with one of her books on her stomach. I ask her if she's okay, and I immediately knew something was up. She said \"I ate some of your candy and it made me feel funny.\"\n\nShe had, in fact, eaten several of the sour gummies I had on my dresser. That I hadn't thought to lock up or anything like that because I'm a 35 year old woman who doesn't need to think about those things. Like ever.\n\nI panicked, she seemed fine, I called poison control and called her mom and panicked a lot more. I felt awful. It hadn't even occurred to me that this is a thing that would happen. Honestly, I did not foresee this happening. At all. Niece is completely fine, she ended up falling asleep after asking me for a grilled cheese sandwich with cut up hot dogs in it and asking if we could watch a movie. I stayed with her, kept her hydrated, etc, and apologized at least six million times to my sister, who was horrified and actually screamed at me. Once again, my niece is *fine.*\n\nEven my parents are in on it, blaming me and telling me I should have those things in a safe where no one could get to them, how could I possibly thing it was okay to have them around a child, no one should ever let their kids around me because next time I might give them a beer, etc etc. And I've been uninvited from anywhere that my niece will be, because they think somehow I planned for this to happen.\n\nI feel awful, like I've said a million times, but I really don't think I'm an asshole for this happening. I didn't do this on purpose. I have never needed to lock up my edibles before for the same reason I would never lock up a bottle of wine. When my sister called me in a panic, it wasn't like I thought \"Oh my god, I need to immediately childproof my home!\"\n\nBut am I the asshole here? Do I really deserve what's happening now?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's start by breaking down the situation. The author is in Colorado where cannabis is legal. She has edibles, specifically sour gummies, on her dresser. She didn't lock them up because she assumes they're safe since she's a 35-year-old woman and not worried about kids. Her niece, who's 9, was left with her when her sister had an emergency.\n\nThe key points here are about responsibility and child safety. Even though the author didn't have a child in the house before, when she agreed to babysit, she should have considered that a child might access her edibles. The fact that she panicked a bit and the rest of the family is blaming her suggests they feel she was negligent. \n\nNow, legal perspective: In Colorado, edibles are legal for adults, but regulations might require safe storage, especially when children are present. The author might not have known this, but the responsibility of ensuring safety when a child is in your care is important. Even if she didn't lock them up for herself, once a child is around, the assumption is that you should take precautions to prevent access to items that could harm them.\n\nEthically, as a caregiver, the author should have childproofed her space, even if it wasn't necessary before. Edibles can look like regular candy to a child, and it's a common mistake. The fact that she didn't foresee this doesn't absolve her of responsibility. The parents were relying on her to keep their child safe, and she failed in that aspect, even if unintentionally.\n\nThe author's argument is that she didn't plan for this, similar to not needing to lock up wine. But alcohol and cannabis edibles are different in terms of potential harm and legal regulations. While a child drinking wine might be a problem, the issue here is specifically about a controlled substance that's illegal for minors, even in a legal state. So the expectation might be higher to secure it properly.\n\nAlso, the after-effects: the niece was fine, but the family's reaction is harsh. They uninvited her and her parents are upset. The parents might be right in feeling that the author didn't prioritize their child's safety, leading to a dangerous situation. The author's own admission that she didn't think about the possibility shows a lack of foresight, which is a valid criticism.\n\nSo, in conclusion, even though the author didn't intend to harm the niece, the responsibility lies with her to secure the edibles once a child is in her care. The parents and family are within their rights to be upset and take precautions, as safety is paramount. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
