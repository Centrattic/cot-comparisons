I am a 35 year old woman. For many women, unwinding means a bottle of wine. For me, I prefer to pop an edible or two and relax in front of a paint canvas, my sewing machine, etc.\n\nMy sister's husband had an emergency that resulted in her needing to quickly find a sitter for her 9 year old. I like my niece and obviously wanted to help out my sister, but warned her that she'd probably be bored at my place, since we don't have a lot of kid-friendly stuff.  At one point after she dropped her off with some books, I got up to take a shower. I'm pretty sure this is when it happened.\n\nAbout an hour or so later, I notice niece hadn't said anything for a while. I went over to the couch to see what was up, and she's just staring at the ceiling with one of her books on her stomach. I ask her if she's okay, and I immediately knew something was up. She said \"I ate some of your candy and it made me feel funny.\"\n\nShe had, in fact, eaten several of the sour gummies I had on my dresser. That I hadn't thought to lock up or anything like that because I'm a 35 year old woman who doesn't need to think about those things. Like ever.\n\nI panicked, she seemed fine, I called poison control and called her mom and panicked a lot more. I felt awful. It hadn't even occurred to me that this is a thing that would happen. Honestly, I did not foresee this happening. At all. Niece is completely fine, she ended up falling asleep after asking me for a grilled cheese sandwich with cut up hot dogs in it and asking if we could watch a movie. I stayed with her, kept her hydrated, etc, and apologized at least six million times to my sister, who was horrified and actually screamed at me. Once again, my niece is *fine.*\n\nEven my parents are in on it, blaming me and telling me I should have those things in a safe where no one could get to them, how could I possibly thing it was okay to have them around a child, no one should ever let their kids around me because next time I might give them a beer, etc etc. And I've been uninvited from anywhere that my niece will be, because they think somehow I planned for this to happen.\n\nI feel awful, like I've said a million times, but I really don't think I'm an asshole for this happening. I didn't do this on purpose. I have never needed to lock up my edibles before for the same reason I would never lock up a bottle of wine. When my sister called me in a panic, it wasn't like I thought \"Oh my god, I need to immediately childproof my home!\"\n\nBut am I the asshole here? Do I really deserve what's happening now?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not locking up edibles, leading to her niece getting high. I need to figure out the answer based on the given scenario.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author has edibles in her home in Colorado, which is a legal state. She's a 35-year-old woman who uses edibles to relax. Her sister had an emergency and left her 9-year-old niece with her. The niece found and ate the edibles, got high, and the author panicked. Now, the sister and others are blaming her, saying she should have locked up the edibles.\n\nSo, the key points here are about responsibility and safety. Even though the author didn't intend for the niece to get high, she was aware that her niece would be in the house. The edibles weren't locked up, which is a risk when there's a child present, even if it's just for a short visit.\n\nIn Colorado, even with legalization, there are laws about keeping cannabis products out of reach of children. The author might be violating that by not properly storing the edibles. Additionally, the fact that she mentioned having things like a bottle of wine instead of edibles shows she knew the difference in perception, but maybe not the actual legal or safety requirements.\n\nThe author argues that she didn't think to lock them up because she's an adult, but when a child is present, the responsibility shifts. She should have taken precautions, even if she thought the child would be safe. The niece was 9, old enough to find things in a dresser, especially if left unsupervised for a moment, like when the author was in the shower.\n\nThe sister's reaction and the blame from family make sense because the incident could have been prevented. The author's oversight led to a dangerous situation, even if unintentional. The fact that the niece is okay doesn't negate the fact that the author didn't take necessary precautions.\n\nSo, considering the safety of a child in someone's home, even temporarily, the author should have locked up the edibles. The argument that she didn't plan for the child to be there isn't a strong defense because she knew the child was coming. Therefore, the author is at least partially at fault here for not securing the edibles appropriately.\n"
