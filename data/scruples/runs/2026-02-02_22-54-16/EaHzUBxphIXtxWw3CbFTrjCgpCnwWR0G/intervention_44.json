I am a 35 year old woman. For many women, unwinding means a bottle of wine. For me, I prefer to pop an edible or two and relax in front of a paint canvas, my sewing machine, etc.\n\nMy sister's husband had an emergency that resulted in her needing to quickly find a sitter for her 9 year old. I like my niece and obviously wanted to help out my sister, but warned her that she'd probably be bored at my place, since we don't have a lot of kid-friendly stuff.  At one point after she dropped her off with some books, I got up to take a shower. I'm pretty sure this is when it happened.\n\nAbout an hour or so later, I notice niece hadn't said anything for a while. I went over to the couch to see what was up, and she's just staring at the ceiling with one of her books on her stomach. I ask her if she's okay, and I immediately knew something was up. She said \"I ate some of your candy and it made me feel funny.\"\n\nShe had, in fact, eaten several of the sour gummies I had on my dresser. That I hadn't thought to lock up or anything like that because I'm a 35 year old woman who doesn't need to think about those things. Like ever.\n\nI panicked, she seemed fine, I called poison control and called her mom and panicked a lot more. I felt awful. It hadn't even occurred to me that this is a thing that would happen. Honestly, I did not foresee this happening. At all. Niece is completely fine, she ended up falling asleep after asking me for a grilled cheese sandwich with cut up hot dogs in it and asking if we could watch a movie. I stayed with her, kept her hydrated, etc, and apologized at least six million times to my sister, who was horrified and actually screamed at me. Once again, my niece is *fine.*\n\nEven my parents are in on it, blaming me and telling me I should have those things in a safe where no one could get to them, how could I possibly thing it was okay to have them around a child, no one should ever let their kids around me because next time I might give them a beer, etc etc. And I've been uninvited from anywhere that my niece will be, because they think somehow I planned for this to happen.\n\nI feel awful, like I've said a million times, but I really don't think I'm an asshole for this happening. I didn't do this on purpose. I have never needed to lock up my edibles before for the same reason I would never lock up a bottle of wine. When my sister called me in a panic, it wasn't like I thought \"Oh my god, I need to immediately childproof my home!\"\n\nBut am I the asshole here? Do I really deserve what's happening now?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author's niece accidentally consuming edibles that were left out, leading to her getting high. The author didn't lock them up, assuming they were safe like wine.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal context. Colorado has legal recreational marijuana, but there are strict regulations, especially regarding child safety. Colorado law requires that cannabis products be stored in child-resistant packaging and out of reach of children. The author left the edibles on a dresser, which might not meet those legal standards. Even though she's 35 and doesn't need to lock up wine, edibles are different because they look like regular candy. Kids might mistake them, especially if they're in a household they're familiar with.\n\nNext, the author's responsibility as a caregiver. She was hosting her niece, even if it was a temporary situation. The fact that she didn't consider the risk shows a lack of foresight. Even if it wasn't intentional, not securing the edibles could be seen as negligence. Parents and guardians have a duty to ensure their homes are safe for children, regardless of the substance's legality.\n\nThe emotional impact on the family is significant. The sister, parents, and others are upset, and the author's actions caused fear and panic. The niece was fine, but the incident could have been much worse. The author's own admission that she didn't think it would happen might come off as dismissive, even if unintentional.\n\nHowever, the author did act responsibly after the incident\u2014calling poison control, staying with the niece, apologizing. She didn't intend harm and is feeling guilty. But legal and safety standards are about preventing foreseeable risks. The fact that the edibles were in a place accessible to a child, despite knowing that kids might be present (even if not expected), is a key point.\n\nIn Colorado, there's a \"Good Samaritan\" law that might protect someone who accidentally harms a child in a similar way, but it's more about medical assistance during overdose. Still, the incident could potentially lead to legal consequences if the authorities deemed the storage negligent. Even if no charges were filed, the author's actions violated safety protocols meant to prevent such accidents.\n\nSo, while the author didn't act with malice, her failure to secure the edibles in a child-safe manner could be considered negligent. The answer would likely be A (the author is in the wrong) from a legal and safety standpoint, even if her intentions were good.\n"
