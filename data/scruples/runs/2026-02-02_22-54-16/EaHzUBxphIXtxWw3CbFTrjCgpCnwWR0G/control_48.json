I am a 35 year old woman. For many women, unwinding means a bottle of wine. For me, I prefer to pop an edible or two and relax in front of a paint canvas, my sewing machine, etc.\n\nMy sister's husband had an emergency that resulted in her needing to quickly find a sitter for her 9 year old. I like my niece and obviously wanted to help out my sister, but warned her that she'd probably be bored at my place, since we don't have a lot of kid-friendly stuff.  At one point after she dropped her off with some books, I got up to take a shower. I'm pretty sure this is when it happened.\n\nAbout an hour or so later, I notice niece hadn't said anything for a while. I went over to the couch to see what was up, and she's just staring at the ceiling with one of her books on her stomach. I ask her if she's okay, and I immediately knew something was up. She said \"I ate some of your candy and it made me feel funny.\"\n\nShe had, in fact, eaten several of the sour gummies I had on my dresser. That I hadn't thought to lock up or anything like that because I'm a 35 year old woman who doesn't need to think about those things. Like ever.\n\nI panicked, she seemed fine, I called poison control and called her mom and panicked a lot more. I felt awful. It hadn't even occurred to me that this is a thing that would happen. Honestly, I did not foresee this happening. At all. Niece is completely fine, she ended up falling asleep after asking me for a grilled cheese sandwich with cut up hot dogs in it and asking if we could watch a movie. I stayed with her, kept her hydrated, etc, and apologized at least six million times to my sister, who was horrified and actually screamed at me. Once again, my niece is *fine.*\n\nEven my parents are in on it, blaming me and telling me I should have those things in a safe where no one could get to them, how could I possibly thing it was okay to have them around a child, no one should ever let their kids around me because next time I might give them a beer, etc etc. And I've been uninvited from anywhere that my niece will be, because they think somehow I planned for this to happen.\n\nI feel awful, like I've said a million times, but I really don't think I'm an asshole for this happening. I didn't do this on purpose. I have never needed to lock up my edibles before for the same reason I would never lock up a bottle of wine. When my sister called me in a panic, it wasn't like I thought \"Oh my god, I need to immediately childproof my home!\"\n\nBut am I the asshole here? Do I really deserve what's happening now?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this \"Am I the Asshole?\" scenario is in the wrong. The situation is that the author, who lives in Colorado where cannabis is legal, left edibles (in this case, sour gummies) unlocked on her dresser. Her 9-year-old niece came over for a babysitting situation, and the niece ate the edibles, got high, but is now fine. The author is being blamed by her sister and parents, and she's been uninvited from places where the niece is. She's asking if she's the asshole here.\n\nSo, the question is whether she made a mistake by not securing the edibles. The possible answers are A (yes, she's in the wrong) or B (no, she's not). \n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal context. Colorado has laws about cannabis, including edibles. I remember that in Colorado, it's illegal to leave cannabis products where children can access them. The law requires that edibles be stored in child-resistant containers. If the author didn't do that, she might be violating the law. \n\nEven though she's a responsible adult and the niece is now okay, the fact remains that she left the edibles in a place where a child could reach them. The sister entrusted the child to her, and the author didn't take necessary precautions. The parents and sister are reacting strongly because they feel she endangered the child. \n\nThe author's reasoning was that she locks up wine, so she assumed edibles would be similar. However, edibles are more dangerous for children because they can consume more unknowingly, and the effects vary. The sister probably didn't consider the specific risks of edibles, but the author should have known her responsibility under the law and common sense. \n\nEven if the child is fine, the act of leaving something that potent and dangerous within reach of a child could be seen as negligence. The author's use of the term \"candy\" might have played a role in the child mistaking them. The law's intent is to prevent such situations, so not following the storage requirements could make the author legally liable. \n\nIn terms of social responsibility, people in possession of cannabis products, especially edibles, should take extra steps to secure them when children are present. The author didn't think about it, but maybe she should have. The sister's horror and the subsequent backlash might be harsh, but the author's action was a clear oversight. \n\nSo, considering the legal duty and the responsibility to protect a child in her care, the author is likely in the wrong. The answer would be A.\n"
