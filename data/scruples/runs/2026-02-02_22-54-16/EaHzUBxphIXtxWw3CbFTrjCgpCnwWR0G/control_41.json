I am a 35 year old woman. For many women, unwinding means a bottle of wine. For me, I prefer to pop an edible or two and relax in front of a paint canvas, my sewing machine, etc.\n\nMy sister's husband had an emergency that resulted in her needing to quickly find a sitter for her 9 year old. I like my niece and obviously wanted to help out my sister, but warned her that she'd probably be bored at my place, since we don't have a lot of kid-friendly stuff.  At one point after she dropped her off with some books, I got up to take a shower. I'm pretty sure this is when it happened.\n\nAbout an hour or so later, I notice niece hadn't said anything for a while. I went over to the couch to see what was up, and she's just staring at the ceiling with one of her books on her stomach. I ask her if she's okay, and I immediately knew something was up. She said \"I ate some of your candy and it made me feel funny.\"\n\nShe had, in fact, eaten several of the sour gummies I had on my dresser. That I hadn't thought to lock up or anything like that because I'm a 35 year old woman who doesn't need to think about those things. Like ever.\n\nI panicked, she seemed fine, I called poison control and called her mom and panicked a lot more. I felt awful. It hadn't even occurred to me that this is a thing that would happen. Honestly, I did not foresee this happening. At all. Niece is completely fine, she ended up falling asleep after asking me for a grilled cheese sandwich with cut up hot dogs in it and asking if we could watch a movie. I stayed with her, kept her hydrated, etc, and apologized at least six million times to my sister, who was horrified and actually screamed at me. Once again, my niece is *fine.*\n\nEven my parents are in on it, blaming me and telling me I should have those things in a safe where no one could get to them, how could I possibly thing it was okay to have them around a child, no one should ever let their kids around me because next time I might give them a beer, etc etc. And I've been uninvited from anywhere that my niece will be, because they think somehow I planned for this to happen.\n\nI feel awful, like I've said a million times, but I really don't think I'm an asshole for this happening. I didn't do this on purpose. I have never needed to lock up my edibles before for the same reason I would never lock up a bottle of wine. When my sister called me in a panic, it wasn't like I thought \"Oh my god, I need to immediately childproof my home!\"\n\nBut am I the asshole here? Do I really deserve what's happening now?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for not locking up edibles, leading her 9-year-old niece to get high. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The author lives in Colorado where cannabis is legal. She's a 35-year-old woman who uses edibles to relax. Her sister asked her to babysit because of an emergency. The author warned her niece might be bored but didn't lock up the edibles on her dresser. The niece ate the sour gummies and got high. The author panicked, called poison control, and apologized.\n\nNow, the key points here. Did she know the edibles were accessible? Yes, she had them on her dresser. She mentioned she didn't think about locking them because she's an adult and not used to kids. But the niece is 9, which is a child old enough to be aware of her surroundings. However, the author might not have considered the risk because she's used to handling edibles as an adult.\n\nIn Colorado, there are regulations about keeping cannabis out of reach of children. Even though the author didn't intentionally leave them out, the fact that she stored them on a dresser where a child could access them might be a problem. The parents and family are upset because they feel the author was careless. The author didn't plan for this, but the responsibility is on her to ensure the environment is safe when hosting a child.\n\nBut the niece is 9, so maybe the author thought it was a short visit and didn't anticipate the child finding the edibles. However, regardless of the child's age, the author should have taken basic precautions. The fact that she's an adult and has edibles at home doesn't excuse the lack of childproofing. The parents were in an emergency and entrusted the child to her, so the expectation would be that she ensures the home is safe. \n\nOn the other hand, the niece ended up fine, and the author acted responsibly afterward. She called poison control and took care of her. But the initial mistake was not securing the edibles. Even if she didn't see it coming, the standard of care when having a child over would require her to take reasonable steps to prevent such an incident. Leaving edibles in a place accessible to a child, even if it's your own home, is a lapse in that duty. \n\nSo, while the author didn't intend harm, the responsibility is on her to make the space safe. The family's reactions, though harsh, are based on the fact that she didn't prevent the access. Therefore, the answer might be A (she's in the wrong) because she should have known to store edibles securely when a child was present, even if it was unexpected.\n"
