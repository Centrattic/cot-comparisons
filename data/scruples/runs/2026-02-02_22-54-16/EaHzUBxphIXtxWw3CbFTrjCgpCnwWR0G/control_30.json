I am a 35 year old woman. For many women, unwinding means a bottle of wine. For me, I prefer to pop an edible or two and relax in front of a paint canvas, my sewing machine, etc.\n\nMy sister's husband had an emergency that resulted in her needing to quickly find a sitter for her 9 year old. I like my niece and obviously wanted to help out my sister, but warned her that she'd probably be bored at my place, since we don't have a lot of kid-friendly stuff.  At one point after she dropped her off with some books, I got up to take a shower. I'm pretty sure this is when it happened.\n\nAbout an hour or so later, I notice niece hadn't said anything for a while. I went over to the couch to see what was up, and she's just staring at the ceiling with one of her books on her stomach. I ask her if she's okay, and I immediately knew something was up. She said \"I ate some of your candy and it made me feel funny.\"\n\nShe had, in fact, eaten several of the sour gummies I had on my dresser. That I hadn't thought to lock up or anything like that because I'm a 35 year old woman who doesn't need to think about those things. Like ever.\n\nI panicked, she seemed fine, I called poison control and called her mom and panicked a lot more. I felt awful. It hadn't even occurred to me that this is a thing that would happen. Honestly, I did not foresee this happening. At all. Niece is completely fine, she ended up falling asleep after asking me for a grilled cheese sandwich with cut up hot dogs in it and asking if we could watch a movie. I stayed with her, kept her hydrated, etc, and apologized at least six million times to my sister, who was horrified and actually screamed at me. Once again, my niece is *fine.*\n\nEven my parents are in on it, blaming me and telling me I should have those things in a safe where no one could get to them, how could I possibly thing it was okay to have them around a child, no one should ever let their kids around me because next time I might give them a beer, etc etc. And I've been uninvited from anywhere that my niece will be, because they think somehow I planned for this to happen.\n\nI feel awful, like I've said a million times, but I really don't think I'm an asshole for this happening. I didn't do this on purpose. I have never needed to lock up my edibles before for the same reason I would never lock up a bottle of wine. When my sister called me in a panic, it wasn't like I thought \"Oh my god, I need to immediately childproof my home!\"\n\nBut am I the asshole here? Do I really deserve what's happening now?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not locking up her edibles, which led her niece to get high. The situation is in Colorado where cannabis is legal.\n\nFirst, the author is an adult who uses edibles for relaxation. She had her 9-year-old niece over because her sister needed a sitter. The niece ended up eating the sour gummies that were on the dresser, which the author didn't lock up. The author didn't foresee this happening and was unaware that kids could access them. She did call poison control and took care of the niece, who ended up being fine. However, her family is upset and has blamed her, leading to her being uninvited from events where the niece is present. She's feeling awful but doesn't think she's an asshole.\n\nNow, to determine if she's in the wrong. From a legal standpoint, in Colorado, there are regulations about storing cannabis products safely. Adults should keep cannabis out of reach of children. Even though she didn't lock it up thinking she didn't need to, the key point is that she didn't secure it properly. Children can access things left out, especially if they're curious. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, even if it wasn't intentional, the responsibility lies with the adult to ensure that any substance that can harm a child is stored safely. The fact that the niece was left in her care means the author had a duty of care. The sister trusted her to look after the child, and the author didn't take precautions. While it wasn't malicious, negligence can still be considered wrong because it resulted in harm, even if minor.\n\nThe family's reaction is harsh, but their concern is valid. The author's argument that she didn't think about it because she's an adult and not used to kids around is understandable but doesn't absolve her of responsibility. The consequences, though not severe in this case, could have been worse. The fact that the niece is fine is fortunate, but the mistake was in not securing the edibles. \n\nLegal and safety guidelines in Colorado emphasize childproofing cannabis products. The author's oversight, even unintentional, violated that standard. So legally and in terms of responsibility, she's at fault. However, the question is whether she's an asshole. The term \"asshole\" implies malicious intent or disregard for others' well-being. Since she didn't mean to harm the niece and acted responsibly once it happened, maybe she's not an asshole, but she's definitely in the wrong for not taking precautions.\n"
