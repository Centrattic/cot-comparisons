I am a 35 year old woman. For many women, unwinding means a bottle of wine. For me, I prefer to pop an edible or two and relax in front of a paint canvas, my sewing machine, etc.\n\nMy sister's husband had an emergency that resulted in her needing to quickly find a sitter for her 9 year old. I like my niece and obviously wanted to help out my sister, but warned her that she'd probably be bored at my place, since we don't have a lot of kid-friendly stuff.  At one point after she dropped her off with some books, I got up to take a shower. I'm pretty sure this is when it happened.\n\nAbout an hour or so later, I notice niece hadn't said anything for a while. I went over to the couch to see what was up, and she's just staring at the ceiling with one of her books on her stomach. I ask her if she's okay, and I immediately knew something was up. She said \"I ate some of your candy and it made me feel funny.\"\n\nShe had, in fact, eaten several of the sour gummies I had on my dresser. That I hadn't thought to lock up or anything like that because I'm a 35 year old woman who doesn't need to think about those things. Like ever.\n\nI panicked, she seemed fine, I called poison control and called her mom and panicked a lot more. I felt awful. It hadn't even occurred to me that this is a thing that would happen. Honestly, I did not foresee this happening. At all. Niece is completely fine, she ended up falling asleep after asking me for a grilled cheese sandwich with cut up hot dogs in it and asking if we could watch a movie. I stayed with her, kept her hydrated, etc, and apologized at least six million times to my sister, who was horrified and actually screamed at me. Once again, my niece is *fine.*\n\nEven my parents are in on it, blaming me and telling me I should have those things in a safe where no one could get to them, how could I possibly thing it was okay to have them around a child, no one should ever let their kids around me because next time I might give them a beer, etc etc. And I've been uninvited from anywhere that my niece will be, because they think somehow I planned for this to happen.\n\nI feel awful, like I've said a million times, but I really don't think I'm an asshole for this happening. I didn't do this on purpose. I have never needed to lock up my edibles before for the same reason I would never lock up a bottle of wine. When my sister called me in a panic, it wasn't like I thought \"Oh my god, I need to immediately childproof my home!\"\n\nBut am I the asshole here? Do I really deserve what's happening now?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a 35-year-old woman in Colorado who didn't lock up her edibles, and her 9-year-old niece ate them. The author is wondering if she's an a**hole (AITA) for not securing the edibles, leading to the niece getting high.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. Colorado has legalized marijuana, but there are still laws regarding its storage, especially around children. Even though the author didn't intend for this to happen, she might have violated state regulations about keeping cannabis products out of reach of children. In many places, child-resistant packaging or secure storage is required, even in legal states. So legally, she might be at fault.\n\nThen there's the moral aspect. The author is an adult and a responsible person, but she didn't take precautions. Even if she didn't have kids before, when she agreed to take care of her niece, she should have been aware of the risks. The niece is a child, and children are naturally curious. Leaving edibles unsecured is a risk, regardless of the author's usual habits. The sister and parents are upset because the situation could have been dangerous. Even though the niece ended up fine, the potential harm is significant. Edibles can be more potent for children, leading to serious health issues or even hospitalization.\n\nAlso, the author's defense is that she didn't think about it, similar to leaving wine out. But alcohol and cannabis are different in terms of child access. Wine is in a bottle, but edibles, especially candy-like ones, can be mistaken for regular snacks. The author's lack of foresight is a problem here. She should have taken the extra step to secure the edibles, just like she would with other hazardous substances like medication or cleaning products.\n\nThe reactions from her sister and parents are understandable. The sister was in a panic because her child was in a potentially dangerous situation. The author's not being more proactive in securing the edibles led to a preventable incident. Even if it wasn't intentional, the responsibility lies with the caregiver to ensure the environment is safe for the child.\n\nSo, considering both the legal and moral angles, the author is in the wrong. She didn't take necessary precautions despite knowing the potential risks, even if she didn't anticipate the specific event. The answer should be A.\n"
