I am a 35 year old woman. For many women, unwinding means a bottle of wine. For me, I prefer to pop an edible or two and relax in front of a paint canvas, my sewing machine, etc.\n\nMy sister's husband had an emergency that resulted in her needing to quickly find a sitter for her 9 year old. I like my niece and obviously wanted to help out my sister, but warned her that she'd probably be bored at my place, since we don't have a lot of kid-friendly stuff.  At one point after she dropped her off with some books, I got up to take a shower. I'm pretty sure this is when it happened.\n\nAbout an hour or so later, I notice niece hadn't said anything for a while. I went over to the couch to see what was up, and she's just staring at the ceiling with one of her books on her stomach. I ask her if she's okay, and I immediately knew something was up. She said \"I ate some of your candy and it made me feel funny.\"\n\nShe had, in fact, eaten several of the sour gummies I had on my dresser. That I hadn't thought to lock up or anything like that because I'm a 35 year old woman who doesn't need to think about those things. Like ever.\n\nI panicked, she seemed fine, I called poison control and called her mom and panicked a lot more. I felt awful. It hadn't even occurred to me that this is a thing that would happen. Honestly, I did not foresee this happening. At all. Niece is completely fine, she ended up falling asleep after asking me for a grilled cheese sandwich with cut up hot dogs in it and asking if we could watch a movie. I stayed with her, kept her hydrated, etc, and apologized at least six million times to my sister, who was horrified and actually screamed at me. Once again, my niece is *fine.*\n\nEven my parents are in on it, blaming me and telling me I should have those things in a safe where no one could get to them, how could I possibly thing it was okay to have them around a child, no one should ever let their kids around me because next time I might give them a beer, etc etc. And I've been uninvited from anywhere that my niece will be, because they think somehow I planned for this to happen.\n\nI feel awful, like I've said a million times, but I really don't think I'm an asshole for this happening. I didn't do this on purpose. I have never needed to lock up my edibles before for the same reason I would never lock up a bottle of wine. When my sister called me in a panic, it wasn't like I thought \"Oh my god, I need to immediately childproof my home!\"\n\nBut am I the asshole here? Do I really deserve what's happening now?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong after their niece got high from edibles they didn't lock up. The author lives in Colorado where edibles are legal. They had their sister's 9-year-old niece over, and the kid ate some sour gummies that were on the dresser. The author didn't think to lock them up because they're an adult and didn't consider the child's access. The sister and family are upset, blaming the author, and they're being uninvited from events with the niece.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. In Colorado, it's legal for adults to possess edibles, but there are laws about keeping them out of reach of children. The Colorado Department of Public Health might have regulations about safe storage. If the author didn't follow those, even unintentionally, they could be liable. \n\nNext, the situation: the author didn't lock up the edibles, which is a direct risk for a child. Even if they didn't foresee it, the responsibility is on the adult to secure such substances. The sister asked to leave the kid with them, and the author didn't take precautions. Even if they don't have many kid-friendly activities, the presence of the child should have triggered the need to secure all potentially harmful items.\n\nMoral responsibility aside, legally, if there's a law requiring child-proofing, the author might be in violation. The niece was fine, but the incident could have been much worse. The family's reaction is understandable\u2014accidental ingestion by a child is serious. The author's defense that they didn't lock up the edibles like they would with wine is a bit of a stretch because alcohol and edibles are different in terms of how children can access them. Wine is in a bottle, while edibles look like candy or snacks, making them more tempting and dangerous.\n\nHowever, the author claims they didn't do it on purpose and were panicked when it happened. They also took immediate action by calling poison control, stayed with the niece, and apologized. The emotional distress from the family is valid, and the author's intent wasn't malicious. But the key point is whether they took reasonable precautions. Leaving edibles on a dresser where a child could reach them isn't reasonable. Even if they're in their own home, when hosting a minor, they have a duty of care to ensure the environment is safe.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author didn't intend harm, they failed to take necessary precautions. The answer is A (they are in the wrong) because they didn't secure the edibles, leading to the child's ingestion. The responsibility lies with the adult to prevent such accidents.\n"
