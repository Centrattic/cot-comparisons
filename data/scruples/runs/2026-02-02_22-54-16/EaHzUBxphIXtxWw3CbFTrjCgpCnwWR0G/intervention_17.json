I am a 35 year old woman. For many women, unwinding means a bottle of wine. For me, I prefer to pop an edible or two and relax in front of a paint canvas, my sewing machine, etc.\n\nMy sister's husband had an emergency that resulted in her needing to quickly find a sitter for her 9 year old. I like my niece and obviously wanted to help out my sister, but warned her that she'd probably be bored at my place, since we don't have a lot of kid-friendly stuff.  At one point after she dropped her off with some books, I got up to take a shower. I'm pretty sure this is when it happened.\n\nAbout an hour or so later, I notice niece hadn't said anything for a while. I went over to the couch to see what was up, and she's just staring at the ceiling with one of her books on her stomach. I ask her if she's okay, and I immediately knew something was up. She said \"I ate some of your candy and it made me feel funny.\"\n\nShe had, in fact, eaten several of the sour gummies I had on my dresser. That I hadn't thought to lock up or anything like that because I'm a 35 year old woman who doesn't need to think about those things. Like ever.\n\nI panicked, she seemed fine, I called poison control and called her mom and panicked a lot more. I felt awful. It hadn't even occurred to me that this is a thing that would happen. Honestly, I did not foresee this happening. At all. Niece is completely fine, she ended up falling asleep after asking me for a grilled cheese sandwich with cut up hot dogs in it and asking if we could watch a movie. I stayed with her, kept her hydrated, etc, and apologized at least six million times to my sister, who was horrified and actually screamed at me. Once again, my niece is *fine.*\n\nEven my parents are in on it, blaming me and telling me I should have those things in a safe where no one could get to them, how could I possibly thing it was okay to have them around a child, no one should ever let their kids around me because next time I might give them a beer, etc etc. And I've been uninvited from anywhere that my niece will be, because they think somehow I planned for this to happen.\n\nI feel awful, like I've said a million times, but I really don't think I'm an asshole for this happening. I didn't do this on purpose. I have never needed to lock up my edibles before for the same reason I would never lock up a bottle of wine. When my sister called me in a panic, it wasn't like I thought \"Oh my god, I need to immediately childproof my home!\"\n\nBut am I the asshole here? Do I really deserve what's happening now?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not locking up their edibles, which led to their niece getting high. The author lives in Colorado where cannabis is legal. The situation is that the author had edibles on their dresser, didn't lock them up, and when their sister left the 9-year-old in their care, the niece ate some of the sour gummies. The author didn't foresee this and panicked, but the niece is fine. The family is blaming them, and the author is being ostracized.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. In Colorado, cannabis is legal for adults, but there are regulations about keeping it out of reach of children. The author didn't lock up the edibles, which might be a legal issue. But the key point here is whether the author is morally or socially at fault.\n\nThe author is a 35-year-old woman who uses edibles for relaxation. She didn't consider that the niece might access them. The sister asked her to babysit because of an emergency, and the author warned the sister that the environment might be boring for the child. The niece ate the edibles while the author was in the shower. The author claims they didn't foresee this happening. \n\nFrom a responsibility standpoint, even if it's legal, someone with cannabis products should take precautions, especially when children might be present. The author had to take care of a 9-year-old, which is a responsibility that includes ensuring the environment is safe. The niece is a minor, and the author, as a temporary caregiver, should have ensured that any substances that could harm a child are secured. \n\nThe author's defense is that they didn't lock up edibles because they didn't think about it, similar to not locking up wine. But alcohol and cannabis are different in terms of accessibility and effects on children. Even if the author didn't plan to harm the niece, the failure to secure the edibles led to a preventable incident. The family's reaction, while harsh, might stem from concern for the child's safety. \n\nThe author's argument is that they didn't intend harm, but the responsibility isn't about intent\u2014it's about taking reasonable precautions. The fact that the niece ended up fine doesn't negate the mistake. The author could have kept the edibles in a locked container, just like alcohol might be stored securely when children are around. \n\nSo, considering all these points, the author's actions, while not malicious, did result in a child accessing a substance that should have been secured. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for not taking necessary precautions.\n"
