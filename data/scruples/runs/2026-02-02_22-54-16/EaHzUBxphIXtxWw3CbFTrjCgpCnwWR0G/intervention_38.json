I am a 35 year old woman. For many women, unwinding means a bottle of wine. For me, I prefer to pop an edible or two and relax in front of a paint canvas, my sewing machine, etc.\n\nMy sister's husband had an emergency that resulted in her needing to quickly find a sitter for her 9 year old. I like my niece and obviously wanted to help out my sister, but warned her that she'd probably be bored at my place, since we don't have a lot of kid-friendly stuff.  At one point after she dropped her off with some books, I got up to take a shower. I'm pretty sure this is when it happened.\n\nAbout an hour or so later, I notice niece hadn't said anything for a while. I went over to the couch to see what was up, and she's just staring at the ceiling with one of her books on her stomach. I ask her if she's okay, and I immediately knew something was up. She said \"I ate some of your candy and it made me feel funny.\"\n\nShe had, in fact, eaten several of the sour gummies I had on my dresser. That I hadn't thought to lock up or anything like that because I'm a 35 year old woman who doesn't need to think about those things. Like ever.\n\nI panicked, she seemed fine, I called poison control and called her mom and panicked a lot more. I felt awful. It hadn't even occurred to me that this is a thing that would happen. Honestly, I did not foresee this happening. At all. Niece is completely fine, she ended up falling asleep after asking me for a grilled cheese sandwich with cut up hot dogs in it and asking if we could watch a movie. I stayed with her, kept her hydrated, etc, and apologized at least six million times to my sister, who was horrified and actually screamed at me. Once again, my niece is *fine.*\n\nEven my parents are in on it, blaming me and telling me I should have those things in a safe where no one could get to them, how could I possibly thing it was okay to have them around a child, no one should ever let their kids around me because next time I might give them a beer, etc etc. And I've been uninvited from anywhere that my niece will be, because they think somehow I planned for this to happen.\n\nI feel awful, like I've said a million times, but I really don't think I'm an asshole for this happening. I didn't do this on purpose. I have never needed to lock up my edibles before for the same reason I would never lock up a bottle of wine. When my sister called me in a panic, it wasn't like I thought \"Oh my god, I need to immediately childproof my home!\"\n\nBut am I the asshole here? Do I really deserve what's happening now?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for not locking up edibles that their 9-year-old niece ate. The situation is in Colorado where edibles are legal.\n\nFirst, the author is a 35-year-old woman who uses edibles for relaxation. She had her sister's 9-year-old niece for a few hours because the sister had an emergency. The niece ate the sour gummies, which were on the dresser. The author didn't lock them up, thinking she didn't need to since she's an adult and didn't consider the kid's presence.\n\nThe question is whether the author is at fault. The answer options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nHmm. Colorado has laws about keeping cannabis products out of reach of children. Even though the author didn't intend harm, the fact that she left edibles accessible in a home where a child might be could be an issue. Legal responsibility often hinges on foreseeability. If the author knew or should have known there was a child present, even temporarily, not securing the edibles might be considered negligence.\n\nBut the author didn't realize the niece would have access. However, the niece was a child, so a reasonable person might anticipate that a child could find and consume something left out. The author's own statement that she didn't think about it before suggests a lack of due care. The family's reaction, including being blamed and uninvited, might align with the idea that she wasn't cautious enough.\n\nOn the other hand, the author acted responsibly after the incident, called poison control, stayed with the niece, and apologized. The niece was fine, and the author didn't intend to harm her. But legal and social responsibility often look at whether the risk was foreseeable. Since the author had a 9-year-old in her home, even briefly, not securing edibles could be seen as a failure to prevent a preventable accident.\n\nSo, while the author didn't act with malice, the negligence in not securing the edibles when a child was present could make her at fault. The answer might be A (yes), but I need to check Colorado's specific laws. Colorado requires cannabis products to be stored in a child-resistant container and out of reach of children. Leaving them on a dresser might not meet those requirements, especially if a child is present. Therefore, legally, the author might be in the wrong because she didn't follow the necessary precautions.\n"
