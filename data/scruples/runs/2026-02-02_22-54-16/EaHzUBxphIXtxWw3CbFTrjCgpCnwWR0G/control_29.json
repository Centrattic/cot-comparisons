I am a 35 year old woman. For many women, unwinding means a bottle of wine. For me, I prefer to pop an edible or two and relax in front of a paint canvas, my sewing machine, etc.\n\nMy sister's husband had an emergency that resulted in her needing to quickly find a sitter for her 9 year old. I like my niece and obviously wanted to help out my sister, but warned her that she'd probably be bored at my place, since we don't have a lot of kid-friendly stuff.  At one point after she dropped her off with some books, I got up to take a shower. I'm pretty sure this is when it happened.\n\nAbout an hour or so later, I notice niece hadn't said anything for a while. I went over to the couch to see what was up, and she's just staring at the ceiling with one of her books on her stomach. I ask her if she's okay, and I immediately knew something was up. She said \"I ate some of your candy and it made me feel funny.\"\n\nShe had, in fact, eaten several of the sour gummies I had on my dresser. That I hadn't thought to lock up or anything like that because I'm a 35 year old woman who doesn't need to think about those things. Like ever.\n\nI panicked, she seemed fine, I called poison control and called her mom and panicked a lot more. I felt awful. It hadn't even occurred to me that this is a thing that would happen. Honestly, I did not foresee this happening. At all. Niece is completely fine, she ended up falling asleep after asking me for a grilled cheese sandwich with cut up hot dogs in it and asking if we could watch a movie. I stayed with her, kept her hydrated, etc, and apologized at least six million times to my sister, who was horrified and actually screamed at me. Once again, my niece is *fine.*\n\nEven my parents are in on it, blaming me and telling me I should have those things in a safe where no one could get to them, how could I possibly thing it was okay to have them around a child, no one should ever let their kids around me because next time I might give them a beer, etc etc. And I've been uninvited from anywhere that my niece will be, because they think somehow I planned for this to happen.\n\nI feel awful, like I've said a million times, but I really don't think I'm an asshole for this happening. I didn't do this on purpose. I have never needed to lock up my edibles before for the same reason I would never lock up a bottle of wine. When my sister called me in a panic, it wasn't like I thought \"Oh my god, I need to immediately childproof my home!\"\n\nBut am I the asshole here? Do I really deserve what's happening now?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not locking up her edibles, leading her niece to get high. The situation is in Colorado where edibles are legal. The author is an adult who uses edibles for relaxation and didn't lock them up because she considered herself responsible. Her sister needed a sitter for her 9-year-old, and the author agreed despite knowing the kid might be bored. The niece found the edibles, ate them, and the author panicked, called poison control, and apologized. Now, her family is blaming her and excluding her.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is at fault. Colorado law requires that cannabis products, including edibles, be stored securely to prevent access by children. Even though the author didn't think about it, having edibles accessible in a home where a child might be present could be a legal and safety issue. The key point is whether the author took reasonable precautions. She didn't lock them up, perhaps because she didn't consider the risk, but responsibility for child safety is on the adult. \n\nChildren are curious and may not understand the dangers of edibles. The author's reasoning that she treats edibles like wine is flawed because alcohol and edibles affect the body differently, especially in children. Also, parents have a duty to ensure their home is safe for any child present. Even if it was an accident, the outcome was preventable with proper storage. The author's family's reaction is harsh, but the author did have a responsibility to secure the edibles. So, the answer might be A because she didn't take necessary precautions. However, it's also a mistake made in good faith, so B could be considered. But legally and in terms of adult responsibility, the answer is likely A.\n"
