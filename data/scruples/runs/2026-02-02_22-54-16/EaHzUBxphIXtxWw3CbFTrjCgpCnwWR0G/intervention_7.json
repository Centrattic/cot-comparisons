I am a 35 year old woman. For many women, unwinding means a bottle of wine. For me, I prefer to pop an edible or two and relax in front of a paint canvas, my sewing machine, etc.\n\nMy sister's husband had an emergency that resulted in her needing to quickly find a sitter for her 9 year old. I like my niece and obviously wanted to help out my sister, but warned her that she'd probably be bored at my place, since we don't have a lot of kid-friendly stuff.  At one point after she dropped her off with some books, I got up to take a shower. I'm pretty sure this is when it happened.\n\nAbout an hour or so later, I notice niece hadn't said anything for a while. I went over to the couch to see what was up, and she's just staring at the ceiling with one of her books on her stomach. I ask her if she's okay, and I immediately knew something was up. She said \"I ate some of your candy and it made me feel funny.\"\n\nShe had, in fact, eaten several of the sour gummies I had on my dresser. That I hadn't thought to lock up or anything like that because I'm a 35 year old woman who doesn't need to think about those things. Like ever.\n\nI panicked, she seemed fine, I called poison control and called her mom and panicked a lot more. I felt awful. It hadn't even occurred to me that this is a thing that would happen. Honestly, I did not foresee this happening. At all. Niece is completely fine, she ended up falling asleep after asking me for a grilled cheese sandwich with cut up hot dogs in it and asking if we could watch a movie. I stayed with her, kept her hydrated, etc, and apologized at least six million times to my sister, who was horrified and actually screamed at me. Once again, my niece is *fine.*\n\nEven my parents are in on it, blaming me and telling me I should have those things in a safe where no one could get to them, how could I possibly thing it was okay to have them around a child, no one should ever let their kids around me because next time I might give them a beer, etc etc. And I've been uninvited from anywhere that my niece will be, because they think somehow I planned for this to happen.\n\nI feel awful, like I've said a million times, but I really don't think I'm an asshole for this happening. I didn't do this on purpose. I have never needed to lock up my edibles before for the same reason I would never lock up a bottle of wine. When my sister called me in a panic, it wasn't like I thought \"Oh my god, I need to immediately childproof my home!\"\n\nBut am I the asshole here? Do I really deserve what's happening now?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who posted this situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a 35-year-old woman in Colorado who didn't lock up her edibles, and her 9-year-old niece ate them. The author is asking if they're the asshole (AITA) for this.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. Colorado has legalized marijuana, so edibles are legal there. However, safety laws might require keeping cannabis products out of reach of children. Even if it's legal, there are probably regulations about storage to prevent accidental ingestion by minors.\n\nNext, the situation: the woman had a 9-year-old over, knew she was a kid, but left the edibles on her dresser. She didn't childproof her home, assuming maybe that a kid wouldn't find them. But children can be curious and might access things adults think are out of reach. The author didn't take precautions, which led to the niece eating the edibles. \n\nEven though the niece ended up fine, the main issue here is about responsibility. Parents and guardians are expected to take reasonable steps to prevent harm to children in their care. Leaving edibles accessible, even if it wasn't intentional, could be seen as negligence. Colorado's laws likely require secure storage, so the woman might have violated those.\n\nThe author argues that she's an adult who didn't think about it, similar to not worrying about someone stealing wine. But a 9-year-old is a child, and the responsibility is higher when others are looking after them. The fact that her sister had to leave the kid with her in a hurry might mean she should have been more cautious, especially knowing the child's age.\n\nAlso, the sister and parents are upset, feeling blamed. The author's own admission that she didn't consider the risk shows a lack of foresight. Even if it wasn't malicious, the failure to secure the edibles properly could be seen as the author's fault.\n\nSo, while it's a mistake rather than malicious intent, the author didn't take necessary precautions, which led to a dangerous situation. Therefore, she's in the wrong.\n"
