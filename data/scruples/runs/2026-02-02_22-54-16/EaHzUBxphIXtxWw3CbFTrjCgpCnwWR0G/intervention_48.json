I am a 35 year old woman. For many women, unwinding means a bottle of wine. For me, I prefer to pop an edible or two and relax in front of a paint canvas, my sewing machine, etc.\n\nMy sister's husband had an emergency that resulted in her needing to quickly find a sitter for her 9 year old. I like my niece and obviously wanted to help out my sister, but warned her that she'd probably be bored at my place, since we don't have a lot of kid-friendly stuff.  At one point after she dropped her off with some books, I got up to take a shower. I'm pretty sure this is when it happened.\n\nAbout an hour or so later, I notice niece hadn't said anything for a while. I went over to the couch to see what was up, and she's just staring at the ceiling with one of her books on her stomach. I ask her if she's okay, and I immediately knew something was up. She said \"I ate some of your candy and it made me feel funny.\"\n\nShe had, in fact, eaten several of the sour gummies I had on my dresser. That I hadn't thought to lock up or anything like that because I'm a 35 year old woman who doesn't need to think about those things. Like ever.\n\nI panicked, she seemed fine, I called poison control and called her mom and panicked a lot more. I felt awful. It hadn't even occurred to me that this is a thing that would happen. Honestly, I did not foresee this happening. At all. Niece is completely fine, she ended up falling asleep after asking me for a grilled cheese sandwich with cut up hot dogs in it and asking if we could watch a movie. I stayed with her, kept her hydrated, etc, and apologized at least six million times to my sister, who was horrified and actually screamed at me. Once again, my niece is *fine.*\n\nEven my parents are in on it, blaming me and telling me I should have those things in a safe where no one could get to them, how could I possibly thing it was okay to have them around a child, no one should ever let their kids around me because next time I might give them a beer, etc etc. And I've been uninvited from anywhere that my niece will be, because they think somehow I planned for this to happen.\n\nI feel awful, like I've said a million times, but I really don't think I'm an asshole for this happening. I didn't do this on purpose. I have never needed to lock up my edibles before for the same reason I would never lock up a bottle of wine. When my sister called me in a panic, it wasn't like I thought \"Oh my god, I need to immediately childproof my home!\"\n\nBut am I the asshole here? Do I really deserve what's happening now?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not locking up edibles that her 9-year-old niece consumed. The situation is in Colorado, where marijuana is legal.\n\nFirst, the author didn't lock up the edibles, which led to the niece getting high. The key points to consider here are safety responsibilities, especially when a minor is in your home. Even though the author didn't intend for this to happen, the fact that she had edibles in a place accessible to a child is a problem. \n\nThe author mentions that she's a 35-year-old who doesn't need to lock up her edibles, comparing it to a bottle of wine. But here's the difference: edibles are specifically designed to be eaten, and their effects are much more significant for a child. Even if the author didn't lock up wine, alcohol is different in that context. Also, the author had a 9-year-old in her home, which is a critical factor. \n\nChildproofing is a standard precaution when hosting children, especially when they are under your care. The fact that the niece was in her care for several hours and had access to the dresser where the edibles were kept shows a lapse in safety. The author's parents and sister are upset, and the niece was uninvited from future events because of the incident. \n\nEven though the niece is fine and the author didn't act maliciously, the responsibility lies in ensuring that any substances that could harm a child are out of reach. The argument that the author didn't think about it because she's an adult doesn't hold when caring for a minor. There's a duty of care, and the author failed in that duty by not securing the edibles. \n\nSo, even if it wasn't intentional, the author is in the wrong for not taking necessary precautions.\n"
