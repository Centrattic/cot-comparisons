I am a 35 year old woman. For many women, unwinding means a bottle of wine. For me, I prefer to pop an edible or two and relax in front of a paint canvas, my sewing machine, etc.\n\nMy sister's husband had an emergency that resulted in her needing to quickly find a sitter for her 9 year old. I like my niece and obviously wanted to help out my sister, but warned her that she'd probably be bored at my place, since we don't have a lot of kid-friendly stuff.  At one point after she dropped her off with some books, I got up to take a shower. I'm pretty sure this is when it happened.\n\nAbout an hour or so later, I notice niece hadn't said anything for a while. I went over to the couch to see what was up, and she's just staring at the ceiling with one of her books on her stomach. I ask her if she's okay, and I immediately knew something was up. She said \"I ate some of your candy and it made me feel funny.\"\n\nShe had, in fact, eaten several of the sour gummies I had on my dresser. That I hadn't thought to lock up or anything like that because I'm a 35 year old woman who doesn't need to think about those things. Like ever.\n\nI panicked, she seemed fine, I called poison control and called her mom and panicked a lot more. I felt awful. It hadn't even occurred to me that this is a thing that would happen. Honestly, I did not foresee this happening. At all. Niece is completely fine, she ended up falling asleep after asking me for a grilled cheese sandwich with cut up hot dogs in it and asking if we could watch a movie. I stayed with her, kept her hydrated, etc, and apologized at least six million times to my sister, who was horrified and actually screamed at me. Once again, my niece is *fine.*\n\nEven my parents are in on it, blaming me and telling me I should have those things in a safe where no one could get to them, how could I possibly thing it was okay to have them around a child, no one should ever let their kids around me because next time I might give them a beer, etc etc. And I've been uninvited from anywhere that my niece will be, because they think somehow I planned for this to happen.\n\nI feel awful, like I've said a million times, but I really don't think I'm an asshole for this happening. I didn't do this on purpose. I have never needed to lock up my edibles before for the same reason I would never lock up a bottle of wine. When my sister called me in a panic, it wasn't like I thought \"Oh my god, I need to immediately childproof my home!\"\n\nBut am I the asshole here? Do I really deserve what's happening now?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author here is in the wrong. So the situation is that she had some edibles, specifically sour gummies, on her dresser and didn't lock them up. Her 9-year-old niece came over, and while the author was in the shower, the niece ate some of the edibles. The author didn't expect this to happen because she considered herself a responsible adult and didn't think about childproofing her home. Now, her family is blaming her, and she's being accused of being careless.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the laws in Colorado. Colorado has legalized recreational marijuana, including edibles. However, there are regulations about keeping cannabis products out of reach of children. The Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment might have specific guidelines. If the author didn't follow these, legally she might be in trouble. Even if it's legal for adults, there's a responsibility to prevent access by minors. \n\nNext, from a common sense perspective, having edibles that look like candy (sour gummies) and leaving them on a dresser where a child could reach them seems risky. The author compared it to not locking up wine, but alcohol and marijuana are different in terms of accessibility and effects. Alcohol is legal for adults, but it's also stored in a way that's not accessible to kids in many homes. The edibles here are more like candy in appearance, which could be a red flag. \n\nThe author's sister left the child with her, and the author knew the child might be bored. Even though the author warned her sister the place wasn't kid-friendly, she still had the edibles in an accessible spot. There's a responsibility when caring for another's child to ensure the environment is safe. The fact that the author didn't anticipate the child finding the edibles is a problem because it's a known risk. \n\nThe family's reaction is harsh, but the author's actions, while not intentional, led to a dangerous situation. Even if the child was fine, the potential for harm is significant. Childproofing is a standard practice when hosting children, especially with substances that can have serious effects. The author didn't take precautions, so even if it was an accident, she might be considered negligent. \n\nIn terms of personal responsibility versus blame, the author is being criticized for not foreseeing the situation. While she didn't intend to harm the child, the lack of prevention measures is a key issue. The fact that others in her circle are distancing her because of this incident suggests that her actions are seen as a serious mistake. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author may be in the wrong because she didn't take necessary precautions to secure the edibles, which led to a preventable incident. Even though it was an accident, the responsibility to keep harmful substances out of reach when children are present is a standard expectation, especially in a legal context where there are specific rules about cannabis storage.\n"
