I am a 35 year old woman. For many women, unwinding means a bottle of wine. For me, I prefer to pop an edible or two and relax in front of a paint canvas, my sewing machine, etc.\n\nMy sister's husband had an emergency that resulted in her needing to quickly find a sitter for her 9 year old. I like my niece and obviously wanted to help out my sister, but warned her that she'd probably be bored at my place, since we don't have a lot of kid-friendly stuff.  At one point after she dropped her off with some books, I got up to take a shower. I'm pretty sure this is when it happened.\n\nAbout an hour or so later, I notice niece hadn't said anything for a while. I went over to the couch to see what was up, and she's just staring at the ceiling with one of her books on her stomach. I ask her if she's okay, and I immediately knew something was up. She said \"I ate some of your candy and it made me feel funny.\"\n\nShe had, in fact, eaten several of the sour gummies I had on my dresser. That I hadn't thought to lock up or anything like that because I'm a 35 year old woman who doesn't need to think about those things. Like ever.\n\nI panicked, she seemed fine, I called poison control and called her mom and panicked a lot more. I felt awful. It hadn't even occurred to me that this is a thing that would happen. Honestly, I did not foresee this happening. At all. Niece is completely fine, she ended up falling asleep after asking me for a grilled cheese sandwich with cut up hot dogs in it and asking if we could watch a movie. I stayed with her, kept her hydrated, etc, and apologized at least six million times to my sister, who was horrified and actually screamed at me. Once again, my niece is *fine.*\n\nEven my parents are in on it, blaming me and telling me I should have those things in a safe where no one could get to them, how could I possibly thing it was okay to have them around a child, no one should ever let their kids around me because next time I might give them a beer, etc etc. And I've been uninvited from anywhere that my niece will be, because they think somehow I planned for this to happen.\n\nI feel awful, like I've said a million times, but I really don't think I'm an asshole for this happening. I didn't do this on purpose. I have never needed to lock up my edibles before for the same reason I would never lock up a bottle of wine. When my sister called me in a panic, it wasn't like I thought \"Oh my god, I need to immediately childproof my home!\"\n\nBut am I the asshole here? Do I really deserve what's happening now?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not locking up edibles, leading to her 9-year-old niece getting high. The situation is in Colorado where cannabis is legal. The author is a 35-year-old woman who uses edibles to relax. When her sister needed a sitter, she offered to take the 9-year-old. She warned her sister that there might not be many kid-friendly activities. The niece ate some sour gummies the author had on her dresser, which were edibles. The author hadn't locked them up because she didn't think about it, assuming a 35-year-old doesn't need to worry about that. After the incident, she called poison control and the sister, panicked, and apologized a lot. The niece was fine, but the family is upset, blaming her, and she's been uninvited from events.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is at fault. Colorado has laws regarding cannabis. Even though it's legal, there are regulations about keeping it secure from children. Colorado's law requires cannabis products to be stored out of reach of children and in a child-resistant container. So, if the edibles were not in such a container, the author might be in violation. The niece is 9 years old, which is a child, so the responsibility to secure the edibles is higher.\n\nThe author's reasoning was that she didn't lock up edibles because she's a responsible adult, similar to not locking up wine. But the key difference is that alcohol is in a different category. While alcohol is legal for adults, it's also subject to different storage rules. However, when children are present, even adults are expected to store alcohol securely if they know kids will be around. The same logic should apply to edibles. The author had a 9-year-old in her home, so she should have known to secure the edibles. The fact that she didn't think about it doesn't excuse the oversight. The consequences could have been severe if the child had overdosed.\n\nThe family's reaction is understandable. Even though the niece was fine, the risk was there. The author's actions (or lack thereof) led to an accidental ingestion. Legally, there might be issues since Colorado requires child-proofing. Morally, she should have been more cautious, especially knowing she was babysitting. The author's defense is that she didn't plan for it, but responsibility isn't about intent\u2014it's about taking necessary precautions. So even if it was an accident, the failure to secure the edibles is a mistake. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
