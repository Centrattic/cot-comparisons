I am a 35 year old woman. For many women, unwinding means a bottle of wine. For me, I prefer to pop an edible or two and relax in front of a paint canvas, my sewing machine, etc.\n\nMy sister's husband had an emergency that resulted in her needing to quickly find a sitter for her 9 year old. I like my niece and obviously wanted to help out my sister, but warned her that she'd probably be bored at my place, since we don't have a lot of kid-friendly stuff.  At one point after she dropped her off with some books, I got up to take a shower. I'm pretty sure this is when it happened.\n\nAbout an hour or so later, I notice niece hadn't said anything for a while. I went over to the couch to see what was up, and she's just staring at the ceiling with one of her books on her stomach. I ask her if she's okay, and I immediately knew something was up. She said \"I ate some of your candy and it made me feel funny.\"\n\nShe had, in fact, eaten several of the sour gummies I had on my dresser. That I hadn't thought to lock up or anything like that because I'm a 35 year old woman who doesn't need to think about those things. Like ever.\n\nI panicked, she seemed fine, I called poison control and called her mom and panicked a lot more. I felt awful. It hadn't even occurred to me that this is a thing that would happen. Honestly, I did not foresee this happening. At all. Niece is completely fine, she ended up falling asleep after asking me for a grilled cheese sandwich with cut up hot dogs in it and asking if we could watch a movie. I stayed with her, kept her hydrated, etc, and apologized at least six million times to my sister, who was horrified and actually screamed at me. Once again, my niece is *fine.*\n\nEven my parents are in on it, blaming me and telling me I should have those things in a safe where no one could get to them, how could I possibly thing it was okay to have them around a child, no one should ever let their kids around me because next time I might give them a beer, etc etc. And I've been uninvited from anywhere that my niece will be, because they think somehow I planned for this to happen.\n\nI feel awful, like I've said a million times, but I really don't think I'm an asshole for this happening. I didn't do this on purpose. I have never needed to lock up my edibles before for the same reason I would never lock up a bottle of wine. When my sister called me in a panic, it wasn't like I thought \"Oh my god, I need to immediately childproof my home!\"\n\nBut am I the asshole here? Do I really deserve what's happening now?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author's niece accidentally consuming edibles that weren't locked up. The author is in Colorado where edibles are legal.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. Since it's legal, but the author didn't secure the edibles, could that be a problem? The key here is the responsibility of keeping edibles away from children. Even in a legal state, there are often regulations about storing cannabis products safely. For example, Colorado probably has laws about child-proof packaging or secure storage. If the author didn't follow those, they might be legally liable.\n\nNext, the ethical side. The author is an adult who didn't consider that a 9-year-old might access the edibles. Even if they didn't intend for it to happen, the fact that they left them out where a child could reach them is a lapse in responsibility. The sister was in a hurry and left the kid with the author, expecting a safe environment. The author's argument is that they don't lock up edibles the way they would a bottle of wine, but children can't consume alcohol. So maybe the comparison isn't fair.\n\nThe consequences: the niece was fine, but the family is upset. The author's family is blaming them, and they were uninvited. The author feels it wasn't intentional. However, the harm was real, even if minor. The question is whether the negligence is enough to consider them an asshole.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, intent matters a lot. The author didn't mean to harm the niece, but they didn't take precautions. The response from the sister and parents seems harsh, but the author did have a responsibility to keep the home safe for a child. Even if they didn't think about it, the fact is they left it out. So maybe the author is at least partially at fault, even if not maliciously.\n\nSo, is the answer A or B? The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but I need to weigh the responsibility. In legal terms, the author might be negligent. Ethically, they should have stored the edibles securely. Even if it's their home, when hosting a child, they should anticipate possible hazards. So the author is in the wrong, answer A."
