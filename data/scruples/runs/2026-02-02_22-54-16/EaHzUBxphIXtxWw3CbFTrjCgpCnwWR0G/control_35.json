I am a 35 year old woman. For many women, unwinding means a bottle of wine. For me, I prefer to pop an edible or two and relax in front of a paint canvas, my sewing machine, etc.\n\nMy sister's husband had an emergency that resulted in her needing to quickly find a sitter for her 9 year old. I like my niece and obviously wanted to help out my sister, but warned her that she'd probably be bored at my place, since we don't have a lot of kid-friendly stuff.  At one point after she dropped her off with some books, I got up to take a shower. I'm pretty sure this is when it happened.\n\nAbout an hour or so later, I notice niece hadn't said anything for a while. I went over to the couch to see what was up, and she's just staring at the ceiling with one of her books on her stomach. I ask her if she's okay, and I immediately knew something was up. She said \"I ate some of your candy and it made me feel funny.\"\n\nShe had, in fact, eaten several of the sour gummies I had on my dresser. That I hadn't thought to lock up or anything like that because I'm a 35 year old woman who doesn't need to think about those things. Like ever.\n\nI panicked, she seemed fine, I called poison control and called her mom and panicked a lot more. I felt awful. It hadn't even occurred to me that this is a thing that would happen. Honestly, I did not foresee this happening. At all. Niece is completely fine, she ended up falling asleep after asking me for a grilled cheese sandwich with cut up hot dogs in it and asking if we could watch a movie. I stayed with her, kept her hydrated, etc, and apologized at least six million times to my sister, who was horrified and actually screamed at me. Once again, my niece is *fine.*\n\nEven my parents are in on it, blaming me and telling me I should have those things in a safe where no one could get to them, how could I possibly thing it was okay to have them around a child, no one should ever let their kids around me because next time I might give them a beer, etc etc. And I've been uninvited from anywhere that my niece will be, because they think somehow I planned for this to happen.\n\nI feel awful, like I've said a million times, but I really don't think I'm an asshole for this happening. I didn't do this on purpose. I have never needed to lock up my edibles before for the same reason I would never lock up a bottle of wine. When my sister called me in a panic, it wasn't like I thought \"Oh my god, I need to immediately childproof my home!\"\n\nBut am I the asshole here? Do I really deserve what's happening now?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who posted this is in the wrong. Let's start by reading through the situation again.\n\nThe author is a 35-year-old woman in Colorado, a state where cannabis is legal. She uses edibles to relax. Her sister needed childcare urgently, so she offered to watch her 9-year-old niece. The sister warned her the kid might be bored because there's not much kid stuff there. The author had edibles (sour gummies) on her dresser, which she didn't lock up. She went to take a shower, and the niece ate some of the edibles. The author discovered this when the niece started acting strange. They called poison control, but the niece ended up being fine, even falling asleep after a grilled cheese. The author feels bad, but her sister and parents are blaming her, saying she should have locked up the edibles and that she's a bad influence. The author is being uninvited from places with the niece now.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is at fault here. The options are A (Yes) or B (No).\n\nFirst, let's look at the legal aspect. Colorado legalized recreational cannabis, but there are still regulations, especially regarding minors. I think it's illegal to leave cannabis products accessible to children. Colorado law likely requires cannabis to be stored securely to prevent access by minors. So if the author had the edibles in an unlocked dresser, that might be against the law. That's a point against her.\n\nNext, the practical side. The author knew a 9-year-old child was coming over. Even if she's an adult and used to having edibles around, she should have taken steps to secure them. The sister did warn that the kid might be bored and that there's not much to keep her occupied. The fact that the niece found the edibles suggests they were in an accessible spot. The author didn't consider the risk, which is a lapse in responsibility.\n\nThe author argues that she didn't lock them up because she's an adult and never thought about it. But having a child in the home, even temporarily, changes the responsibility. Just like you wouldn't leave a bottle of wine out for a child, even if you're an adult, you should secure edibles. The comparison to wine isn't perfect because alcohol and cannabis have different legal considerations, but the principle of securing substances accessible to minors applies.\n\nThe outcome was that the niece was fine, but the potential danger is significant. Edibles can be more potent for children, and even though there were no lasting effects, the risk was there. The family's reaction is understandable given the severity of the situation. The author's family is upset because they see this as a major negligence.\n\nOn the other hand, the author didn't intend harm; it was an accident. She took the situation seriously once it happened, called poison control, and took care of the niece. But intent doesn't remove responsibility. Negligence is about failing to take reasonable precautions. Leaving edibles in a place a child could reach is negligence, regardless of intent.\n\nColorado's law on cannabis safety: According to Colorado state law, cannabis products must be stored in child-resistant packaging and kept out of reach of children. The author had the edibles on her dresser, which is not a secure location. This is a legal violation, which would make her at fault.\n\nSo, considering the legal requirements, the foreseeable risk of a child accessing the edibles, and the duty of care expected when hosting a child, the author is at fault. The family's reaction is valid because she violated both legal standards and common safety practices. Even though the outcome was non-harmful, the act of leaving the edibles accessible was a mistake.\n"
