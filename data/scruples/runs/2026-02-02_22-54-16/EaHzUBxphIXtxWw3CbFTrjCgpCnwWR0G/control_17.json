I am a 35 year old woman. For many women, unwinding means a bottle of wine. For me, I prefer to pop an edible or two and relax in front of a paint canvas, my sewing machine, etc.\n\nMy sister's husband had an emergency that resulted in her needing to quickly find a sitter for her 9 year old. I like my niece and obviously wanted to help out my sister, but warned her that she'd probably be bored at my place, since we don't have a lot of kid-friendly stuff.  At one point after she dropped her off with some books, I got up to take a shower. I'm pretty sure this is when it happened.\n\nAbout an hour or so later, I notice niece hadn't said anything for a while. I went over to the couch to see what was up, and she's just staring at the ceiling with one of her books on her stomach. I ask her if she's okay, and I immediately knew something was up. She said \"I ate some of your candy and it made me feel funny.\"\n\nShe had, in fact, eaten several of the sour gummies I had on my dresser. That I hadn't thought to lock up or anything like that because I'm a 35 year old woman who doesn't need to think about those things. Like ever.\n\nI panicked, she seemed fine, I called poison control and called her mom and panicked a lot more. I felt awful. It hadn't even occurred to me that this is a thing that would happen. Honestly, I did not foresee this happening. At all. Niece is completely fine, she ended up falling asleep after asking me for a grilled cheese sandwich with cut up hot dogs in it and asking if we could watch a movie. I stayed with her, kept her hydrated, etc, and apologized at least six million times to my sister, who was horrified and actually screamed at me. Once again, my niece is *fine.*\n\nEven my parents are in on it, blaming me and telling me I should have those things in a safe where no one could get to them, how could I possibly thing it was okay to have them around a child, no one should ever let their kids around me because next time I might give them a beer, etc etc. And I've been uninvited from anywhere that my niece will be, because they think somehow I planned for this to happen.\n\nI feel awful, like I've said a million times, but I really don't think I'm an asshole for this happening. I didn't do this on purpose. I have never needed to lock up my edibles before for the same reason I would never lock up a bottle of wine. When my sister called me in a panic, it wasn't like I thought \"Oh my god, I need to immediately childproof my home!\"\n\nBut am I the asshole here? Do I really deserve what's happening now?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if they're the asshole for not locking up their edibles, leading their niece to get high. They live in Colorado where marijuana is legal. The situation involved the niece eating sour gummies that were left on the dresser. The author didn't think to lock them up because they're an adult and didn't consider the risk with a child around.\n\nFirst, the key issue here is child safety. Even if the person is an adult and uses edibles, when a child is present, there's a responsibility to keep such items secure. Colorado law requires that cannabis products be stored out of reach of children, similar to other medications. The author admitted they didn't lock them up, which is a basic safety measure. \n\nThe niece is 9 years old, and the author is an adult who should know better. The sister dropped off the child without prior warning, but the author still had a duty to ensure the environment was safe. The argument that they didn't think about it because they're an adult doesn't hold up. Parents and guardians are expected to take precautions, especially when hosting a child. \n\nEven if the author didn't intend for the child to access the edibles, the outcome was harmful, and the reaction from the family is understandable. The parents and sister are concerned about the safety of the child. The author's defense that they treat it like wine is flawed because alcohol and edibles have different risks, especially with children. \n\nSo, while the author didn't mean to cause harm, they failed to prevent a foreseeable risk. In legal terms, negligence can be a factor here. The parents' blame and the sister's anger stem from the fact that the author didn't take necessary precautions. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because they didn't secure the edibles, leading to the child's intoxication.\n"
