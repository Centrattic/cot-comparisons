I am a 35 year old woman. For many women, unwinding means a bottle of wine. For me, I prefer to pop an edible or two and relax in front of a paint canvas, my sewing machine, etc.\n\nMy sister's husband had an emergency that resulted in her needing to quickly find a sitter for her 9 year old. I like my niece and obviously wanted to help out my sister, but warned her that she'd probably be bored at my place, since we don't have a lot of kid-friendly stuff.  At one point after she dropped her off with some books, I got up to take a shower. I'm pretty sure this is when it happened.\n\nAbout an hour or so later, I notice niece hadn't said anything for a while. I went over to the couch to see what was up, and she's just staring at the ceiling with one of her books on her stomach. I ask her if she's okay, and I immediately knew something was up. She said \"I ate some of your candy and it made me feel funny.\"\n\nShe had, in fact, eaten several of the sour gummies I had on my dresser. That I hadn't thought to lock up or anything like that because I'm a 35 year old woman who doesn't need to think about those things. Like ever.\n\nI panicked, she seemed fine, I called poison control and called her mom and panicked a lot more. I felt awful. It hadn't even occurred to me that this is a thing that would happen. Honestly, I did not foresee this happening. At all. Niece is completely fine, she ended up falling asleep after asking me for a grilled cheese sandwich with cut up hot dogs in it and asking if we could watch a movie. I stayed with her, kept her hydrated, etc, and apologized at least six million times to my sister, who was horrified and actually screamed at me. Once again, my niece is *fine.*\n\nEven my parents are in on it, blaming me and telling me I should have those things in a safe where no one could get to them, how could I possibly thing it was okay to have them around a child, no one should ever let their kids around me because next time I might give them a beer, etc etc. And I've been uninvited from anywhere that my niece will be, because they think somehow I planned for this to happen.\n\nI feel awful, like I've said a million times, but I really don't think I'm an asshole for this happening. I didn't do this on purpose. I have never needed to lock up my edibles before for the same reason I would never lock up a bottle of wine. When my sister called me in a panic, it wasn't like I thought \"Oh my god, I need to immediately childproof my home!\"\n\nBut am I the asshole here? Do I really deserve what's happening now?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that she has edibles, which are legal in Colorado. She had her 9-year-old niece over because her sister needed a sitter. The niece got into her sour gummies, which were on the dresser and not locked up. The author didn't think to lock them up because she's a responsible adult who doesn't need to worry about such things, similar to how she might leave wine out. Now, her family is blaming her, and she's being called an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. Colorado has specific laws about marijuana products and keeping them out of reach of children. Even though it's legal for adults, there are storage requirements. If she didn't follow those laws, she might be legally at fault. But the question is about whether she's morally wrong or an asshole, not just legally. \n\nThen there's the responsibility aspect. The niece is a child, and the author knew the child was coming over. Even if she didn't think the edibles were dangerous, she should have been aware that children might not understand the risks and could mistake them for candy. Leaving them on a dresser, which is accessible, shows a lack of foresight. \n\nThe author mentioned not having to lock up edibles before, comparing it to wine. But edibles are different because they can be mistaken for regular candy. Wine is not something a child would typically eat, so the comparison might not hold. The author's assumption that she doesn't need to secure edibles because she's a responsible adult might be flawed when a child is present. \n\nHer family's reactions are understandable. The niece being high is a serious situation, even if she ended up okay. The author's own admission of not foreseeing this happening suggests a lack of precaution. Even if she didn't intend harm, the negligence in not securing the edibles could be seen as irresponsible. \n\nHowever, she did act appropriately once it happened: calling poison control, staying with the niece, apologizing, etc. That shows she's not malicious. But the core issue is whether she should have been more cautious. \n\nIn Colorado, there's a law requiring edibles to be stored in a locked container or in a place not accessible to children. If she didn't follow that law, she's legally wrong. Morally, even if the law isn't broken, the responsibility to a child's safety is higher. \n\nSo, while her intentions weren't malicious, her failure to secure the edibles in a child's presence could be seen as negligent, making her at least partially responsible. Therefore, the answer might be A (she's in the wrong), but I need to check if the legal aspect is a factor here. Since the question is about being an asshole and not just legal, the moral responsibility is key. The family's reactions and the potential danger to the child suggest she is in the wrong.\n"
