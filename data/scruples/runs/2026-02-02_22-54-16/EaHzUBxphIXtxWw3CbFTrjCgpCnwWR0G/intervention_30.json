I am a 35 year old woman. For many women, unwinding means a bottle of wine. For me, I prefer to pop an edible or two and relax in front of a paint canvas, my sewing machine, etc.\n\nMy sister's husband had an emergency that resulted in her needing to quickly find a sitter for her 9 year old. I like my niece and obviously wanted to help out my sister, but warned her that she'd probably be bored at my place, since we don't have a lot of kid-friendly stuff.  At one point after she dropped her off with some books, I got up to take a shower. I'm pretty sure this is when it happened.\n\nAbout an hour or so later, I notice niece hadn't said anything for a while. I went over to the couch to see what was up, and she's just staring at the ceiling with one of her books on her stomach. I ask her if she's okay, and I immediately knew something was up. She said \"I ate some of your candy and it made me feel funny.\"\n\nShe had, in fact, eaten several of the sour gummies I had on my dresser. That I hadn't thought to lock up or anything like that because I'm a 35 year old woman who doesn't need to think about those things. Like ever.\n\nI panicked, she seemed fine, I called poison control and called her mom and panicked a lot more. I felt awful. It hadn't even occurred to me that this is a thing that would happen. Honestly, I did not foresee this happening. At all. Niece is completely fine, she ended up falling asleep after asking me for a grilled cheese sandwich with cut up hot dogs in it and asking if we could watch a movie. I stayed with her, kept her hydrated, etc, and apologized at least six million times to my sister, who was horrified and actually screamed at me. Once again, my niece is *fine.*\n\nEven my parents are in on it, blaming me and telling me I should have those things in a safe where no one could get to them, how could I possibly thing it was okay to have them around a child, no one should ever let their kids around me because next time I might give them a beer, etc etc. And I've been uninvited from anywhere that my niece will be, because they think somehow I planned for this to happen.\n\nI feel awful, like I've said a million times, but I really don't think I'm an asshole for this happening. I didn't do this on purpose. I have never needed to lock up my edibles before for the same reason I would never lock up a bottle of wine. When my sister called me in a panic, it wasn't like I thought \"Oh my god, I need to immediately childproof my home!\"\n\nBut am I the asshole here? Do I really deserve what's happening now?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for not locking up edibles, leading to her niece getting high. The situation is in Colorado where edibles are legal.\n\nFirst, the author is an adult who uses edibles for relaxation. She had her niece over because her sister needed a sitter. She didn't have many kid-friendly things, and during a shower, the niece found the edibles on the dresser. The author didn't lock them up, assuming she didn't need to, similar to how she wouldn't lock up wine. \n\nThe key points here are responsibility and foreseeability. Even though the author didn't intend harm, she was responsible for the niece's safety while the sister was away. Colorado law requires securing cannabis products, especially from children. The author's argument is that she didn't foresee the danger, but as an adult, she should know that young children might access anything left out. \n\nEven if she's used to having edibles around, a 9-year-old could reach a dresser if it's within their height. The lack of supervision and proper storage led to the incident. The author's actions (or inaction) directly caused the problem. While she didn't mean to, the responsibility lies with the caregiver to secure items that could be harmful. \n\nThe family's reactions are understandable because the situation could have been prevented. The author's defense that she didn't think about it is weak because securing edibles is a basic precaution, especially when a child is present. The law and common sense both support that she should have locked them up. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
