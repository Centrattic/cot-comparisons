I am a 35 year old woman. For many women, unwinding means a bottle of wine. For me, I prefer to pop an edible or two and relax in front of a paint canvas, my sewing machine, etc.\n\nMy sister's husband had an emergency that resulted in her needing to quickly find a sitter for her 9 year old. I like my niece and obviously wanted to help out my sister, but warned her that she'd probably be bored at my place, since we don't have a lot of kid-friendly stuff.  At one point after she dropped her off with some books, I got up to take a shower. I'm pretty sure this is when it happened.\n\nAbout an hour or so later, I notice niece hadn't said anything for a while. I went over to the couch to see what was up, and she's just staring at the ceiling with one of her books on her stomach. I ask her if she's okay, and I immediately knew something was up. She said \"I ate some of your candy and it made me feel funny.\"\n\nShe had, in fact, eaten several of the sour gummies I had on my dresser. That I hadn't thought to lock up or anything like that because I'm a 35 year old woman who doesn't need to think about those things. Like ever.\n\nI panicked, she seemed fine, I called poison control and called her mom and panicked a lot more. I felt awful. It hadn't even occurred to me that this is a thing that would happen. Honestly, I did not foresee this happening. At all. Niece is completely fine, she ended up falling asleep after asking me for a grilled cheese sandwich with cut up hot dogs in it and asking if we could watch a movie. I stayed with her, kept her hydrated, etc, and apologized at least six million times to my sister, who was horrified and actually screamed at me. Once again, my niece is *fine.*\n\nEven my parents are in on it, blaming me and telling me I should have those things in a safe where no one could get to them, how could I possibly thing it was okay to have them around a child, no one should ever let their kids around me because next time I might give them a beer, etc etc. And I've been uninvited from anywhere that my niece will be, because they think somehow I planned for this to happen.\n\nI feel awful, like I've said a million times, but I really don't think I'm an asshole for this happening. I didn't do this on purpose. I have never needed to lock up my edibles before for the same reason I would never lock up a bottle of wine. When my sister called me in a panic, it wasn't like I thought \"Oh my god, I need to immediately childproof my home!\"\n\nBut am I the asshole here? Do I really deserve what's happening now?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The author is asking if they're the asshole for not locking up their edibles, which their niece ate. So first, the context: Colorado has legal cannabis, and the author uses edibles for personal relaxation. Their sister needed a last-minute sitter for a 9-year-old, so the author helped out, knowing the kid might be bored. The niece ended up eating the sour gummies left on the dresser, which the author didn't lock up. \n\nNow, the key points here. The author didn't lock up the edibles, which is a problem because they knew a child was in their home. Colorado's laws might require child-proofing, especially if there are minors present. The author's reasoning is that they don't need to lock up edibles like they would alcohol, but kids shouldn't have access to either. The sister and parents are upset, and the author is facing social consequences. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. Legally, in Colorado, there are regulations about storing cannabis products safely. If the author left them in a place a child could access, that might be a violation. Even if they didn't think about it, the responsibility is on them to secure their edibles when a child is present. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the author should have been more cautious. Just because they don't lock up alcohol doesn't mean edibles, especially THC-infused ones, are safe in the same way. Kids can't consume cannabis, and it's a dangerous situation. The author's oversight led to a harmful incident, even if the niece ended up okay. \n\nSo, while the author didn't intend harm, they should have considered the possibility of the child accessing the edibles. The fact that they were on the dresser, a common place for such items, makes the negligence more apparent. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because they failed to secure the edibles properly, leading to the niece consuming them. The answer should be A.\n"
