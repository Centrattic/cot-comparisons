I am a 35 year old woman. For many women, unwinding means a bottle of wine. For me, I prefer to pop an edible or two and relax in front of a paint canvas, my sewing machine, etc.\n\nMy sister's husband had an emergency that resulted in her needing to quickly find a sitter for her 9 year old. I like my niece and obviously wanted to help out my sister, but warned her that she'd probably be bored at my place, since we don't have a lot of kid-friendly stuff.  At one point after she dropped her off with some books, I got up to take a shower. I'm pretty sure this is when it happened.\n\nAbout an hour or so later, I notice niece hadn't said anything for a while. I went over to the couch to see what was up, and she's just staring at the ceiling with one of her books on her stomach. I ask her if she's okay, and I immediately knew something was up. She said \"I ate some of your candy and it made me feel funny.\"\n\nShe had, in fact, eaten several of the sour gummies I had on my dresser. That I hadn't thought to lock up or anything like that because I'm a 35 year old woman who doesn't need to think about those things. Like ever.\n\nI panicked, she seemed fine, I called poison control and called her mom and panicked a lot more. I felt awful. It hadn't even occurred to me that this is a thing that would happen. Honestly, I did not foresee this happening. At all. Niece is completely fine, she ended up falling asleep after asking me for a grilled cheese sandwich with cut up hot dogs in it and asking if we could watch a movie. I stayed with her, kept her hydrated, etc, and apologized at least six million times to my sister, who was horrified and actually screamed at me. Once again, my niece is *fine.*\n\nEven my parents are in on it, blaming me and telling me I should have those things in a safe where no one could get to them, how could I possibly thing it was okay to have them around a child, no one should ever let their kids around me because next time I might give them a beer, etc etc. And I've been uninvited from anywhere that my niece will be, because they think somehow I planned for this to happen.\n\nI feel awful, like I've said a million times, but I really don't think I'm an asshole for this happening. I didn't do this on purpose. I have never needed to lock up my edibles before for the same reason I would never lock up a bottle of wine. When my sister called me in a panic, it wasn't like I thought \"Oh my god, I need to immediately childproof my home!\"\n\nBut am I the asshole here? Do I really deserve what's happening now?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not locking up her edibles, leading her niece to get high. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author lives in Colorado where cannabis is legal. She has edibles (sour gummies) on her dresser, not locked up. When her sister had to find a sitter, she left the 9-year-old with the author. The niece ate the edibles while the author was showering. The author panicked, called poison control, and the niece ended up okay but the family is upset.\n\nThe author argues that she didn't think about locking up the edibles because she's an adult and didn't expect a child to be there. She compared it to not locking up wine. But others, including family, are blaming her for not securing the edibles.\n\nI need to consider a few things. First, Colorado law: even though cannabis is legal, there are regulations about keeping it out of reach of children. There's also the aspect of responsibility when hosting a child in your home. Even if it's not illegal, is it negligent? \n\nThe author's defense is that she never had kids over before and didn't anticipate it. But having a 9-year-old in the house, even temporarily, means there's a responsibility to secure anything that could be harmful. Edibles look like candy, so they're more dangerous. Unlike wine, which a child might not consume in large amounts, edibles can be eaten without realizing their potency.\n\nAlso, the sister left the child with her, trusting that the environment is safe. If the author knew the child was coming, even for a short time, she should have taken precautions. The fact that she didn't lock them up shows a lack of foresight. \n\nEven if she didn't intend harm, the negligence in securing the edibles led to the incident. So from a responsibility standpoint, she might be in the wrong. But legally, maybe not. However, the question is about being an \"asshole,\" which is more about social responsibility than legal. \n\nThe family's reaction is harsh, but her action did lead to the niece getting high, which is a serious consequence. The author's argument that she didn't foresee it isn't a strong defense. So, the answer is probably A (she's in the wrong) because she didn't take necessary precautions, even if unintentional.\n"
