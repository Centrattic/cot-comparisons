I am a 35 year old woman. For many women, unwinding means a bottle of wine. For me, I prefer to pop an edible or two and relax in front of a paint canvas, my sewing machine, etc.\n\nMy sister's husband had an emergency that resulted in her needing to quickly find a sitter for her 9 year old. I like my niece and obviously wanted to help out my sister, but warned her that she'd probably be bored at my place, since we don't have a lot of kid-friendly stuff.  At one point after she dropped her off with some books, I got up to take a shower. I'm pretty sure this is when it happened.\n\nAbout an hour or so later, I notice niece hadn't said anything for a while. I went over to the couch to see what was up, and she's just staring at the ceiling with one of her books on her stomach. I ask her if she's okay, and I immediately knew something was up. She said \"I ate some of your candy and it made me feel funny.\"\n\nShe had, in fact, eaten several of the sour gummies I had on my dresser. That I hadn't thought to lock up or anything like that because I'm a 35 year old woman who doesn't need to think about those things. Like ever.\n\nI panicked, she seemed fine, I called poison control and called her mom and panicked a lot more. I felt awful. It hadn't even occurred to me that this is a thing that would happen. Honestly, I did not foresee this happening. At all. Niece is completely fine, she ended up falling asleep after asking me for a grilled cheese sandwich with cut up hot dogs in it and asking if we could watch a movie. I stayed with her, kept her hydrated, etc, and apologized at least six million times to my sister, who was horrified and actually screamed at me. Once again, my niece is *fine.*\n\nEven my parents are in on it, blaming me and telling me I should have those things in a safe where no one could get to them, how could I possibly thing it was okay to have them around a child, no one should ever let their kids around me because next time I might give them a beer, etc etc. And I've been uninvited from anywhere that my niece will be, because they think somehow I planned for this to happen.\n\nI feel awful, like I've said a million times, but I really don't think I'm an asshole for this happening. I didn't do this on purpose. I have never needed to lock up my edibles before for the same reason I would never lock up a bottle of wine. When my sister called me in a panic, it wasn't like I thought \"Oh my god, I need to immediately childproof my home!\"\n\nBut am I the asshole here? Do I really deserve what's happening now?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not locking up edibles, leading their niece to get high. The situation is in Colorado where edibles are legal. The author is an adult who uses edibles for relaxation, and she had a 9-year-old niece stay over while her sister's husband had an emergency.\n\nFirst, the key points here are responsibility and foreseeability. The author didn't lock up the edibles, which a 9-year-old could easily access. Even though the author didn't intend for this to happen, the question is whether leaving edibles out in a place where a child might be is negligent.\n\nEdibles, especially in forms like gummies, can look like candy. It's reasonable to assume a child might try to eat them if they see them. The author mentions not considering the risk because she's an adult who doesn't need to worry about such things. However, when a child is present, even temporarily, the responsibility to secure substances that could harm them increases.\n\nThe sister called in a panic, which suggests the situation was urgent. But the author should have taken basic precautions, like locking up the edibles or keeping them out of reach. The fact that the niece found them on the dresser indicates they were accessible. \n\nWhile the author didn't intend harm and the niece is fine, the lack of foresight is a problem. Parents and guardians are expected to secure items that could be dangerous to children. The author's argument that she treats edibles like wine (which is not a child-accessible item) is weak because wine is not something a child would consume without supervision, but edibles disguised as candy are more tempting and dangerous.\n\nThe family's reaction is harsh, but the author's oversight, even if unintentional, does make her responsible for not securing the edibles. Therefore, she's in the wrong because she didn't take necessary precautions to prevent the child from accessing something harmful.\n"
