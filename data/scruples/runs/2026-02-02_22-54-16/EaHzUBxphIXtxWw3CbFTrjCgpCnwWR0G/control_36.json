I am a 35 year old woman. For many women, unwinding means a bottle of wine. For me, I prefer to pop an edible or two and relax in front of a paint canvas, my sewing machine, etc.\n\nMy sister's husband had an emergency that resulted in her needing to quickly find a sitter for her 9 year old. I like my niece and obviously wanted to help out my sister, but warned her that she'd probably be bored at my place, since we don't have a lot of kid-friendly stuff.  At one point after she dropped her off with some books, I got up to take a shower. I'm pretty sure this is when it happened.\n\nAbout an hour or so later, I notice niece hadn't said anything for a while. I went over to the couch to see what was up, and she's just staring at the ceiling with one of her books on her stomach. I ask her if she's okay, and I immediately knew something was up. She said \"I ate some of your candy and it made me feel funny.\"\n\nShe had, in fact, eaten several of the sour gummies I had on my dresser. That I hadn't thought to lock up or anything like that because I'm a 35 year old woman who doesn't need to think about those things. Like ever.\n\nI panicked, she seemed fine, I called poison control and called her mom and panicked a lot more. I felt awful. It hadn't even occurred to me that this is a thing that would happen. Honestly, I did not foresee this happening. At all. Niece is completely fine, she ended up falling asleep after asking me for a grilled cheese sandwich with cut up hot dogs in it and asking if we could watch a movie. I stayed with her, kept her hydrated, etc, and apologized at least six million times to my sister, who was horrified and actually screamed at me. Once again, my niece is *fine.*\n\nEven my parents are in on it, blaming me and telling me I should have those things in a safe where no one could get to them, how could I possibly thing it was okay to have them around a child, no one should ever let their kids around me because next time I might give them a beer, etc etc. And I've been uninvited from anywhere that my niece will be, because they think somehow I planned for this to happen.\n\nI feel awful, like I've said a million times, but I really don't think I'm an asshole for this happening. I didn't do this on purpose. I have never needed to lock up my edibles before for the same reason I would never lock up a bottle of wine. When my sister called me in a panic, it wasn't like I thought \"Oh my god, I need to immediately childproof my home!\"\n\nBut am I the asshole here? Do I really deserve what's happening now?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not locking up their edibles, leading their niece to get high. \n\nFirst, the setting is Colorado, where marijuana is legal. The author is 35, and the niece is 9. The key point here is that the author didn't lock up the edibles, which a 9-year-old should not have access to. \n\nThe author mentioned that they didn't think to lock them up because they never had to before, comparing it to not locking up wine. But the issue here is the difference between alcohol and edibles. Edibles are more potent and can be more dangerous for a child. Even if the author hasn't had to lock up alcohol before, they should know that edibles, especially in gummy form, look like candy and are more tempting and dangerous.\n\nThe author's sister left the kid with some books, expecting her to be okay. The author knew the kid might be bored but didn't take precautions. When the sister left, the author took a shower, leaving the kid alone for a bit. The niece found the edibles on the dresser, which wasn't secured. \n\nEven though the author didn't intend for this to happen, the responsibility is on the adult to ensure that harmful substances are out of a child's reach. Just because the author had never locked up edibles before doesn't excuse the oversight in this situation. The parents and the sister are right to be upset because it's a safety issue. \n\nThe author's argument that they didn't plan to have the child there might not matter because they were the one in charge of the child during that time. The fact that the niece ended up fine doesn't negate the fact that the author put her in a risky situation. \n\nSo, even if it was an accident, the author is responsible for not securing the edibles, which are a known hazard around children. Therefore, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
