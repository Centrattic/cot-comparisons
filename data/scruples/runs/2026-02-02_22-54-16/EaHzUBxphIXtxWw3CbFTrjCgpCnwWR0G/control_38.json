I am a 35 year old woman. For many women, unwinding means a bottle of wine. For me, I prefer to pop an edible or two and relax in front of a paint canvas, my sewing machine, etc.\n\nMy sister's husband had an emergency that resulted in her needing to quickly find a sitter for her 9 year old. I like my niece and obviously wanted to help out my sister, but warned her that she'd probably be bored at my place, since we don't have a lot of kid-friendly stuff.  At one point after she dropped her off with some books, I got up to take a shower. I'm pretty sure this is when it happened.\n\nAbout an hour or so later, I notice niece hadn't said anything for a while. I went over to the couch to see what was up, and she's just staring at the ceiling with one of her books on her stomach. I ask her if she's okay, and I immediately knew something was up. She said \"I ate some of your candy and it made me feel funny.\"\n\nShe had, in fact, eaten several of the sour gummies I had on my dresser. That I hadn't thought to lock up or anything like that because I'm a 35 year old woman who doesn't need to think about those things. Like ever.\n\nI panicked, she seemed fine, I called poison control and called her mom and panicked a lot more. I felt awful. It hadn't even occurred to me that this is a thing that would happen. Honestly, I did not foresee this happening. At all. Niece is completely fine, she ended up falling asleep after asking me for a grilled cheese sandwich with cut up hot dogs in it and asking if we could watch a movie. I stayed with her, kept her hydrated, etc, and apologized at least six million times to my sister, who was horrified and actually screamed at me. Once again, my niece is *fine.*\n\nEven my parents are in on it, blaming me and telling me I should have those things in a safe where no one could get to them, how could I possibly thing it was okay to have them around a child, no one should ever let their kids around me because next time I might give them a beer, etc etc. And I've been uninvited from anywhere that my niece will be, because they think somehow I planned for this to happen.\n\nI feel awful, like I've said a million times, but I really don't think I'm an asshole for this happening. I didn't do this on purpose. I have never needed to lock up my edibles before for the same reason I would never lock up a bottle of wine. When my sister called me in a panic, it wasn't like I thought \"Oh my god, I need to immediately childproof my home!\"\n\nBut am I the asshole here? Do I really deserve what's happening now?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for not locking up her edibles, leading her niece to get high.\n\nFirst, the setting is Colorado where marijuana is legal. The author is an adult who uses edibles. She offered to babysit her 9-year-old niece when her sister had an emergency. She mentioned her home isn't kid-friendly, which might imply she's aware of potential hazards but didn't take specific precautions here.\n\nThe key issue is child safety. Even though she didn't intend for the child to access the edibles, leaving them on her dresser unsecured could be considered a risk. Parents and caregivers typically childproof homes to prevent accidental ingestion, especially with substances that can have serious effects on children. The author's argument is that she treats edibles like wine, but children aren't adults and can't assess the risks. The parents and family are upset because she didn't take steps to secure the edibles, which is a standard safety measure.\n\nShe panicked when it happened and took action, but the initial oversight is what's being questioned. The law in Colorado might have specific regulations about keeping cannabis products out of reach of children, which could add a legal aspect. Even if unintentional, the responsibility lies with the caregiver to ensure the environment is safe. The fact that her niece didn't have serious effects is fortunate, but the potential for harm was there.\n\nConsidering all this, the author's failure to secure the edibles in a child's presence, despite knowing the child was there and the home wasn't kid-friendly, likely makes her at fault. The answer is probably A (wrong) because she didn't take necessary precautions, even if it was an oversight.\n"
