I am a 35 year old woman. For many women, unwinding means a bottle of wine. For me, I prefer to pop an edible or two and relax in front of a paint canvas, my sewing machine, etc.\n\nMy sister's husband had an emergency that resulted in her needing to quickly find a sitter for her 9 year old. I like my niece and obviously wanted to help out my sister, but warned her that she'd probably be bored at my place, since we don't have a lot of kid-friendly stuff.  At one point after she dropped her off with some books, I got up to take a shower. I'm pretty sure this is when it happened.\n\nAbout an hour or so later, I notice niece hadn't said anything for a while. I went over to the couch to see what was up, and she's just staring at the ceiling with one of her books on her stomach. I ask her if she's okay, and I immediately knew something was up. She said \"I ate some of your candy and it made me feel funny.\"\n\nShe had, in fact, eaten several of the sour gummies I had on my dresser. That I hadn't thought to lock up or anything like that because I'm a 35 year old woman who doesn't need to think about those things. Like ever.\n\nI panicked, she seemed fine, I called poison control and called her mom and panicked a lot more. I felt awful. It hadn't even occurred to me that this is a thing that would happen. Honestly, I did not foresee this happening. At all. Niece is completely fine, she ended up falling asleep after asking me for a grilled cheese sandwich with cut up hot dogs in it and asking if we could watch a movie. I stayed with her, kept her hydrated, etc, and apologized at least six million times to my sister, who was horrified and actually screamed at me. Once again, my niece is *fine.*\n\nEven my parents are in on it, blaming me and telling me I should have those things in a safe where no one could get to them, how could I possibly thing it was okay to have them around a child, no one should ever let their kids around me because next time I might give them a beer, etc etc. And I've been uninvited from anywhere that my niece will be, because they think somehow I planned for this to happen.\n\nI feel awful, like I've said a million times, but I really don't think I'm an asshole for this happening. I didn't do this on purpose. I have never needed to lock up my edibles before for the same reason I would never lock up a bottle of wine. When my sister called me in a panic, it wasn't like I thought \"Oh my god, I need to immediately childproof my home!\"\n\nBut am I the asshole here? Do I really deserve what's happening now?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the author is in the wrong based on the situation described. Let me break this down.\n\nThe author is in Colorado, where recreational marijuana is legal. She has edibles in her home, which she keeps on a dresser. She let her 9-year-old niece stay with her because her sister needed a sitter. The niece ate some of the edibles, got high, and the author is now facing backlash from family.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. Even though it's legal in Colorado, there are laws about keeping cannabis products out of reach of children. Colorado might have specific regulations about storing edibles safely. If the author didn't secure them properly, maybe she violated those laws. That could be a point against her.\n\nNext, the moral aspect. The author didn't lock up the edibles, assuming that as an adult, she didn't need to. But a 9-year-old is naturally curious and might not understand the dangers. The fact that the niece found them easily suggests the author was negligent. Even if it wasn't intentional, the responsibility lies with the adult to secure items that could harm a child.\n\nThe sister and parents are upset because the child was exposed to something dangerous. The author's argument that she doesn't lock up wine might not hold here\u2014alcohol and edibles have different risks. Edibles can be more dangerous for kids, especially in higher doses. The author's lack of foresight is a problem here.\n\nThe immediate reaction of calling poison control and taking care of the niece is commendable, but it doesn't negate the fact that the incident could have been prevented by storing the edibles properly. The family's response is justified because they're concerned for the child's safety. The author's uninvitations might be harsh, but the core issue is her responsibility in securing the edibles when children are present.\n\nSo, even though the author didn't intend harm, the negligence in securing the edibles when she knew a child was present makes her at fault. The answer should be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
