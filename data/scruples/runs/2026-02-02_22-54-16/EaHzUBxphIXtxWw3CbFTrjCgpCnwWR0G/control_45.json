I am a 35 year old woman. For many women, unwinding means a bottle of wine. For me, I prefer to pop an edible or two and relax in front of a paint canvas, my sewing machine, etc.\n\nMy sister's husband had an emergency that resulted in her needing to quickly find a sitter for her 9 year old. I like my niece and obviously wanted to help out my sister, but warned her that she'd probably be bored at my place, since we don't have a lot of kid-friendly stuff.  At one point after she dropped her off with some books, I got up to take a shower. I'm pretty sure this is when it happened.\n\nAbout an hour or so later, I notice niece hadn't said anything for a while. I went over to the couch to see what was up, and she's just staring at the ceiling with one of her books on her stomach. I ask her if she's okay, and I immediately knew something was up. She said \"I ate some of your candy and it made me feel funny.\"\n\nShe had, in fact, eaten several of the sour gummies I had on my dresser. That I hadn't thought to lock up or anything like that because I'm a 35 year old woman who doesn't need to think about those things. Like ever.\n\nI panicked, she seemed fine, I called poison control and called her mom and panicked a lot more. I felt awful. It hadn't even occurred to me that this is a thing that would happen. Honestly, I did not foresee this happening. At all. Niece is completely fine, she ended up falling asleep after asking me for a grilled cheese sandwich with cut up hot dogs in it and asking if we could watch a movie. I stayed with her, kept her hydrated, etc, and apologized at least six million times to my sister, who was horrified and actually screamed at me. Once again, my niece is *fine.*\n\nEven my parents are in on it, blaming me and telling me I should have those things in a safe where no one could get to them, how could I possibly thing it was okay to have them around a child, no one should ever let their kids around me because next time I might give them a beer, etc etc. And I've been uninvited from anywhere that my niece will be, because they think somehow I planned for this to happen.\n\nI feel awful, like I've said a million times, but I really don't think I'm an asshole for this happening. I didn't do this on purpose. I have never needed to lock up my edibles before for the same reason I would never lock up a bottle of wine. When my sister called me in a panic, it wasn't like I thought \"Oh my god, I need to immediately childproof my home!\"\n\nBut am I the asshole here? Do I really deserve what's happening now?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this story is in the wrong. The situation is that the author left edibles (which are legal in Colorado) on her dresser, and her 9-year-old niece ate them. The author didn't lock them up because she thought of them like wine, which adults don't lock up. But since a child accessed them, there's controversy.\n\nFirst, I need to consider Colorado's laws. Colorado legalized recreational marijuana, but there are specific regulations about storing it safely. I think the law requires that cannabis products, including edibles, be kept in child-resistant containers and out of reach of children. If the author left them on a dresser where a child could reach, that might violate the law. Even if she considers edibles like wine, the law might treat them differently because of the potential danger to kids.\n\nNext, the author's responsibility. She's an adult with a 9-year-old niece in her home. Even if she didn't think about the risk before, once she's aware there's a child present, she should take precautions. The sister needed a sitter, so the author knew a child would be there. Leaving edibles accessible could be seen as negligence, especially since there are laws in place to prevent such situations. The fact that she didn't lock them up shows a lack of foresight.\n\nThen, the reactions from family. The sister and parents are upset, which is understandable given the situation. The author's defense is that she didn't think it would happen, but that's not a solid excuse. Parents and guardians are expected to take reasonable steps to protect children in their care. The author might not have intended harm, but the responsibility lies with her for not securing the edibles.\n\nAlso, the consequences: the niece consumed several edibles, which could have been dangerous. Even though she ended up okay, the risk was there. The author's panic and attempts to help after the fact don't negate the initial negligence. It's about preventing the incident, not just reacting to it.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The author didn't secure the edibles properly, which is against Colorado's laws. She should have known that children might access them, especially when hosting a child. Therefore, she is at fault for not taking necessary precautions. The answer is A, yes, she's in the wrong.\n"
