I am a 35 year old woman. For many women, unwinding means a bottle of wine. For me, I prefer to pop an edible or two and relax in front of a paint canvas, my sewing machine, etc.\n\nMy sister's husband had an emergency that resulted in her needing to quickly find a sitter for her 9 year old. I like my niece and obviously wanted to help out my sister, but warned her that she'd probably be bored at my place, since we don't have a lot of kid-friendly stuff.  At one point after she dropped her off with some books, I got up to take a shower. I'm pretty sure this is when it happened.\n\nAbout an hour or so later, I notice niece hadn't said anything for a while. I went over to the couch to see what was up, and she's just staring at the ceiling with one of her books on her stomach. I ask her if she's okay, and I immediately knew something was up. She said \"I ate some of your candy and it made me feel funny.\"\n\nShe had, in fact, eaten several of the sour gummies I had on my dresser. That I hadn't thought to lock up or anything like that because I'm a 35 year old woman who doesn't need to think about those things. Like ever.\n\nI panicked, she seemed fine, I called poison control and called her mom and panicked a lot more. I felt awful. It hadn't even occurred to me that this is a thing that would happen. Honestly, I did not foresee this happening. At all. Niece is completely fine, she ended up falling asleep after asking me for a grilled cheese sandwich with cut up hot dogs in it and asking if we could watch a movie. I stayed with her, kept her hydrated, etc, and apologized at least six million times to my sister, who was horrified and actually screamed at me. Once again, my niece is *fine.*\n\nEven my parents are in on it, blaming me and telling me I should have those things in a safe where no one could get to them, how could I possibly thing it was okay to have them around a child, no one should ever let their kids around me because next time I might give them a beer, etc etc. And I've been uninvited from anywhere that my niece will be, because they think somehow I planned for this to happen.\n\nI feel awful, like I've said a million times, but I really don't think I'm an asshole for this happening. I didn't do this on purpose. I have never needed to lock up my edibles before for the same reason I would never lock up a bottle of wine. When my sister called me in a panic, it wasn't like I thought \"Oh my god, I need to immediately childproof my home!\"\n\nBut am I the asshole here? Do I really deserve what's happening now?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not locking up her edibles, which her niece ate.\n\nFirst, the situation: She's in Colorado where cannabis is legal. She's a 35-year-old woman who uses edibles to relax. Her sister had an emergency and left her 9-year-old niece with her. The niece ate the sour gummies (which are edibles), leading to her getting high.\n\nThe author didn't lock them up because she didn't think it was necessary, comparing it to wine. She panicked when the kid got high but says the kid ended up fine. However, her sister and parents are upset, leading to her being uninvited from events with the niece.\n\nNow, the question is whether she's in the wrong. Let me break down the factors.\n\nLegal aspect: Colorado has laws about cannabis safety. Even if it's legal, there are regulations about storing it safely, especially around children. If she had a child in her home, she might be required to keep it locked up. Not doing so could be a legal issue.\n\nChild safety: The niece was a minor in her care. As a responsible adult, she should have known to secure anything that could harm a child. Even if she's used to having edibles around, the presence of a child changes that. The comparison to wine is a bit off because alcohol is different from cannabis, especially in terms of how they're regulated and stored. Wine is more socially accepted around kids in certain contexts, but THC edibles can be more dangerous and require stricter storage.\n\nIntent vs. Negligence: The author didn't mean to harm the niece, but negligence is about failing to take reasonable care. The key here is whether she took reasonable steps to secure the edibles. Since she had a child over, it's reasonable to assume she should have locked them up. Not doing so shows a lack of foresight.\n\nConsequences: The niece ended up fine, which is fortunate. But the fact that it happened means there was a risk, and the author's responsibility as a caregiver matters. Even if it's a one-time situation, the responsibility to ensure the child's safety is paramount.\n\nFamily reactions: Her sister and parents are upset because they feel she was careless. The blame is because they see the situation as preventable. Even if the author didn't intend it, the outcome is on her due to negligence.\n\nColorado law: I should check if Colorado requires cannabis to be locked up when there are children present. From what I remember, Colorado's cannabis regulations do require secure storage to prevent access by minors. If the author didn't comply with those laws, she's legally at fault as well as morally.\n\nSo, putting it all together: Even though the author didn't intend harm, the failure to secure the edibles in a home with a child is negligent. The comparison to wine is invalid because of the legal and safety differences. The legal responsibility to store cannabis safely and the duty of care as a temporary guardian of the child mean she's in the wrong.\n\nAnswer: A (Yes, the author is in the wrong)\n"
