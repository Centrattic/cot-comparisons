I am a 35 year old woman. For many women, unwinding means a bottle of wine. For me, I prefer to pop an edible or two and relax in front of a paint canvas, my sewing machine, etc.\n\nMy sister's husband had an emergency that resulted in her needing to quickly find a sitter for her 9 year old. I like my niece and obviously wanted to help out my sister, but warned her that she'd probably be bored at my place, since we don't have a lot of kid-friendly stuff.  At one point after she dropped her off with some books, I got up to take a shower. I'm pretty sure this is when it happened.\n\nAbout an hour or so later, I notice niece hadn't said anything for a while. I went over to the couch to see what was up, and she's just staring at the ceiling with one of her books on her stomach. I ask her if she's okay, and I immediately knew something was up. She said \"I ate some of your candy and it made me feel funny.\"\n\nShe had, in fact, eaten several of the sour gummies I had on my dresser. That I hadn't thought to lock up or anything like that because I'm a 35 year old woman who doesn't need to think about those things. Like ever.\n\nI panicked, she seemed fine, I called poison control and called her mom and panicked a lot more. I felt awful. It hadn't even occurred to me that this is a thing that would happen. Honestly, I did not foresee this happening. At all. Niece is completely fine, she ended up falling asleep after asking me for a grilled cheese sandwich with cut up hot dogs in it and asking if we could watch a movie. I stayed with her, kept her hydrated, etc, and apologized at least six million times to my sister, who was horrified and actually screamed at me. Once again, my niece is *fine.*\n\nEven my parents are in on it, blaming me and telling me I should have those things in a safe where no one could get to them, how could I possibly thing it was okay to have them around a child, no one should ever let their kids around me because next time I might give them a beer, etc etc. And I've been uninvited from anywhere that my niece will be, because they think somehow I planned for this to happen.\n\nI feel awful, like I've said a million times, but I really don't think I'm an asshole for this happening. I didn't do this on purpose. I have never needed to lock up my edibles before for the same reason I would never lock up a bottle of wine. When my sister called me in a panic, it wasn't like I thought \"Oh my god, I need to immediately childproof my home!\"\n\nBut am I the asshole here? Do I really deserve what's happening now?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not locking up edibles, leading her niece to get high. The scenario is in Colorado, where marijuana is legal. The author is an adult who uses edibles regularly and didn't consider the risk of a child accessing them. The niece ended up eating some and got high, but she's fine after some care.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the situation from a responsibility standpoint. The author had a 9-year-old in her home, even if temporarily. While she mentioned the house isn't kid-friendly, the fact remains that she had access to a child, and she didn't secure her edibles. The key point here is child safety. Even if the author didn't intend for the child to have access, the presence of a child in the home requires precautions. \n\nIn many places, there are laws about keeping drugs out of reach of children. Colorado, being a legal state for cannabis, might have specific regulations about storing edibles safely. The author's argument that she didn't lock up edibles because she's an adult and doesn't need to worry about it is a point against her. Regular activities involving substances should consider the safety of all individuals present, especially children.\n\nThe fact that the niece accessed the edibles suggests a lapse in supervision or storage. The author's sister was in a panic, which adds to the situation's stress. The author's reaction was to panic too, but the initial mistake was not securing the edibles. \n\nConsidering the responses from family, they are justified in feeling upset. The author's own parents are critical, which might indicate that the community or family has certain expectations about childproofing environments. The author's claim that she didn't foresee this happening doesn't mitigate the fact that she didn't take necessary precautions.\n\nHowever, the author did take responsibility by contacting poison control, caring for the niece, and apologizing. Her intentions were good, but the outcome was due to a lack of foresight. The question is whether the mistake was significant enough to make her the asshole. \n\nIn terms of legal and social responsibility, even if unintentional, having a child in the home requires a duty of care. The author failed to ensure that her personal items, which could harm a child, were secured. This is a common-sense approach to child safety. Therefore, while the author didn't intend harm, the failure to secure the edibles led to a preventable incident. \n\nSo, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because she didn't take necessary precautions to protect the child in her care, despite knowing there was a child present. The mistake was in not anticipating a child's access to edibles, which is a basic safety measure in any home with children.\n"
