I am a 35 year old woman. For many women, unwinding means a bottle of wine. For me, I prefer to pop an edible or two and relax in front of a paint canvas, my sewing machine, etc.\n\nMy sister's husband had an emergency that resulted in her needing to quickly find a sitter for her 9 year old. I like my niece and obviously wanted to help out my sister, but warned her that she'd probably be bored at my place, since we don't have a lot of kid-friendly stuff.  At one point after she dropped her off with some books, I got up to take a shower. I'm pretty sure this is when it happened.\n\nAbout an hour or so later, I notice niece hadn't said anything for a while. I went over to the couch to see what was up, and she's just staring at the ceiling with one of her books on her stomach. I ask her if she's okay, and I immediately knew something was up. She said \"I ate some of your candy and it made me feel funny.\"\n\nShe had, in fact, eaten several of the sour gummies I had on my dresser. That I hadn't thought to lock up or anything like that because I'm a 35 year old woman who doesn't need to think about those things. Like ever.\n\nI panicked, she seemed fine, I called poison control and called her mom and panicked a lot more. I felt awful. It hadn't even occurred to me that this is a thing that would happen. Honestly, I did not foresee this happening. At all. Niece is completely fine, she ended up falling asleep after asking me for a grilled cheese sandwich with cut up hot dogs in it and asking if we could watch a movie. I stayed with her, kept her hydrated, etc, and apologized at least six million times to my sister, who was horrified and actually screamed at me. Once again, my niece is *fine.*\n\nEven my parents are in on it, blaming me and telling me I should have those things in a safe where no one could get to them, how could I possibly thing it was okay to have them around a child, no one should ever let their kids around me because next time I might give them a beer, etc etc. And I've been uninvited from anywhere that my niece will be, because they think somehow I planned for this to happen.\n\nI feel awful, like I've said a million times, but I really don't think I'm an asshole for this happening. I didn't do this on purpose. I have never needed to lock up my edibles before for the same reason I would never lock up a bottle of wine. When my sister called me in a panic, it wasn't like I thought \"Oh my god, I need to immediately childproof my home!\"\n\nBut am I the asshole here? Do I really deserve what's happening now?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for not locking up her edibles, which led her niece to get high.\n\nFirst, the author is in Colorado where cannabis is legal. She's a 35-year-old who uses edibles for relaxation. Her sister asked her to watch her 9-year-old niece because of an emergency. The author warned her sister that the niece might get bored but agreed to take her in. The niece ended up eating the sour gummies from the dresser, which the author hadn't locked. The author didn't foresee this happening and was shocked. She took immediate action by calling poison control and her sister, and the niece ended up fine. However, the family is blaming her, saying she should have locked up the edibles.\n\nThe key points here are: 1) Did the author have a duty to secure the edibles when a child was present? 2) Was her oversight reasonable? 3) Are there any laws or regulations requiring secure storage of cannabis products around children?\n\nIn Colorado, as in many places with legal cannabis, there are laws about storing cannabis products safely to prevent access by children or pets. For example, Colorado law requires that cannabis products be stored in a child-resistant container and out of reach of children. However, the author may not have known this law, or she might have thought that since she's an adult, it's not necessary. But legally, even if the intention was good, the storage might not have met the legal requirements.\n\nFrom a responsibility standpoint, when someone is caring for a child in their home, they should take reasonable precautions to ensure the child's safety. This includes securing all potentially dangerous items, not just obvious ones like cleaning products or medications. Edibles, which can be mistaken for regular candy, especially by a child, should be stored securely. The author's argument that she treats edibles like wine is a bit problematic because wine is not as immediately dangerous to a child in the same way. Edibles can have more severe effects if ingested by a child, leading to potential medical emergencies.\n\nThe author's reaction after the incident\u2014calling poison control, staying with the niece, apologizing\u2014shows she took the situation seriously. However, the initial oversight is where the problem lies. The fact that she didn't lock up the edibles despite knowing they were in a place accessible to the niece (the dresser) suggests a lack of precaution. Even if she didn't think it was a possibility, as a responsible adult, securing items that can harm children is a necessary step when they are present in the home.\n\nThe family's reaction, while harsh, is based on the concern for the child's safety. The author's defense that she didn't plan for this to happen doesn't mitigate the fact that she should have anticipated the risk. The situation could have been much worse if the niece hadn't been fine. \n\nLegally and ethically, the author might be seen as negligent for not securing the edibles, especially since Colorado has specific storage laws. Even if not criminal, it's a safety issue. So, while she didn't intend harm, the responsibility to secure potentially dangerous items when a child is present is on her. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
