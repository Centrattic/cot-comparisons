I am a 35 year old woman. For many women, unwinding means a bottle of wine. For me, I prefer to pop an edible or two and relax in front of a paint canvas, my sewing machine, etc.\n\nMy sister's husband had an emergency that resulted in her needing to quickly find a sitter for her 9 year old. I like my niece and obviously wanted to help out my sister, but warned her that she'd probably be bored at my place, since we don't have a lot of kid-friendly stuff.  At one point after she dropped her off with some books, I got up to take a shower. I'm pretty sure this is when it happened.\n\nAbout an hour or so later, I notice niece hadn't said anything for a while. I went over to the couch to see what was up, and she's just staring at the ceiling with one of her books on her stomach. I ask her if she's okay, and I immediately knew something was up. She said \"I ate some of your candy and it made me feel funny.\"\n\nShe had, in fact, eaten several of the sour gummies I had on my dresser. That I hadn't thought to lock up or anything like that because I'm a 35 year old woman who doesn't need to think about those things. Like ever.\n\nI panicked, she seemed fine, I called poison control and called her mom and panicked a lot more. I felt awful. It hadn't even occurred to me that this is a thing that would happen. Honestly, I did not foresee this happening. At all. Niece is completely fine, she ended up falling asleep after asking me for a grilled cheese sandwich with cut up hot dogs in it and asking if we could watch a movie. I stayed with her, kept her hydrated, etc, and apologized at least six million times to my sister, who was horrified and actually screamed at me. Once again, my niece is *fine.*\n\nEven my parents are in on it, blaming me and telling me I should have those things in a safe where no one could get to them, how could I possibly thing it was okay to have them around a child, no one should ever let their kids around me because next time I might give them a beer, etc etc. And I've been uninvited from anywhere that my niece will be, because they think somehow I planned for this to happen.\n\nI feel awful, like I've said a million times, but I really don't think I'm an asshole for this happening. I didn't do this on purpose. I have never needed to lock up my edibles before for the same reason I would never lock up a bottle of wine. When my sister called me in a panic, it wasn't like I thought \"Oh my god, I need to immediately childproof my home!\"\n\nBut am I the asshole here? Do I really deserve what's happening now?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author left edibles unlocked, and their niece ate some, got high, but is now fine. The author is defending their actions by comparing it to not needing to lock up wine, but others are blaming her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. Colorado has laws about cannabis products, especially around children. I remember that in states where cannabis is legal, there are strict storage requirements to prevent access by minors. If the author didn't follow those laws, they could be at fault legally. But the question is about moral or ethical wrongness, not just legal.\n\nThen there's the practical side. The author is an adult with a 9-year-old niece. Even if they didn't think the child would find the edibles, the responsibility is on the caregiver to secure items that could harm a child. Edibles, especially in candy form, are attractive to kids. The author admitted they didn't lock them up because they didn't think about it, which is a common excuse but doesn't absolve them of responsibility.\n\nComparing it to wine isn't fair. Wine is alcohol, which is legal for adults and not typically disguised as candy. Edibles, especially those looking like candy, are much more dangerous for kids. The author's sister trusted them to watch the child, and the author failed to secure a hazardous item. Even if it was an accident, the oversight is significant.\n\nThe backlash from family is harsh, but the author's mistake was leaving edibles accessible. They should have known better, especially with a child present. The fact that the niece ended up fine doesn't negate the responsibility to prevent such an incident. The author's argument that they didn't plan for this is valid, but responsibility lies in taking precautions regardless of expectations.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the author is in the wrong. They didn't take necessary precautions, leading to a preventable situation. The answer should be A.\n"
