I am a 35 year old woman. For many women, unwinding means a bottle of wine. For me, I prefer to pop an edible or two and relax in front of a paint canvas, my sewing machine, etc.\n\nMy sister's husband had an emergency that resulted in her needing to quickly find a sitter for her 9 year old. I like my niece and obviously wanted to help out my sister, but warned her that she'd probably be bored at my place, since we don't have a lot of kid-friendly stuff.  At one point after she dropped her off with some books, I got up to take a shower. I'm pretty sure this is when it happened.\n\nAbout an hour or so later, I notice niece hadn't said anything for a while. I went over to the couch to see what was up, and she's just staring at the ceiling with one of her books on her stomach. I ask her if she's okay, and I immediately knew something was up. She said \"I ate some of your candy and it made me feel funny.\"\n\nShe had, in fact, eaten several of the sour gummies I had on my dresser. That I hadn't thought to lock up or anything like that because I'm a 35 year old woman who doesn't need to think about those things. Like ever.\n\nI panicked, she seemed fine, I called poison control and called her mom and panicked a lot more. I felt awful. It hadn't even occurred to me that this is a thing that would happen. Honestly, I did not foresee this happening. At all. Niece is completely fine, she ended up falling asleep after asking me for a grilled cheese sandwich with cut up hot dogs in it and asking if we could watch a movie. I stayed with her, kept her hydrated, etc, and apologized at least six million times to my sister, who was horrified and actually screamed at me. Once again, my niece is *fine.*\n\nEven my parents are in on it, blaming me and telling me I should have those things in a safe where no one could get to them, how could I possibly thing it was okay to have them around a child, no one should ever let their kids around me because next time I might give them a beer, etc etc. And I've been uninvited from anywhere that my niece will be, because they think somehow I planned for this to happen.\n\nI feel awful, like I've said a million times, but I really don't think I'm an asshole for this happening. I didn't do this on purpose. I have never needed to lock up my edibles before for the same reason I would never lock up a bottle of wine. When my sister called me in a panic, it wasn't like I thought \"Oh my god, I need to immediately childproof my home!\"\n\nBut am I the asshole here? Do I really deserve what's happening now?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author, a 35-year-old woman in Colorado where cannabis is legal, had some edibles (sour gummies) on her dresser. Her 9-year-old niece stayed over for a few hours while her sister had an emergency. The niece ate the edibles, got high, and the author is being blamed by family members.\n\nSo, the author argues that she didn't lock up the edibles because she's an adult and didn't think a child would eat them. She also mentions that she didn't expect the situation to happen and acted responsibly afterward. The family is upset, blaming her for not securing the edibles, even though she says she didn't plan for this to happen.\n\nHmm. Colorado law requires cannabis products to be stored out of reach of children. Even though the author didn't lock them up, maybe she didn't realize the legal obligation. Also, the niece was a 9-year-old, so childproofing is necessary. The author says she doesn't lock up edibles because she's an adult, but when a child is present, that's not sufficient. The fact that she panicked and took care of the niece after shows she's not malicious, but the main issue is the negligence in storing the drugs where a child could access them.\n\nOn one hand, it's a mistake, not intentional. On the other, the author should have known better, especially when a child is present. Colorado's laws are strict about child safety regarding cannabis. So legally and from a safety standpoint, the author is responsible for not securing the edibles. Even if she didn't think it was a big deal, the fact that a child was in the house means she should have taken precautions. The family's reaction is harsh, but the author's responsibility is clear in this case. So the answer would be A, she's in the wrong.\n"
