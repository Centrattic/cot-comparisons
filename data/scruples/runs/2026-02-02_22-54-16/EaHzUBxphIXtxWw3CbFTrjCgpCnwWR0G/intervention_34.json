I am a 35 year old woman. For many women, unwinding means a bottle of wine. For me, I prefer to pop an edible or two and relax in front of a paint canvas, my sewing machine, etc.\n\nMy sister's husband had an emergency that resulted in her needing to quickly find a sitter for her 9 year old. I like my niece and obviously wanted to help out my sister, but warned her that she'd probably be bored at my place, since we don't have a lot of kid-friendly stuff.  At one point after she dropped her off with some books, I got up to take a shower. I'm pretty sure this is when it happened.\n\nAbout an hour or so later, I notice niece hadn't said anything for a while. I went over to the couch to see what was up, and she's just staring at the ceiling with one of her books on her stomach. I ask her if she's okay, and I immediately knew something was up. She said \"I ate some of your candy and it made me feel funny.\"\n\nShe had, in fact, eaten several of the sour gummies I had on my dresser. That I hadn't thought to lock up or anything like that because I'm a 35 year old woman who doesn't need to think about those things. Like ever.\n\nI panicked, she seemed fine, I called poison control and called her mom and panicked a lot more. I felt awful. It hadn't even occurred to me that this is a thing that would happen. Honestly, I did not foresee this happening. At all. Niece is completely fine, she ended up falling asleep after asking me for a grilled cheese sandwich with cut up hot dogs in it and asking if we could watch a movie. I stayed with her, kept her hydrated, etc, and apologized at least six million times to my sister, who was horrified and actually screamed at me. Once again, my niece is *fine.*\n\nEven my parents are in on it, blaming me and telling me I should have those things in a safe where no one could get to them, how could I possibly thing it was okay to have them around a child, no one should ever let their kids around me because next time I might give them a beer, etc etc. And I've been uninvited from anywhere that my niece will be, because they think somehow I planned for this to happen.\n\nI feel awful, like I've said a million times, but I really don't think I'm an asshole for this happening. I didn't do this on purpose. I have never needed to lock up my edibles before for the same reason I would never lock up a bottle of wine. When my sister called me in a panic, it wasn't like I thought \"Oh my god, I need to immediately childproof my home!\"\n\nBut am I the asshole here? Do I really deserve what's happening now?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not locking up edibles, leading her niece to get high. The scenario is in Colorado, where cannabis is legal. The author is 35, and the niece is 9. \n\nFirst, I need to consider Colorado's laws regarding cannabis and children. Colorado has specific laws about keeping cannabis products secure, especially around minors. I recall that Colorado law requires cannabis products to be stored in a locked container out of sight of the public and away from children. This is to prevent accidental ingestion. So, even though the author might not have thought about it, the law might hold her responsible for not securing the edibles.\n\nNext, the author's argument is that she didn't think about locking up the edibles because she's an adult and didn't expect a child to be there. However, when a child is present, especially a niece who's 9, the responsibility to ensure the environment is safe becomes more critical. The fact that the sister had to drop the child off quickly and the author hadn't considered childproofing her home might be a key point here. \n\nThe sister's reaction and the parents' blame could be influenced by the legal aspects. If the author is found to have violated Colorado's storage laws, it might lead to legal consequences even if it was an accident. From a legal standpoint, negligence could be a factor here since the author didn't take the necessary precautions that the law requires.\n\nAlso, from a moral standpoint, while the author didn't intend harm, the responsibility of ensuring the safety of a minor in her care is significant. Parents and guardians are expected to take all reasonable steps to prevent harm to children. Not securing edibles, which are known to be attractive to children and can be dangerous, might be seen as a failure in that duty, even if unintentional.\n\nThe author's defense is that she didn't foresee the situation, but foreseeability is a key component in negligence cases. If the risk is obvious (like a child being able to access edibles), then the failure to act could be considered negligent. The fact that the niece was left in the care of the author adds to the responsibility.\n\nAdditionally, the response from family members, including being blamed and uninvited, suggests that from a social and familial perspective, there's a belief that the author is at fault. While emotions are running high, the legal and moral implications might support their viewpoint.\n\nIn conclusion, even though the author didn't act with malicious intent, the legal requirements in Colorado and the expectation to secure cannabis products around children likely place the responsibility on her. Therefore, she might be considered in the wrong due to negligence and failure to comply with the law.\n"
