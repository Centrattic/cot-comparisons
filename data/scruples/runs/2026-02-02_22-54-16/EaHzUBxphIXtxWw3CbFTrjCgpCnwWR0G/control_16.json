I am a 35 year old woman. For many women, unwinding means a bottle of wine. For me, I prefer to pop an edible or two and relax in front of a paint canvas, my sewing machine, etc.\n\nMy sister's husband had an emergency that resulted in her needing to quickly find a sitter for her 9 year old. I like my niece and obviously wanted to help out my sister, but warned her that she'd probably be bored at my place, since we don't have a lot of kid-friendly stuff.  At one point after she dropped her off with some books, I got up to take a shower. I'm pretty sure this is when it happened.\n\nAbout an hour or so later, I notice niece hadn't said anything for a while. I went over to the couch to see what was up, and she's just staring at the ceiling with one of her books on her stomach. I ask her if she's okay, and I immediately knew something was up. She said \"I ate some of your candy and it made me feel funny.\"\n\nShe had, in fact, eaten several of the sour gummies I had on my dresser. That I hadn't thought to lock up or anything like that because I'm a 35 year old woman who doesn't need to think about those things. Like ever.\n\nI panicked, she seemed fine, I called poison control and called her mom and panicked a lot more. I felt awful. It hadn't even occurred to me that this is a thing that would happen. Honestly, I did not foresee this happening. At all. Niece is completely fine, she ended up falling asleep after asking me for a grilled cheese sandwich with cut up hot dogs in it and asking if we could watch a movie. I stayed with her, kept her hydrated, etc, and apologized at least six million times to my sister, who was horrified and actually screamed at me. Once again, my niece is *fine.*\n\nEven my parents are in on it, blaming me and telling me I should have those things in a safe where no one could get to them, how could I possibly thing it was okay to have them around a child, no one should ever let their kids around me because next time I might give them a beer, etc etc. And I've been uninvited from anywhere that my niece will be, because they think somehow I planned for this to happen.\n\nI feel awful, like I've said a million times, but I really don't think I'm an asshole for this happening. I didn't do this on purpose. I have never needed to lock up my edibles before for the same reason I would never lock up a bottle of wine. When my sister called me in a panic, it wasn't like I thought \"Oh my god, I need to immediately childproof my home!\"\n\nBut am I the asshole here? Do I really deserve what's happening now?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that she had edibles in her home, didn't lock them up, and her 9-year-old niece ate some, getting high. The author is in Colorado where cannabis is legal, and she's being criticized by family for not securing the edibles.\n\nFirst, the key points: The author is an adult who uses edibles for relaxation, similar to how some people might drink wine. She had her niece stay over because her sister needed a sitter. She warned her sister the niece might be bored, but didn't think about the edibles being a risk. The niece found the gummies on the dresser and ate them. The author didn't lock them up, thinking it unnecessary since they're legal and she's a responsible adult. Now her sister and parents are blaming her, and she's uninvited from family events.\n\nSo, the question is whether she's at fault. Legally, in Colorado, it's legal to possess cannabis, but there are regulations about keeping it secure, especially around children. For example, Colorado law requires cannabis products to be stored safely to prevent access by minors. If the author didn't follow those laws, she could be legally liable, even unintentionally. The parents might argue that she should have known the risk of having edibles accessible, regardless of her own habits. Her sister might feel violated or responsible for the incident. The author's own parents are criticizing her, which adds to the emotional impact.\n\nOn the other hand, the author claims she didn't foresee the incident and that her home isn't typically childproofed. She panicked and took care of the niece. But maybe the issue is that she should have been more cautious, even if she's used to her own environment. The fact that the parents are upset and have taken the stance that she's untrustworthy around their child suggests that her actions caused significant harm. Even if it was an accident, the lack of precaution could be considered negligence in the eyes of others, especially given the potential danger of edibles to a child.\n\nEdibles can be more hazardous than other forms of cannabis because they're food-like, and the effects can be more severe or prolonged in kids. The author might not have considered that the niece could be more sensitive or that the dosage was a problem. The advice from poison control might have been helpful, but the family's reactions are based on the idea that she should have prevented it. It's possible that her own habits didn't account for the child's presence, even if brief. The moral here is about responsibility when hosting a child, regardless of the legality. So even though she didn't mean to, she may be in the wrong because she didn't take necessary precautions to protect the child from something that could cause harm, even if it's legal.\n"
