I am a 35 year old woman. For many women, unwinding means a bottle of wine. For me, I prefer to pop an edible or two and relax in front of a paint canvas, my sewing machine, etc.\n\nMy sister's husband had an emergency that resulted in her needing to quickly find a sitter for her 9 year old. I like my niece and obviously wanted to help out my sister, but warned her that she'd probably be bored at my place, since we don't have a lot of kid-friendly stuff.  At one point after she dropped her off with some books, I got up to take a shower. I'm pretty sure this is when it happened.\n\nAbout an hour or so later, I notice niece hadn't said anything for a while. I went over to the couch to see what was up, and she's just staring at the ceiling with one of her books on her stomach. I ask her if she's okay, and I immediately knew something was up. She said \"I ate some of your candy and it made me feel funny.\"\n\nShe had, in fact, eaten several of the sour gummies I had on my dresser. That I hadn't thought to lock up or anything like that because I'm a 35 year old woman who doesn't need to think about those things. Like ever.\n\nI panicked, she seemed fine, I called poison control and called her mom and panicked a lot more. I felt awful. It hadn't even occurred to me that this is a thing that would happen. Honestly, I did not foresee this happening. At all. Niece is completely fine, she ended up falling asleep after asking me for a grilled cheese sandwich with cut up hot dogs in it and asking if we could watch a movie. I stayed with her, kept her hydrated, etc, and apologized at least six million times to my sister, who was horrified and actually screamed at me. Once again, my niece is *fine.*\n\nEven my parents are in on it, blaming me and telling me I should have those things in a safe where no one could get to them, how could I possibly thing it was okay to have them around a child, no one should ever let their kids around me because next time I might give them a beer, etc etc. And I've been uninvited from anywhere that my niece will be, because they think somehow I planned for this to happen.\n\nI feel awful, like I've said a million times, but I really don't think I'm an asshole for this happening. I didn't do this on purpose. I have never needed to lock up my edibles before for the same reason I would never lock up a bottle of wine. When my sister called me in a panic, it wasn't like I thought \"Oh my god, I need to immediately childproof my home!\"\n\nBut am I the asshole here? Do I really deserve what's happening now?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves the author not locking up their edibles, which led to their 9-year-old niece getting high after eating some sour gummies.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal context. The author lives in Colorado where recreational cannabis is legal, but there are regulations about storing cannabis products safely. Even though the author didn't lock up the edibles because they thought they were safe, similar to how they'd leave wine around, the product was accessible to a child. Colorado law likely requires proper storage to prevent access by minors. So, from a legal standpoint, the author might have violated storage laws.\n\nNext, the social context. The author had the niece over for a few hours because the sister needed a sitter. The author warned the sister that the place wasn't kid-friendly, but left the edibles out. Even if the author didn't think about it beforehand, once a child is in the home, the responsibility to secure any potentially harmful substances increases. Leaving edibles within reach of a child, regardless of the author's previous habits, could be seen as negligent. Parents and caregivers are generally expected to take extra precautions when children are present.\n\nThe emotional response from the sister and parents suggests that they feel betrayed or unsafe. The author's explanation that they never locked things up before because they didn't think about it might not absolve them of responsibility. The key point is that the niece had access because the edibles weren't secured, leading to harm. Even if unintended, the outcome was foreseeable in hindsight. The author's lack of foresight in this situation could be considered a failure to exercise reasonable care, which is a key component in determining negligence.\n\nHowever, the author is not a malicious person; they acted out of care for their sister but overlooked the risk. The question is whether the action (not securing edibles) was a reasonable oversight. Given that the product was in a place accessible to a child, even if it was the author's own home, it's a matter of safety protocols. Many people might argue that as a responsible adult, especially when hosting a child, securing edibles is necessary. \n\nOn the other hand, the author didn't have a history of such incidents and might not have considered the risk. But the consequences were significant, and the parents are within their rights to be upset and take measures like uninviting the author to protect their child. The author's actions, while not malicious, led to a preventable situation where a child ingested something she shouldn't have.\n\nSo, balancing legal responsibility, social expectations, and the outcome, the author likely is at fault for not taking necessary precautions to secure the edibles when a child was present. Even if it wasn't intentional, the negligence in not securing the substances could be seen as the author being in the wrong.\n"
