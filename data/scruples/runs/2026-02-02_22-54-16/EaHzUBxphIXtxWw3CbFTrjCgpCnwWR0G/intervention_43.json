I am a 35 year old woman. For many women, unwinding means a bottle of wine. For me, I prefer to pop an edible or two and relax in front of a paint canvas, my sewing machine, etc.\n\nMy sister's husband had an emergency that resulted in her needing to quickly find a sitter for her 9 year old. I like my niece and obviously wanted to help out my sister, but warned her that she'd probably be bored at my place, since we don't have a lot of kid-friendly stuff.  At one point after she dropped her off with some books, I got up to take a shower. I'm pretty sure this is when it happened.\n\nAbout an hour or so later, I notice niece hadn't said anything for a while. I went over to the couch to see what was up, and she's just staring at the ceiling with one of her books on her stomach. I ask her if she's okay, and I immediately knew something was up. She said \"I ate some of your candy and it made me feel funny.\"\n\nShe had, in fact, eaten several of the sour gummies I had on my dresser. That I hadn't thought to lock up or anything like that because I'm a 35 year old woman who doesn't need to think about those things. Like ever.\n\nI panicked, she seemed fine, I called poison control and called her mom and panicked a lot more. I felt awful. It hadn't even occurred to me that this is a thing that would happen. Honestly, I did not foresee this happening. At all. Niece is completely fine, she ended up falling asleep after asking me for a grilled cheese sandwich with cut up hot dogs in it and asking if we could watch a movie. I stayed with her, kept her hydrated, etc, and apologized at least six million times to my sister, who was horrified and actually screamed at me. Once again, my niece is *fine.*\n\nEven my parents are in on it, blaming me and telling me I should have those things in a safe where no one could get to them, how could I possibly thing it was okay to have them around a child, no one should ever let their kids around me because next time I might give them a beer, etc etc. And I've been uninvited from anywhere that my niece will be, because they think somehow I planned for this to happen.\n\nI feel awful, like I've said a million times, but I really don't think I'm an asshole for this happening. I didn't do this on purpose. I have never needed to lock up my edibles before for the same reason I would never lock up a bottle of wine. When my sister called me in a panic, it wasn't like I thought \"Oh my god, I need to immediately childproof my home!\"\n\nBut am I the asshole here? Do I really deserve what's happening now?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let's start by breaking down the situation. The author is a 35-year-old woman in Colorado where cannabis is legal. She has edibles, specifically sour gummies, on her dresser. Her sister drops off her 9-year-old niece because of an emergency. The author warned her sister the niece might get bored, and she took a shower. The niece ate the edibles and got high. The author panicked, called poison control, took care of the niece, and apologized. Her family is upset, blaming her for not locking up the edibles, and she's been uninvited from events with the niece.\n\nFirst, the key issue here is whether the author was negligent in not securing the edibles. Colorado has laws about keeping cannabis products out of reach of children. The author's sister brought the child into her home, and the edibles were left on the dresser. The author might not have considered the risk before, but once a child is present, the responsibility to secure such items increases. \n\nThe author argues that she doesn't lock up edibles like she would wine, but alcohol and cannabis are different in terms of accessibility to children. Even though the child was not supposed to be there for an extended period, the fact that she had access to the edibles on the dresser is a problem. \n\nFrom a legal standpoint in Colorado, there are child-resistant packaging and storage requirements. If the author didn't follow these, she could be at fault. Morally, even if it wasn't intentional, the failure to secure the edibles led to the niece getting high. The family's reaction is understandable because they might see this as a preventable accident. \n\nHowever, the author didn't intend for it to happen and took immediate action. The niece was unharmed, so the outcome wasn't the worst. But the responsibility of keeping substances away from children is significant. The author might have underestimated the risk when a child was present, even if it was a last-minute arrangement. \n\nSo, while the author's intentions were good and it was an accident, the negligence in not securing the edibles could make her at least partially responsible. The answer might depend on whether the storage was compliant with local laws and the standard of care expected when a child is present in the home.\n"
