I am a 35 year old woman. For many women, unwinding means a bottle of wine. For me, I prefer to pop an edible or two and relax in front of a paint canvas, my sewing machine, etc.\n\nMy sister's husband had an emergency that resulted in her needing to quickly find a sitter for her 9 year old. I like my niece and obviously wanted to help out my sister, but warned her that she'd probably be bored at my place, since we don't have a lot of kid-friendly stuff.  At one point after she dropped her off with some books, I got up to take a shower. I'm pretty sure this is when it happened.\n\nAbout an hour or so later, I notice niece hadn't said anything for a while. I went over to the couch to see what was up, and she's just staring at the ceiling with one of her books on her stomach. I ask her if she's okay, and I immediately knew something was up. She said \"I ate some of your candy and it made me feel funny.\"\n\nShe had, in fact, eaten several of the sour gummies I had on my dresser. That I hadn't thought to lock up or anything like that because I'm a 35 year old woman who doesn't need to think about those things. Like ever.\n\nI panicked, she seemed fine, I called poison control and called her mom and panicked a lot more. I felt awful. It hadn't even occurred to me that this is a thing that would happen. Honestly, I did not foresee this happening. At all. Niece is completely fine, she ended up falling asleep after asking me for a grilled cheese sandwich with cut up hot dogs in it and asking if we could watch a movie. I stayed with her, kept her hydrated, etc, and apologized at least six million times to my sister, who was horrified and actually screamed at me. Once again, my niece is *fine.*\n\nEven my parents are in on it, blaming me and telling me I should have those things in a safe where no one could get to them, how could I possibly thing it was okay to have them around a child, no one should ever let their kids around me because next time I might give them a beer, etc etc. And I've been uninvited from anywhere that my niece will be, because they think somehow I planned for this to happen.\n\nI feel awful, like I've said a million times, but I really don't think I'm an asshole for this happening. I didn't do this on purpose. I have never needed to lock up my edibles before for the same reason I would never lock up a bottle of wine. When my sister called me in a panic, it wasn't like I thought \"Oh my god, I need to immediately childproof my home!\"\n\nBut am I the asshole here? Do I really deserve what's happening now?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author's niece getting high from eating edibles that weren't locked up. The author is in Colorado where marijuana is legal.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. Colorado has laws about keeping edibles out of reach of children. Even though the author didn't think about it, maybe there's a legal requirement to secure such items. The author is an adult who had the responsibility, so maybe they should have known better.\n\nThen, the ethical side. The author had a 9-year-old in their care. Children can be curious, so leaving edibles accessible might be negligent. Even if the author didn't intend for it to happen, the lack of precaution could be seen as careless. The fact that the niece ended up high, despite being okay, might be considered a preventable situation.\n\nThe author's own reasoning is that they didn't think about the risk, comparing it to not needing to lock up wine. But alcohol and edibles have different risks with children. Maybe that comparison isn't fair because the effects of edibles can be more severe or unpredictable in kids.\n\nFamily reactions are harsh, but the author is taking responsibility. However, the main question is about being in the wrong. If the author didn't take necessary precautions, even unintentionally, they might be at fault. Colorado's laws likely require child-proofing, so not doing so could be the author's responsibility.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer might lean towards A (yes, the author is in the wrong) because they didn't secure the edibles appropriately, leading to an avoidable incident. Even if it was an oversight, the responsibility to prevent harm to a child might make them at fault.\n"
