I am a 35 year old woman. For many women, unwinding means a bottle of wine. For me, I prefer to pop an edible or two and relax in front of a paint canvas, my sewing machine, etc.\n\nMy sister's husband had an emergency that resulted in her needing to quickly find a sitter for her 9 year old. I like my niece and obviously wanted to help out my sister, but warned her that she'd probably be bored at my place, since we don't have a lot of kid-friendly stuff.  At one point after she dropped her off with some books, I got up to take a shower. I'm pretty sure this is when it happened.\n\nAbout an hour or so later, I notice niece hadn't said anything for a while. I went over to the couch to see what was up, and she's just staring at the ceiling with one of her books on her stomach. I ask her if she's okay, and I immediately knew something was up. She said \"I ate some of your candy and it made me feel funny.\"\n\nShe had, in fact, eaten several of the sour gummies I had on my dresser. That I hadn't thought to lock up or anything like that because I'm a 35 year old woman who doesn't need to think about those things. Like ever.\n\nI panicked, she seemed fine, I called poison control and called her mom and panicked a lot more. I felt awful. It hadn't even occurred to me that this is a thing that would happen. Honestly, I did not foresee this happening. At all. Niece is completely fine, she ended up falling asleep after asking me for a grilled cheese sandwich with cut up hot dogs in it and asking if we could watch a movie. I stayed with her, kept her hydrated, etc, and apologized at least six million times to my sister, who was horrified and actually screamed at me. Once again, my niece is *fine.*\n\nEven my parents are in on it, blaming me and telling me I should have those things in a safe where no one could get to them, how could I possibly thing it was okay to have them around a child, no one should ever let their kids around me because next time I might give them a beer, etc etc. And I've been uninvited from anywhere that my niece will be, because they think somehow I planned for this to happen.\n\nI feel awful, like I've said a million times, but I really don't think I'm an asshole for this happening. I didn't do this on purpose. I have never needed to lock up my edibles before for the same reason I would never lock up a bottle of wine. When my sister called me in a panic, it wasn't like I thought \"Oh my god, I need to immediately childproof my home!\"\n\nBut am I the asshole here? Do I really deserve what's happening now?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So the user wants to know if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author left edibles on her dresser, which her 9-year-old niece ate, leading to her getting high. The author didn't lock them up, assuming she didn't need to because she's an adult and doesn't think about childproofing her home. Now, her sister and family are blaming her, and she's being uninvited from places where her niece might be. She's asking if she's the asshole here.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Colorado has legal cannabis, so edibles are legal, but they still need to be stored safely, especially around kids. The author mentions she's a 35-year-old woman who uses edibles to unwind. She had a 9-year-old over, and she didn't lock up the edibles, thinking it wasn't necessary. But the niece ate them.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break down the key points. The author had a child in her home, even if it was temporarily, and she didn't secure the edibles. While she might not have seen the need, Colorado law likely requires that cannabis products be stored safely to prevent access by children. Even if the author didn't lock them up like she would wine, the legal and safety standards might be different for cannabis, especially in homes where children might be present.\n\nAlso, the author's reasoning is that she didn't think about it. But as a responsible adult, when hosting a child, even briefly, securing anything that could be harmful is part of the responsibility. The fact that the niece had access to the dresser where the edibles were stored suggests a lack of childproofing. Even if the author didn't foresee it, the responsibility is on the adult to ensure a safe environment.\n\nHer family's reaction, while possibly harsh, isn't unfounded. The parents are worried about their child's safety, and the author's oversight, albeit unintentional, led to their child being under the influence. The author's argument that she didn't plan it and it was a mistake might make her not an \"asshole,\" but legally and ethically, she might still be at fault for not taking precautions.\n\nSo, considering all that, even if the author didn't intend harm, her negligence in securing the edibles in a home where a child was present could place her in the wrong. The answer would depend on the perspective\u2014whether it's about intent versus responsibility. From a legal standpoint, she might have violated safe storage laws. From a family relations standpoint, the family's blame is due to negligence in creating a safe environment for their child.\n"
