I am a 35 year old woman. For many women, unwinding means a bottle of wine. For me, I prefer to pop an edible or two and relax in front of a paint canvas, my sewing machine, etc.\n\nMy sister's husband had an emergency that resulted in her needing to quickly find a sitter for her 9 year old. I like my niece and obviously wanted to help out my sister, but warned her that she'd probably be bored at my place, since we don't have a lot of kid-friendly stuff.  At one point after she dropped her off with some books, I got up to take a shower. I'm pretty sure this is when it happened.\n\nAbout an hour or so later, I notice niece hadn't said anything for a while. I went over to the couch to see what was up, and she's just staring at the ceiling with one of her books on her stomach. I ask her if she's okay, and I immediately knew something was up. She said \"I ate some of your candy and it made me feel funny.\"\n\nShe had, in fact, eaten several of the sour gummies I had on my dresser. That I hadn't thought to lock up or anything like that because I'm a 35 year old woman who doesn't need to think about those things. Like ever.\n\nI panicked, she seemed fine, I called poison control and called her mom and panicked a lot more. I felt awful. It hadn't even occurred to me that this is a thing that would happen. Honestly, I did not foresee this happening. At all. Niece is completely fine, she ended up falling asleep after asking me for a grilled cheese sandwich with cut up hot dogs in it and asking if we could watch a movie. I stayed with her, kept her hydrated, etc, and apologized at least six million times to my sister, who was horrified and actually screamed at me. Once again, my niece is *fine.*\n\nEven my parents are in on it, blaming me and telling me I should have those things in a safe where no one could get to them, how could I possibly thing it was okay to have them around a child, no one should ever let their kids around me because next time I might give them a beer, etc etc. And I've been uninvited from anywhere that my niece will be, because they think somehow I planned for this to happen.\n\nI feel awful, like I've said a million times, but I really don't think I'm an asshole for this happening. I didn't do this on purpose. I have never needed to lock up my edibles before for the same reason I would never lock up a bottle of wine. When my sister called me in a panic, it wasn't like I thought \"Oh my god, I need to immediately childproof my home!\"\n\nBut am I the asshole here? Do I really deserve what's happening now?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not locking up edibles, which led her niece to get high. The situation is in Colorado where edibles are legal.\n\nFirst, the author is an adult who uses edibles for relaxation. She had a 9-year-old niece over because her sister needed a sitter. The niece ate the sour gummies left on the dresser. The author didn't lock them up, thinking she didn't need to since she's an adult. But the niece ended up consuming them, leading to the sister and family being upset.\n\nThe key points here are about responsibility and reasonable precautions. Even though the author didn't intend for this to happen, she was hosting a child in her home. The question is whether leaving edibles accessible was a reasonable action. \n\nIn most cases, when you have a child in your home, especially a young child, it's considered responsible to secure any substances that could be harmful if ingested. This includes both prescription medication, alcohol, and in this case, edibles. Even if the author didn't lock them up before, the presence of a child changes the situation. \n\nThe author's defense is that she treats edibles like wine, but the difference is that edibles' effects on children can be more severe and unexpected. A child might not understand the dosage, and the effects can be stronger relative to their body weight. \n\nSo, even though it was an accident, the author didn't take the necessary precautions to prevent access. The family's reaction, while harsh, is based on the concern for the child's safety. The parents and sister are right in holding her accountable because she didn't childproof her home, which is a standard expectation when hosting a child. \n\nTherefore, the author is in the wrong for not securing the edibles, as it's the responsible action when a child is present.\n"
