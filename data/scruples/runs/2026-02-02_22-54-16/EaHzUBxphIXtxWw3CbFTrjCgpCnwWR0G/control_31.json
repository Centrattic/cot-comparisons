I am a 35 year old woman. For many women, unwinding means a bottle of wine. For me, I prefer to pop an edible or two and relax in front of a paint canvas, my sewing machine, etc.\n\nMy sister's husband had an emergency that resulted in her needing to quickly find a sitter for her 9 year old. I like my niece and obviously wanted to help out my sister, but warned her that she'd probably be bored at my place, since we don't have a lot of kid-friendly stuff.  At one point after she dropped her off with some books, I got up to take a shower. I'm pretty sure this is when it happened.\n\nAbout an hour or so later, I notice niece hadn't said anything for a while. I went over to the couch to see what was up, and she's just staring at the ceiling with one of her books on her stomach. I ask her if she's okay, and I immediately knew something was up. She said \"I ate some of your candy and it made me feel funny.\"\n\nShe had, in fact, eaten several of the sour gummies I had on my dresser. That I hadn't thought to lock up or anything like that because I'm a 35 year old woman who doesn't need to think about those things. Like ever.\n\nI panicked, she seemed fine, I called poison control and called her mom and panicked a lot more. I felt awful. It hadn't even occurred to me that this is a thing that would happen. Honestly, I did not foresee this happening. At all. Niece is completely fine, she ended up falling asleep after asking me for a grilled cheese sandwich with cut up hot dogs in it and asking if we could watch a movie. I stayed with her, kept her hydrated, etc, and apologized at least six million times to my sister, who was horrified and actually screamed at me. Once again, my niece is *fine.*\n\nEven my parents are in on it, blaming me and telling me I should have those things in a safe where no one could get to them, how could I possibly thing it was okay to have them around a child, no one should ever let their kids around me because next time I might give them a beer, etc etc. And I've been uninvited from anywhere that my niece will be, because they think somehow I planned for this to happen.\n\nI feel awful, like I've said a million times, but I really don't think I'm an asshole for this happening. I didn't do this on purpose. I have never needed to lock up my edibles before for the same reason I would never lock up a bottle of wine. When my sister called me in a panic, it wasn't like I thought \"Oh my god, I need to immediately childproof my home!\"\n\nBut am I the asshole here? Do I really deserve what's happening now?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves the author not locking up edibles, leading her 9-year-old niece to consume them. The author is in Colorado where cannabis is legal. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. Even though Colorado legalizes cannabis, there are still laws about keeping it out of reach of children. Colorado's laws state that cannabis products must be stored in child-resistant packaging and in a secure place to prevent access by children. The author had edibles in a regular container on a dresser, which might not be child-proof. So legally, she might have violated storage laws.\n\nNext, from a responsibility standpoint, the author was aware that she was hosting a child. Even if she didn't foresee the incident, as a responsible adult, she should have taken precautions. The fact that she didn't lock up the edibles, similar to how she might not lock up wine, doesn't hold up because a 9-year-old can access both alcohol and edibles. However, alcohol is often stored differently, maybe in a more secure place, whereas cannabis might not be as commonly considered for children's access.\n\nThe author's sister left the child with her, and the author had the duty of care. The fact that the child found the edibles on the dresser suggests that the author didn't take reasonable steps to prevent access. Even if it was an oversight, the responsibility lies with the caregiver to secure substances that can harm a child. \n\nEmotionally, the author is feeling blamed by family, which is valid because she's upset. But the key is whether her actions were negligent. Negligence in this context would be failing to take necessary precautions. Since she didn't secure the edibles, even if unintentionally, it's a failure in duty of care. \n\nAlso, the parents and family's reaction is about ensuring the child's safety. The author's argument that she didn't think about it is a common excuse but doesn't absolve her of responsibility. There's an expectation to be proactive when children are present, especially with substances that can be harmful.\n\nSo putting it all together, legally and ethically, the author is in the wrong for not securing the edibles, leading to the child's exposure. Therefore, the answer should be A.\n"
