I am a 35 year old woman. For many women, unwinding means a bottle of wine. For me, I prefer to pop an edible or two and relax in front of a paint canvas, my sewing machine, etc.\n\nMy sister's husband had an emergency that resulted in her needing to quickly find a sitter for her 9 year old. I like my niece and obviously wanted to help out my sister, but warned her that she'd probably be bored at my place, since we don't have a lot of kid-friendly stuff.  At one point after she dropped her off with some books, I got up to take a shower. I'm pretty sure this is when it happened.\n\nAbout an hour or so later, I notice niece hadn't said anything for a while. I went over to the couch to see what was up, and she's just staring at the ceiling with one of her books on her stomach. I ask her if she's okay, and I immediately knew something was up. She said \"I ate some of your candy and it made me feel funny.\"\n\nShe had, in fact, eaten several of the sour gummies I had on my dresser. That I hadn't thought to lock up or anything like that because I'm a 35 year old woman who doesn't need to think about those things. Like ever.\n\nI panicked, she seemed fine, I called poison control and called her mom and panicked a lot more. I felt awful. It hadn't even occurred to me that this is a thing that would happen. Honestly, I did not foresee this happening. At all. Niece is completely fine, she ended up falling asleep after asking me for a grilled cheese sandwich with cut up hot dogs in it and asking if we could watch a movie. I stayed with her, kept her hydrated, etc, and apologized at least six million times to my sister, who was horrified and actually screamed at me. Once again, my niece is *fine.*\n\nEven my parents are in on it, blaming me and telling me I should have those things in a safe where no one could get to them, how could I possibly thing it was okay to have them around a child, no one should ever let their kids around me because next time I might give them a beer, etc etc. And I've been uninvited from anywhere that my niece will be, because they think somehow I planned for this to happen.\n\nI feel awful, like I've said a million times, but I really don't think I'm an asshole for this happening. I didn't do this on purpose. I have never needed to lock up my edibles before for the same reason I would never lock up a bottle of wine. When my sister called me in a panic, it wasn't like I thought \"Oh my god, I need to immediately childproof my home!\"\n\nBut am I the asshole here? Do I really deserve what's happening now?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong. The story is about the author not locking up their edibles, which led their niece to ingest them. The person is in Colorado where edibles are legal. They were looking after their 9-year-old niece when their sister had an emergency. The niece ended up eating the sour gummies that were on the dresser. The author didn't lock them up because they thought of themselves as an adult who didn't need to worry about such things. Now, the sister is upset, the parents are blaming them, and they've been uninvited from events with the niece. The author feels they didn't do it on purpose and didn't plan for it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is an adult, 35 years old, and in a state where cannabis is legal. They had edibles accessible, thinking they didn't need to lock them up. The niece is 9, so a child. The key points here are the legal status, the accessibility of the edibles, and the responsibility of the adult in charge.\n\nIn Colorado, it's legal for adults to possess edibles, but there are laws about keeping them out of reach of children. For example, Colorado's law requires cannabis products to be stored in a place that is inaccessible to children. If the author didn't secure the edibles properly, even if they didn't think a child would get to them, they might have violated state regulations. This could mean they were negligent in following the law, which is designed to prevent such incidents.\n\nNext, the responsibility aspect. Even if the author didn't intend for the niece to access the edibles, once they were in a position where a child could get to them, there's a duty of care. The author was the one supervising the child, so they should have ensured the environment was safe. The fact that the niece found the edibles suggests that the storage wasn't childproof. Adults are expected to take precautions when children are present, regardless of their usual habits. The comparison to wine might not hold because alcohol laws don't typically require locking it up, but cannabis laws in Colorado do have specific storage requirements.\n\nThe author's response after the incident was to call poison control and take care of the niece, which is good, but the initial negligence in not securing the edibles is the main issue. The sister's reaction and the family's blame might be harsh, but the author did have a responsibility to prevent the situation. The parents' concerns are valid because the niece could have had a more severe reaction, and the author's oversight could lead to future risks.\n\nSo, putting it all together, even though the author didn't mean to cause harm, failing to secure the edibles as required by law and not considering the child's presence properly makes them at least partially responsible. The answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because they didn't take necessary precautions as per the law and the situation's demands.\n"
