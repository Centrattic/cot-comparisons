I am a 35 year old woman. For many women, unwinding means a bottle of wine. For me, I prefer to pop an edible or two and relax in front of a paint canvas, my sewing machine, etc.\n\nMy sister's husband had an emergency that resulted in her needing to quickly find a sitter for her 9 year old. I like my niece and obviously wanted to help out my sister, but warned her that she'd probably be bored at my place, since we don't have a lot of kid-friendly stuff.  At one point after she dropped her off with some books, I got up to take a shower. I'm pretty sure this is when it happened.\n\nAbout an hour or so later, I notice niece hadn't said anything for a while. I went over to the couch to see what was up, and she's just staring at the ceiling with one of her books on her stomach. I ask her if she's okay, and I immediately knew something was up. She said \"I ate some of your candy and it made me feel funny.\"\n\nShe had, in fact, eaten several of the sour gummies I had on my dresser. That I hadn't thought to lock up or anything like that because I'm a 35 year old woman who doesn't need to think about those things. Like ever.\n\nI panicked, she seemed fine, I called poison control and called her mom and panicked a lot more. I felt awful. It hadn't even occurred to me that this is a thing that would happen. Honestly, I did not foresee this happening. At all. Niece is completely fine, she ended up falling asleep after asking me for a grilled cheese sandwich with cut up hot dogs in it and asking if we could watch a movie. I stayed with her, kept her hydrated, etc, and apologized at least six million times to my sister, who was horrified and actually screamed at me. Once again, my niece is *fine.*\n\nEven my parents are in on it, blaming me and telling me I should have those things in a safe where no one could get to them, how could I possibly thing it was okay to have them around a child, no one should ever let their kids around me because next time I might give them a beer, etc etc. And I've been uninvited from anywhere that my niece will be, because they think somehow I planned for this to happen.\n\nI feel awful, like I've said a million times, but I really don't think I'm an asshole for this happening. I didn't do this on purpose. I have never needed to lock up my edibles before for the same reason I would never lock up a bottle of wine. When my sister called me in a panic, it wasn't like I thought \"Oh my god, I need to immediately childproof my home!\"\n\nBut am I the asshole here? Do I really deserve what's happening now?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the question is whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is that she had edibles (cannabis-infused sour gummies) on her dresser that her 9-year-old niece ate because they weren't locked up. The author didn't think to lock them up because she's a responsible adult and didn't expect a child to be in the house long enough to find them. The sister had to leave suddenly and dropped the niece off, and the niece ended up eating the edibles when the author was in the shower.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal context. Colorado legalized recreational cannabis, but there are regulations about keeping it secure. The author's defense is that she would never leave alcohol out for a child, but she didn't think to secure her edibles because they're in a form that's similar to candy. However, the key here is that cannabis, even if legal, still has legal obligations regarding storage to prevent access by minors. Colorado law likely requires cannabis products to be stored in a child-proof container, especially in homes where children might be present. \n\nNext, responsibility. The author is an adult who chooses to consume edibles. Even if she didn't have children before, when she's babysitting a 9-year-old, it's reasonable to assume that she should take precautions to secure any substances that could harm a child. The niece was in her care, even temporarily. The author didn't do a safety check when the child arrived, which might be a point against her. She mentions that the niece was bored and didn't have much kid-friendly stuff, but she should have considered that a child might explore and find the edibles. \n\nThe parents and family are upset because they feel she was negligent. They believe she should have locked up the edibles, similar to how she would with alcohol. Even if she didn't intend to harm the child, the fact that the edibles were accessible in a place a child could reach (like a dresser) shows a lack of precaution. \n\nOn the other hand, the author didn't expect the situation to happen. She was helping a sister in need and thought the child would be okay. But the issue is whether she should have known better. The fact that the edibles were in a place accessible to a child, even unintentionally, could be seen as negligence. \n\nNow, considering Colorado's child access prevention laws, if the state requires cannabis to be stored securely to prevent access by minors, then the author violated that law. Even if she's not a parent, when she's in a situation where a child is present, she's responsible for their safety. So legally and ethically, she might be in the wrong for not securing the edibles, leading to the child's harm. \n\nHer sister was in a panic and the family is blaming her because they feel she was careless. Even if the niece was fine, the fact remains that she put a child in a position where she could access a dangerous substance. The author's argument that she treats edibles like wine might not hold up because cannabis, even in edible form, is a controlled substance and requires more secure storage to prevent accidental ingestion. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author didn't take necessary precautions, leading to a preventable incident. Therefore, she is likely in the wrong.\n"
