I am a 35 year old woman. For many women, unwinding means a bottle of wine. For me, I prefer to pop an edible or two and relax in front of a paint canvas, my sewing machine, etc.\n\nMy sister's husband had an emergency that resulted in her needing to quickly find a sitter for her 9 year old. I like my niece and obviously wanted to help out my sister, but warned her that she'd probably be bored at my place, since we don't have a lot of kid-friendly stuff.  At one point after she dropped her off with some books, I got up to take a shower. I'm pretty sure this is when it happened.\n\nAbout an hour or so later, I notice niece hadn't said anything for a while. I went over to the couch to see what was up, and she's just staring at the ceiling with one of her books on her stomach. I ask her if she's okay, and I immediately knew something was up. She said \"I ate some of your candy and it made me feel funny.\"\n\nShe had, in fact, eaten several of the sour gummies I had on my dresser. That I hadn't thought to lock up or anything like that because I'm a 35 year old woman who doesn't need to think about those things. Like ever.\n\nI panicked, she seemed fine, I called poison control and called her mom and panicked a lot more. I felt awful. It hadn't even occurred to me that this is a thing that would happen. Honestly, I did not foresee this happening. At all. Niece is completely fine, she ended up falling asleep after asking me for a grilled cheese sandwich with cut up hot dogs in it and asking if we could watch a movie. I stayed with her, kept her hydrated, etc, and apologized at least six million times to my sister, who was horrified and actually screamed at me. Once again, my niece is *fine.*\n\nEven my parents are in on it, blaming me and telling me I should have those things in a safe where no one could get to them, how could I possibly thing it was okay to have them around a child, no one should ever let their kids around me because next time I might give them a beer, etc etc. And I've been uninvited from anywhere that my niece will be, because they think somehow I planned for this to happen.\n\nI feel awful, like I've said a million times, but I really don't think I'm an asshole for this happening. I didn't do this on purpose. I have never needed to lock up my edibles before for the same reason I would never lock up a bottle of wine. When my sister called me in a panic, it wasn't like I thought \"Oh my god, I need to immediately childproof my home!\"\n\nBut am I the asshole here? Do I really deserve what's happening now?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves accidentally allowing their niece to consume edibles because they weren't locked up. The author is in Colorado, where cannabis is legal.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. Colorado law regarding cannabis and minors. I remember that even though it's legal for adults, there are strict rules about keeping cannabis products secure, especially when it comes to children. There might be laws about storing cannabis out of reach of children to prevent accidental ingestion. If the author had edibles in an accessible place, they might have violated those laws. \n\nThen, the social responsibility angle. Even if the author didn't think of it as a 35-year-old adult, the presence of a child in their home creates a duty of care. Parents and guardians are expected to make sure their environment is safe for children. Leaving edibles on a dresser where a child could reach them might be considered negligent, regardless of whether the person has done so before. \n\nThe author's defense is that they didn't think it was necessary, comparing it to not locking up wine. But edibles are different because they can be mistaken for regular candy, especially by a child. The legal and health risks are higher. The fact that the niece ended up getting high and needed medical attention might lead to legal consequences, even if the author didn't intend harm.\n\nAlso, the reactions from family members\u2014blaming the author, uninviting them\u2014suggest that there's a social expectation of responsibility here. The author's oversight led to a serious situation, which impacts their relationships and reputation. \n\nSo, legally and socially, the author might be considered responsible. Even if it was an accident, the failure to secure the edibles in a child-safe manner could be seen as negligence. Therefore, the answer might be that the author is in the wrong (A). But I should double-check Colorado's specific laws on cannabis storage around children to confirm.\n"
