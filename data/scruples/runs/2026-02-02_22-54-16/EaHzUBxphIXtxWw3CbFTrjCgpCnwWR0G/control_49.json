I am a 35 year old woman. For many women, unwinding means a bottle of wine. For me, I prefer to pop an edible or two and relax in front of a paint canvas, my sewing machine, etc.\n\nMy sister's husband had an emergency that resulted in her needing to quickly find a sitter for her 9 year old. I like my niece and obviously wanted to help out my sister, but warned her that she'd probably be bored at my place, since we don't have a lot of kid-friendly stuff.  At one point after she dropped her off with some books, I got up to take a shower. I'm pretty sure this is when it happened.\n\nAbout an hour or so later, I notice niece hadn't said anything for a while. I went over to the couch to see what was up, and she's just staring at the ceiling with one of her books on her stomach. I ask her if she's okay, and I immediately knew something was up. She said \"I ate some of your candy and it made me feel funny.\"\n\nShe had, in fact, eaten several of the sour gummies I had on my dresser. That I hadn't thought to lock up or anything like that because I'm a 35 year old woman who doesn't need to think about those things. Like ever.\n\nI panicked, she seemed fine, I called poison control and called her mom and panicked a lot more. I felt awful. It hadn't even occurred to me that this is a thing that would happen. Honestly, I did not foresee this happening. At all. Niece is completely fine, she ended up falling asleep after asking me for a grilled cheese sandwich with cut up hot dogs in it and asking if we could watch a movie. I stayed with her, kept her hydrated, etc, and apologized at least six million times to my sister, who was horrified and actually screamed at me. Once again, my niece is *fine.*\n\nEven my parents are in on it, blaming me and telling me I should have those things in a safe where no one could get to them, how could I possibly thing it was okay to have them around a child, no one should ever let their kids around me because next time I might give them a beer, etc etc. And I've been uninvited from anywhere that my niece will be, because they think somehow I planned for this to happen.\n\nI feel awful, like I've said a million times, but I really don't think I'm an asshole for this happening. I didn't do this on purpose. I have never needed to lock up my edibles before for the same reason I would never lock up a bottle of wine. When my sister called me in a panic, it wasn't like I thought \"Oh my god, I need to immediately childproof my home!\"\n\nBut am I the asshole here? Do I really deserve what's happening now?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not locking up her edibles, leading her niece to get high. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author is in Colorado where edibles are legal. She has a 9-year-old niece over for a few hours. The niece ate some of her edibles that were on the dresser and got high. The author didn't lock them up, thinking she's a responsible adult and not a parent, so she didn't consider the risk.\n\nNow, considering the responsibilities. Even though the author isn't a parent, when a child is in her care, she has a duty to ensure the environment is safe. Edibles, especially ones that look like candy, can be tempting and dangerous to kids. The author didn't take any precautions, which seems like a major oversight. \n\nThe author's argument is that she didn't think it would happen, similar to not locking up wine. But alcohol and edibles aren't the same in this context. Edibles can have delayed effects and higher potency, making them more dangerous if ingested by a child. The fact that the niece ended up high shows the risk wasn't just hypothetical.\n\nLegal aspects: In Colorado, there are laws about keeping cannabis products secure. For example, Colorado law requires that cannabis products be stored out of reach of children. If the author had kids or was caring for someone else's child, she might be liable. Even though it's legal, negligence in storage could lead to legal consequences, depending on the circumstances.\n\nPublic opinion in the AITA context usually looks at negligence and responsibility. People might argue that the author should have known better, regardless of her own habits. The fact that the niece is okay is a plus, but the act of not securing the edibles was a mistake. \n\nThe family's reaction is harsh, but the author's responsibility isn't about intent; it's about taking reasonable precautions. The author's reasoning that she didn't plan for it to happen doesn't mitigate the fact that she didn't take steps to prevent it. \n\nSo, even though the author didn't intend harm, the failure to secure the edibles in a home where a child was present is a clear error in judgment. Therefore, she is in the wrong.\n"
