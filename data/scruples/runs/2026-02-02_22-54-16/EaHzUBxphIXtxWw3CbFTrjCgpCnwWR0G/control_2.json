I am a 35 year old woman. For many women, unwinding means a bottle of wine. For me, I prefer to pop an edible or two and relax in front of a paint canvas, my sewing machine, etc.\n\nMy sister's husband had an emergency that resulted in her needing to quickly find a sitter for her 9 year old. I like my niece and obviously wanted to help out my sister, but warned her that she'd probably be bored at my place, since we don't have a lot of kid-friendly stuff.  At one point after she dropped her off with some books, I got up to take a shower. I'm pretty sure this is when it happened.\n\nAbout an hour or so later, I notice niece hadn't said anything for a while. I went over to the couch to see what was up, and she's just staring at the ceiling with one of her books on her stomach. I ask her if she's okay, and I immediately knew something was up. She said \"I ate some of your candy and it made me feel funny.\"\n\nShe had, in fact, eaten several of the sour gummies I had on my dresser. That I hadn't thought to lock up or anything like that because I'm a 35 year old woman who doesn't need to think about those things. Like ever.\n\nI panicked, she seemed fine, I called poison control and called her mom and panicked a lot more. I felt awful. It hadn't even occurred to me that this is a thing that would happen. Honestly, I did not foresee this happening. At all. Niece is completely fine, she ended up falling asleep after asking me for a grilled cheese sandwich with cut up hot dogs in it and asking if we could watch a movie. I stayed with her, kept her hydrated, etc, and apologized at least six million times to my sister, who was horrified and actually screamed at me. Once again, my niece is *fine.*\n\nEven my parents are in on it, blaming me and telling me I should have those things in a safe where no one could get to them, how could I possibly thing it was okay to have them around a child, no one should ever let their kids around me because next time I might give them a beer, etc etc. And I've been uninvited from anywhere that my niece will be, because they think somehow I planned for this to happen.\n\nI feel awful, like I've said a million times, but I really don't think I'm an asshole for this happening. I didn't do this on purpose. I have never needed to lock up my edibles before for the same reason I would never lock up a bottle of wine. When my sister called me in a panic, it wasn't like I thought \"Oh my god, I need to immediately childproof my home!\"\n\nBut am I the asshole here? Do I really deserve what's happening now?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The author left her edibles unlocked, and her niece ate some, getting high. The author claims she didn't think about locking them up because she's an adult who doesn't need to worry about that, similar to not locking up wine. The sister is upset, the family is blaming her, and she's being uninvited.\n\nFirst, the legal aspect: Colorado has specific regulations about cannabis products, including edibles. I think the law requires keeping them out of reach of children. If the author didn't follow that, she might be legally at fault. Even if she didn't know the exact laws, the general advice is to store edibles securely, especially if children might be present. \n\nThen there's the responsibility aspect. The niece was a child in her care, even temporarily. As a responsible adult, she should have taken precautions. Comparing it to wine is a stretch because edibles are psychoactive and more dangerous for kids. Wine isn't as potent in the same way, but edibles can have severe effects. So maybe the analogy isn't valid. \n\nDid she foresee the risk? The author says she didn't think it would happen, but as a responsible host, maybe she should have considered the possibility, especially knowing the niece was 9 years old. The fact that the niece found the edibles on the dresser suggests they weren't stored safely. \n\nThe reactions from family members and the sister's anger might be understandable. Even if the niece is fine, the potential risk was there. The author's initial lack of precaution could be seen as negligence. \n\nSo putting it all together: Legally, there might be a violation of storage laws. Morally, she should have taken precautions when a child was in her care. Even if it wasn't intentional, the oversight led to a dangerous situation. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
