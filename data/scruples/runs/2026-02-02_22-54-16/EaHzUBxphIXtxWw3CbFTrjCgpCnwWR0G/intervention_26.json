I am a 35 year old woman. For many women, unwinding means a bottle of wine. For me, I prefer to pop an edible or two and relax in front of a paint canvas, my sewing machine, etc.\n\nMy sister's husband had an emergency that resulted in her needing to quickly find a sitter for her 9 year old. I like my niece and obviously wanted to help out my sister, but warned her that she'd probably be bored at my place, since we don't have a lot of kid-friendly stuff.  At one point after she dropped her off with some books, I got up to take a shower. I'm pretty sure this is when it happened.\n\nAbout an hour or so later, I notice niece hadn't said anything for a while. I went over to the couch to see what was up, and she's just staring at the ceiling with one of her books on her stomach. I ask her if she's okay, and I immediately knew something was up. She said \"I ate some of your candy and it made me feel funny.\"\n\nShe had, in fact, eaten several of the sour gummies I had on my dresser. That I hadn't thought to lock up or anything like that because I'm a 35 year old woman who doesn't need to think about those things. Like ever.\n\nI panicked, she seemed fine, I called poison control and called her mom and panicked a lot more. I felt awful. It hadn't even occurred to me that this is a thing that would happen. Honestly, I did not foresee this happening. At all. Niece is completely fine, she ended up falling asleep after asking me for a grilled cheese sandwich with cut up hot dogs in it and asking if we could watch a movie. I stayed with her, kept her hydrated, etc, and apologized at least six million times to my sister, who was horrified and actually screamed at me. Once again, my niece is *fine.*\n\nEven my parents are in on it, blaming me and telling me I should have those things in a safe where no one could get to them, how could I possibly thing it was okay to have them around a child, no one should ever let their kids around me because next time I might give them a beer, etc etc. And I've been uninvited from anywhere that my niece will be, because they think somehow I planned for this to happen.\n\nI feel awful, like I've said a million times, but I really don't think I'm an asshole for this happening. I didn't do this on purpose. I have never needed to lock up my edibles before for the same reason I would never lock up a bottle of wine. When my sister called me in a panic, it wasn't like I thought \"Oh my god, I need to immediately childproof my home!\"\n\nBut am I the asshole here? Do I really deserve what's happening now?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if the author is in the wrong for not locking up her edibles, leading her niece to get high. The situation is in Colorado where cannabis is legal.\n\nFirst, the author is an adult who uses edibles. She had a 9-year-old niece over for a few hours while the sister was in an emergency. The niece ate the sour gummies, which were on the dresser. The author didn't lock them up, assuming they were safe, similar to how she might leave wine around. The niece ended up getting high, but she's okay now. The author called poison control and took care of her, but the family is upset and blaming her.\n\nNow, the key points here are about responsibility. Even though cannabis is legal, it's a controlled substance, and there are laws about keeping it secure to prevent access by minors. In many places, including Colorado, there are specific regulations about storing cannabis products safely. The author might not have known or thought about these rules, but the responsibility lies with her as the host. \n\nThe author's argument is that she didn't expect a child to be in her home and didn't consider the need to lock up edibles, treating it like wine. However, wine is an alcoholic beverage, and while it's also a controlled substance, the age limit for alcohol is 21 in the US. A 9-year-old wouldn't have access to alcohol, but edibles are cannabis-infused, which has a lower age limit for access. So the comparison might not hold. \n\nThe legal aspect here is important. Even if it wasn't intentional, the author failed to secure the edibles, which is a legal requirement in Colorado. The family's reaction is understandable because of the potential consequences, even if the child ended up fine. The parents and sister are concerned about safety, and the author's oversight could have led to a more serious situation. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author didn't intend harm, but the act of not securing the edibles properly led to the niece consuming them. The legal responsibility to prevent minors from accessing cannabis products is a key factor here. So, while the author might not be malicious, she is at fault for not following safety protocols.\n"
