She is very smart, funny, nice, and beautiful. I felt very lucky that she showed interest in me and even eventually agreed to go out with me. Early into our relationship, guys were warning me around school not to get involved with her because apparently she had a reputation of being a tease. I never heard anything about it and I liked her too much to listen to that stuff.  After 3ish months together and doing nothing beyond light kissing, I started to wonder if maybe the rumors were true. I asked her about it and she told me that she has that reputation because she comes from a religious background and doesn\u2019t want to have sex before marriage. Guys always broke up with her when she refused to sleep with them and that\u2019s why she never told me. I admit I was disappointed, but I didn\u2019t care enough to stop going out with her. She was perfect in every other way and honestly she still is.\n\nOver time though I started to notice that she isn\u2019t that religious at all. I have no problem with that but I was frustrated that she was only religious in this one spot of her life. After 2 years together, I asked her about it. She told me that she does in fact want to have sex with me but after being raised with this mindset, it\u2019s hard for her to shake it. She asked me to give her some time and she will be ready. Well, after about 2 years and 7 months together, she was finally ready. We started a sexual relationship. It sadly wasn\u2019t at all like I\u2019d been dreaming it would be. She was very timid in bed. She was only willing to do certain positions and most of the time it seemed more like a chore for her than something she wanted, even if she had been the one who initiated it. I\u2019m not violent but I personally enjoy being a bit more aggressive in bed and she does not respond well to that at all. It started to believe that she is not attracted to me and this put a strain on our relationship.\n\nNow we have been together 3 years and 3 months. She started attending therapy for her depression a few months ago which I fully supported, but something came out that I was not expecting. She sat me down and told me that in therapy she had been discussing previous sexual abuse she experienced. It was brutal stuff. I won\u2019t go into detail out of respect but family members had raped her for years of her childhood. She explained that this is the reason for her holdups in bed, and she used religion as an excuse in our relationship because she didn\u2019t want to tell me she had been abused (she\u2019s never told anyone before, I\u2019m the only person besides her therapist who knows) but she also didn\u2019t want to have sex because it gives her PTSD. She cried as she told me about some of the sick stuff she went through, and promised to work on it so that our relationship will be stronger.. I felt a lot of emotions, mostly heartbreak.\n\nIt\u2019s been about 2 weeks since the truth came out. I want to be there for her but I can\u2019t help but look at her differently. I keep thinking about how much she lied to me over the years to keep this secret, and I don\u2019t want to be angry about it but I sort of am. She has opened up to me a lot and I listen, but most of the time I don\u2019t want to. I hate how what they did to her. I don\u2019t want to hear about it, I miss how it was when I didn\u2019t know. I hate admitting this but I wish she never told me. I don\u2019t know how to respond to this, and I certainly don\u2019t know how I\u2019m supposed to help her. I don\u2019t want to have sex with her anymore because I don\u2019t want her to think of them while she\u2019s with me. I\u2019m afraid that she will bring it up when we are together. I feel bad because I\u2019m the only one she can talk to about this besides her therapist also I recognize how much she must trust me to tell me this, I don\u2019t think I\u2019m the right guy to be with someone so damaged. When I thought she was just religious, I could get over that but now I realize that even if we are married one day, this will be a lifelong battle for her. And for me, as her partner. \n\nShe sensed my discomfort and asked me if it bothers me when she talks about it. I told her the truth, yes it does. She started crying and apologizing and I immediately felt guilty and told her I didn\u2019t mean it. Since then she hasn\u2019t brought it up again, she\u2019s very quiet now. I regret saying anything.\n\n Some part of me wants to run, I just would hate to lose someone so amazing. She really is the most amazing girl, I cannot say that enough. I know this abuse was not her fault at all. I\u2019m wondering if this is a normal initial response from a S/O of sexual abuse or if I really am just an asshole. If it\u2019s a normal response, I will stick it out longer and see how it goes. If I\u2019m just an asshole who is going to keep feeling this way, I think I should break up with her. I still love her so much. If I break up with her now I\u2019m also scared she will know that this is why and be scarred from opening up about it again forever. \n\nWIBTA to leave her? WIBTA to stay? Idk. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's take a look at this situation. The author is a man in a three-and-a-half-year relationship with his girlfriend. Initially, he thought her reasons for not having sex were due to her religious background, but later she revealed that she was actually in therapy for past sexual abuse. Now he's breaking up with her because he feels uncomfortable and can't handle the situation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The girlfriend opened up about her trauma, which is a significant and sensitive topic. The author had supported her therapy and agreed to be there for her. However, after learning the truth, he's feeling a mix of emotions, including anger and discomfort, leading him to consider ending the relationship. The key points here are the girlfriend's vulnerability and the author's reaction.\n\nThe author's main issue seems to be that the reason for her hesitancy to engage in sex was a lie (using religion as an excuse instead of her true trauma). Now that he knows the real reason, he's struggling with how to handle it. He feels she's \"damaged\" and that this will be a lifelong battle for both of them. But wait, he's the one who was in the relationship and chose to stay for three years, supporting her through therapy. He knew she was in therapy for depression, so he was aware of some underlying issues. Now, after the truth comes out, he wants to leave because he's not sure how to support her and fears he might make things worse by bringing up the abuse if they have sex again.\n\nIs it wrong for him to break up? Well, the girlfriend took a major step by sharing her trauma, which is often a crucial part of healing. The author's immediate reaction is to feel like he's the \"wrong guy\" and wants to leave because he's not equipped to handle her PTSD. But isn't it part of a healthy relationship to work through such challenges together? By breaking up, he's abandoning her at a time when she might need support the most. The fact that he was in the relationship for so long and supported her therapy suggests he was committed before knowing the full extent of her history. Now that he knows, he's backing out, which might be seen as a failure to support her when she's most vulnerable.\n\nAlso, he's expressing that he doesn't want to have sex with her anymore, fearing she might think of her abusers. This shows empathy, but it's important to approach this with care and not let it become an excuse to leave. He should communicate his feelings without judgment and explore ways to support her needs, maybe adjusting his approach to intimacy. The girlfriend is now very quiet and hasn't brought it up again, which could be a sign of withdrawal due to fear of rejection. Ending the relationship now could retraumatize her, especially since she opened up to him in trust.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the author is in a position where he should try to work through this with her. Walking away after she was brave enough to share such intimate details might be considered selfish. Relationships require effort and understanding, especially when dealing with trauma. If he's not sure how to support her, perhaps he should seek couples counseling or individual therapy to better handle his feelings rather than ending the relationship immediately.\n\nSo, the answer here is likely A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because he's not supporting his girlfriend through her trauma and is breaking up based on discomfort rather than working through the issues. His reaction could be harmful to her, and leaving might be the wrong choice despite his own feelings of being overwhelmed.\n"
