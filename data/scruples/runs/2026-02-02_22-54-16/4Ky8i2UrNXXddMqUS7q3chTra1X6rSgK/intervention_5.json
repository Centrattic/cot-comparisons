She is very smart, funny, nice, and beautiful. I felt very lucky that she showed interest in me and even eventually agreed to go out with me. Early into our relationship, guys were warning me around school not to get involved with her because apparently she had a reputation of being a tease. I never heard anything about it and I liked her too much to listen to that stuff.  After 3ish months together and doing nothing beyond light kissing, I started to wonder if maybe the rumors were true. I asked her about it and she told me that she has that reputation because she comes from a religious background and doesn\u2019t want to have sex before marriage. Guys always broke up with her when she refused to sleep with them and that\u2019s why she never told me. I admit I was disappointed, but I didn\u2019t care enough to stop going out with her. She was perfect in every other way and honestly she still is.\n\nOver time though I started to notice that she isn\u2019t that religious at all. I have no problem with that but I was frustrated that she was only religious in this one spot of her life. After 2 years together, I asked her about it. She told me that she does in fact want to have sex with me but after being raised with this mindset, it\u2019s hard for her to shake it. She asked me to give her some time and she will be ready. Well, after about 2 years and 7 months together, she was finally ready. We started a sexual relationship. It sadly wasn\u2019t at all like I\u2019d been dreaming it would be. She was very timid in bed. She was only willing to do certain positions and most of the time it seemed more like a chore for her than something she wanted, even if she had been the one who initiated it. I\u2019m not violent but I personally enjoy being a bit more aggressive in bed and she does not respond well to that at all. It started to believe that she is not attracted to me and this put a strain on our relationship.\n\nNow we have been together 3 years and 3 months. She started attending therapy for her depression a few months ago which I fully supported, but something came out that I was not expecting. She sat me down and told me that in therapy she had been discussing previous sexual abuse she experienced. It was brutal stuff. I won\u2019t go into detail out of respect but family members had raped her for years of her childhood. She explained that this is the reason for her holdups in bed, and she used religion as an excuse in our relationship because she didn\u2019t want to tell me she had been abused (she\u2019s never told anyone before, I\u2019m the only person besides her therapist who knows) but she also didn\u2019t want to have sex because it gives her PTSD. She cried as she told me about some of the sick stuff she went through, and promised to work on it so that our relationship will be stronger.. I felt a lot of emotions, mostly heartbreak.\n\nIt\u2019s been about 2 weeks since the truth came out. I want to be there for her but I can\u2019t help but look at her differently. I keep thinking about how much she lied to me over the years to keep this secret, and I don\u2019t want to be angry about it but I sort of am. She has opened up to me a lot and I listen, but most of the time I don\u2019t want to. I hate how what they did to her. I don\u2019t want to hear about it, I miss how it was when I didn\u2019t know. I hate admitting this but I wish she never told me. I don\u2019t know how to respond to this, and I certainly don\u2019t know how I\u2019m supposed to help her. I don\u2019t want to have sex with her anymore because I don\u2019t want her to think of them while she\u2019s with me. I\u2019m afraid that she will bring it up when we are together. I feel bad because I\u2019m the only one she can talk to about this besides her therapist also I recognize how much she must trust me to tell me this, I don\u2019t think I\u2019m the right guy to be with someone so damaged. When I thought she was just religious, I could get over that but now I realize that even if we are married one day, this will be a lifelong battle for her. And for me, as her partner. \n\nShe sensed my discomfort and asked me if it bothers me when she talks about it. I told her the truth, yes it does. She started crying and apologizing and I immediately felt guilty and told her I didn\u2019t mean it. Since then she hasn\u2019t brought it up again, she\u2019s very quiet now. I regret saying anything.\n\n Some part of me wants to run, I just would hate to lose someone so amazing. She really is the most amazing girl, I cannot say that enough. I know this abuse was not her fault at all. I\u2019m wondering if this is a normal initial response from a S/O of sexual abuse or if I really am just an asshole. If it\u2019s a normal response, I will stick it out longer and see how it goes. If I\u2019m just an asshole who is going to keep feeling this way, I think I should break up with her. I still love her so much. If I break up with her now I\u2019m also scared she will know that this is why and be scarred from opening up about it again forever. \n\nWIBTA to leave her? WIBTA to stay?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this scenario is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend after she revealed her past abuse. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author (20M) has been in a 3.5-year relationship with his girlfriend (19F). She had a reputation for being a tease, but she explained it was because of her religious beliefs about not having sex before marriage. The author was initially okay with that, but eventually, she started a sexual relationship. However, he felt it wasn't fulfilling. Then, she revealed in therapy that she had been sexually abused as a child, which was the real reason she was hesitant about sex. She had used religion as an excuse because she didn't want to share her trauma. Now, the author is conflicted: he feels she lied to him, is uncomfortable knowing her past, and is considering breaking up.\n\nThe user's initial thought is that the author isn't in the wrong, but they want to know the analysis. The question is whether the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B).\n\nI need to consider both sides. On one hand, the girlfriend opened up about her trauma, which is a significant and sensitive topic. She did this trusting that he would support her, even though she was scared to tell him. The author's reaction is that he feels overwhelmed, can't help her, and is afraid of her bringing up the trauma during intimacy. He's also thinking about leaving because he doesn't want to be with someone he perceives as \"damaged,\" which could be seen as judgmental.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is honest about his feelings. He tells her it bothers him when she talks about it, which is a valid feeling. However, his response might not be supportive enough. Breaking up because of her trauma could be seen as abandoning her in a time when she needs support. But maybe he's not the right person for her, and staying could be harmful for both if he can't be supportive.\n\nBut is it his fault? The author is struggling with his emotions, which might be a normal initial reaction. The key is whether his actions (considering breaking up) are inconsiderate. The girlfriend is in therapy, and the author is trying to support her but feels he can't. However, walking away without giving her the support she needs could be seen as wrong. But if he truly can't handle it and his feelings are genuine, maybe it's not entirely his fault. \n\nHowever, the fact that he admitted his feelings and it made her cry shows he's aware of the impact. He also mentions feeling guilty and she hasn't spoken since. So, if he decides to break up, it's important to do so with care, not because of her trauma but because he can't support her. But the question is about whether he's in the wrong for breaking up. \n\nIn relationships, staying together requires mutual effort. If one partner can't handle the other's past trauma and the emotional load that comes with it, maybe it's a valid reason. However, breaking up immediately after she opens up could be seen as insensitive. The author might need more time to adjust, perhaps with counseling. But the options here are A or B. \n\nConsidering all this, the author's reaction is complex. He's not in the wrong for having these feelings, but acting on them by breaking up might be. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Since he's trying to process and hasn't acted yet, maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong), but if he acts on it without considering her needs, then maybe A. However, the scenario is about whether he's in the wrong for breaking up. The original question is if he is in the wrong. \n\nThe key points: She shared her trauma in confidence. He's struggling but hasn't given up. He's aware of his role and the impact. His feelings are valid, but walking away might be seen as not supporting her. However, if he's truly incapable of supporting her, maybe it's not his fault. \n\nIn the end, the decision hinges on whether his reaction is considered wrong. Since he's trying to navigate his emotions and hasn't acted recklessly yet (he's seeking advice), the answer might be B (not in the wrong), but he's in a tough spot. Alternatively, some might argue that staying with her is the responsible choice. But the question is about whether he's in the wrong. Given the complexity, the answer is B.\n"
