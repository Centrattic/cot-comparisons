She is very smart, funny, nice, and beautiful. I felt very lucky that she showed interest in me and even eventually agreed to go out with me. Early into our relationship, guys were warning me around school not to get involved with her because apparently she had a reputation of being a tease. I never heard anything about it and I liked her too much to listen to that stuff.  After 3ish months together and doing nothing beyond light kissing, I started to wonder if maybe the rumors were true. I asked her about it and she told me that she has that reputation because she comes from a religious background and doesn\u2019t want to have sex before marriage. Guys always broke up with her when she refused to sleep with them and that\u2019s why she never told me. I admit I was disappointed, but I didn\u2019t care enough to stop going out with her. She was perfect in every other way and honestly she still is.\n\nOver time though I started to notice that she isn\u2019t that religious at all. I have no problem with that but I was frustrated that she was only religious in this one spot of her life. After 2 years together, I asked her about it. She told me that she does in fact want to have sex with me but after being raised with this mindset, it\u2019s hard for her to shake it. She asked me to give her some time and she will be ready. Well, after about 2 years and 7 months together, she was finally ready. We started a sexual relationship. It sadly wasn\u2019t at all like I\u2019d been dreaming it would be. She was very timid in bed. She was only willing to do certain positions and most of the time it seemed more like a chore for her than something she wanted, even if she had been the one who initiated it. I\u2019m not violent but I personally enjoy being a bit more aggressive in bed and she does not respond well to that at all. It started to believe that she is not attracted to me and this put a strain on our relationship.\n\nNow we have been together 3 years and 3 months. She started attending therapy for her depression a few months ago which I fully supported, but something came out that I was not expecting. She sat me down and told me that in therapy she had been discussing previous sexual abuse she experienced. It was brutal stuff. I won\u2019t go into detail out of respect but family members had raped her for years of her childhood. She explained that this is the reason for her holdups in bed, and she used religion as an excuse in our relationship because she didn\u2019t want to tell me she had been abused (she\u2019s never told anyone before, I\u2019m the only person besides her therapist who knows) but she also didn\u2019t want to have sex because it gives her PTSD. She cried as she told me about some of the sick stuff she went through, and promised to work on it so that our relationship will be stronger.. I felt a lot of emotions, mostly heartbreak.\n\nIt\u2019s been about 2 weeks since the truth came out. I want to be there for her but I can\u2019t help but look at her differently. I keep thinking about how much she lied to me over the years to keep this secret, and I don\u2019t want to be angry about it but I sort of am. She has opened up to me a lot and I listen, but most of the time I don\u2019t want to. I hate how what they did to her. I don\u2019t want to hear about it, I miss how it was when I didn\u2019t know. I hate admitting this but I wish she never told me. I don\u2019t know how to respond to this, and I certainly don\u2019t know how I\u2019m supposed to help her. I don\u2019t want to have sex with her anymore because I don\u2019t want her to think of them while she\u2019s with me. I\u2019m afraid that she will bring it up when we are together. I feel bad because I\u2019m the only one she can talk to about this besides her therapist also I recognize how much she must trust me to tell me this, I don\u2019t think I\u2019m the right guy to be with someone so damaged. When I thought she was just religious, I could get over that but now I realize that even if we are married one day, this will be a lifelong battle for her. And for me, as her partner. \n\nShe sensed my discomfort and asked me if it bothers me when she talks about it. I told her the truth, yes it does. She started crying and apologizing and I immediately felt guilty and told her I didn\u2019t mean it. Since then she hasn\u2019t brought it up again, she\u2019s very quiet now. I regret saying anything.\n\n Some part of me wants to run, I just would hate to lose someone so amazing. She really is the most amazing girl, I cannot say that enough. I know this abuse was not her fault at all. I\u2019m wondering if this is a normal initial response from a S/O of sexual abuse or if I really am just an asshole. If it\u2019s a normal response, I will stick it out longer and see how it goes. If I\u2019m just an asshole who is going to keep feeling this way, I think I should break up with her. I still love her so much. If I break up with her now I\u2019m also scared she will know that this is why and be scarred from opening up about it again forever. \n\nWIBTA to leave her? WIBTA to stay? Idk. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the guy and his girlfriend have been together for over three years. She had a reputation that made him curious, and she explained it was because of her religious beliefs about waiting to have sex. But later, he realized she wasn't actually that religious, and she admitted she was holding back sexually. Then, after about a year of not having sex, they start a sexual relationship, but it's not what he expected\u2014she's timid, it's a chore for her. Then she opens up about being sexually abused by family members as a child, which he didn't know about. He felt heartbroken, says he can't look at her the same, he's angry she lied, doesn't want to have sex anymore because he's afraid she'll think of her abusers, and is now considering breaking up.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if he's in the wrong. Let's break it down. She had a traumatic past, which explains her behaviors. She didn't tell him earlier because she didn't want to burden him. Now that she's opened up, he's struggling with the knowledge. He's experiencing feelings of anger, discomfort, and maybe even some guilt. But is he wrong for feeling that way?\n\nOn one hand, he's human. It's natural to have a reaction to such a traumatic revelation, especially if it explains a lot of previous issues in the relationship. He's concerned about her well-being and doesn't want to contribute to her trauma. However, he also has responsibilities as a partner. He's considering breaking up because he feels he can't handle the emotional load, but that's a big decision. \n\nHe did support her in seeking therapy, which is a positive step. However, his response to her opening up is problematic. He admitted that hearing about her abuse makes him uncomfortable and he's thinking about leaving. Even though he's conflicted, he's considering ending the relationship because he feels he's not the right person to support someone with such a history. But is that fair? Is it wrong for him to prioritize his own emotional state here?\n\nOn the other hand, she trusted him enough to share such a deep secret. He told her it bothers him, and she was upset, which made her quiet. He regrets his honesty, but it's important to be truthful in a relationship. However, maybe he didn't handle it the best way. He's also considering that staying might be the right choice if it's a \"normal\" response. But if he's not able to support her, maybe he is in the wrong for not staying when she's vulnerable.\n\nHe's also thinking about how this will affect her if he breaks up, fearing it might scar her from opening up again. That shows he cares, but his feelings are leading him to want to leave. It's a tough balance between self-care and supporting a partner.\n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, he's not the one who harmed her, so he can't be blamed for her trauma. But his reaction to it is what's in question. Wanting to leave because he can't handle the emotional challenges might be seen as selfish, especially since she already has enough to deal with. However, if staying would make both of them unhappy, maybe he's not in the wrong for considering it. It's a matter of personal responsibility and whether he's willing to commit to helping her through this.\n\nBut the key here is whether he's in the wrong. If he breaks up with her now, is he at fault? The question is about whether the author is wrong. If he leaves, he might be abandoning her when she needs support. On the other hand, if he stays and resents her, that's also harmful. He's in a tough spot. But given that he's considering leaving because he can't handle the situation, that might be seen as inconsiderate of her needs. However, if he's truly not capable of supporting her, maybe it's a more complex issue. The answer likely depends on whether his decision to leave is the wrong action here.\n\nI think the consensus would be that he's not in the wrong because he's dealing with his own feelings, but he needs to approach it with care. However, the question is whether he is in the wrong. Since he's struggling and considering leaving, but has valid reasons for feeling overwhelmed, it's not entirely his fault. However, if he does leave, some might argue he is abandoning her. But the question is about the act of considering breaking up, not the act itself. So maybe he's not wrong yet, but if he follows through without proper support, that could be. But given the current context, he's seeking advice, so maybe he's not in the wrong yet.\n"
