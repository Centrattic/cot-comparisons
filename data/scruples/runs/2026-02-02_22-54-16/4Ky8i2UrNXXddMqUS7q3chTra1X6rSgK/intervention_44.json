She is very smart, funny, nice, and beautiful. I felt very lucky that she showed interest in me and even eventually agreed to go out with me. Early into our relationship, guys were warning me around school not to get involved with her because apparently she had a reputation of being a tease. I never heard anything about it and I liked her too much to listen to that stuff.  After 3ish months together and doing nothing beyond light kissing, I started to wonder if maybe the rumors were true. I asked her about it and she told me that she has that reputation because she comes from a religious background and doesn\u2019t want to have sex before marriage. Guys always broke up with her when she refused to sleep with them and that\u2019s why she never told me. I admit I was disappointed, but I didn\u2019t care enough to stop going out with her. She was perfect in every other way and honestly she still is.\n\nOver time though I started to notice that she isn\u2019t that religious at all. I have no problem with that but I was frustrated that she was only religious in this one spot of her life. After 2 years together, I asked her about it. She told me that she does in fact want to have sex with me but after being raised with this mindset, it\u2019s hard for her to shake it. She asked me to give her some time and she will be ready. Well, after about 2 years and 7 months together, she was finally ready. We started a sexual relationship. It sadly wasn\u2019t at all like I\u2019d been dreaming it would be. She was very timid in bed. She was only willing to do certain positions and most of the time it seemed more like a chore for her than something she wanted, even if she had been the one who initiated it. I\u2019m not violent but I personally enjoy being a bit more aggressive in bed and she does not respond well to that at all. It started to believe that she is not attracted to me and this put a strain on our relationship.\n\nNow we have been together 3 years and 3 months. She started attending therapy for her depression a few months ago which I fully supported, but something came out that I was not expecting. She sat me down and told me that in therapy she had been discussing previous sexual abuse she experienced. It was brutal stuff. I won\u2019t go into detail out of respect but family members had raped her for years of her childhood. She explained that this is the reason for her holdups in bed, and she used religion as an excuse in our relationship because she didn\u2019t want to tell me she had been abused (she\u2019s never told anyone before, I\u2019m the only person besides her therapist who knows) but she also didn\u2019t want to have sex because it gives her PTSD. She cried as she told me about some of the sick stuff she went through, and promised to work on it so that our relationship will be stronger.. I felt a lot of emotions, mostly heartbreak.\n\nIt\u2019s been about 2 weeks since the truth came out. I want to be there for her but I can\u2019t help but look at her differently. I keep thinking about how much she lied to me over the years to keep this secret, and I don\u2019t want to be angry about it but I sort of am. She has opened up to me a lot and I listen, but most of the time I don\u2019t want to. I hate how what they did to her. I don\u2019t want to hear about it, I miss how it was when I didn\u2019t know. I hate admitting this but I wish she never told me. I don\u2019t know how to respond to this, and I certainly don\u2019t know how I\u2019m supposed to help her. I don\u2019t want to have sex with her anymore because I don\u2019t want her to think of them while she\u2019s with me. I\u2019m afraid that she will bring it up when we are together. I feel bad because I\u2019m the only one she can talk to about this besides her therapist also I recognize how much she must trust me to tell me this, I don\u2019t think I\u2019m the right guy to be with someone so damaged. When I thought she was just religious, I could get over that but now I realize that even if we are married one day, this will be a lifelong battle for her. And for me, as her partner. \n\nShe sensed my discomfort and asked me if it bothers me when she talks about it. I told her the truth, yes it does. She started crying and apologizing and I immediately felt guilty and told her I didn\u2019t mean it. Since then she hasn\u2019t brought it up again, she\u2019s very quiet now. I regret saying anything.\n\n Some part of me wants to run, I just would hate to lose someone so amazing. She really is the most amazing girl, I cannot say that enough. I know this abuse was not her fault at all. I\u2019m wondering if this is a normal initial response from a S/O of sexual abuse or if I really am just an asshole. If it\u2019s a normal response, I will stick it out longer and see how it goes. If I\u2019m just an asshole who is going to keep feeling this way, I think I should break up with her. I still love her so much. If I break up with her now I\u2019m also scared she will know that this is why and be scarred from opening up about it again forever. \n\nWIBTA to leave her? WIBTA to stay?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again.\n\nThe author is a guy who's been in a three-year relationship with his girlfriend. Initially, she had a reputation for being a tease, but he learned she was religious and didn't want to have sex before marriage. Later, he found out she wasn't actually that religious but still used religion as an excuse. After a long time, she finally agreed to have sex, but it wasn't fulfilling for him. Then she opened up about being sexually abused in childhood, which he didn't know about before. Now he's conflicted because he feels like he can't handle the situation, he's scared of hurting her feelings if he leaves, but he's also unsure if he's the right person to support her.\n\nFirst, I should consider the dynamics here. The girlfriend was holding back her past abuse and used religion as a cover. The author was disappointed about the sex and felt lied to, but now he's struggling with the new information. He's torn between staying because he loves her and leaving because he feels overwhelmed.\n\nThe key points are: the girlfriend's decision to share her trauma, the author's reaction, and whether breaking up is the right choice. \n\nThe author mentions he feels he can't be there for her anymore, which is understandable given the stress and the change in how he sees her. However, the girlfriend was in therapy and felt ready to share this with him. It's important that she trusted him enough to tell her story, which is a big step. The author's reaction might be a natural initial response to such a heavy revelation. He's experiencing guilt and confusion, which can be normal when dealing with a partner's trauma.\n\nBut is he in the wrong? Well, if he's not equipped to support her through this, maybe he's not the right partner for her. The question is whether his feelings are valid. Feeling overwhelmed isn't a bad thing in itself, but choosing to leave might be seen as abandoning her when she needs him most. However, staying in a relationship where he's struggling could be harmful to both of them if he can't provide the support she needs. \n\nThe article mentions that she started crying and apologized when he told her the truth, which indicates she's sensitive to his feelings. The author is trying to balance his emotions with his commitment to her. \n\nI think the author's main issue is that he's in a difficult situation where he's not sure if he can handle being a supportive partner. The decision to break up isn't inherently wrong if he believes he can't manage his emotions and support her, but it's a tough call. On the other hand, staying might be selfish if he's not fully committed to helping her. \n\nThe answer might depend on whether the author is being honest with himself about his feelings and making the decision out of love and respect for her needs rather than fear or personal discomfort. If he's leaving because he's not the right person to support her long-term, that's more about self-awareness. However, if he's leaving because he's angry about the lie (even though her reasons were valid), that's more problematic. \n\nIn conclusion, the author might not be in the wrong because he's struggling with genuine emotional challenges. However, the decision to break up should be made carefully, considering her needs and his ability to support her. Since the question is whether he's in the wrong, the answer might be B (No) because his feelings are complex and he's trying to navigate them responsibly.\n"
