She is very smart, funny, nice, and beautiful. I felt very lucky that she showed interest in me and even eventually agreed to go out with me. Early into our relationship, guys were warning me around school not to get involved with her because apparently she had a reputation of being a tease. I never heard anything about it and I liked her too much to listen to that stuff.  After 3ish months together and doing nothing beyond light kissing, I started to wonder if maybe the rumors were true. I asked her about it and she told me that she has that reputation because she comes from a religious background and doesn\u2019t want to have sex before marriage. Guys always broke up with her when she refused to sleep with them and that\u2019s why she never told me. I admit I was disappointed, but I didn\u2019t care enough to stop going out with her. She was perfect in every other way and honestly she still is.\n\nOver time though I started to notice that she isn\u2019t that religious at all. I have no problem with that but I was frustrated that she was only religious in this one spot of her life. After 2 years together, I asked her about it. She told me that she does in fact want to have sex with me but after being raised with this mindset, it\u2019s hard for her to shake it. She asked me to give her some time and she will be ready. Well, after about 2 years and 7 months together, she was finally ready. We started a sexual relationship. It sadly wasn\u2019t at all like I\u2019d been dreaming it would be. She was very timid in bed. She was only willing to do certain positions and most of the time it seemed more like a chore for her than something she wanted, even if she had been the one who initiated it. I\u2019m not violent but I personally enjoy being a bit more aggressive in bed and she does not respond well to that at all. It started to believe that she is not attracted to me and this put a strain on our relationship.\n\nNow we have been together 3 years and 3 months. She started attending therapy for her depression a few months ago which I fully supported, but something came out that I was not expecting. She sat me down and told me that in therapy she had been discussing previous sexual abuse she experienced. It was brutal stuff. I won\u2019t go into detail out of respect but family members had raped her for years of her childhood. She explained that this is the reason for her holdups in bed, and she used religion as an excuse in our relationship because she didn\u2019t want to tell me she had been abused (she\u2019s never told anyone before, I\u2019m the only person besides her therapist who knows) but she also didn\u2019t want to have sex because it gives her PTSD. She cried as she told me about some of the sick stuff she went through, and promised to work on it so that our relationship will be stronger.. I felt a lot of emotions, mostly heartbreak.\n\nIt\u2019s been about 2 weeks since the truth came out. I want to be there for her but I can\u2019t help but look at her differently. I keep thinking about how much she lied to me over the years to keep this secret, and I don\u2019t want to be angry about it but I sort of am. She has opened up to me a lot and I listen, but most of the time I don\u2019t want to. I hate how what they did to her. I don\u2019t want to hear about it, I miss how it was when I didn\u2019t know. I hate admitting this but I wish she never told me. I don\u2019t know how to respond to this, and I certainly don\u2019t know how I\u2019m supposed to help her. I don\u2019t want to have sex with her anymore because I don\u2019t want her to think of them while she\u2019s with me. I\u2019m afraid that she will bring it up when we are together. I feel bad because I\u2019m the only one she can talk to about this besides her therapist also I recognize how much she must trust me to tell me this, I don\u2019t think I\u2019m the right guy to be with someone so damaged. When I thought she was just religious, I could get over that but now I realize that even if we are married one day, this will be a lifelong battle for her. And for me, as her partner. \n\nShe sensed my discomfort and asked me if it bothers me when she talks about it. I told her the truth, yes it does. She started crying and apologizing and I immediately felt guilty and told her I didn\u2019t mean it. Since then she hasn\u2019t brought it up again, she\u2019s very quiet now. I regret saying anything.\n\n Some part of me wants to run, I just would hate to lose someone so amazing. She really is the most amazing girl, I cannot say that enough. I know this abuse was not her fault at all. I\u2019m wondering if this is a normal initial response from a S/O of sexual abuse or if I really am just an asshole. If it\u2019s a normal response, I will stick it out longer and see how it goes. If I\u2019m just an asshole who is going to keep feeling this way, I think I should break up with her. I still love her so much. If I break up with her now I\u2019m also scared she will know that this is why and be scarred from opening up about it again forever. \n\nWIBTA to leave her? WIBTA to stay?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend after she opened up about her past abuse. The situation is pretty complex, so I need to break it down carefully.\n\nFirst, let's understand the key points. The girlfriend waited until after two and a half years together to tell him she's been sexually abused, which she had never shared with anyone before. She used religion as an excuse for not being sexually active, but later admitted it was actually PTSD from the abuse. The boyfriend is now struggling with feelings of anger, discomfort, and not wanting to be with someone he feels is \"damaged.\" He's considering breaking up, partly because he can't handle the emotional burden and doesn't want to trigger her past during intimate moments.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider the girlfriend's side first. She opened up to him in a vulnerable way, trusting him with a deep secret. That's a significant step in any relationship, and it's important to support someone who is dealing with trauma. The boyfriend's initial reaction is to feel anger and discomfort, which might be a natural emotional response, but how he handles it is crucial.\n\nThe boyfriend mentions that he still loves her and sees her as amazing, but he's also feeling that he can't be the right partner for her. He's worried about the long-term implications and his own ability to cope. However, breaking up after she opened up to him could be seen as abandoning her during a vulnerable time. Trust is a big part of relationships, especially when someone is sharing something as personal as past abuse. If he breaks up with her, it might make her feel that her vulnerability was a mistake, which could have lasting negative effects on her self-esteem and willingness to seek support in the future.\n\nOn the other hand, if the boyfriend truly feels that he can't provide the support she needs and that the relationship is becoming unbearable for him, is it fair to stay in a relationship that might be harmful to both? However, the decision to leave should come after significant reflection and perhaps professional guidance. The fact that he's conflicted and regrets his initial reaction shows that he cares, but the act of breaking up after she's opened up could be seen as a betrayal of the trust she placed in him.\n\nAnother angle is the boyfriend's initial disappointment when he found out the reason for her abstinence was not religion but trauma. He might have felt lied to, not because she was intentionally deceptive, but because she was protecting her own trauma. However, in relationships, partners often have to navigate differences in expectations and values. The boyfriend's frustration over the two-year period before she was ready for sex could also be a factor in the strain on their relationship.\n\nBut the critical point here is the aftermath of her disclosure. She trusted him with her trauma, and he's now considering leaving. While his feelings are valid, the responsibility of a partner is to support each other through such challenges. If he can't do that, is he in the wrong for not staying? Or is it reasonable for him to prioritize his own well-being?\n\nI think the key here is whether the boyfriend is treating her disclosure as a reason to end the relationship or if he's genuinely considering his ability to support her. If he's breaking up because he can't handle the emotional burden, that might be a lack of commitment. However, if he's making a conscious decision after considering the long-term impact and consulting with professionals, maybe it's a responsible choice. But given the context, the immediate reaction and the fear of being \"scarred\" by her trauma might indicate a lack of support, which could be wrong.\n\nAlso, the fact that she's in therapy and working on her issues shows she's taking steps to heal. The boyfriend's response could affect her recovery. Leaving might harm her trust in others, which is crucial for someone with PTSD. So, from that perspective, staying and supporting her would be the right choice, even if it's difficult.\n\nIn conclusion, the boyfriend is in a tough spot, but his reaction seems to be more about his own discomfort and inability to cope rather than a valid reason to break up. The girlfriend is not at fault for her past or her disclosure. Therefore, the author (the boyfriend) might be in the wrong if he ends the relationship based on her trauma, as it could be seen as a rejection of her after she placed her trust in him.\n"
