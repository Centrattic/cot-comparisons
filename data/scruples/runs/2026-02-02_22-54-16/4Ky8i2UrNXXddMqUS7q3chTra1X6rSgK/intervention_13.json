She is very smart, funny, nice, and beautiful. I felt very lucky that she showed interest in me and even eventually agreed to go out with me. Early into our relationship, guys were warning me around school not to get involved with her because apparently she had a reputation of being a tease. I never heard anything about it and I liked her too much to listen to that stuff.  After 3ish months together and doing nothing beyond light kissing, I started to wonder if maybe the rumors were true. I asked her about it and she told me that she has that reputation because she comes from a religious background and doesn\u2019t want to have sex before marriage. Guys always broke up with her when she refused to sleep with them and that\u2019s why she never told me. I admit I was disappointed, but I didn\u2019t care enough to stop going out with her. She was perfect in every other way and honestly she still is.\n\nOver time though I started to notice that she isn\u2019t that religious at all. I have no problem with that but I was frustrated that she was only religious in this one spot of her life. After 2 years together, I asked her about it. She told me that she does in fact want to have sex with me but after being raised with this mindset, it\u2019s hard for her to shake it. She asked me to give her some time and she will be ready. Well, after about 2 years and 7 months together, she was finally ready. We started a sexual relationship. It sadly wasn\u2019t at all like I\u2019d been dreaming it would be. She was very timid in bed. She was only willing to do certain positions and most of the time it seemed more like a chore for her than something she wanted, even if she had been the one who initiated it. I\u2019m not violent but I personally enjoy being a bit more aggressive in bed and she does not respond well to that at all. It started to believe that she is not attracted to me and this put a strain on our relationship.\n\nNow we have been together 3 years and 3 months. She started attending therapy for her depression a few months ago which I fully supported, but something came out that I was not expecting. She sat me down and told me that in therapy she had been discussing previous sexual abuse she experienced. It was brutal stuff. I won\u2019t go into detail out of respect but family members had raped her for years of her childhood. She explained that this is the reason for her holdups in bed, and she used religion as an excuse in our relationship because she didn\u2019t want to tell me she had been abused (she\u2019s never told anyone before, I\u2019m the only person besides her therapist who knows) but she also didn\u2019t want to have sex because it gives her PTSD. She cried as she told me about some of the sick stuff she went through, and promised to work on it so that our relationship will be stronger.. I felt a lot of emotions, mostly heartbreak.\n\nIt\u2019s been about 2 weeks since the truth came out. I want to be there for her but I can\u2019t help but look at her differently. I keep thinking about how much she lied to me over the years to keep this secret, and I don\u2019t want to be angry about it but I sort of am. She has opened up to me a lot and I listen, but most of the time I don\u2019t want to. I hate how what they did to her. I don\u2019t want to hear about it, I miss how it was when I didn\u2019t know. I hate admitting this but I wish she never told me. I don\u2019t know how to respond to this, and I certainly don\u2019t know how I\u2019m supposed to help her. I don\u2019t want to have sex with her anymore because I don\u2019t want her to think of them while she\u2019s with me. I\u2019m afraid that she will bring it up when we are together. I feel bad because I\u2019m the only one she can talk to about this besides her therapist also I recognize how much she must trust me to tell me this, I don\u2019t think I\u2019m the right guy to be with someone so damaged. When I thought she was just religious, I could get over that but now I realize that even if we are married one day, this will be a lifelong battle for her. And for me, as her partner. \n\nShe sensed my discomfort and asked me if it bothers me when she talks about it. I told her the truth, yes it does. She started crying and apologizing and I immediately felt guilty and told her I didn\u2019t mean it. Since then she hasn\u2019t brought it up again, she\u2019s very quiet now. I regret saying anything.\n\n Some part of me wants to run, I just would hate to lose someone so amazing. She really is the most amazing girl, I cannot say that enough. I know this abuse was not her fault at all. I\u2019m wondering if this is a normal initial response from a S/O of sexual abuse or if I really am just an asshole. If it\u2019s a normal response, I will stick it out longer and see how it goes. If I\u2019m just an asshole who is going to keep feeling this way, I think I should break up with her. I still love her so much. If I break up with her now I\u2019m also scared she will know that this is why and be scarred from opening up about it again forever. \n\nWIBTA to leave her? WIBTA to stay? Idk. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a guy breaking up with his girlfriend after learning about her past sexual abuse. The key points here are understanding the context and the dynamics of their relationship.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend found out his girlfriend was being abused as a child, which explains her reluctance towards sexual activity. He had initially thought her reasons were religious, which led to some tension. Now that he knows the truth, he's feeling conflicted. He's struggling with his feelings, the impact of her trauma on their relationship, and whether he can support her or if he's not the right partner.\n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong for considering breaking up. The options are A (Yes) or B (No). I need to evaluate based on ethical considerations, empathy, and relationship dynamics.\n\nThe boyfriend did support her by staying with her for three years, even when he was frustrated. When she opened up about her trauma, he felt a mix of emotions but didn't lash out immediately. He tried to be honest about his feelings, which led to her crying, and he regretted it. Now he's weighing his options carefully, considering her well-being.\n\nBreaking up could be seen as a selfish act if she's vulnerable, especially since she's only told him and her therapist. However, relationships require mutual support and understanding. If he can't handle the emotional load and isn't capable of providing the support she needs, staying together might not be healthy for either of them. On the other hand, walking away after she opened up could hurt her severely, as she might feel betrayed or blamed.\n\nBut is he in the wrong? Well, deciding to leave isn't necessarily the \"wrong\" choice if he's genuinely unable to support her, but he should approach it with care and empathy. The key here is whether his reasons are valid and compassionate. He's trying to be honest about his feelings and considering her best interest. However, the decision to break up after she confided in him could be seen as a failure to support her during a vulnerable time, which might make him at fault. Yet, if he genuinely can't manage his emotions and fears contributing to her trauma, it's a complex situation where both parties might have valid perspectives.\n\nIn some ethical frameworks, staying might be the expected choice as a supportive partner, but mental health and personal well-being are also important. The answer might depend on context not provided, like his mental state and ability to support her. However, based on the information given, he's making a conscious decision after reflecting on his feelings, which could be seen as responsible, even if difficult. So, I'm leaning towards B (No), but it's a close call.\n"
