She is very smart, funny, nice, and beautiful. I felt very lucky that she showed interest in me and even eventually agreed to go out with me. Early into our relationship, guys were warning me around school not to get involved with her because apparently she had a reputation of being a tease. I never heard anything about it and I liked her too much to listen to that stuff.  After 3ish months together and doing nothing beyond light kissing, I started to wonder if maybe the rumors were true. I asked her about it and she told me that she has that reputation because she comes from a religious background and doesn\u2019t want to have sex before marriage. Guys always broke up with her when she refused to sleep with them and that\u2019s why she never told me. I admit I was disappointed, but I didn\u2019t care enough to stop going out with her. She was perfect in every other way and honestly she still is.\n\nOver time though I started to notice that she isn\u2019t that religious at all. I have no problem with that but I was frustrated that she was only religious in this one spot of her life. After 2 years together, I asked her about it. She told me that she does in fact want to have sex with me but after being raised with this mindset, it\u2019s hard for her to shake it. She asked me to give her some time and she will be ready. Well, after about 2 years and 7 months together, she was finally ready. We started a sexual relationship. It sadly wasn\u2019t at all like I\u2019d been dreaming it would be. She was very timid in bed. She was only willing to do certain positions and most of the time it seemed more like a chore for her than something she wanted, even if she had been the one who initiated it. I\u2019m not violent but I personally enjoy being a bit more aggressive in bed and she does not respond well to that at all. It started to believe that she is not attracted to me and this put a strain on our relationship.\n\nNow we have been together 3 years and 3 months. She started attending therapy for her depression a few months ago which I fully supported, but something came out that I was not expecting. She sat me down and told me that in therapy she had been discussing previous sexual abuse she experienced. It was brutal stuff. I won\u2019t go into detail out of respect but family members had raped her for years of her childhood. She explained that this is the reason for her holdups in bed, and she used religion as an excuse in our relationship because she didn\u2019t want to tell me she had been abused (she\u2019s never told anyone before, I\u2019m the only person besides her therapist who knows) but she also didn\u2019t want to have sex because it gives her PTSD. She cried as she told me about some of the sick stuff she went through, and promised to work on it so that our relationship will be stronger.. I felt a lot of emotions, mostly heartbreak.\n\nIt\u2019s been about 2 weeks since the truth came out. I want to be there for her but I can\u2019t help but look at her differently. I keep thinking about how much she lied to me over the years to keep this secret, and I don\u2019t want to be angry about it but I sort of am. She has opened up to me a lot and I listen, but most of the time I don\u2019t want to. I hate how what they did to her. I don\u2019t want to hear about it, I miss how it was when I didn\u2019t know. I hate admitting this but I wish she never told me. I don\u2019t know how to respond to this, and I certainly don\u2019t know how I\u2019m supposed to help her. I don\u2019t want to have sex with her anymore because I don\u2019t want her to think of them while she\u2019s with me. I\u2019m afraid that she will bring it up when we are together. I feel bad because I\u2019m the only one she can talk to about this besides her therapist also I recognize how much she must trust me to tell me this, I don\u2019t think I\u2019m the right guy to be with someone so damaged. When I thought she was just religious, I could get over that but now I realize that even if we are married one day, this will be a lifelong battle for her. And for me, as her partner. \n\nShe sensed my discomfort and asked me if it bothers me when she talks about it. I told her the truth, yes it does. She started crying and apologizing and I immediately felt guilty and told her I didn\u2019t mean it. Since then she hasn\u2019t brought it up again, she\u2019s very quiet now. I regret saying anything.\n\n Some part of me wants to run, I just would hate to lose someone so amazing. She really is the most amazing girl, I cannot say that enough. I know this abuse was not her fault at all. I\u2019m wondering if this is a normal initial response from a S/O of sexual abuse or if I really am just an asshole. If it\u2019s a normal response, I will stick it out longer and see how it goes. If I\u2019m just an asshole who is going to keep feeling this way, I think I should break up with her. I still love her so much. If I break up with her now I\u2019m also scared she will know that this is why and be scarred from opening up about it again forever. \n\nWIBTA to leave her? WIBTA to stay? Idk. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the situation described is in the wrong if they break up with his girlfriend after she opened up about her past abuse. The options are A (yes, he's in the wrong) or B (no, he's not in the wrong).\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points of the scenario. The girlfriend had a history of sexual abuse, which she only revealed after three years of the relationship. She initially used religion as an excuse for not having sex, but later explained that her reluctance was due to PTSD from the abuse. The author feels conflicted now that he knows the truth. He's struggling with his feelings of guilt, discomfort, and the fear that he might not be able to support her long-term. He's considering breaking up because he can't handle the situation emotionally, but he's also worried about how that would affect her.\n\nNow, the main question is whether he's in the wrong for considering the breakup. Let's break down the factors. \n\nThe girlfriend did something brave by opening up about her trauma, which is a significant step in therapy. The author supports her therapy, so he's shown support. However, he's now experiencing negative emotions\u2014feeling like she lied, discomfort, and fear of not being able to help. These feelings are valid, but how he handles them matters.\n\nOne angle is empathy. The girlfriend's actions were about protecting her mental health and trust. She didn't lie to manipulate but to protect herself. The author's initial frustration about the religious excuse could be seen as not fully understanding her trauma. However, he did stick with her for three years, which shows commitment. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's feelings after learning the truth are complex. He's human, and it's natural to feel overwhelmed. However, walking away might be seen as abandoning someone in a time of need, especially since she's the one who's been through trauma. But if he isn't able to support her effectively and feels like it's a lifelong battle that he's not equipped to handle, maybe leaving isn't the worst thing, as long as it's done with care.\n\nAnother point is communication. The author did tell her his discomfort, which is important. She cried and apologized, but he regretted it. Maybe there's a need for more open dialogue and seeking couples therapy. If he can't get the support he needs, maybe staying isn't healthy for either of them. But if he leaves, he might feel guilty, and she might take it as rejection, which could harm her healing.\n\nLegally and morally, there's no \"wrong\" in wanting to leave if it's about personal capability. However, the ethical angle would consider the girlfriend's vulnerability. The author is in a position where he needs to weigh his own well-being against hers. If he can't be supportive, staying might do more harm. But if he can work through it, staying is better.\n\nSo, considering all this, the answer might be B (he's not in the wrong) because his feelings are a result of genuine emotional conflict and he's trying to process. He's not being cruel, just struggling with the situation. However, he should handle the breakup with sensitivity if he decides to go that route. But the question is whether he's in the wrong for considering the breakup, not the act itself. Since he's trying to figure it out and hasn't acted yet, and given his internal conflict, it's not necessarily his fault. So B.\n"
