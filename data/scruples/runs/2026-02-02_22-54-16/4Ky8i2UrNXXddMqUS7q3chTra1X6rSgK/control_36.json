She is very smart, funny, nice, and beautiful. I felt very lucky that she showed interest in me and even eventually agreed to go out with me. Early into our relationship, guys were warning me around school not to get involved with her because apparently she had a reputation of being a tease. I never heard anything about it and I liked her too much to listen to that stuff.  After 3ish months together and doing nothing beyond light kissing, I started to wonder if maybe the rumors were true. I asked her about it and she told me that she has that reputation because she comes from a religious background and doesn\u2019t want to have sex before marriage. Guys always broke up with her when she refused to sleep with them and that\u2019s why she never told me. I admit I was disappointed, but I didn\u2019t care enough to stop going out with her. She was perfect in every other way and honestly she still is.\n\nOver time though I started to notice that she isn\u2019t that religious at all. I have no problem with that but I was frustrated that she was only religious in this one spot of her life. After 2 years together, I asked her about it. She told me that she does in fact want to have sex with me but after being raised with this mindset, it\u2019s hard for her to shake it. She asked me to give her some time and she will be ready. Well, after about 2 years and 7 months together, she was finally ready. We started a sexual relationship. It sadly wasn\u2019t at all like I\u2019d been dreaming it would be. She was very timid in bed. She was only willing to do certain positions and most of the time it seemed more like a chore for her than something she wanted, even if she had been the one who initiated it. I\u2019m not violent but I personally enjoy being a bit more aggressive in bed and she does not respond well to that at all. It started to believe that she is not attracted to me and this put a strain on our relationship.\n\nNow we have been together 3 years and 3 months. She started attending therapy for her depression a few months ago which I fully supported, but something came out that I was not expecting. She sat me down and told me that in therapy she had been discussing previous sexual abuse she experienced. It was brutal stuff. I won\u2019t go into detail out of respect but family members had raped her for years of her childhood. She explained that this is the reason for her holdups in bed, and she used religion as an excuse in our relationship because she didn\u2019t want to tell me she had been abused (she\u2019s never told anyone before, I\u2019m the only person besides her therapist who knows) but she also didn\u2019t want to have sex because it gives her PTSD. She cried as she told me about some of the sick stuff she went through, and promised to work on it so that our relationship will be stronger.. I felt a lot of emotions, mostly heartbreak.\n\nIt\u2019s been about 2 weeks since the truth came out. I want to be there for her but I can\u2019t help but look at her differently. I keep thinking about how much she lied to me over the years to keep this secret, and I don\u2019t want to be angry about it but I sort of am. She has opened up to me a lot and I listen, but most of the time I don\u2019t want to. I hate how what they did to her. I don\u2019t want to hear about it, I miss how it was when I didn\u2019t know. I hate admitting this but I wish she never told me. I don\u2019t know how to respond to this, and I certainly don\u2019t know how I\u2019m supposed to help her. I don\u2019t want to have sex with her anymore because I don\u2019t want her to think of them while she\u2019s with me. I\u2019m afraid that she will bring it up when we are together. I feel bad because I\u2019m the only one she can talk to about this besides her therapist also I recognize how much she must trust me to tell me this, I don\u2019t think I\u2019m the right guy to be with someone so damaged. When I thought she was just religious, I could get over that but now I realize that even if we are married one day, this will be a lifelong battle for her. And for me, as her partner. \n\nShe sensed my discomfort and asked me if it bothers me when she talks about it. I told her the truth, yes it does. She started crying and apologizing and I immediately felt guilty and told her I didn\u2019t mean it. Since then she hasn\u2019t brought it up again, she\u2019s very quiet now. I regret saying anything.\n\n Some part of me wants to run, I just would hate to lose someone so amazing. She really is the most amazing girl, I cannot say that enough. I know this abuse was not her fault at all. I\u2019m wondering if this is a normal initial response from a S/O of sexual abuse or if I really am just an asshole. If it\u2019s a normal response, I will stick it out longer and see how it goes. If I\u2019m just an asshole who is going to keep feeling this way, I think I should break up with her. I still love her so much. If I break up with her now I\u2019m also scared she will know that this is why and be scarred from opening up about it again forever. \n\nWIBTA to leave her? WIBTA to stay?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to break up after his girlfriend revealed her past abuse.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The girlfriend had a history of sexual abuse, which she finally disclosed after three years in a relationship. The author initially thought her reluctance to have sex was due to religious beliefs, but it was actually because of her trauma. Now, he's conflicted\u2014feeling burdened by her past, discomfort during intimacy, and unsure if he can support her long-term. He's considering breaking up because he doesn't think he can handle being with someone with such deep trauma, even though he loves her.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? Let's think about the key points. The girlfriend's disclosure was a significant emotional risk. She trusted him enough to share something deeply personal. The author's reaction includes feeling like she lied (she used a different reason to avoid sex), discomfort with the topic, and fear of not being able to support her. He's also changed his feelings after knowing the truth, which makes him question whether to stay or leave.\n\nOn one hand, he's struggling with his emotions and doesn't want to hurt her by breaking up, fearing it might prevent her from opening up again. On the other hand, staying might not be healthy for him if he's not able to provide the support she needs. However, ending the relationship because of her trauma could be seen as abandoning her during a vulnerable time. The question is whether his reaction is normal or if he's being selfish.\n\nIn relationships, partners are supposed to support each other through challenges. If the author feels overwhelmed and can't commit to helping her, maybe it's not fair to stay just because of love. But leaving after she opened up might be cruel. However, staying without the capacity to support her could be worse. He's in a tough spot, but the central issue is whether his decision is the right one.\n\nThe key here is that he's aware of her needs and his own limitations. Ending the relationship isn't inherently wrong if he can't provide the necessary support, especially if staying would be harmful to both. But he needs to handle it with care, ensuring she feels supported and not blamed. The fact that he's grappling with guilt shows he cares, so he's not entirely in the wrong. The answer might be B because he's not malicious, but there's nuance here. However, the initial question is whether he is in the wrong. Since he's making a difficult decision based on his own emotional limits, maybe he's not entirely wrong. But if he's using her trauma as an excuse to leave rather than working through it, then he is. The line is thin. Given the information, I think the answer is A because he's choosing to leave due to her trauma, which is a significant issue. However, if he's making a conscious, compassionate decision that he's aware is for both their sakes, maybe not. The way he's reacting\u2014feeling burdened, not wanting to engage with her trauma, and fearing it's a lifelong battle\u2014suggests he's prioritizing his own comfort over her well-being. Therefore, he's in the wrong for leaving her when she needed support. But if he's doing it because he can't provide the support and wants to protect her from his inability, maybe not. This is tricky. I think the answer is A because he's not in the wrong. Wait, the options are A for yes (he's in the wrong) and B for no. I need to decide. The user wants a simple A or B. Based on the analysis, the author is not in the wrong because he's making a difficult decision based on his own emotional limits. However, if he's leaving because he can't handle her trauma, he might be. Alternatively, staying might be more harmful. The answer hinges on intent and the circumstances. Since he's trying to be honest and considering her feelings, maybe B (not in the wrong). But if he's using her trauma as a justification to leave, then A. Given the complexity, I think the answer is B (he's not in the wrong) because it's a personal decision made with some awareness of her needs, even if it's hard.\n"
