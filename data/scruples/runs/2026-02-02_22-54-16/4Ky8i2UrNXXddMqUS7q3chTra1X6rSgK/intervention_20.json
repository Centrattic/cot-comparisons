She is very smart, funny, nice, and beautiful. I felt very lucky that she showed interest in me and even eventually agreed to go out with me. Early into our relationship, guys were warning me around school not to get involved with her because apparently she had a reputation of being a tease. I never heard anything about it and I liked her too much to listen to that stuff.  After 3ish months together and doing nothing beyond light kissing, I started to wonder if maybe the rumors were true. I asked her about it and she told me that she has that reputation because she comes from a religious background and doesn\u2019t want to have sex before marriage. Guys always broke up with her when she refused to sleep with them and that\u2019s why she never told me. I admit I was disappointed, but I didn\u2019t care enough to stop going out with her. She was perfect in every other way and honestly she still is.\n\nOver time though I started to notice that she isn\u2019t that religious at all. I have no problem with that but I was frustrated that she was only religious in this one spot of her life. After 2 years together, I asked her about it. She told me that she does in fact want to have sex with me but after being raised with this mindset, it\u2019s hard for her to shake it. She asked me to give her some time and she will be ready. Well, after about 2 years and 7 months together, she was finally ready. We started a sexual relationship. It sadly wasn\u2019t at all like I\u2019d been dreaming it would be. She was very timid in bed. She was only willing to do certain positions and most of the time it seemed more like a chore for her than something she wanted, even if she had been the one who initiated it. I\u2019m not violent but I personally enjoy being a bit more aggressive in bed and she does not respond well to that at all. It started to believe that she is not attracted to me and this put a strain on our relationship.\n\nNow we have been together 3 years and 3 months. She started attending therapy for her depression a few months ago which I fully supported, but something came out that I was not expecting. She sat me down and told me that in therapy she had been discussing previous sexual abuse she experienced. It was brutal stuff. I won\u2019t go into detail out of respect but family members had raped her for years of her childhood. She explained that this is the reason for her holdups in bed, and she used religion as an excuse in our relationship because she didn\u2019t want to tell me she had been abused (she\u2019s never told anyone before, I\u2019m the only person besides her therapist who knows) but she also didn\u2019t want to have sex because it gives her PTSD. She cried as she told me about some of the sick stuff she went through, and promised to work on it so that our relationship will be stronger.. I felt a lot of emotions, mostly heartbreak.\n\nIt\u2019s been about 2 weeks since the truth came out. I want to be there for her but I can\u2019t help but look at her differently. I keep thinking about how much she lied to me over the years to keep this secret, and I don\u2019t want to be angry about it but I sort of am. She has opened up to me a lot and I listen, but most of the time I don\u2019t want to. I hate how what they did to her. I don\u2019t want to hear about it, I miss how it was when I didn\u2019t know. I hate admitting this but I wish she never told me. I don\u2019t know how to respond to this, and I certainly don\u2019t know how I\u2019m supposed to help her. I don\u2019t want to have sex with her anymore because I don\u2019t want her to think of them while she\u2019s with me. I\u2019m afraid that she will bring it up when we are together. I feel bad because I\u2019m the only one she can talk to about this besides her therapist also I recognize how much she must trust me to tell me this, I don\u2019t think I\u2019m the right guy to be with someone so damaged. When I thought she was just religious, I could get over that but now I realize that even if we are married one day, this will be a lifelong battle for her. And for me, as her partner. \n\nShe sensed my discomfort and asked me if it bothers me when she talks about it. I told her the truth, yes it does. She started crying and apologizing and I immediately felt guilty and told her I didn\u2019t mean it. Since then she hasn\u2019t brought it up again, she\u2019s very quiet now. I regret saying anything.\n\n Some part of me wants to run, I just would hate to lose someone so amazing. She really is the most amazing girl, I cannot say that enough. I know this abuse was not her fault at all. I\u2019m wondering if this is a normal initial response from a S/O of sexual abuse or if I really am just an asshole. If it\u2019s a normal response, I will stick it out longer and see how it goes. If I\u2019m just an asshole who is going to keep feeling this way, I think I should break up with her. I still love her so much. If I break up with her now I\u2019m also scared she will know that this is why and be scarred from opening up about it again forever. \n\nWIBTA to leave her? WIBTA to stay? Idk. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend after she opened up about her past abuse. Let me start by reading through the scenario again to make sure I understand the details.\n\nThe guy, 20M, and his girlfriend, 19F, have been together for over three years. The girl had a reputation for being a tease, but she explained it was because she was religious and didn't want to have sex before marriage. He didn't care and they stayed together. Over time, he noticed she wasn't really religious, just in that aspect. After almost three years, she became ready for a sexual relationship but was very timid and didn't enjoy it. He felt she wasn't attracted to him, which strained their relationship.\n\nThen, she started therapy and revealed she had been sexually abused by family members as a child. She used religion as an excuse to avoid sex because of her PTSD. The author is now struggling with how to handle this. He feels hurt that she lied about being religious, upset by the abuse details, and conflicted about staying. He doesn't want to be with someone he feels is \"damaged,\" but he still loves her. The question is whether breaking up is the right move.\n\nThe user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The options are A for yes (he's wrong) or B for no (he's not wrong). \n\nFirst, I'll consider the girl's situation. She has a history of trauma that caused her PTSD, which affected her sexual relationship. She confided in her partner, which shows trust. She was honest about the reasons after years of using religion as an excuse. The author now feels overwhelmed and considering breaking up, not because of her actions, but because of his own feelings about her trauma.\n\nOn one hand, the author is in a relationship with someone who has significant trauma, and he's struggling to cope. It's not uncommon for people to have a hard time adjusting when they learn a partner has a traumatic past. But on the other hand, the girl was honest once she felt safe to share, and the author is choosing to leave, which could retraumatize her if she feels blamed for her past. \n\nIt's important to note that the author's feelings are valid\u2014he's feeling overwhelmed and scared. However, breaking up immediately might not be the healthiest or most supportive response. Staying in a relationship without genuine support could also be harmful. But the key here is that the girl's disclosure was part of her healing process, and the author's reaction might be seen as abandoning her during a vulnerable time. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, relationships require mutual support and effort. If the author can't provide that support, maybe ending the relationship is necessary for his well-being. But if he's breaking up because he's uncomfortable with her trauma, that could be seen as inconsiderate. The line between self-care and abandonment is tricky here. \n\nHowever, the author isn't in the wrong just because he's feeling conflicted. People have the right to reassess relationships when they're struggling. But the way he handles the breakup would matter. If he's honest and supportive, then it's a responsible decision. If he's being cruel or dismissive, that's different. The scenario doesn't indicate that. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author is not in the wrong for wanting to leave due to his inability to cope, especially if he's not able to support her needs. But he should approach it with care and empathy. Therefore, the answer would be B (not in the wrong). However, some might argue A because staying might have been more supportive. But given the information, B seems more accurate.\n"
