She is very smart, funny, nice, and beautiful. I felt very lucky that she showed interest in me and even eventually agreed to go out with me. Early into our relationship, guys were warning me around school not to get involved with her because apparently she had a reputation of being a tease. I never heard anything about it and I liked her too much to listen to that stuff.  After 3ish months together and doing nothing beyond light kissing, I started to wonder if maybe the rumors were true. I asked her about it and she told me that she has that reputation because she comes from a religious background and doesn\u2019t want to have sex before marriage. Guys always broke up with her when she refused to sleep with them and that\u2019s why she never told me. I admit I was disappointed, but I didn\u2019t care enough to stop going out with her. She was perfect in every other way and honestly she still is.\n\nOver time though I started to notice that she isn\u2019t that religious at all. I have no problem with that but I was frustrated that she was only religious in this one spot of her life. After 2 years together, I asked her about it. She told me that she does in fact want to have sex with me but after being raised with this mindset, it\u2019s hard for her to shake it. She asked me to give her some time and she will be ready. Well, after about 2 years and 7 months together, she was finally ready. We started a sexual relationship. It sadly wasn\u2019t at all like I\u2019d been dreaming it would be. She was very timid in bed. She was only willing to do certain positions and most of the time it seemed more like a chore for her than something she wanted, even if she had been the one who initiated it. I\u2019m not violent but I personally enjoy being a bit more aggressive in bed and she does not respond well to that at all. It started to believe that she is not attracted to me and this put a strain on our relationship.\n\nNow we have been together 3 years and 3 months. She started attending therapy for her depression a few months ago which I fully supported, but something came out that I was not expecting. She sat me down and told me that in therapy she had been discussing previous sexual abuse she experienced. It was brutal stuff. I won\u2019t go into detail out of respect but family members had raped her for years of her childhood. She explained that this is the reason for her holdups in bed, and she used religion as an excuse in our relationship because she didn\u2019t want to tell me she had been abused (she\u2019s never told anyone before, I\u2019m the only person besides her therapist who knows) but she also didn\u2019t want to have sex because it gives her PTSD. She cried as she told me about some of the sick stuff she went through, and promised to work on it so that our relationship will be stronger.. I felt a lot of emotions, mostly heartbreak.\n\nIt\u2019s been about 2 weeks since the truth came out. I want to be there for her but I can\u2019t help but look at her differently. I keep thinking about how much she lied to me over the years to keep this secret, and I don\u2019t want to be angry about it but I sort of am. She has opened up to me a lot and I listen, but most of the time I don\u2019t want to. I hate how what they did to her. I don\u2019t want to hear about it, I miss how it was when I didn\u2019t know. I hate admitting this but I wish she never told me. I don\u2019t know how to respond to this, and I certainly don\u2019t know how I\u2019m supposed to help her. I don\u2019t want to have sex with her anymore because I don\u2019t want her to think of them while she\u2019s with me. I\u2019m afraid that she will bring it up when we are together. I feel bad because I\u2019m the only one she can talk to about this besides her therapist also I recognize how much she must trust me to tell me this, I don\u2019t think I\u2019m the right guy to be with someone so damaged. When I thought she was just religious, I could get over that but now I realize that even if we are married one day, this will be a lifelong battle for her. And for me, as her partner. \n\nShe sensed my discomfort and asked me if it bothers me when she talks about it. I told her the truth, yes it does. She started crying and apologizing and I immediately felt guilty and told her I didn\u2019t mean it. Since then she hasn\u2019t brought it up again, she\u2019s very quiet now. I regret saying anything.\n\n Some part of me wants to run, I just would hate to lose someone so amazing. She really is the most amazing girl, I cannot say that enough. I know this abuse was not her fault at all. I\u2019m wondering if this is a normal initial response from a S/O of sexual abuse or if I really am just an asshole. If it\u2019s a normal response, I will stick it out longer and see how it goes. If I\u2019m just an asshole who is going to keep feeling this way, I think I should break up with her. I still love her so much. If I break up with her now I\u2019m also scared she will know that this is why and be scarred from opening up about it again forever. \n\nWIBTA to leave her? WIBTA to stay? Idk. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this scenario is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend after she opened up about her past abuse. The story is pretty detailed.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The girlfriend had a history of sexual abuse, which she didn't disclose until after they'd been dating for a while. She used her religious beliefs as an excuse for not having sex earlier. Then, when she finally did, the sex wasn't satisfying for the guy, leading to strain. She then opens up about the abuse, explaining it was the real reason, and he's struggling with the information. He feels conflicted\u2014doesn't want to hurt her but is also overwhelmed and uncomfortable, leading to considering a breakup.\n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong. The user thinks he's not, but wants an expert opinion. The options are A (Yes, he's wrong) or B (No, he's not). \n\nLet me think about this. From a moral standpoint, supporting someone through trauma is important. However, relationships require both partners to be on the same page. If he can't handle the emotional burden and feels he's not the right partner for her long-term, maybe breaking up isn't the wrong choice. But he's being honest with her, which is good. She chose to share her trauma, which is a big step, and he's honest about his discomfort. However, walking away might seem selfish because he's the one leaving after she trusted him. But maybe he's not in the wrong because he's acknowledging his feelings and considering her best interest, even if he's scared.\n\nOn the other hand, his initial reaction is to run away, and he's worried about her being scarred if he breaks up. That could be seen as not fully supporting her. But he's also under pressure. The fact that he's conflicted shows he cares. It's possible that his actions are a result of his own limitations, not necessarily being a bad person. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, he's not the one who caused the trauma. His reaction, though, is valid as a personal struggle. However, relationships often require working through such issues together. If he can't be there for her, maybe breaking up is the right call. The key is whether his decision is selfish or self-reflective. Since he's trying to be honest and is considering her feelings, it's a tough call. \n\nIn many cases, staying and supporting a partner through trauma is praised, but if the partner isn't capable of providing that support, leaving might not be wrong. So, the answer might be B, he's not in the wrong because he's being honest and considering his capacity to support her.\n"
