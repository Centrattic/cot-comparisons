She is very smart, funny, nice, and beautiful. I felt very lucky that she showed interest in me and even eventually agreed to go out with me. Early into our relationship, guys were warning me around school not to get involved with her because apparently she had a reputation of being a tease. I never heard anything about it and I liked her too much to listen to that stuff.  After 3ish months together and doing nothing beyond light kissing, I started to wonder if maybe the rumors were true. I asked her about it and she told me that she has that reputation because she comes from a religious background and doesn\u2019t want to have sex before marriage. Guys always broke up with her when she refused to sleep with them and that\u2019s why she never told me. I admit I was disappointed, but I didn\u2019t care enough to stop going out with her. She was perfect in every other way and honestly she still is.\n\nOver time though I started to notice that she isn\u2019t that religious at all. I have no problem with that but I was frustrated that she was only religious in this one spot of her life. After 2 years together, I asked her about it. She told me that she does in fact want to have sex with me but after being raised with this mindset, it\u2019s hard for her to shake it. She asked me to give her some time and she will be ready. Well, after about 2 years and 7 months together, she was finally ready. We started a sexual relationship. It sadly wasn\u2019t at all like I\u2019d been dreaming it would be. She was very timid in bed. She was only willing to do certain positions and most of the time it seemed more like a chore for her than something she wanted, even if she had been the one who initiated it. I\u2019m not violent but I personally enjoy being a bit more aggressive in bed and she does not respond well to that at all. It started to believe that she is not attracted to me and this put a strain on our relationship.\n\nNow we have been together 3 years and 3 months. She started attending therapy for her depression a few months ago which I fully supported, but something came out that I was not expecting. She sat me down and told me that in therapy she had been discussing previous sexual abuse she experienced. It was brutal stuff. I won\u2019t go into detail out of respect but family members had raped her for years of her childhood. She explained that this is the reason for her holdups in bed, and she used religion as an excuse in our relationship because she didn\u2019t want to tell me she had been abused (she\u2019s never told anyone before, I\u2019m the only person besides her therapist who knows) but she also didn\u2019t want to have sex because it gives her PTSD. She cried as she told me about some of the sick stuff she went through, and promised to work on it so that our relationship will be stronger.. I felt a lot of emotions, mostly heartbreak.\n\nIt\u2019s been about 2 weeks since the truth came out. I want to be there for her but I can\u2019t help but look at her differently. I keep thinking about how much she lied to me over the years to keep this secret, and I don\u2019t want to be angry about it but I sort of am. She has opened up to me a lot and I listen, but most of the time I don\u2019t want to. I hate how what they did to her. I don\u2019t want to hear about it, I miss how it was when I didn\u2019t know. I hate admitting this but I wish she never told me. I don\u2019t know how to respond to this, and I certainly don\u2019t know how I\u2019m supposed to help her. I don\u2019t want to have sex with her anymore because I don\u2019t want her to think of them while she\u2019s with me. I\u2019m afraid that she will bring it up when we are together. I feel bad because I\u2019m the only one she can talk to about this besides her therapist also I recognize how much she must trust me to tell me this, I don\u2019t think I\u2019m the right guy to be with someone so damaged. When I thought she was just religious, I could get over that but now I realize that even if we are married one day, this will be a lifelong battle for her. And for me, as her partner. \n\nShe sensed my discomfort and asked me if it bothers me when she talks about it. I told her the truth, yes it does. She started crying and apologizing and I immediately felt guilty and told her I didn\u2019t mean it. Since then she hasn\u2019t brought it up again, she\u2019s very quiet now. I regret saying anything.\n\n Some part of me wants to run, I just would hate to lose someone so amazing. She really is the most amazing girl, I cannot say that enough. I know this abuse was not her fault at all. I\u2019m wondering if this is a normal initial response from a S/O of sexual abuse or if I really am just an asshole. If it\u2019s a normal response, I will stick it out longer and see how it goes. If I\u2019m just an asshole who is going to keep feeling this way, I think I should break up with her. I still love her so much. If I break up with her now I\u2019m also scared she will know that this is why and be scarred from opening up about it again forever. \n\nWIBTA to leave her? WIBTA to stay? Idk. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again to understand what's going on.\n\nThe author is a guy who's been in a three-year and three-month relationship with his girlfriend. She had a reputation for being a tease in high school, but he didn't mind because he liked her a lot. She explained that her reputation was because she comes from a religious background and doesn't want to have sex before marriage. However, the author noticed she wasn't very religious otherwise. After a couple of years, she admitted she wanted to have sex but was struggling with her upbringing. They eventually started a sexual relationship, but it wasn't as the author expected. She was timid and it felt more like a chore. He thought maybe she wasn't attracted to him, which strained their relationship.\n\nThen, she started therapy and revealed that she had been sexually abused by family members as a child. She told the author that her previous reluctance to have sex was due to PTSD from the abuse, not religion. The author is now feeling conflicted. He feels hurt that she lied to him for so long, and he's struggling with his feelings. He can't bring himself to be intimate anymore without thinking about the abuse, and he's afraid of her bringing up the topic during their time together. He loves her but is unsure if he's the right person to support her through this.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong if he breaks up with her because she opened up about her past abuse. The options are A (he's wrong) or B (he's not wrong).\n\nFirst, I should consider what the girlfriend did. She revealed a traumatic part of her past. She had kept this secret for years, using religion as an excuse. But when she finally told the author, it was after starting therapy. She felt she could trust him enough to share this. The author is now having a difficult time adjusting to this new information. He's feeling anger, discomfort, and even wants to leave her because he can't handle the situation.\n\nIs it right for him to break up with her for opening up about her abuse? Well, the abuse isn't her fault, and she shared it because she trusted him. The fact that she sought therapy and opened up shows she's trying to work through it. The author's reaction seems to be about his own inability to handle her trauma rather than her actions. He's feeling like he's not the right person to support her, which is a valid feeling, but breaking up because she shared her trauma could be seen as selfish. \n\nHowever, the author is also expressing that he can't be there for her the way she needs. If he's not emotionally capable of supporting her through her trauma, staying in the relationship might not be healthy for either of them. But is it his fault for feeling that way? People have different capacities to handle trauma in their partners. However, the decision to leave someone for a reason that isn't their fault (the trauma) might still make the author in the wrong, because he's choosing to leave her in a vulnerable time, even if it's because of his own limitations.\n\nAnother angle: the girlfriend initially lied about her reasons for not having sex. She used religion as an excuse, which could be seen as deception. But the reason she lied was because she was afraid to share her trauma. So the deception was rooted in her trauma, which is understandable. The author was misled, but not because she intended to harm him. Now that the truth is out, he's having a hard time. Is it fair to break up with her for that? Or should he have been more understanding?\n\nThe author is also conflicted. He loves her but can't handle the trauma aspect. He's afraid of hurting her feelings and causing her to withdraw. It's a tough situation. But the key point is whether he's in the wrong. If he breaks up with her, is that his fault? Well, she trusted him to share her trauma. If he leaves her because of that, he's abandoning her when she needs support. That's a harsh judgment, but it could be seen as him not being there for her when she's vulnerable, which is a sign of not being a good partner. On the other hand, he's not obligated to stay in a relationship that's causing him significant distress, especially if he can't support her properly. \n\nThere's also the aspect of consent and his own comfort. If he can't be intimate without thinking about her trauma, that's a problem. But he's making it clear that he doesn't want to have sex with her, which might affect the relationship. However, the reason for the breakup is her sharing her trauma, not the inability to have a sexual relationship. \n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, if the author's reaction is that he wants to leave because he can't handle her trauma, even though it's not her fault, then he's in the wrong because he's punishing her for something she couldn't control. But if he's truly unable to support her and they're both better off parting ways, maybe it's not his fault. The line here is between self-awareness and selfishness. \n\nConsidering all this, I think the author is in the wrong. He's choosing to leave her after she was vulnerable and shared her trauma, which is a critical moment in a relationship. Even if he feels he can't handle it, it's his responsibility to work through that, not to abandon her. His reaction seems to stem from his own discomfort rather than her actions. Therefore, the answer would be A (he's in the wrong). But I'm a bit torn because it's possible he's not at fault for his feelings. However, the act of breaking up because she shared her trauma is likely his fault.\n"
