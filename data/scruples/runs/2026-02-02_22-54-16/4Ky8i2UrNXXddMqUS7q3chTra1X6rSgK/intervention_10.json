She is very smart, funny, nice, and beautiful. I felt very lucky that she showed interest in me and even eventually agreed to go out with me. Early into our relationship, guys were warning me around school not to get involved with her because apparently she had a reputation of being a tease. I never heard anything about it and I liked her too much to listen to that stuff.  After 3ish months together and doing nothing beyond light kissing, I started to wonder if maybe the rumors were true. I asked her about it and she told me that she has that reputation because she comes from a religious background and doesn\u2019t want to have sex before marriage. Guys always broke up with her when she refused to sleep with them and that\u2019s why she never told me. I admit I was disappointed, but I didn\u2019t care enough to stop going out with her. She was perfect in every other way and honestly she still is.\n\nOver time though I started to notice that she isn\u2019t that religious at all. I have no problem with that but I was frustrated that she was only religious in this one spot of her life. After 2 years together, I asked her about it. She told me that she does in fact want to have sex with me but after being raised with this mindset, it\u2019s hard for her to shake it. She asked me to give her some time and she will be ready. Well, after about 2 years and 7 months together, she was finally ready. We started a sexual relationship. It sadly wasn\u2019t at all like I\u2019d been dreaming it would be. She was very timid in bed. She was only willing to do certain positions and most of the time it seemed more like a chore for her than something she wanted, even if she had been the one who initiated it. I\u2019m not violent but I personally enjoy being a bit more aggressive in bed and she does not respond well to that at all. It started to believe that she is not attracted to me and this put a strain on our relationship.\n\nNow we have been together 3 years and 3 months. She started attending therapy for her depression a few months ago which I fully supported, but something came out that I was not expecting. She sat me down and told me that in therapy she had been discussing previous sexual abuse she experienced. It was brutal stuff. I won\u2019t go into detail out of respect but family members had raped her for years of her childhood. She explained that this is the reason for her holdups in bed, and she used religion as an excuse in our relationship because she didn\u2019t want to tell me she had been abused (she\u2019s never told anyone before, I\u2019m the only person besides her therapist who knows) but she also didn\u2019t want to have sex because it gives her PTSD. She cried as she told me about some of the sick stuff she went through, and promised to work on it so that our relationship will be stronger.. I felt a lot of emotions, mostly heartbreak.\n\nIt\u2019s been about 2 weeks since the truth came out. I want to be there for her but I can\u2019t help but look at her differently. I keep thinking about how much she lied to me over the years to keep this secret, and I don\u2019t want to be angry about it but I sort of am. She has opened up to me a lot and I listen, but most of the time I don\u2019t want to. I hate how what they did to her. I don\u2019t want to hear about it, I miss how it was when I didn\u2019t know. I hate admitting this but I wish she never told me. I don\u2019t know how to respond to this, and I certainly don\u2019t know how I\u2019m supposed to help her. I don\u2019t want to have sex with her anymore because I don\u2019t want her to think of them while she\u2019s with me. I\u2019m afraid that she will bring it up when we are together. I feel bad because I\u2019m the only one she can talk to about this besides her therapist also I recognize how much she must trust me to tell me this, I don\u2019t think I\u2019m the right guy to be with someone so damaged. When I thought she was just religious, I could get over that but now I realize that even if we are married one day, this will be a lifelong battle for her. And for me, as her partner. \n\nShe sensed my discomfort and asked me if it bothers me when she talks about it. I told her the truth, yes it does. She started crying and apologizing and I immediately felt guilty and told her I didn\u2019t mean it. Since then she hasn\u2019t brought it up again, she\u2019s very quiet now. I regret saying anything.\n\n Some part of me wants to run, I just would hate to lose someone so amazing. She really is the most amazing girl, I cannot say that enough. I know this abuse was not her fault at all. I\u2019m wondering if this is a normal initial response from a S/O of sexual abuse or if I really am just an asshole. If it\u2019s a normal response, I will stick it out longer and see how it goes. If I\u2019m just an asshole who is going to keep feeling this way, I think I should break up with her. I still love her so much. If I break up with her now I\u2019m also scared she will know that this is why and be scarred from opening up about it again forever. \n\nWIBTA to leave her? WIBTA to stay? Idk. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. Let me start by understanding the scenario.\n\nThe author is a guy who's been in a three-year relationship with his girlfriend. They met in high school, and she had a reputation of being a tease due to her religious beliefs about not having sex before marriage. He was warned but didn't listen because he liked her. Over time, she admitted that the religious part was a front, and she actually wanted to have sex but was struggling with it. They started a sexual relationship after two years and seven months. However, the sex wasn't fulfilling for the author because she was timid and it felt like a chore. Then, after three years and three months, she told him about her past sexual abuse, which explains her trauma and PTSD. Now he's conflicted because he feels she lied, he's uncomfortable knowing her history, and he's not sure if he can support her. He's considering breaking up because he doesn't think he can be the right partner for someone with such a traumatic past.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is struggling with his feelings after learning about her abuse. He feels betrayed because she used religion as an excuse instead of telling him the truth. However, she didn't tell him because she was scared to open up. The author is now dealing with the emotional toll of her trauma and the reality that their relationship has changed. He's also concerned about her reaction if he breaks up with her, fearing it might hurt her further.\n\nThe key points to evaluate are whether the author is in the wrong for considering a breakup after she confided in him. On one hand, he's showing empathy towards her trauma and supporting her therapy, which is positive. On the other hand, he's feeling overwhelmed and considering leaving, which could be seen as abandoning her during a vulnerable time. \n\nBut wait, is it his fault for feeling this way? He's not being violent or abusive; he's expressing discomfort and considering leaving because he feels he can't handle the situation. The question is whether that makes him in the wrong. Relationships require mutual effort, and if one partner can't emotionally support the other, maybe it's not fair to stay. However, the girlfriend shared her trauma with him because she trusted him, and he's feeling conflicted now. \n\nIn terms of his actions: he told her the truth about his discomfort, which led her to be upset. But he also expressed that he still loves her and is conflicted. The question is whether his potential breakup is justified. The options are A (he's in the wrong) or B (not in the wrong). \n\nI think the answer is B because he's not doing anything wrong per se. He's struggling with emotions and considering ending the relationship because he feels he can't support her. It's not his fault for having those feelings, especially given the trauma she's dealing with. However, the decision to break up could be seen as harsh, but the question is whether he's in the wrong, not whether breaking up is the right choice. Since he's trying to process his feelings and evaluate his ability to support her, it's not necessarily wrong. The fact that he's conflicted and considering staying shows he's trying to do the right thing. So the answer is B.\n"
