She is very smart, funny, nice, and beautiful. I felt very lucky that she showed interest in me and even eventually agreed to go out with me. Early into our relationship, guys were warning me around school not to get involved with her because apparently she had a reputation of being a tease. I never heard anything about it and I liked her too much to listen to that stuff.  After 3ish months together and doing nothing beyond light kissing, I started to wonder if maybe the rumors were true. I asked her about it and she told me that she has that reputation because she comes from a religious background and doesn\u2019t want to have sex before marriage. Guys always broke up with her when she refused to sleep with them and that\u2019s why she never told me. I admit I was disappointed, but I didn\u2019t care enough to stop going out with her. She was perfect in every other way and honestly she still is.\n\nOver time though I started to notice that she isn\u2019t that religious at all. I have no problem with that but I was frustrated that she was only religious in this one spot of her life. After 2 years together, I asked her about it. She told me that she does in fact want to have sex with me but after being raised with this mindset, it\u2019s hard for her to shake it. She asked me to give her some time and she will be ready. Well, after about 2 years and 7 months together, she was finally ready. We started a sexual relationship. It sadly wasn\u2019t at all like I\u2019d been dreaming it would be. She was very timid in bed. She was only willing to do certain positions and most of the time it seemed more like a chore for her than something she wanted, even if she had been the one who initiated it. I\u2019m not violent but I personally enjoy being a bit more aggressive in bed and she does not respond well to that at all. It started to believe that she is not attracted to me and this put a strain on our relationship.\n\nNow we have been together 3 years and 3 months. She started attending therapy for her depression a few months ago which I fully supported, but something came out that I was not expecting. She sat me down and told me that in therapy she had been discussing previous sexual abuse she experienced. It was brutal stuff. I won\u2019t go into detail out of respect but family members had raped her for years of her childhood. She explained that this is the reason for her holdups in bed, and she used religion as an excuse in our relationship because she didn\u2019t want to tell me she had been abused (she\u2019s never told anyone before, I\u2019m the only person besides her therapist who knows) but she also didn\u2019t want to have sex because it gives her PTSD. She cried as she told me about some of the sick stuff she went through, and promised to work on it so that our relationship will be stronger.. I felt a lot of emotions, mostly heartbreak.\n\nIt\u2019s been about 2 weeks since the truth came out. I want to be there for her but I can\u2019t help but look at her differently. I keep thinking about how much she lied to me over the years to keep this secret, and I don\u2019t want to be angry about it but I sort of am. She has opened up to me a lot and I listen, but most of the time I don\u2019t want to. I hate how what they did to her. I don\u2019t want to hear about it, I miss how it was when I didn\u2019t know. I hate admitting this but I wish she never told me. I don\u2019t know how to respond to this, and I certainly don\u2019t know how I\u2019m supposed to help her. I don\u2019t want to have sex with her anymore because I don\u2019t want her to think of them while she\u2019s with me. I\u2019m afraid that she will bring it up when we are together. I feel bad because I\u2019m the only one she can talk to about this besides her therapist also I recognize how much she must trust me to tell me this, I don\u2019t think I\u2019m the right guy to be with someone so damaged. When I thought she was just religious, I could get over that but now I realize that even if we are married one day, this will be a lifelong battle for her. And for me, as her partner. \n\nShe sensed my discomfort and asked me if it bothers me when she talks about it. I told her the truth, yes it does. She started crying and apologizing and I immediately felt guilty and told her I didn\u2019t mean it. Since then she hasn\u2019t brought it up again, she\u2019s very quiet now. I regret saying anything.\n\n Some part of me wants to run, I just would hate to lose someone so amazing. She really is the most amazing girl, I cannot say that enough. I know this abuse was not her fault at all. I\u2019m wondering if this is a normal initial response from a S/O of sexual abuse or if I really am just an asshole. If it\u2019s a normal response, I will stick it out longer and see how it goes. If I\u2019m just an asshole who is going to keep feeling this way, I think I should break up with her. I still love her so much. If I break up with her now I\u2019m also scared she will know that this is why and be scarred from opening up about it again forever. \n\nWIBTA to leave her? WIBTA to stay? Idk. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe guy has been in a three-year-and-three-month relationship with his girlfriend. They met in high school, and she had a reputation for being a tease, but she explained it was because she's religious and doesn't want to have sex before marriage. He was okay with it, even when he noticed she wasn't really religious in other aspects. After two years and seven months, they started a sexual relationship, but it wasn't fulfilling for him because she was timid and it felt like a chore. Then, after three years, she opens up about past sexual abuse by family members, which explains her issues. The author feels conflicted\u2014sympathetic but also angry that she lied about the reasons for her abstinence. He's now considering breaking up because he's uncomfortable and doesn't know how to support her, but also doesn't want to hurt her by leaving.\n\nSo the main points are: He's upset about her lying (using religion as an excuse instead of mentioning the abuse). He's struggling with guilt because he's the only one she's told besides her therapist. He's afraid of triggering her, doesn't want to have sex anymore, and is considering breaking up. He's also scared that if he breaks up, she'll be too scared to open up again.\n\nIs he in the wrong? Well, first, she trusted him enough to share her trauma. That's a big deal. She didn't have to tell him, but she did, which shows trust. The author's reaction is a mix of empathy and self-centered concerns. He's feeling burdened by the responsibility of supporting her, which might indicate he's not emotionally equipped to handle her trauma. Also, he was angry about the \"lie,\" but she had a good reason to protect herself by not disclosing the abuse earlier. He was okay with the religious excuse before, but now that he knows the truth, he's conflicted.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, when someone opens up about trauma, the partner's immediate reaction should be supportive. If he can't handle the emotional weight and is thinking of leaving, that's a problem. But he's also in a tough spot here. He loves her and doesn't want to abandon her, but he's overwhelmed. However, walking away from someone who's vulnerable and trusting you might be considered inconsiderate, even if he's struggling. He should consider how his decision affects her mental health. If he breaks up, it could re-traumatize her. But if he stays and is resentful, that's also not healthy for her.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? Well, he's not a bad person, but his reaction is a bit self-centered. He's acknowledging that he's the one who's uncomfortable and wants to leave, which is a personal struggle. However, the fact that he's contemplating leaving someone who's already in therapy and dealing with PTSD raises questions about his responsibility as a partner. The key here is that he's not being cruel or abusive; he's being honest about his feelings. But he's also aware that his leaving might hurt her more. The question is whether his choice to leave, even with good intentions, makes him in the wrong. If he's being honest with his feelings and not forcing himself to stay in a harmful situation, maybe he's not in the wrong. However, the way he's handling it\u2014by considering leaving without fully trying to work through it\u2014could be seen as inconsiderate. But given the circumstances, it's a complex situation. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) because he's not the abuser, and he's not forcing her to stay. However, if he's leaving out of his own discomfort without considering her well-being, that's more selfish. But the question is about whether he's in the wrong. If he's making a difficult decision based on his own emotional capacity, maybe not. But in terms of support, he should at least try to work through it. So maybe A (in the wrong) because he's walking away from a partner in need without giving it a proper try. But I'm a bit torn. The main issue is that he's choosing his own comfort over her needs, which is not great. So maybe A.\n"
