She is very smart, funny, nice, and beautiful. I felt very lucky that she showed interest in me and even eventually agreed to go out with me. Early into our relationship, guys were warning me around school not to get involved with her because apparently she had a reputation of being a tease. I never heard anything about it and I liked her too much to listen to that stuff.  After 3ish months together and doing nothing beyond light kissing, I started to wonder if maybe the rumors were true. I asked her about it and she told me that she has that reputation because she comes from a religious background and doesn\u2019t want to have sex before marriage. Guys always broke up with her when she refused to sleep with them and that\u2019s why she never told me. I admit I was disappointed, but I didn\u2019t care enough to stop going out with her. She was perfect in every other way and honestly she still is.\n\nOver time though I started to notice that she isn\u2019t that religious at all. I have no problem with that but I was frustrated that she was only religious in this one spot of her life. After 2 years together, I asked her about it. She told me that she does in fact want to have sex with me but after being raised with this mindset, it\u2019s hard for her to shake it. She asked me to give her some time and she will be ready. Well, after about 2 years and 7 months together, she was finally ready. We started a sexual relationship. It sadly wasn\u2019t at all like I\u2019d been dreaming it would be. She was very timid in bed. She was only willing to do certain positions and most of the time it seemed more like a chore for her than something she wanted, even if she had been the one who initiated it. I\u2019m not violent but I personally enjoy being a bit more aggressive in bed and she does not respond well to that at all. It started to believe that she is not attracted to me and this put a strain on our relationship.\n\nNow we have been together 3 years and 3 months. She started attending therapy for her depression a few months ago which I fully supported, but something came out that I was not expecting. She sat me down and told me that in therapy she had been discussing previous sexual abuse she experienced. It was brutal stuff. I won\u2019t go into detail out of respect but family members had raped her for years of her childhood. She explained that this is the reason for her holdups in bed, and she used religion as an excuse in our relationship because she didn\u2019t want to tell me she had been abused (she\u2019s never told anyone before, I\u2019m the only person besides her therapist who knows) but she also didn\u2019t want to have sex because it gives her PTSD. She cried as she told me about some of the sick stuff she went through, and promised to work on it so that our relationship will be stronger.. I felt a lot of emotions, mostly heartbreak.\n\nIt\u2019s been about 2 weeks since the truth came out. I want to be there for her but I can\u2019t help but look at her differently. I keep thinking about how much she lied to me over the years to keep this secret, and I don\u2019t want to be angry about it but I sort of am. She has opened up to me a lot and I listen, but most of the time I don\u2019t want to. I hate how what they did to her. I don\u2019t want to hear about it, I miss how it was when I didn\u2019t know. I hate admitting this but I wish she never told me. I don\u2019t know how to respond to this, and I certainly don\u2019t know how I\u2019m supposed to help her. I don\u2019t want to have sex with her anymore because I don\u2019t want her to think of them while she\u2019s with me. I\u2019m afraid that she will bring it up when we are together. I feel bad because I\u2019m the only one she can talk to about this besides her therapist also I recognize how much she must trust me to tell me this, I don\u2019t think I\u2019m the right guy to be with someone so damaged. When I thought she was just religious, I could get over that but now I realize that even if we are married one day, this will be a lifelong battle for her. And for me, as her partner. \n\nShe sensed my discomfort and asked me if it bothers me when she talks about it. I told her the truth, yes it does. She started crying and apologizing and I immediately felt guilty and told her I didn\u2019t mean it. Since then she hasn\u2019t brought it up again, she\u2019s very quiet now. I regret saying anything.\n\n Some part of me wants to run, I just would hate to lose someone so amazing. She really is the most amazing girl, I cannot say that enough. I know this abuse was not her fault at all. I\u2019m wondering if this is a normal initial response from a S/O of sexual abuse or if I really am just an asshole. If it\u2019s a normal response, I will stick it out longer and see how it goes. If I\u2019m just an asshole who is going to keep feeling this way, I think I should break up with her. I still love her so much. If I break up with her now I\u2019m also scared she will know that this is why and be scarred from opening up about it again forever. \n\nWIBTA to leave her? WIBTA to stay? Idk. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a breakup after the girlfriend reveals her past sexual abuse.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author, a guy in a 3.5-year relationship, broke up with his girlfriend after she opened up about being sexually abused as a child. The girlfriend had used religion as an excuse for not having sex earlier, but it turned out her reluctance was due to PTSD from the abuse. The author is conflicted\u2014he feels hurt she didn't tell him sooner, doesn't want to be in a relationship where he's constantly reminded of the trauma, and is considering breaking up. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B). \n\nThe girlfriend did reveal her trauma, which is a significant step. The author's reaction seems to be a mix of valid feelings\u2014discomfort, fear of being associated with her trauma, and maybe some frustration over being lied to about the religious excuse. However, the author does acknowledge her trust and the courage it took for her to share. \n\nBut he's also considering leaving her because he can't handle the emotional burden. The key here is whether walking away is justified. The girlfriend has a history of being abused and is in therapy. She's also the only person besides her therapist who knows about her past. If the author leaves, it might impact her recovery and trust in future relationships. \n\nThe author's feelings are valid\u2014he's struggling with the change in perception of his partner. However, staying in a relationship where he's unhappy and not willing to support her through this is a choice. But the ethical question here is whether he's in the wrong for ending the relationship, especially when she opened up to him in vulnerability. \n\nThe author is not being violent or abusive, but his decision to break up might be seen as abandoning her during a critical time. However, staying in an unhappy relationship isn't healthy for either party. The challenge is balancing his emotional needs with hers. \n\nSince the author is conflicted and doesn't want to hurt her, but also feels he can't support her properly, it's a complex situation. The fact that he's considering the impact on her and feels guilty suggests he's not entirely in the wrong. However, the act of leaving after she opened up might be seen as wrong because he's not giving her the support she might need. \n\nBut the question is whether he's in the wrong. The answer hinges on whether the decision to leave is justified. Since the author is struggling with his feelings and acknowledges her needs but can't reconcile his own, it's a tough call. Some might say he's in the wrong for not staying and supporting her, while others might argue he's not wrong if he can't provide the support she needs. \n\nGiven that the girlfriend is in therapy and might need support, the author's decision to leave could be seen as a failure to support her. However, if he's genuinely unable to cope, maybe it's not his fault. But the act of breaking up after she trusted him is a point against him. \n\nConsidering all that, the answer might lean towards A (the author is in the wrong) because he's choosing to leave after she took a big step to open up, which could retraumatize her. However, if the relationship is toxic for both, maybe B. But the main issue is that he's not in the wrong for having feelings, but he is in the wrong for acting on them without considering the consequences. \n\nI think the answer is A. The author is in the wrong for breaking up with her after she opened up about her trauma. He should have discussed his feelings more and tried to work through them together instead of immediately considering a breakup.\n"
