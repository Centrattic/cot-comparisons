She is very smart, funny, nice, and beautiful. I felt very lucky that she showed interest in me and even eventually agreed to go out with me. Early into our relationship, guys were warning me around school not to get involved with her because apparently she had a reputation of being a tease. I never heard anything about it and I liked her too much to listen to that stuff.  After 3ish months together and doing nothing beyond light kissing, I started to wonder if maybe the rumors were true. I asked her about it and she told me that she has that reputation because she comes from a religious background and doesn\u2019t want to have sex before marriage. Guys always broke up with her when she refused to sleep with them and that\u2019s why she never told me. I admit I was disappointed, but I didn\u2019t care enough to stop going out with her. She was perfect in every other way and honestly she still is.\n\nOver time though I started to notice that she isn\u2019t that religious at all. I have no problem with that but I was frustrated that she was only religious in this one spot of her life. After 2 years together, I asked her about it. She told me that she does in fact want to have sex with me but after being raised with this mindset, it\u2019s hard for her to shake it. She asked me to give her some time and she will be ready. Well, after about 2 years and 7 months together, she was finally ready. We started a sexual relationship. It sadly wasn\u2019t at all like I\u2019d been dreaming it would be. She was very timid in bed. She was only willing to do certain positions and most of the time it seemed more like a chore for her than something she wanted, even if she had been the one who initiated it. I\u2019m not violent but I personally enjoy being a bit more aggressive in bed and she does not respond well to that at all. It started to believe that she is not attracted to me and this put a strain on our relationship.\n\nNow we have been together 3 years and 3 months. She started attending therapy for her depression a few months ago which I fully supported, but something came out that I was not expecting. She sat me down and told me that in therapy she had been discussing previous sexual abuse she experienced. It was brutal stuff. I won\u2019t go into detail out of respect but family members had raped her for years of her childhood. She explained that this is the reason for her holdups in bed, and she used religion as an excuse in our relationship because she didn\u2019t want to tell me she had been abused (she\u2019s never told anyone before, I\u2019m the only person besides her therapist who knows) but she also didn\u2019t want to have sex because it gives her PTSD. She cried as she told me about some of the sick stuff she went through, and promised to work on it so that our relationship will be stronger.. I felt a lot of emotions, mostly heartbreak.\n\nIt\u2019s been about 2 weeks since the truth came out. I want to be there for her but I can\u2019t help but look at her differently. I keep thinking about how much she lied to me over the years to keep this secret, and I don\u2019t want to be angry about it but I sort of am. She has opened up to me a lot and I listen, but most of the time I don\u2019t want to. I hate how what they did to her. I don\u2019t want to hear about it, I miss how it was when I didn\u2019t know. I hate admitting this but I wish she never told me. I don\u2019t know how to respond to this, and I certainly don\u2019t know how I\u2019m supposed to help her. I don\u2019t want to have sex with her anymore because I don\u2019t want her to think of them while she\u2019s with me. I\u2019m afraid that she will bring it up when we are together. I feel bad because I\u2019m the only one she can talk to about this besides her therapist also I recognize how much she must trust me to tell me this, I don\u2019t think I\u2019m the right guy to be with someone so damaged. When I thought she was just religious, I could get over that but now I realize that even if we are married one day, this will be a lifelong battle for her. And for me, as her partner. \n\nShe sensed my discomfort and asked me if it bothers me when she talks about it. I told her the truth, yes it does. She started crying and apologizing and I immediately felt guilty and told her I didn\u2019t mean it. Since then she hasn\u2019t brought it up again, she\u2019s very quiet now. I regret saying anything.\n\n Some part of me wants to run, I just would hate to lose someone so amazing. She really is the most amazing girl, I cannot say that enough. I know this abuse was not her fault at all. I\u2019m wondering if this is a normal initial response from a S/O of sexual abuse or if I really am just an asshole. If it\u2019s a normal response, I will stick it out longer and see how it goes. If I\u2019m just an asshole who is going to keep feeling this way, I think I should break up with her. I still love her so much. If I break up with her now I\u2019m also scared she will know that this is why and be scarred from opening up about it again forever. \n\nWIBTA to leave her? WIBTA to stay? Idk. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The author is a guy who's been in a relationship with his girlfriend for three years and three months. She opened up to him about her past sexual abuse, which he didn't know about until after she went to therapy. Now he's feeling conflicted about staying with her. He's struggling with the fact that she lied about her reasons for not having sex (using religion as an excuse instead of her trauma), and he's having trouble handling the emotional and sexual aspects of their relationship now that he knows the truth.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether he's in the wrong. The key points here are about how he's responding to her trauma. She trusted him enough to share something deeply personal, which is a huge step for someone with PTSD. He did support her initially, but now he's feeling overwhelmed. He mentions that he can't be there for her anymore because the thought of her reliving her trauma during intimacy is too much for him. He's also considering breaking up because he's scared of causing her more distress by being with her.\n\nNow, considering his response: he's honest about his feelings, which is important. He told her that hearing about her trauma affects him, and she cried and apologized. He felt guilty and assured her he didn't mean it. But he's now considering leaving. The question is whether that makes him the bad guy.\n\nOn one hand, he's not in the wrong for having feelings and being honest with her. His feelings are valid, and it's okay to feel overwhelmed. However, the way he's processing this situation might be problematic. He's choosing to back away when she's in a vulnerable state, which could be seen as abandonment. Also, his initial reaction to her sharing such a sensitive topic might be a normal first response, but deciding to leave based on his discomfort could be hurtful. He also has to consider her mental health\u2014leaving might make her feel that her trauma is the reason for the breakup, which could be detrimental to her recovery.\n\nAnother angle: he supported her decision to go to therapy and was okay with her not being ready for sex. When she finally shared the real reason, he felt he couldn't handle it. It's important to note that supporting a partner with PTSD requires patience and understanding. If he's not able to provide that, then maybe he's not in the wrong for choosing to step back, but he should do so with care and ensure she has other support systems in place.\n\nHowever, breaking up because he's uncomfortable with her trauma, even if it's a valid feeling, could be seen as selfish. He's the one who has the luxury of choosing to leave, while she's the one dealing with the trauma. It's a tough situation because staying might mean both have to work through these issues, but leaving could be the lesser of two evils if he's not equipped to handle it. But in terms of being \"in the wrong,\" it's more about his intentions and actions. He's honest and tried to communicate, but deciding to leave might be a responsible choice if he can't be supportive, rather than being in the wrong.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The author is not in the wrong for feeling overwhelmed and considering leaving, as long as he handles it with care and doesn't blame her. But he could be criticized for not doing enough to support her, but given the context, it's more about his personal limits. The answer might be B (No), because he's not necessarily at fault for his feelings, though the situation is complex.\n"
