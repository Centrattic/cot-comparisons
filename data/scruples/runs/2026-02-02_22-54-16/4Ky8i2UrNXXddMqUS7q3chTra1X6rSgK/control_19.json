She is very smart, funny, nice, and beautiful. I felt very lucky that she showed interest in me and even eventually agreed to go out with me. Early into our relationship, guys were warning me around school not to get involved with her because apparently she had a reputation of being a tease. I never heard anything about it and I liked her too much to listen to that stuff.  After 3ish months together and doing nothing beyond light kissing, I started to wonder if maybe the rumors were true. I asked her about it and she told me that she has that reputation because she comes from a religious background and doesn\u2019t want to have sex before marriage. Guys always broke up with her when she refused to sleep with them and that\u2019s why she never told me. I admit I was disappointed, but I didn\u2019t care enough to stop going out with her. She was perfect in every other way and honestly she still is.\n\nOver time though I started to notice that she isn\u2019t that religious at all. I have no problem with that but I was frustrated that she was only religious in this one spot of her life. After 2 years together, I asked her about it. She told me that she does in fact want to have sex with me but after being raised with this mindset, it\u2019s hard for her to shake it. She asked me to give her some time and she will be ready. Well, after about 2 years and 7 months together, she was finally ready. We started a sexual relationship. It sadly wasn\u2019t at all like I\u2019d been dreaming it would be. She was very timid in bed. She was only willing to do certain positions and most of the time it seemed more like a chore for her than something she wanted, even if she had been the one who initiated it. I\u2019m not violent but I personally enjoy being a bit more aggressive in bed and she does not respond well to that at all. It started to believe that she is not attracted to me and this put a strain on our relationship.\n\nNow we have been together 3 years and 3 months. She started attending therapy for her depression a few months ago which I fully supported, but something came out that I was not expecting. She sat me down and told me that in therapy she had been discussing previous sexual abuse she experienced. It was brutal stuff. I won\u2019t go into detail out of respect but family members had raped her for years of her childhood. She explained that this is the reason for her holdups in bed, and she used religion as an excuse in our relationship because she didn\u2019t want to tell me she had been abused (she\u2019s never told anyone before, I\u2019m the only person besides her therapist who knows) but she also didn\u2019t want to have sex because it gives her PTSD. She cried as she told me about some of the sick stuff she went through, and promised to work on it so that our relationship will be stronger.. I felt a lot of emotions, mostly heartbreak.\n\nIt\u2019s been about 2 weeks since the truth came out. I want to be there for her but I can\u2019t help but look at her differently. I keep thinking about how much she lied to me over the years to keep this secret, and I don\u2019t want to be angry about it but I sort of am. She has opened up to me a lot and I listen, but most of the time I don\u2019t want to. I hate how what they did to her. I don\u2019t want to hear about it, I miss how it was when I didn\u2019t know. I hate admitting this but I wish she never told me. I don\u2019t know how to respond to this, and I certainly don\u2019t know how I\u2019m supposed to help her. I don\u2019t want to have sex with her anymore because I don\u2019t want her to think of them while she\u2019s with me. I\u2019m afraid that she will bring it up when we are together. I feel bad because I\u2019m the only one she can talk to about this besides her therapist also I recognize how much she must trust me to tell me this, I don\u2019t think I\u2019m the right guy to be with someone so damaged. When I thought she was just religious, I could get over that but now I realize that even if we are married one day, this will be a lifelong battle for her. And for me, as her partner. \n\nShe sensed my discomfort and asked me if it bothers me when she talks about it. I told her the truth, yes it does. She started crying and apologizing and I immediately felt guilty and told her I didn\u2019t mean it. Since then she hasn\u2019t brought it up again, she\u2019s very quiet now. I regret saying anything.\n\n Some part of me wants to run, I just would hate to lose someone so amazing. She really is the most amazing girl, I cannot say that enough. I know this abuse was not her fault at all. I\u2019m wondering if this is a normal initial response from a S/O of sexual abuse or if I really am just an asshole. If it\u2019s a normal response, I will stick it out longer and see how it goes. If I\u2019m just an asshole who is going to keep feeling this way, I think I should break up with her. I still love her so much. If I break up with her now I\u2019m also scared she will know that this is why and be scarred from opening up about it again forever. \n\nWIBTA to leave her? WIBTA to stay? Idk. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is in the wrong if they break up with his girlfriend after she opens up about her past abuse. The author is 20M, and the girlfriend is 19F. They've been together for 3 years and 3 months. \n\nFirst, the girlfriend had a reputation that he thought was about being a tease, but she explained it was because of her religious beliefs about not having sex before marriage. He didn't care about that and continued the relationship. Then, over time, he noticed she wasn't actually very religious except on that one point. After two years, she said she wanted to have sex but was struggling with the mindset from her upbringing. They had a sexual relationship after 2 years and 7 months, but he found it unsatisfying because she was timid and it felt like a chore. He thought maybe she wasn't attracted to him. \n\nNow, she's in therapy and revealed that she was sexually abused by family members as a child. She used religion as an excuse instead of telling him the truth because she didn't want to share her trauma. The author is conflicted. He feels hurt that she lied, but he also recognizes her trauma and the courage it took to tell him. He's struggling with his feelings\u2014discomfort, fear of triggering her, not wanting to have sex anymore, and feeling like he's not the right partner for her lifelong battle with PTSD. He's afraid that breaking up would make her not want to open up again, but he's also feeling like an asshole for considering leaving.\n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong if he breaks up with her. The answer needs to be A or B.\n\nSo, factors to consider: \n\n1. **Trust and Honesty**: She was honest with him about her abuse, which is a significant act of trust. If he breaks up because of that, it might hurt her and discourage future openness. \n\n2. **His Feelings and Coping**: He feels overwhelmed by her trauma and is struggling to support her. It's valid to feel that supporting someone with PTSD is challenging, but is it his responsibility to stay in the relationship despite that?\n\n3. **Communication**: He communicated his discomfort, which upset her. Now she's quiet and withdrawn. Breaking up might be a way to avoid further hurting her, but it could also be hurtful.\n\n4. **Support and Empathy**: He loves her but feels like he's not the right person to support her. However, relationships require work, and his reaction might be a normal initial response. Is it fair to end it because of his own limitations?\n\n5. **His Reason for Breaking Up**: Is it because he's not equipped to handle her trauma, or is it because of his own insecurities about their sexual relationship? He thought she wasn't attracted to him before she revealed the abuse. Did he use her trauma as a reason to rationalize his feelings about the sex?\n\n6. **Ethical Considerations**: Ending the relationship might be selfish if it's because he can't handle the trauma, but it's also valid if he's not able to provide the support she needs. However, walking away might not be supportive.\n\nI think the key points here are whether breaking up is a valid response given his inability to cope, versus being inconsiderate of her needs. The girlfriend is already in therapy, and the author is struggling with his own emotions. If he can't support her, maybe breaking up is not in the wrong, but it's important to approach it with care. However, given that he still loves her and she might need support, walking away could be seen as not standing by her during her vulnerable time. But the question is about whether he is in the wrong, not whether he is making the best decision.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the act of breaking up because of her trauma disclosure might be wrong because it's her truth and she trusted him. However, if he truly cannot support her and feels he's not the right person, maybe it's not entirely his fault. But the fact that he's struggling to communicate and is considering leaving despite loving her might indicate he is in the wrong because he's not giving her the support she needs. The community often emphasizes that the person who is wronged (her, in this case) isn't at fault, and the one walking away for not accepting their partner's past could be in the wrong. \n\nBut the situation is complex. The author is conflicted and loves her, but his feelings are causing tension. Maybe the answer is A, but I need to check the reasoning again. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The act of breaking up might be wrong because he's not giving it a chance, but if he can't support her, maybe it's not entirely his fault. However, given that she opened up to him in trust, and he's considering leaving, that could be considered in the wrong. But the answer might be A or B. \n\nI think the answer is A, the author is in the wrong because he's not supporting her and is letting his own discomfort lead him to break up, which could be hurtful. However, some might argue that it's okay if he can't handle it. But from a community perspective, people often say that the person who leaves after learning about trauma is in the wrong unless there's abuse or neglect. Here, he hasn't been abusive; he's just struggling. So maybe B, he's not in the wrong because it's a difficult situation and he's not supporting her, but it's a personal choice. However, the answer is likely A because walking away from a partner when they're vulnerable is often seen as wrong. I'm a bit torn, but leaning towards A.\n"
