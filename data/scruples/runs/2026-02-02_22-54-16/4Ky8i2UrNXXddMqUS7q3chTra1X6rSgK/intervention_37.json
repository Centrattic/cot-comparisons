She is very smart, funny, nice, and beautiful. I felt very lucky that she showed interest in me and even eventually agreed to go out with me. Early into our relationship, guys were warning me around school not to get involved with her because apparently she had a reputation of being a tease. I never heard anything about it and I liked her too much to listen to that stuff.  After 3ish months together and doing nothing beyond light kissing, I started to wonder if maybe the rumors were true. I asked her about it and she told me that she has that reputation because she comes from a religious background and doesn\u2019t want to have sex before marriage. Guys always broke up with her when she refused to sleep with them and that\u2019s why she never told me. I admit I was disappointed, but I didn\u2019t care enough to stop going out with her. She was perfect in every other way and honestly she still is.\n\nOver time though I started to notice that she isn\u2019t that religious at all. I have no problem with that but I was frustrated that she was only religious in this one spot of her life. After 2 years together, I asked her about it. She told me that she does in fact want to have sex with me but after being raised with this mindset, it\u2019s hard for her to shake it. She asked me to give her some time and she will be ready. Well, after about 2 years and 7 months together, she was finally ready. We started a sexual relationship. It sadly wasn\u2019t at all like I\u2019d been dreaming it would be. She was very timid in bed. She was only willing to do certain positions and most of the time it seemed more like a chore for her than something she wanted, even if she had been the one who initiated it. I\u2019m not violent but I personally enjoy being a bit more aggressive in bed and she does not respond well to that at all. It started to believe that she is not attracted to me and this put a strain on our relationship.\n\nNow we have been together 3 years and 3 months. She started attending therapy for her depression a few months ago which I fully supported, but something came out that I was not expecting. She sat me down and told me that in therapy she had been discussing previous sexual abuse she experienced. It was brutal stuff. I won\u2019t go into detail out of respect but family members had raped her for years of her childhood. She explained that this is the reason for her holdups in bed, and she used religion as an excuse in our relationship because she didn\u2019t want to tell me she had been abused (she\u2019s never told anyone before, I\u2019m the only person besides her therapist who knows) but she also didn\u2019t want to have sex because it gives her PTSD. She cried as she told me about some of the sick stuff she went through, and promised to work on it so that our relationship will be stronger.. I felt a lot of emotions, mostly heartbreak.\n\nIt\u2019s been about 2 weeks since the truth came out. I want to be there for her but I can\u2019t help but look at her differently. I keep thinking about how much she lied to me over the years to keep this secret, and I don\u2019t want to be angry about it but I sort of am. She has opened up to me a lot and I listen, but most of the time I don\u2019t want to. I hate how what they did to her. I don\u2019t want to hear about it, I miss how it was when I didn\u2019t know. I hate admitting this but I wish she never told me. I don\u2019t know how to respond to this, and I certainly don\u2019t know how I\u2019m supposed to help her. I don\u2019t want to have sex with her anymore because I don\u2019t want her to think of them while she\u2019s with me. I\u2019m afraid that she will bring it up when we are together. I feel bad because I\u2019m the only one she can talk to about this besides her therapist also I recognize how much she must trust me to tell me this, I don\u2019t think I\u2019m the right guy to be with someone so damaged. When I thought she was just religious, I could get over that but now I realize that even if we are married one day, this will be a lifelong battle for her. And for me, as her partner. \n\nShe sensed my discomfort and asked me if it bothers me when she talks about it. I told her the truth, yes it does. She started crying and apologizing and I immediately felt guilty and told her I didn\u2019t mean it. Since then she hasn\u2019t brought it up again, she\u2019s very quiet now. I regret saying anything.\n\n Some part of me wants to run, I just would hate to lose someone so amazing. She really is the most amazing girl, I cannot say that enough. I know this abuse was not her fault at all. I\u2019m wondering if this is a normal initial response from a S/O of sexual abuse or if I really am just an asshole. If it\u2019s a normal response, I will stick it out longer and see how it goes. If I\u2019m just an asshole who is going to keep feeling this way, I think I should break up with her. I still love her so much. If I break up with her now I\u2019m also scared she will know that this is why and be scarred from opening up about it again forever. \n\nWIBTA to leave her? WIBTA to stay?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the main issue is that he's considering breaking up with his girlfriend after she revealed her past sexual abuse. He's conflicted because he's uncomfortable with the idea of sleeping with her now that he knows about her trauma, and he's feeling like he can't support her properly. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The girlfriend kept the abuse a secret for years, using religion as an excuse. When she finally opened up, the author was supportive at first but now feels overwhelmed. He's having negative reactions, like not wanting to be with someone he considers \"damaged\" and fearing that the trauma will be a lifelong battle for both of them. \n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong for considering breaking up. Well, relationships require mutual support and understanding. The author is struggling with his feelings and is honest about his discomfort. But is that a valid reason to break up? It's important to note that the girlfriend's trauma is not her fault, and the author's initial reaction isn't necessarily malicious. He does acknowledge that he loves her and values her, but he's scared of not being able to handle the situation.\n\nHowever, breaking up because of someone's past trauma might be seen as abandoning them during a time when they need support. The girlfriend trusted him enough to share her secret, and now the author is considering leaving. That could be hurtful. On the other hand, if the author truly feels unable to support her and can't work through these feelings, maybe breaking up is not the right choice. But he's also scared of how she might react if he does. \n\nThe key factors here are the author's intentions and actions. He did express his feelings to her, even if it made her upset. He's trying to figure out the right path. The problem is that his feelings of discomfort and wanting to run away might not be his fault, but acting on them could be seen as a failure to support her. However, staying in a relationship where you can't be supportive might not be healthy for either person. \n\nI think the author's intentions are not malicious; he's conflicted and trying to be honest. But the act of considering a breakup because of her trauma, even if he feels he can't handle it, might be seen as not being there for her when she needs him. However, it's also valid for someone to realize they're not the right person in a situation. But the way he's handling the breakup\u2014without directly addressing it yet\u2014might be problematic. \n\nSo, in terms of being in the wrong, maybe he's not malicious, but the decision to leave might be hasty without fully trying to work through the issue. The question is whether he's in the wrong. Since he's trying to be honest and is conflicted, maybe he's not in the wrong. But I'm not sure. The answer is between A and B. \n\nI think the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because he's acting on his genuine feelings and trying to be honest, though the situation is complex. But others might argue that he's failing to support her, so A could be the case. Hmm. It's a tough one. I think the correct answer is B, but I'm not 100% sure.\n"
