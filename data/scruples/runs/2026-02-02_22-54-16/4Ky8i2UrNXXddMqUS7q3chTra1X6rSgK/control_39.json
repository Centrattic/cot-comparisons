She is very smart, funny, nice, and beautiful. I felt very lucky that she showed interest in me and even eventually agreed to go out with me. Early into our relationship, guys were warning me around school not to get involved with her because apparently she had a reputation of being a tease. I never heard anything about it and I liked her too much to listen to that stuff.  After 3ish months together and doing nothing beyond light kissing, I started to wonder if maybe the rumors were true. I asked her about it and she told me that she has that reputation because she comes from a religious background and doesn\u2019t want to have sex before marriage. Guys always broke up with her when she refused to sleep with them and that\u2019s why she never told me. I admit I was disappointed, but I didn\u2019t care enough to stop going out with her. She was perfect in every other way and honestly she still is.\n\nOver time though I started to notice that she isn\u2019t that religious at all. I have no problem with that but I was frustrated that she was only religious in this one spot of her life. After 2 years together, I asked her about it. She told me that she does in fact want to have sex with me but after being raised with this mindset, it\u2019s hard for her to shake it. She asked me to give her some time and she will be ready. Well, after about 2 years and 7 months together, she was finally ready. We started a sexual relationship. It sadly wasn\u2019t at all like I\u2019d been dreaming it would be. She was very timid in bed. She was only willing to do certain positions and most of the time it seemed more like a chore for her than something she wanted, even if she had been the one who initiated it. I\u2019m not violent but I personally enjoy being a bit more aggressive in bed and she does not respond well to that at all. It started to believe that she is not attracted to me and this put a strain on our relationship.\n\nNow we have been together 3 years and 3 months. She started attending therapy for her depression a few months ago which I fully supported, but something came out that I was not expecting. She sat me down and told me that in therapy she had been discussing previous sexual abuse she experienced. It was brutal stuff. I won\u2019t go into detail out of respect but family members had raped her for years of her childhood. She explained that this is the reason for her holdups in bed, and she used religion as an excuse in our relationship because she didn\u2019t want to tell me she had been abused (she\u2019s never told anyone before, I\u2019m the only person besides her therapist who knows) but she also didn\u2019t want to have sex because it gives her PTSD. She cried as she told me about some of the sick stuff she went through, and promised to work on it so that our relationship will be stronger.. I felt a lot of emotions, mostly heartbreak.\n\nIt\u2019s been about 2 weeks since the truth came out. I want to be there for her but I can\u2019t help but look at her differently. I keep thinking about how much she lied to me over the years to keep this secret, and I don\u2019t want to be angry about it but I sort of am. She has opened up to me a lot and I listen, but most of the time I don\u2019t want to. I hate how what they did to her. I don\u2019t want to hear about it, I miss how it was when I didn\u2019t know. I hate admitting this but I wish she never told me. I don\u2019t know how to respond to this, and I certainly don\u2019t know how I\u2019m supposed to help her. I don\u2019t want to have sex with her anymore because I don\u2019t want her to think of them while she\u2019s with me. I\u2019m afraid that she will bring it up when we are together. I feel bad because I\u2019m the only one she can talk to about this besides her therapist also I recognize how much she must trust me to tell me this, I don\u2019t think I\u2019m the right guy to be with someone so damaged. When I thought she was just religious, I could get over that but now I realize that even if we are married one day, this will be a lifelong battle for her. And for me, as her partner. \n\nShe sensed my discomfort and asked me if it bothers me when she talks about it. I told her the truth, yes it does. She started crying and apologizing and I immediately felt guilty and told her I didn\u2019t mean it. Since then she hasn\u2019t brought it up again, she\u2019s very quiet now. I regret saying anything.\n\n Some part of me wants to run, I just would hate to lose someone so amazing. She really is the most amazing girl, I cannot say that enough. I know this abuse was not her fault at all. I\u2019m wondering if this is a normal initial response from a S/O of sexual abuse or if I really am just an asshole. If it\u2019s a normal response, I will stick it out longer and see how it goes. If I\u2019m just an asshole who is going to keep feeling this way, I think I should break up with her. I still love her so much. If I break up with her now I\u2019m also scared she will know that this is why and be scarred from opening up about it again forever. \n\nWIBTA to leave her? WIBTA to stay?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author is a guy who's been in a relationship with his girlfriend for over three years. She finally opened up to him about her past sexual abuse after keeping it a secret for a long time, using religion as an excuse instead. Now he's feeling conflicted and considering breaking up with her, even though he loves her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The girlfriend decided to share something extremely personal and traumatic. That's a big deal. She probably felt safe enough to tell him after years together. The author is upset because he feels lied to, even though she had her reasons. He's also struggling with how to handle the situation emotionally, which is normal under pressure.\n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong for considering the breakup. Well, he's not at fault for having feelings or being overwhelmed. It's normal to feel shocked or even a bit betrayed when a partner discloses something like that, especially after years of a certain narrative. But the key here is his response. He's thinking about leaving her because he can't handle the emotional burden and doesn't want to be with someone who's \"damaged.\" That's where the problem lies. \n\nThe girlfriend is dealing with PTSD from abuse, which is a serious mental health issue. The author's reaction might stem from not knowing how to support her, but using that as a reason to break up is questionable. He mentions he still loves her and is conflicted, which shows he cares. However, his decision to walk away could be seen as abandoning her when she's most vulnerable. \n\nOn the other hand, relationships require both partners to be on the same page. If he can't support her through this, maybe it's not fair to her to stay together. But breaking up because of her trauma and past is a red flag. It's important to note that she didn't hide her trauma out of malice but to protect herself. The author's guilt after being honest shows he's aware of his feelings and the potential harm, which is a good sign. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit nuanced. The author isn't in the wrong for feeling conflicted, but if he chooses to leave based on her trauma, that could be seen as unfair. However, considering his honesty and the fact that he's struggling, maybe he's not entirely to blame. Still, the responsibility for staying with her would require him to work through these feelings, not just take the easy way out. \n\nI think the main issue is that he's considering leaving because of her past, which is not her fault. The wrong here would be on him if he decides to leave, but the question is whether he is in the wrong for considering it. Given that he's in a state of conflict and hasn't acted yet, maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong yet), but if he follows through, that's where the wrong would be. Since the question is about the current situation, and he's seeking advice, the answer might be B because he hasn't acted yet and he's aware of the potential consequences. However, some might argue that his intentions to leave due to her trauma are wrong regardless. But the question is whether he is in the wrong now, not if he will be if he breaks up. So maybe B is the safer answer here.\n"
