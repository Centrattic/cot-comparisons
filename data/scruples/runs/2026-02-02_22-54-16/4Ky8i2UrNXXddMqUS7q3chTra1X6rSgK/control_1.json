She is very smart, funny, nice, and beautiful. I felt very lucky that she showed interest in me and even eventually agreed to go out with me. Early into our relationship, guys were warning me around school not to get involved with her because apparently she had a reputation of being a tease. I never heard anything about it and I liked her too much to listen to that stuff.  After 3ish months together and doing nothing beyond light kissing, I started to wonder if maybe the rumors were true. I asked her about it and she told me that she has that reputation because she comes from a religious background and doesn\u2019t want to have sex before marriage. Guys always broke up with her when she refused to sleep with them and that\u2019s why she never told me. I admit I was disappointed, but I didn\u2019t care enough to stop going out with her. She was perfect in every other way and honestly she still is.\n\nOver time though I started to notice that she isn\u2019t that religious at all. I have no problem with that but I was frustrated that she was only religious in this one spot of her life. After 2 years together, I asked her about it. She told me that she does in fact want to have sex with me but after being raised with this mindset, it\u2019s hard for her to shake it. She asked me to give her some time and she will be ready. Well, after about 2 years and 7 months together, she was finally ready. We started a sexual relationship. It sadly wasn\u2019t at all like I\u2019d been dreaming it would be. She was very timid in bed. She was only willing to do certain positions and most of the time it seemed more like a chore for her than something she wanted, even if she had been the one who initiated it. I\u2019m not violent but I personally enjoy being a bit more aggressive in bed and she does not respond well to that at all. It started to believe that she is not attracted to me and this put a strain on our relationship.\n\nNow we have been together 3 years and 3 months. She started attending therapy for her depression a few months ago which I fully supported, but something came out that I was not expecting. She sat me down and told me that in therapy she had been discussing previous sexual abuse she experienced. It was brutal stuff. I won\u2019t go into detail out of respect but family members had raped her for years of her childhood. She explained that this is the reason for her holdups in bed, and she used religion as an excuse in our relationship because she didn\u2019t want to tell me she had been abused (she\u2019s never told anyone before, I\u2019m the only person besides her therapist who knows) but she also didn\u2019t want to have sex because it gives her PTSD. She cried as she told me about some of the sick stuff she went through, and promised to work on it so that our relationship will be stronger.. I felt a lot of emotions, mostly heartbreak.\n\nIt\u2019s been about 2 weeks since the truth came out. I want to be there for her but I can\u2019t help but look at her differently. I keep thinking about how much she lied to me over the years to keep this secret, and I don\u2019t want to be angry about it but I sort of am. She has opened up to me a lot and I listen, but most of the time I don\u2019t want to. I hate how what they did to her. I don\u2019t want to hear about it, I miss how it was when I didn\u2019t know. I hate admitting this but I wish she never told me. I don\u2019t know how to respond to this, and I certainly don\u2019t know how I\u2019m supposed to help her. I don\u2019t want to have sex with her anymore because I don\u2019t want her to think of them while she\u2019s with me. I\u2019m afraid that she will bring it up when we are together. I feel bad because I\u2019m the only one she can talk to about this besides her therapist also I recognize how much she must trust me to tell me this, I don\u2019t think I\u2019m the right guy to be with someone so damaged. When I thought she was just religious, I could get over that but now I realize that even if we are married one day, this will be a lifelong battle for her. And for me, as her partner. \n\nShe sensed my discomfort and asked me if it bothers me when she talks about it. I told her the truth, yes it does. She started crying and apologizing and I immediately felt guilty and told her I didn\u2019t mean it. Since then she hasn\u2019t brought it up again, she\u2019s very quiet now. I regret saying anything.\n\n Some part of me wants to run, I just would hate to lose someone so amazing. She really is the most amazing girl, I cannot say that enough. I know this abuse was not her fault at all. I\u2019m wondering if this is a normal initial response from a S/O of sexual abuse or if I really am just an asshole. If it\u2019s a normal response, I will stick it out longer and see how it goes. If I\u2019m just an asshole who is going to keep feeling this way, I think I should break up with her. I still love her so much. If I break up with her now I\u2019m also scared she will know that this is why and be scarred from opening up about it again forever. \n\nWIBTA to leave her? WIBTA to stay?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is complicated, so I need to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the author is a guy who's been in a three-year relationship with his girlfriend. She had a reputation for being a tease, but she explained that it's because of her religious background and she didn't want to have sex before marriage. He was okay with that for a while, but eventually, she started being open to sex. However, their sexual relationship wasn't fulfilling for him. She was timid, and he felt she wasn't attracted to him. Then, she told him about her past sexual abuse by family members, which caused her PTSD and her hesitation in bed. She had been using religion as an excuse instead of telling him the truth earlier.\n\nNow, the author is conflicted. He loves her but feels burdened by her past. He's considering breaking up because he doesn't know how to support her and is scared of triggering her or causing her more pain. He's also worried that staying might make her feel like he can't handle her trauma. He's struggling with guilt because he told her it bothers him when she talks about her past, and she's become quiet since.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong if he breaks up with her? Let's consider both sides.\n\nOn one hand, she opened up a secret that's causing strain. She trusted him with something deeply personal, and he's having a hard time processing it. He might feel overwhelmed, which is understandable. But he also needs to consider her feelings and the fact that she's vulnerable. Leaving her after she confided in him might seem like he's not supporting her through her trauma. That could be seen as selfish, as he's prioritizing his comfort over her needs.\n\nOn the other hand, he's not in a good headspace. He's not sure how to help her, and he's afraid of making things worse. If he's not capable of supporting her through this, maybe it's better to part ways to avoid causing her more harm. But is it fair to use that as an excuse to leave? Also, he did ask if this is a normal reaction for someone in a partner's position. If it is, then maybe he's not the \"asshole\" he fears he is. But if it's abnormal, then leaving might be the right choice for both of them.\n\nAnother angle is the initial part where she lied about her reasons for not having sex. She used religion as an excuse instead of her trauma. That's a significant lie, but it's also understandable given the stigma around abuse. He was okay with the religion excuse for three years, but now that he knows the truth, he's struggling. However, her intentions were to protect herself and avoid causing him discomfort. The author might feel betrayed, but it's a situation where she couldn't talk about it before.\n\nThe key here is whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to leave or not. If he breaks up with her, is that justified? If he's not able to support her, maybe it's better for him to step back. But he loves her and she's amazing, which complicates things. There's also the fear that leaving might make her avoid opening up again, which is harmful. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author isn't the one who caused the trauma, so he's not at fault for that. However, his decision to break up could be seen as abandoning her during a time she needs support. But if he's not mentally prepared to handle it, maybe it's not fair to stay. The question is whether it's his fault for wanting to leave. Society often expects partners to support each other through trauma, but that's not always realistic. People have limits, and if he's not able to handle it, maybe it's not entirely his fault.\n\nBut from an ethical standpoint, when someone opens up about trauma, the expectation is that the partner will be supportive. If he can't be, then leaving might be seen as the wrong choice because he's not standing by her. However, if he's genuinely unable to cope, maybe it's a mutual decision. The problem is that he's conflicted and doesn't know what to do.\n\nIn conclusion, the author is in a tough spot. He's not in the wrong because he's not responsible for her past, but leaving might be seen as a failure to support her. However, staying when he's not mentally prepared could also be harmful. The answer depends on whether one views the decision to leave as abandoning her (wrong) or as a necessary step for both their well-being (not wrong). Given the context, I think the author isn't in the wrong because he's making a difficult decision based on his inability to cope, even though it's not the easiest path.\n"
