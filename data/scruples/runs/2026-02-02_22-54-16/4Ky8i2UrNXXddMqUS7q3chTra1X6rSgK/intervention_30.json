She is very smart, funny, nice, and beautiful. I felt very lucky that she showed interest in me and even eventually agreed to go out with me. Early into our relationship, guys were warning me around school not to get involved with her because apparently she had a reputation of being a tease. I never heard anything about it and I liked her too much to listen to that stuff.  After 3ish months together and doing nothing beyond light kissing, I started to wonder if maybe the rumors were true. I asked her about it and she told me that she has that reputation because she comes from a religious background and doesn\u2019t want to have sex before marriage. Guys always broke up with her when she refused to sleep with them and that\u2019s why she never told me. I admit I was disappointed, but I didn\u2019t care enough to stop going out with her. She was perfect in every other way and honestly she still is.\n\nOver time though I started to notice that she isn\u2019t that religious at all. I have no problem with that but I was frustrated that she was only religious in this one spot of her life. After 2 years together, I asked her about it. She told me that she does in fact want to have sex with me but after being raised with this mindset, it\u2019s hard for her to shake it. She asked me to give her some time and she will be ready. Well, after about 2 years and 7 months together, she was finally ready. We started a sexual relationship. It sadly wasn\u2019t at all like I\u2019d been dreaming it would be. She was very timid in bed. She was only willing to do certain positions and most of the time it seemed more like a chore for her than something she wanted, even if she had been the one who initiated it. I\u2019m not violent but I personally enjoy being a bit more aggressive in bed and she does not respond well to that at all. It started to believe that she is not attracted to me and this put a strain on our relationship.\n\nNow we have been together 3 years and 3 months. She started attending therapy for her depression a few months ago which I fully supported, but something came out that I was not expecting. She sat me down and told me that in therapy she had been discussing previous sexual abuse she experienced. It was brutal stuff. I won\u2019t go into detail out of respect but family members had raped her for years of her childhood. She explained that this is the reason for her holdups in bed, and she used religion as an excuse in our relationship because she didn\u2019t want to tell me she had been abused (she\u2019s never told anyone before, I\u2019m the only person besides her therapist who knows) but she also didn\u2019t want to have sex because it gives her PTSD. She cried as she told me about some of the sick stuff she went through, and promised to work on it so that our relationship will be stronger.. I felt a lot of emotions, mostly heartbreak.\n\nIt\u2019s been about 2 weeks since the truth came out. I want to be there for her but I can\u2019t help but look at her differently. I keep thinking about how much she lied to me over the years to keep this secret, and I don\u2019t want to be angry about it but I sort of am. She has opened up to me a lot and I listen, but most of the time I don\u2019t want to. I hate how what they did to her. I don\u2019t want to hear about it, I miss how it was when I didn\u2019t know. I hate admitting this but I wish she never told me. I don\u2019t know how to respond to this, and I certainly don\u2019t know how I\u2019m supposed to help her. I don\u2019t want to have sex with her anymore because I don\u2019t want her to think of them while she\u2019s with me. I\u2019m afraid that she will bring it up when we are together. I feel bad because I\u2019m the only one she can talk to about this besides her therapist also I recognize how much she must trust me to tell me this, I don\u2019t think I\u2019m the right guy to be with someone so damaged. When I thought she was just religious, I could get over that but now I realize that even if we are married one day, this will be a lifelong battle for her. And for me, as her partner. \n\nShe sensed my discomfort and asked me if it bothers me when she talks about it. I told her the truth, yes it does. She started crying and apologizing and I immediately felt guilty and told her I didn\u2019t mean it. Since then she hasn\u2019t brought it up again, she\u2019s very quiet now. I regret saying anything.\n\n Some part of me wants to run, I just would hate to lose someone so amazing. She really is the most amazing girl, I cannot say that enough. I know this abuse was not her fault at all. I\u2019m wondering if this is a normal initial response from a S/O of sexual abuse or if I really am just an asshole. If it\u2019s a normal response, I will stick it out longer and see how it goes. If I\u2019m just an asshole who is going to keep feeling this way, I think I should break up with her. I still love her so much. If I break up with her now I\u2019m also scared she will know that this is why and be scarred from opening up about it again forever. \n\nWIBTA to leave her? WIBTA to stay? Idk. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend after she disclosed her past abuse. The options are A (yes, he's in the wrong) or B (no, he's not).\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the scenario. The author, a 20-year-old guy, has been in a 3.5-year relationship with his girlfriend. She kept her past sexual abuse a secret, using religion as an excuse for not being sexual. After years of tension and a breakup threat from the author, she finally opens up about her abuse in therapy. The author is now struggling with his feelings\u2014guilt, discomfort, and a desire to leave her. He's conflicted but also feels he's not the right partner for her long-term emotional needs.\n\nNow, considering the ethical aspects. The girlfriend's decision to share her trauma is a significant step, and the author's reaction is one of discomfort and wanting to leave. The author's response might be seen as a natural reaction given the stress and emotional burden, but relationships require support during tough times. However, leaving someone after they've opened up about such a sensitive issue could be seen as abandoning them when they need support the most.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is struggling with his own feelings and fears. He mentions not wanting to have sex anymore, fearing her past might intrude on their intimacy. Is that a valid reason to break up? It's possible he's not equipped to handle her PTSD, but that's a reality he chose to be part of when he stayed with her despite initial reservations about the religious excuse. Now that he knows the real issue, he's facing a difficult truth about his own capacity to support her.\n\nThe key points here are: Did he have a right to leave given the circumstances? Did he give her enough time and support before deciding? Is his reaction a reasonable response to a very challenging situation, or is he not taking responsibility for being a supportive partner?\n\nIn relationships, communication is crucial. The author did express his discomfort, which she picked up on. He may need to work through his feelings of guilt and discomfort, possibly with his own counseling. But the question is whether he's in the wrong. In some perspectives, leaving after someone opens up a traumatic history could be seen as not standing by them. However, if the author truly believes he can't support her and that it's better for both of them, that's a personal decision. It's a tough call, but he's not necessarily in the wrong for feeling this way. Relationships require mutual effort, and if one person can't cope with the partner's trauma, it might not be sustainable in the long run. So, the answer could be B, not in the wrong. But there's also an argument that he should stay and support her. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong, not whether he should stay. The author is conflicted, and his feelings are valid, even if they lead to a breakup. So, B.\n"
