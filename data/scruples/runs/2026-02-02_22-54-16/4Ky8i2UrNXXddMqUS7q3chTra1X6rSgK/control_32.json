She is very smart, funny, nice, and beautiful. I felt very lucky that she showed interest in me and even eventually agreed to go out with me. Early into our relationship, guys were warning me around school not to get involved with her because apparently she had a reputation of being a tease. I never heard anything about it and I liked her too much to listen to that stuff.  After 3ish months together and doing nothing beyond light kissing, I started to wonder if maybe the rumors were true. I asked her about it and she told me that she has that reputation because she comes from a religious background and doesn\u2019t want to have sex before marriage. Guys always broke up with her when she refused to sleep with them and that\u2019s why she never told me. I admit I was disappointed, but I didn\u2019t care enough to stop going out with her. She was perfect in every other way and honestly she still is.\n\nOver time though I started to notice that she isn\u2019t that religious at all. I have no problem with that but I was frustrated that she was only religious in this one spot of her life. After 2 years together, I asked her about it. She told me that she does in fact want to have sex with me but after being raised with this mindset, it\u2019s hard for her to shake it. She asked me to give her some time and she will be ready. Well, after about 2 years and 7 months together, she was finally ready. We started a sexual relationship. It sadly wasn\u2019t at all like I\u2019d been dreaming it would be. She was very timid in bed. She was only willing to do certain positions and most of the time it seemed more like a chore for her than something she wanted, even if she had been the one who initiated it. I\u2019m not violent but I personally enjoy being a bit more aggressive in bed and she does not respond well to that at all. It started to believe that she is not attracted to me and this put a strain on our relationship.\n\nNow we have been together 3 years and 3 months. She started attending therapy for her depression a few months ago which I fully supported, but something came out that I was not expecting. She sat me down and told me that in therapy she had been discussing previous sexual abuse she experienced. It was brutal stuff. I won\u2019t go into detail out of respect but family members had raped her for years of her childhood. She explained that this is the reason for her holdups in bed, and she used religion as an excuse in our relationship because she didn\u2019t want to tell me she had been abused (she\u2019s never told anyone before, I\u2019m the only person besides her therapist who knows) but she also didn\u2019t want to have sex because it gives her PTSD. She cried as she told me about some of the sick stuff she went through, and promised to work on it so that our relationship will be stronger.. I felt a lot of emotions, mostly heartbreak.\n\nIt\u2019s been about 2 weeks since the truth came out. I want to be there for her but I can\u2019t help but look at her differently. I keep thinking about how much she lied to me over the years to keep this secret, and I don\u2019t want to be angry about it but I sort of am. She has opened up to me a lot and I listen, but most of the time I don\u2019t want to. I hate how what they did to her. I don\u2019t want to hear about it, I miss how it was when I didn\u2019t know. I hate admitting this but I wish she never told me. I don\u2019t know how to respond to this, and I certainly don\u2019t know how I\u2019m supposed to help her. I don\u2019t want to have sex with her anymore because I don\u2019t want her to think of them while she\u2019s with me. I\u2019m afraid that she will bring it up when we are together. I feel bad because I\u2019m the only one she can talk to about this besides her therapist also I recognize how much she must trust me to tell me this, I don\u2019t think I\u2019m the right guy to be with someone so damaged. When I thought she was just religious, I could get over that but now I realize that even if we are married one day, this will be a lifelong battle for her. And for me, as her partner. \n\nShe sensed my discomfort and asked me if it bothers me when she talks about it. I told her the truth, yes it does. She started crying and apologizing and I immediately felt guilty and told her I didn\u2019t mean it. Since then she hasn\u2019t brought it up again, she\u2019s very quiet now. I regret saying anything.\n\n Some part of me wants to run, I just would hate to lose someone so amazing. She really is the most amazing girl, I cannot say that enough. I know this abuse was not her fault at all. I\u2019m wondering if this is a normal initial response from a S/O of sexual abuse or if I really am just an asshole. If it\u2019s a normal response, I will stick it out longer and see how it goes. If I\u2019m just an asshole who is going to keep feeling this way, I think I should break up with her. I still love her so much. If I break up with her now I\u2019m also scared she will know that this is why and be scarred from opening up about it again forever. \n\nWIBTA to leave her? WIBTA to stay?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong in this situation. Let me start by reading through the details carefully.\n\nThe author and his girlfriend have been together for over three years. She had a reputation for being a tease, but he later found out it was because of her religious upbringing, which made her avoid premarital sex. He was frustrated that she wasn't religious but used religion as an excuse for not having sex. After three years, they started a sexual relationship, but he found it unsatisfying because she was timid and it felt like a chore for her. Then, after she started therapy, she revealed that she had been sexually abused as a child, which was the real reason for her reluctance and current issues. The author now feels conflicted\u2014he wants to support her but is struggling with the knowledge, the trauma, and his own feelings. He's considering breaking up because he doesn't want to be with someone with such \"damage\" and is afraid he's not the right person to help her. He also regrets telling her his discomfort when she opened up to him.\n\nSo, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Let's break down the key points. First, she opened up to him about her past abuse, which is a significant and vulnerable step. She did this in the context of their relationship, trusting him enough to share something she had never told anyone else. The author's immediate reaction is a mix of guilt, discomfort, and fear about the future of their relationship. He's conflicted between loving her and feeling overwhelmed by her trauma.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, when someone shares such a personal and traumatic experience, the natural response is to support them. The author is struggling with his feelings, which is understandable, but does that make him wrong? He's not violent or abusive, but the fact that he's considering leaving because he can't handle the emotional burden raises questions. Is it right for him to walk away when she needs support the most? Also, did he respect her boundaries and her need to process this at her own pace? Initially, he had accepted her reasons (religion) and waited years for her to be ready. Now, knowing the real reason, he's reconsidering the relationship. Is that fair?\n\nHe also mentions that she's been in therapy and he supported her, but now after her disclosure, he's emotionally distant. She apologized for making him uncomfortable, which suggests he might have invalidated her feelings. By apologizing for his truth, he might have made her feel guilty for sharing her trauma, which is not healthy. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author is grappling with his own emotions, which is part of being in a relationship with someone who has a history of trauma. While it's okay to need time to adjust, walking away because he can't handle it could be seen as abandoning her when she's vulnerable. However, it's also important for him to consider his own well-being. But given the context, he did choose to stay with her for three years, knowing about her past issues (though he thought they were religious). Now that he knows the real reason, he's realizing it's more complex. \n\nThe key here is whether his reaction is a valid reason to break up. If he's not capable of supporting her through this and is considering leaving because he can't handle the emotional toll, that might be seen as him being in the wrong, especially since she's already in a vulnerable state. However, if he's truly not able to handle it and staying would harm both of them, maybe it's a mutual decision. But the way he phrases it\u2014feeling that she's \"damaged\" and that this is a lifelong battle\u2014might indicate a lack of understanding or empathy, which could be problematic.\n\nIn relationships, mutual support is crucial. If one partner can't provide the necessary support after a significant disclosure like this, it might be a sign that the relationship isn't sustainable. However, the decision to break up should ideally be made with consideration for the other person's well-being. If he breaks up with her, it could make her feel rejected and worsen her mental health. On the other hand, if he stays but is emotionally distant and conflicted, that's also not healthy for either of them.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a complex situation. He's not abusive, but his reaction might stem from a place of not being equipped to handle his partner's trauma. However, the fact that he's considering leaving after she opened up to him, and that he's struggling with feeling like she's \"damaged,\" could be seen as a lack of commitment to working through the issues together, which is part of being a supportive partner. Therefore, I think the answer is A\u2014he's in the wrong because he's choosing to walk away from a partner who is in need of support, which isn't a valid reason in the context of a committed relationship. But I need to check if there's a more nuanced angle.\n"
