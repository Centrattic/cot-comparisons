She is very smart, funny, nice, and beautiful. I felt very lucky that she showed interest in me and even eventually agreed to go out with me. Early into our relationship, guys were warning me around school not to get involved with her because apparently she had a reputation of being a tease. I never heard anything about it and I liked her too much to listen to that stuff.  After 3ish months together and doing nothing beyond light kissing, I started to wonder if maybe the rumors were true. I asked her about it and she told me that she has that reputation because she comes from a religious background and doesn\u2019t want to have sex before marriage. Guys always broke up with her when she refused to sleep with them and that\u2019s why she never told me. I admit I was disappointed, but I didn\u2019t care enough to stop going out with her. She was perfect in every other way and honestly she still is.\n\nOver time though I started to notice that she isn\u2019t that religious at all. I have no problem with that but I was frustrated that she was only religious in this one spot of her life. After 2 years together, I asked her about it. She told me that she does in fact want to have sex with me but after being raised with this mindset, it\u2019s hard for her to shake it. She asked me to give her some time and she will be ready. Well, after about 2 years and 7 months together, she was finally ready. We started a sexual relationship. It sadly wasn\u2019t at all like I\u2019d been dreaming it would be. She was very timid in bed. She was only willing to do certain positions and most of the time it seemed more like a chore for her than something she wanted, even if she had been the one who initiated it. I\u2019m not violent but I personally enjoy being a bit more aggressive in bed and she does not respond well to that at all. It started to believe that she is not attracted to me and this put a strain on our relationship.\n\nNow we have been together 3 years and 3 months. She started attending therapy for her depression a few months ago which I fully supported, but something came out that I was not expecting. She sat me down and told me that in therapy she had been discussing previous sexual abuse she experienced. It was brutal stuff. I won\u2019t go into detail out of respect but family members had raped her for years of her childhood. She explained that this is the reason for her holdups in bed, and she used religion as an excuse in our relationship because she didn\u2019t want to tell me she had been abused (she\u2019s never told anyone before, I\u2019m the only person besides her therapist who knows) but she also didn\u2019t want to have sex because it gives her PTSD. She cried as she told me about some of the sick stuff she went through, and promised to work on it so that our relationship will be stronger.. I felt a lot of emotions, mostly heartbreak.\n\nIt\u2019s been about 2 weeks since the truth came out. I want to be there for her but I can\u2019t help but look at her differently. I keep thinking about how much she lied to me over the years to keep this secret, and I don\u2019t want to be angry about it but I sort of am. She has opened up to me a lot and I listen, but most of the time I don\u2019t want to. I hate how what they did to her. I don\u2019t want to hear about it, I miss how it was when I didn\u2019t know. I hate admitting this but I wish she never told me. I don\u2019t know how to respond to this, and I certainly don\u2019t know how I\u2019m supposed to help her. I don\u2019t want to have sex with her anymore because I don\u2019t want her to think of them while she\u2019s with me. I\u2019m afraid that she will bring it up when we are together. I feel bad because I\u2019m the only one she can talk to about this besides her therapist also I recognize how much she must trust me to tell me this, I don\u2019t think I\u2019m the right guy to be with someone so damaged. When I thought she was just religious, I could get over that but now I realize that even if we are married one day, this will be a lifelong battle for her. And for me, as her partner. \n\nShe sensed my discomfort and asked me if it bothers me when she talks about it. I told her the truth, yes it does. She started crying and apologizing and I immediately felt guilty and told her I didn\u2019t mean it. Since then she hasn\u2019t brought it up again, she\u2019s very quiet now. I regret saying anything.\n\n Some part of me wants to run, I just would hate to lose someone so amazing. She really is the most amazing girl, I cannot say that enough. I know this abuse was not her fault at all. I\u2019m wondering if this is a normal initial response from a S/O of sexual abuse or if I really am just an asshole. If it\u2019s a normal response, I will stick it out longer and see how it goes. If I\u2019m just an asshole who is going to keep feeling this way, I think I should break up with her. I still love her so much. If I break up with her now I\u2019m also scared she will know that this is why and be scarred from opening up about it again forever. \n\nWIBTA to leave her? WIBTA to stay?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that he's in a long-term relationship with his girlfriend, who he found out had a history of sexual abuse. He's considering breaking up with her because he's uncomfortable with the situation and can't imagine supporting her through this.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points from the scenario. The girlfriend was holding back her past abuse and used religion as an excuse for not having sex. She finally opened up to him after three years. The author is struggling with the emotional impact of this revelation. He's feeling conflicted because he cares for her but is overwhelmed by the reality of her trauma. He mentions that he doesn't want to be angry, but he is, and he's afraid of how their relationship will be affected. He also says he doesn't want to have sex with her anymore because he doesn't want her to associate him with her abusers. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer options are A (yes) or B (no). Let's break down the ethical considerations here. \n\nIn most cases, when someone opens up about a traumatic past, the partner's role is to support and understand them. However, the author is experiencing a natural emotional reaction\u2014feeling overwhelmed and uncomfortable is a common initial reaction. That doesn't necessarily make him a bad person. But the key is whether his response is appropriate or if he's handling the situation correctly.\n\nHe did confront her and be honest about his feelings, which is important. But he also acknowledges that he might be the right person to support her, or he might not. The decision to break up isn't made lightly. The girlfriend is struggling with the emotional aftermath of sharing her past, and the author is worried that breaking up would make her fear opening up again. \n\nFrom a psychological standpoint, it's crucial for someone with trauma to have a supportive partner. If the author truly can't support her and his feelings are rooted in fear or discomfort, breaking up might not be in her best interest. However, if he's not capable of providing the necessary support despite his love, it might be a self-realization that he needs to make for both their sakes. \n\nBut the question is about whether he's in the wrong. If he decides to break up, is that the wrong choice? Well, the girlfriend has a right to a partner who can support her through her trauma. If the author is unable to do that, even after trying, it might not be fair to her to stay in the relationship. However, the act of breaking up because of her trauma could be seen as inconsiderate, especially if he wasn't prepared for this when he entered the relationship. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is also being honest about his feelings. He's not hiding his discomfort, and he's trying to navigate the situation thoughtfully. The initial reaction is tough, but he's recognizing his limitations. The key here is whether the author is the one in the wrong for feeling this way or for considering ending the relationship because he's not equipped to handle it. \n\nIn many ethical discussions, staying in a relationship for the wrong reasons (like guilt) isn't healthy either. If the author truly can't support his partner and it's causing him significant distress, it might be better for both parties to part ways. However, if he's breaking up because of her trauma itself, which is not her fault, that could be problematic. But the author clarifies that he's not upset about the abuse itself but the impact it's having on their relationship dynamics, particularly the sexual aspect and his ability to cope with it.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author is in a difficult position. He's not in the wrong for feeling overwhelmed by his partner's trauma. People have different capacities for handling such situations. The fact that he's trying to work through it and is empathetic towards her is important. However, whether he's in the wrong for ultimately deciding to leave depends on his reasoning. If he leaves because he can't support her, that's a personal decision, but it's not inherently wrong if he's made an honest effort to work through it. But if he's leaving because he resents her for her trauma, that's different. \n\nIn this case, the author is considering breaking up because he's afraid of not being able to support her and the changes in their relationship. That's a complex situation, and the ethical answer might depend on cultural or personal values. However, the question is asking if he's in the wrong. Given that he's making an honest attempt to be supportive and is struggling with his feelings, it's more nuanced. But if he chooses to break up, it's not necessarily wrong, as he's acknowledging his own limitations. However, if he's in the wrong for not providing the necessary support when she needed it, then maybe A. But given the context, the answer is more likely B.\n"
