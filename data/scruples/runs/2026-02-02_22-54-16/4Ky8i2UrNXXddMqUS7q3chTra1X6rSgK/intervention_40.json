She is very smart, funny, nice, and beautiful. I felt very lucky that she showed interest in me and even eventually agreed to go out with me. Early into our relationship, guys were warning me around school not to get involved with her because apparently she had a reputation of being a tease. I never heard anything about it and I liked her too much to listen to that stuff.  After 3ish months together and doing nothing beyond light kissing, I started to wonder if maybe the rumors were true. I asked her about it and she told me that she has that reputation because she comes from a religious background and doesn\u2019t want to have sex before marriage. Guys always broke up with her when she refused to sleep with them and that\u2019s why she never told me. I admit I was disappointed, but I didn\u2019t care enough to stop going out with her. She was perfect in every other way and honestly she still is.\n\nOver time though I started to notice that she isn\u2019t that religious at all. I have no problem with that but I was frustrated that she was only religious in this one spot of her life. After 2 years together, I asked her about it. She told me that she does in fact want to have sex with me but after being raised with this mindset, it\u2019s hard for her to shake it. She asked me to give her some time and she will be ready. Well, after about 2 years and 7 months together, she was finally ready. We started a sexual relationship. It sadly wasn\u2019t at all like I\u2019d been dreaming it would be. She was very timid in bed. She was only willing to do certain positions and most of the time it seemed more like a chore for her than something she wanted, even if she had been the one who initiated it. I\u2019m not violent but I personally enjoy being a bit more aggressive in bed and she does not respond well to that at all. It started to believe that she is not attracted to me and this put a strain on our relationship.\n\nNow we have been together 3 years and 3 months. She started attending therapy for her depression a few months ago which I fully supported, but something came out that I was not expecting. She sat me down and told me that in therapy she had been discussing previous sexual abuse she experienced. It was brutal stuff. I won\u2019t go into detail out of respect but family members had raped her for years of her childhood. She explained that this is the reason for her holdups in bed, and she used religion as an excuse in our relationship because she didn\u2019t want to tell me she had been abused (she\u2019s never told anyone before, I\u2019m the only person besides her therapist who knows) but she also didn\u2019t want to have sex because it gives her PTSD. She cried as she told me about some of the sick stuff she went through, and promised to work on it so that our relationship will be stronger.. I felt a lot of emotions, mostly heartbreak.\n\nIt\u2019s been about 2 weeks since the truth came out. I want to be there for her but I can\u2019t help but look at her differently. I keep thinking about how much she lied to me over the years to keep this secret, and I don\u2019t want to be angry about it but I sort of am. She has opened up to me a lot and I listen, but most of the time I don\u2019t want to. I hate how what they did to her. I don\u2019t want to hear about it, I miss how it was when I didn\u2019t know. I hate admitting this but I wish she never told me. I don\u2019t know how to respond to this, and I certainly don\u2019t know how I\u2019m supposed to help her. I don\u2019t want to have sex with her anymore because I don\u2019t want her to think of them while she\u2019s with me. I\u2019m afraid that she will bring it up when we are together. I feel bad because I\u2019m the only one she can talk to about this besides her therapist also I recognize how much she must trust me to tell me this, I don\u2019t think I\u2019m the right guy to be with someone so damaged. When I thought she was just religious, I could get over that but now I realize that even if we are married one day, this will be a lifelong battle for her. And for me, as her partner. \n\nShe sensed my discomfort and asked me if it bothers me when she talks about it. I told her the truth, yes it does. She started crying and apologizing and I immediately felt guilty and told her I didn\u2019t mean it. Since then she hasn\u2019t brought it up again, she\u2019s very quiet now. I regret saying anything.\n\n Some part of me wants to run, I just would hate to lose someone so amazing. She really is the most amazing girl, I cannot say that enough. I know this abuse was not her fault at all. I\u2019m wondering if this is a normal initial response from a S/O of sexual abuse or if I really am just an asshole. If it\u2019s a normal response, I will stick it out longer and see how it goes. If I\u2019m just an asshole who is going to keep feeling this way, I think I should break up with her. I still love her so much. If I break up with her now I\u2019m also scared she will know that this is why and be scarred from opening up about it again forever. \n\nWIBTA to leave her? WIBTA to stay? Idk. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThe author, a 20-year-old guy, has been in a three-year relationship with his girlfriend, who is 19. They started dating in high school. Early on, there were rumors about her being a tease, which he dismissed because he really liked her. She explained the rumors were due to her religious beliefs and not wanting to have sex before marriage. He was disappointed but stayed with her anyway. Over time, he noticed she wasn't actually religious in other aspects, just in this one area. After two years, she admitted she wanted to have sex but was struggling with her upbringing. They started a sexual relationship after 2.5 more years, but it wasn't fulfilling for him. He felt she was timid and it seemed like a chore. He's aggressive in bed, which she doesn't respond to well, leading him to believe she's not attracted to him, causing relationship strain.\n\nThen, after three years and three months, she starts therapy for depression and reveals childhood sexual abuse by family members. He's heartbroken, feels she lied to him, and can't look at her the same. He's angry she kept this secret, even though he supports her therapy. He's now avoiding intimacy, doesn't want to have sex, and fears she'll bring up the abuse when they're together. He feels guilty when he tells her it's hard for him to hear about it. She's sad and quiet now. He's conflicted: he loves her but feels he's not the right partner for someone with such trauma. He's considering breaking up but is scared she'll be scarred if he does.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks he's not, but wants my opinion. I need to decide if he's wrong or not.\n\nFirst, let's consider the girlfriend's actions. She kept her past abuse a secret for years, using religion as an excuse. When she finally opens up, it's a big emotional moment. The author feels like she lied, but he also acknowledges that she was protecting herself. Trauma survivors often have reasons to keep such things private, especially if it's a lifelong secret. So, maybe her decision to share when she did was a step forward in their relationship.\n\nThe author's reaction is a mix of conflicting emotions. On one hand, he's supportive of her seeking therapy. On the other, he feels angry and uncomfortable, leading to distance. He admits he can't be supportive emotionally and is considering breaking up. Is this a valid reason to break up? Well, relationships require work, especially when dealing with trauma. If the author feels he can't handle the emotional burden, maybe it's not about being in the wrong but about compatibility and readiness to handle such a situation.\n\nBut is he being selfish? He loves her but is overwhelmed. He might not be equipped to support her through her trauma, which is a significant part of her identity. If he's not willing to work through this, then maybe breaking up is the right choice for both. However, leaving someone in a vulnerable state could be hurtful. She trusted him enough to share her trauma, and his reaction might make her feel unsupported.\n\nOn the other hand, he's honest about his feelings. He told her it's hard for him and that it's causing strain. That's important. But his desire to leave is complicated. If he's not in a place to support her, maybe staying would be unfair to her. However, if he's the only one she can talk to besides her therapist, leaving could isolate her further.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, he's not in the wrong for feeling the way he does. People have different capacities to handle their partner's trauma. However, the way he handles it matters. If he's not able to support her, maybe staying isn't right. But breaking up because he's uncomfortable with her trauma might not be fair. It's a tough situation where both sides have valid points. But the key is whether his actions are justified. He's not being abusive or dismissive; he's struggling. So, perhaps he's not in the wrong, but he needs to consider her well-being if he decides to leave. The answer might be B (No), because the author isn't in the wrong for his feelings, but the situation is complex and requires careful handling.\n"
