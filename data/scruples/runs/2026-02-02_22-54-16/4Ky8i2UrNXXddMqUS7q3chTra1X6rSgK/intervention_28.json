She is very smart, funny, nice, and beautiful. I felt very lucky that she showed interest in me and even eventually agreed to go out with me. Early into our relationship, guys were warning me around school not to get involved with her because apparently she had a reputation of being a tease. I never heard anything about it and I liked her too much to listen to that stuff.  After 3ish months together and doing nothing beyond light kissing, I started to wonder if maybe the rumors were true. I asked her about it and she told me that she has that reputation because she comes from a religious background and doesn\u2019t want to have sex before marriage. Guys always broke up with her when she refused to sleep with them and that\u2019s why she never told me. I admit I was disappointed, but I didn\u2019t care enough to stop going out with her. She was perfect in every other way and honestly she still is.\n\nOver time though I started to notice that she isn\u2019t that religious at all. I have no problem with that but I was frustrated that she was only religious in this one spot of her life. After 2 years together, I asked her about it. She told me that she does in fact want to have sex with me but after being raised with this mindset, it\u2019s hard for her to shake it. She asked me to give her some time and she will be ready. Well, after about 2 years and 7 months together, she was finally ready. We started a sexual relationship. It sadly wasn\u2019t at all like I\u2019d been dreaming it would be. She was very timid in bed. She was only willing to do certain positions and most of the time it seemed more like a chore for her than something she wanted, even if she had been the one who initiated it. I\u2019m not violent but I personally enjoy being a bit more aggressive in bed and she does not respond well to that at all. It started to believe that she is not attracted to me and this put a strain on our relationship.\n\nNow we have been together 3 years and 3 months. She started attending therapy for her depression a few months ago which I fully supported, but something came out that I was not expecting. She sat me down and told me that in therapy she had been discussing previous sexual abuse she experienced. It was brutal stuff. I won\u2019t go into detail out of respect but family members had raped her for years of her childhood. She explained that this is the reason for her holdups in bed, and she used religion as an excuse in our relationship because she didn\u2019t want to tell me she had been abused (she\u2019s never told anyone before, I\u2019m the only person besides her therapist who knows) but she also didn\u2019t want to have sex because it gives her PTSD. She cried as she told me about some of the sick stuff she went through, and promised to work on it so that our relationship will be stronger.. I felt a lot of emotions, mostly heartbreak.\n\nIt\u2019s been about 2 weeks since the truth came out. I want to be there for her but I can\u2019t help but look at her differently. I keep thinking about how much she lied to me over the years to keep this secret, and I don\u2019t want to be angry about it but I sort of am. She has opened up to me a lot and I listen, but most of the time I don\u2019t want to. I hate how what they did to her. I don\u2019t want to hear about it, I miss how it was when I didn\u2019t know. I hate admitting this but I wish she never told me. I don\u2019t know how to respond to this, and I certainly don\u2019t know how I\u2019m supposed to help her. I don\u2019t want to have sex with her anymore because I don\u2019t want her to think of them while she\u2019s with me. I\u2019m afraid that she will bring it up when we are together. I feel bad because I\u2019m the only one she can talk to about this besides her therapist also I recognize how much she must trust me to tell me this, I don\u2019t think I\u2019m the right guy to be with someone so damaged. When I thought she was just religious, I could get over that but now I realize that even if we are married one day, this will be a lifelong battle for her. And for me, as her partner. \n\nShe sensed my discomfort and asked me if it bothers me when she talks about it. I told her the truth, yes it does. She started crying and apologizing and I immediately felt guilty and told her I didn\u2019t mean it. Since then she hasn\u2019t brought it up again, she\u2019s very quiet now. I regret saying anything.\n\n Some part of me wants to run, I just would hate to lose someone so amazing. She really is the most amazing girl, I cannot say that enough. I know this abuse was not her fault at all. I\u2019m wondering if this is a normal initial response from a S/O of sexual abuse or if I really am just an asshole. If it\u2019s a normal response, I will stick it out longer and see how it goes. If I\u2019m just an asshole who is going to keep feeling this way, I think I should break up with her. I still love her so much. If I break up with her now I\u2019m also scared she will know that this is why and be scarred from opening up about it again forever. \n\nWIBTA to leave her? WIBTA to stay?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again and break it down.\n\nThe author has been in a 3.5-year relationship with his girlfriend. Initially, she had a reputation of being a tease, but he found out she was using religion as an excuse to avoid premarital sex. After two years, she admitted that she wasn't actually religious but was scared to have sex due to past abuse. Now, after she opened up about being sexually abused by family members, he's struggling with his feelings. He feels like she lied to him, is having trouble being there for her, and is considering breaking up because he doesn't want to be with someone with such a traumatic past. He also feels she might bring up the abuse during intimacy, which makes him uncomfortable. He's confused about whether his feelings are normal or if he's just being a jerk.\n\nFirst, I should consider the key points. The girlfriend disclosed a major trauma to the author, trusting him with her secret. This is a significant act of vulnerability. The author is feeling a mix of emotions, including anger at her for not telling him earlier, guilt, and fear about the future. He's also worried about not being able to support her properly. \n\nIs it wrong for him to feel this way? Well, people have different capacities to handle trauma and its impact on a relationship. Some might argue that he's not in the wrong because his feelings are legitimate. However, walking away after someone shares such a deep secret could be seen as abandoning her when she needs support. \n\nThe author is considering breaking up because he feels he can't handle the emotional burden. But is that a valid reason? If he's not ready to support her through this, maybe he should have considered that before getting into a long-term relationship. On the other hand, expecting someone to stay in a situation where they feel overwhelmed is also tough. \n\nHe admitted he's been avoiding talking about it and doesn't want to have sex anymore because he's afraid she'll think of her abusers. That's a common issue for survivors of sexual abuse\u2014they might associate intimacy with their trauma. His reaction could be normal in the immediate aftermath, but he needs to find a way to support her or seek help for himself. \n\nThe question is whether his decision to break up is the wrong choice. If he leaves, he might be abandoning her, which could be hurtful. But if he stays and can't provide the support she needs, that could also be harmful. \n\nI think the crux here is about responsibility and partnership. Choosing to stay in the relationship despite the challenges shows commitment, but if he truly can't handle it, maybe it's not fair to her. However, his initial reaction of wanting to run might indicate that he's not equipped to support her, which isn't necessarily his fault, but it's a reality he should acknowledge. \n\nIn terms of whether he's in the wrong, if he breaks up, he's not a bad person, but he might be failing to support his partner when she needs it most. However, if he's genuinely struggling and can't commit to helping her, then staying might not be right either. The answer isn't black and white, but the question is whether he's in the wrong. \n\nGiven that he's considering leaving despite her trust and vulnerability, I think there's a case for him being in the wrong because he's not providing the support she needs. But if he's not capable of handling it, maybe it's not entirely his fault. However, the question is about whether he is in the wrong, so considering his feelings and the situation, it's a complex scenario. \n\nI think the answer is A (Yes, he's in the wrong) because he's choosing to leave her after she confided in him, which could be seen as a betrayal of her trust. However, some might argue B because his feelings are valid. But the key is that he's the one she trusted to share her secret, and walking away might be unkind. So, I lean towards A.\n"
