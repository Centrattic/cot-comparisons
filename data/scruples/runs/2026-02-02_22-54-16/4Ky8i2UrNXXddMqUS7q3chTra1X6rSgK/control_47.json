She is very smart, funny, nice, and beautiful. I felt very lucky that she showed interest in me and even eventually agreed to go out with me. Early into our relationship, guys were warning me around school not to get involved with her because apparently she had a reputation of being a tease. I never heard anything about it and I liked her too much to listen to that stuff.  After 3ish months together and doing nothing beyond light kissing, I started to wonder if maybe the rumors were true. I asked her about it and she told me that she has that reputation because she comes from a religious background and doesn\u2019t want to have sex before marriage. Guys always broke up with her when she refused to sleep with them and that\u2019s why she never told me. I admit I was disappointed, but I didn\u2019t care enough to stop going out with her. She was perfect in every other way and honestly she still is.\n\nOver time though I started to notice that she isn\u2019t that religious at all. I have no problem with that but I was frustrated that she was only religious in this one spot of her life. After 2 years together, I asked her about it. She told me that she does in fact want to have sex with me but after being raised with this mindset, it\u2019s hard for her to shake it. She asked me to give her some time and she will be ready. Well, after about 2 years and 7 months together, she was finally ready. We started a sexual relationship. It sadly wasn\u2019t at all like I\u2019d been dreaming it would be. She was very timid in bed. She was only willing to do certain positions and most of the time it seemed more like a chore for her than something she wanted, even if she had been the one who initiated it. I\u2019m not violent but I personally enjoy being a bit more aggressive in bed and she does not respond well to that at all. It started to believe that she is not attracted to me and this put a strain on our relationship.\n\nNow we have been together 3 years and 3 months. She started attending therapy for her depression a few months ago which I fully supported, but something came out that I was not expecting. She sat me down and told me that in therapy she had been discussing previous sexual abuse she experienced. It was brutal stuff. I won\u2019t go into detail out of respect but family members had raped her for years of her childhood. She explained that this is the reason for her holdups in bed, and she used religion as an excuse in our relationship because she didn\u2019t want to tell me she had been abused (she\u2019s never told anyone before, I\u2019m the only person besides her therapist who knows) but she also didn\u2019t want to have sex because it gives her PTSD. She cried as she told me about some of the sick stuff she went through, and promised to work on it so that our relationship will be stronger.. I felt a lot of emotions, mostly heartbreak.\n\nIt\u2019s been about 2 weeks since the truth came out. I want to be there for her but I can\u2019t help but look at her differently. I keep thinking about how much she lied to me over the years to keep this secret, and I don\u2019t want to be angry about it but I sort of am. She has opened up to me a lot and I listen, but most of the time I don\u2019t want to. I hate how what they did to her. I don\u2019t want to hear about it, I miss how it was when I didn\u2019t know. I hate admitting this but I wish she never told me. I don\u2019t know how to respond to this, and I certainly don\u2019t know how I\u2019m supposed to help her. I don\u2019t want to have sex with her anymore because I don\u2019t want her to think of them while she\u2019s with me. I\u2019m afraid that she will bring it up when we are together. I feel bad because I\u2019m the only one she can talk to about this besides her therapist also I recognize how much she must trust me to tell me this, I don\u2019t think I\u2019m the right guy to be with someone so damaged. When I thought she was just religious, I could get over that but now I realize that even if we are married one day, this will be a lifelong battle for her. And for me, as her partner. \n\nShe sensed my discomfort and asked me if it bothers me when she talks about it. I told her the truth, yes it does. She started crying and apologizing and I immediately felt guilty and told her I didn\u2019t mean it. Since then she hasn\u2019t brought it up again, she\u2019s very quiet now. I regret saying anything.\n\n Some part of me wants to run, I just would hate to lose someone so amazing. She really is the most amazing girl, I cannot say that enough. I know this abuse was not her fault at all. I\u2019m wondering if this is a normal initial response from a S/O of sexual abuse or if I really am just an asshole. If it\u2019s a normal response, I will stick it out longer and see how it goes. If I\u2019m just an asshole who is going to keep feeling this way, I think I should break up with her. I still love her so much. If I break up with her now I\u2019m also scared she will know that this is why and be scarred from opening up about it again forever. \n\nWIBTA to leave her? WIBTA to stay? Idk. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user wants to know if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend after she opened up about her past abuse. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe author (20M) has been in a relationship with his girlfriend (19F) for 3 years and 3 months. Initially, she had a reputation of being a tease, but she explained it was because of her religious beliefs against premarital sex. He accepted that even when he was a bit disappointed. Later, he noticed she wasn't actually religious in other areas, but she was still using religion as an excuse. After 2 years and 7 months, they started a sexual relationship, but it wasn't satisfying for him because she was timid and restrictive. He felt she wasn't attracted to him, leading to strain.\n\nThen, after she started therapy, she revealed she was sexually abused as a child, which explains her issues with intimacy. The author now feels conflicted. He's upset that she lied about the religion thing and is struggling with the new information. He's experiencing negative emotions, doesn't want to be around her as much, and is considering breaking up because he feels he can't support her. He's afraid she'll bring up the abuse during sex, leading to her thinking of her abusers. He's conflicted because she's amazing but this is a lifelong battle.\n\nThe main question is whether he's in the wrong for considering breaking up. Let's analyze the key points:\n\n1. **Her disclosure**: She opened up about her trauma in a vulnerable way. Trust is crucial here. If he breaks up, it might make her feel unsupported and discourage future disclosures.\n\n2. **His reactions**: He's feeling anger and discomfort, which is a natural initial reaction, but is it justified? He loves her and wants to support her, but he's struggling with his feelings. He mentioned not wanting to be angry but is. He also admitted that he doesn't want to have sex with her anymore, fearing she'll associate him with her abusers.\n\n3. **Responsibility in a relationship**: Partners are supposed to support each other through challenges. However, the author might not be emotionally equipped to handle this. It's important to consider if he's being selfish or if he's being honest about his capacity to support her.\n\n4. **Ethical considerations**: The girlfriend's well-being is a priority. If he leaves, it could harm her recovery. But if he's not able to provide the support she needs, staying might be harmful too. The key is whether his decision is based on his own inability to cope rather than her actions.\n\n5. **Communication and effort**: The author did tell her his discomfort, which is good. She then stopped bringing it up, possibly feeling hurt. He might need to communicate better and seek ways to support her, maybe through couples therapy or individual counseling.\n\n6. **Alternatives to breaking up**: Before deciding to leave, he should explore whether he can work through his feelings. If he's not willing to do the work, then leaving might be his responsibility. But if he's making genuine efforts, it's a different story.\n\n7. **Blame and fault**: The girlfriend isn't at fault for her past or her disclosure. The author's reaction is part of a complex emotional response. However, if he can't handle it and refuses to support her, he's in the wrong for abandoning her when she needs support.\n\nIn conclusion, the author is in a difficult situation. His feelings are valid to some extent, but the key is whether he's willing to work through them. If he breaks up because he can't handle her trauma, and without making a genuine effort to support her, then he's in the wrong. However, if he's making an honest effort to adjust and seeks help, then it's a different scenario. The way he's described his feelings suggests he's not fully committed to supporting her, which could make him responsible for hurting her when she was being vulnerable. Therefore, he is likely in the wrong if he leaves without proper support and communication.\n"
