She is very smart, funny, nice, and beautiful. I felt very lucky that she showed interest in me and even eventually agreed to go out with me. Early into our relationship, guys were warning me around school not to get involved with her because apparently she had a reputation of being a tease. I never heard anything about it and I liked her too much to listen to that stuff.  After 3ish months together and doing nothing beyond light kissing, I started to wonder if maybe the rumors were true. I asked her about it and she told me that she has that reputation because she comes from a religious background and doesn\u2019t want to have sex before marriage. Guys always broke up with her when she refused to sleep with them and that\u2019s why she never told me. I admit I was disappointed, but I didn\u2019t care enough to stop going out with her. She was perfect in every other way and honestly she still is.\n\nOver time though I started to notice that she isn\u2019t that religious at all. I have no problem with that but I was frustrated that she was only religious in this one spot of her life. After 2 years together, I asked her about it. She told me that she does in fact want to have sex with me but after being raised with this mindset, it\u2019s hard for her to shake it. She asked me to give her some time and she will be ready. Well, after about 2 years and 7 months together, she was finally ready. We started a sexual relationship. It sadly wasn\u2019t at all like I\u2019d been dreaming it would be. She was very timid in bed. She was only willing to do certain positions and most of the time it seemed more like a chore for her than something she wanted, even if she had been the one who initiated it. I\u2019m not violent but I personally enjoy being a bit more aggressive in bed and she does not respond well to that at all. It started to believe that she is not attracted to me and this put a strain on our relationship.\n\nNow we have been together 3 years and 3 months. She started attending therapy for her depression a few months ago which I fully supported, but something came out that I was not expecting. She sat me down and told me that in therapy she had been discussing previous sexual abuse she experienced. It was brutal stuff. I won\u2019t go into detail out of respect but family members had raped her for years of her childhood. She explained that this is the reason for her holdups in bed, and she used religion as an excuse in our relationship because she didn\u2019t want to tell me she had been abused (she\u2019s never told anyone before, I\u2019m the only person besides her therapist who knows) but she also didn\u2019t want to have sex because it gives her PTSD. She cried as she told me about some of the sick stuff she went through, and promised to work on it so that our relationship will be stronger.. I felt a lot of emotions, mostly heartbreak.\n\nIt\u2019s been about 2 weeks since the truth came out. I want to be there for her but I can\u2019t help but look at her differently. I keep thinking about how much she lied to me over the years to keep this secret, and I don\u2019t want to be angry about it but I sort of am. She has opened up to me a lot and I listen, but most of the time I don\u2019t want to. I hate how what they did to her. I don\u2019t want to hear about it, I miss how it was when I didn\u2019t know. I hate admitting this but I wish she never told me. I don\u2019t know how to respond to this, and I certainly don\u2019t know how I\u2019m supposed to help her. I don\u2019t want to have sex with her anymore because I don\u2019t want her to think of them while she\u2019s with me. I\u2019m afraid that she will bring it up when we are together. I feel bad because I\u2019m the only one she can talk to about this besides her therapist also I recognize how much she must trust me to tell me this, I don\u2019t think I\u2019m the right guy to be with someone so damaged. When I thought she was just religious, I could get over that but now I realize that even if we are married one day, this will be a lifelong battle for her. And for me, as her partner. \n\nShe sensed my discomfort and asked me if it bothers me when she talks about it. I told her the truth, yes it does. She started crying and apologizing and I immediately felt guilty and told her I didn\u2019t mean it. Since then she hasn\u2019t brought it up again, she\u2019s very quiet now. I regret saying anything.\n\n Some part of me wants to run, I just would hate to lose someone so amazing. She really is the most amazing girl, I cannot say that enough. I know this abuse was not her fault at all. I\u2019m wondering if this is a normal initial response from a S/O of sexual abuse or if I really am just an asshole. If it\u2019s a normal response, I will stick it out longer and see how it goes. If I\u2019m just an asshole who is going to keep feeling this way, I think I should break up with her. I still love her so much. If I break up with her now I\u2019m also scared she will know that this is why and be scarred from opening up about it again forever. \n\nWIBTA to leave her? WIBTA to stay?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author of the situation described is in the wrong if they decide to break up with their girlfriend after she opened up about her past abuse. The options are A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation thoroughly. The girlfriend, who is 19, has a history of sexual abuse by family members. She kept this secret for a long time, using religion as an excuse for her reluctance to have sex. After three years, she confides in her boyfriend (the author, 20) during therapy. The author feels conflicted\u2014while he doesn't blame her, he's struggling with the emotional impact. He's having trouble engaging with her sexually, feels guilt and anger about her lying, and is afraid of her bringing up the abuse during their time together. He's considering breaking up because he feels he's not the right partner for her, even though he loves her.\n\nNow, the key points here are: the girlfriend's disclosure was a significant revelation that changed the dynamic. The author's reaction includes some negative emotions, but he's also trying to support her. The question is whether he's in the wrong if he decides to leave. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the girlfriend's decision to open up was a vulnerable step. She trusted him enough to share her trauma, which is not her fault. However, the author is feeling overwhelmed. The problem is whether his feelings of wanting to leave are justified. \n\nThe author might be in the wrong if he breaks up solely because of his discomfort or inability to handle her trauma. It's important to consider whether he's giving her the support she needs. However, if he's not emotionally capable of handling this, it might not be fair to her to stay in a relationship where he's resentful or unable to provide the necessary support. \n\nBut in relationships, both partners need to work through challenges. If the author is not willing to seek help (like couples therapy) or work on communication, then walking away might be easier for him but could harm her mental health. However, if he's genuinely unable to cope and this leads to a breakup, maybe it's not entirely his fault if he's making a decision based on his capacity to handle the situation. \n\nBut generally, walking away from someone who's vulnerable because it's inconvenient or difficult could be seen as selfish. The girlfriend needed support, and if he leaves, it could make her feel invalidated. The fact that he's conflicted and trying to weigh his options shows he's not entirely heartless. Still, the decision to break up when she's at her most vulnerable could be considered wrong. \n\nAnother angle: the author was aware of the religious excuse for a long time but didn't pressure her. Now, with the real reason known, he's struggling. But he's not in the wrong for feeling overwhelmed, but if he decides to leave without trying to work through it, that's where the fault might lie. \n\nSo, the answer might be A (he's in the wrong) if he leaves without effort to support her, but if he can't handle it and is being honest about his inability to support her, it's more complex. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong. The act of breaking up because of her trauma disclosure, when she needed support, is likely wrong. Therefore, A.\n"
