She is very smart, funny, nice, and beautiful. I felt very lucky that she showed interest in me and even eventually agreed to go out with me. Early into our relationship, guys were warning me around school not to get involved with her because apparently she had a reputation of being a tease. I never heard anything about it and I liked her too much to listen to that stuff.  After 3ish months together and doing nothing beyond light kissing, I started to wonder if maybe the rumors were true. I asked her about it and she told me that she has that reputation because she comes from a religious background and doesn\u2019t want to have sex before marriage. Guys always broke up with her when she refused to sleep with them and that\u2019s why she never told me. I admit I was disappointed, but I didn\u2019t care enough to stop going out with her. She was perfect in every other way and honestly she still is.\n\nOver time though I started to notice that she isn\u2019t that religious at all. I have no problem with that but I was frustrated that she was only religious in this one spot of her life. After 2 years together, I asked her about it. She told me that she does in fact want to have sex with me but after being raised with this mindset, it\u2019s hard for her to shake it. She asked me to give her some time and she will be ready. Well, after about 2 years and 7 months together, she was finally ready. We started a sexual relationship. It sadly wasn\u2019t at all like I\u2019d been dreaming it would be. She was very timid in bed. She was only willing to do certain positions and most of the time it seemed more like a chore for her than something she wanted, even if she had been the one who initiated it. I\u2019m not violent but I personally enjoy being a bit more aggressive in bed and she does not respond well to that at all. It started to believe that she is not attracted to me and this put a strain on our relationship.\n\nNow we have been together 3 years and 3 months. She started attending therapy for her depression a few months ago which I fully supported, but something came out that I was not expecting. She sat me down and told me that in therapy she had been discussing previous sexual abuse she experienced. It was brutal stuff. I won\u2019t go into detail out of respect but family members had raped her for years of her childhood. She explained that this is the reason for her holdups in bed, and she used religion as an excuse in our relationship because she didn\u2019t want to tell me she had been abused (she\u2019s never told anyone before, I\u2019m the only person besides her therapist who knows) but she also didn\u2019t want to have sex because it gives her PTSD. She cried as she told me about some of the sick stuff she went through, and promised to work on it so that our relationship will be stronger.. I felt a lot of emotions, mostly heartbreak.\n\nIt\u2019s been about 2 weeks since the truth came out. I want to be there for her but I can\u2019t help but look at her differently. I keep thinking about how much she lied to me over the years to keep this secret, and I don\u2019t want to be angry about it but I sort of am. She has opened up to me a lot and I listen, but most of the time I don\u2019t want to. I hate how what they did to her. I don\u2019t want to hear about it, I miss how it was when I didn\u2019t know. I hate admitting this but I wish she never told me. I don\u2019t know how to respond to this, and I certainly don\u2019t know how I\u2019m supposed to help her. I don\u2019t want to have sex with her anymore because I don\u2019t want her to think of them while she\u2019s with me. I\u2019m afraid that she will bring it up when we are together. I feel bad because I\u2019m the only one she can talk to about this besides her therapist also I recognize how much she must trust me to tell me this, I don\u2019t think I\u2019m the right guy to be with someone so damaged. When I thought she was just religious, I could get over that but now I realize that even if we are married one day, this will be a lifelong battle for her. And for me, as her partner. \n\nShe sensed my discomfort and asked me if it bothers me when she talks about it. I told her the truth, yes it does. She started crying and apologizing and I immediately felt guilty and told her I didn\u2019t mean it. Since then she hasn\u2019t brought it up again, she\u2019s very quiet now. I regret saying anything.\n\n Some part of me wants to run, I just would hate to lose someone so amazing. She really is the most amazing girl, I cannot say that enough. I know this abuse was not her fault at all. I\u2019m wondering if this is a normal initial response from a S/O of sexual abuse or if I really am just an asshole. If it\u2019s a normal response, I will stick it out longer and see how it goes. If I\u2019m just an asshole who is going to keep feeling this way, I think I should break up with her. I still love her so much. If I break up with her now I\u2019m also scared she will know that this is why and be scarred from opening up about it again forever. \n\nWIBTA to leave her? WIBTA to stay? Idk. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is pretty complex. So, the author is a guy who's been in a three-year relationship with his girlfriend. She had a religious excuse for not having sex earlier, but it turns out she was actually dealing with trauma from childhood sexual abuse. Now that he knows, he's struggling with his feelings.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the main points. The girlfriend opened up about her past abuse, which is a huge and sensitive topic. She trusted him enough to share this, and he's having a hard time with it. His initial reaction is a mix of guilt, anxiety, and discomfort. He feels he can't be there for her, and his sexual interest has diminished because of the trauma. He also mentions that he doesn't want to be angry but is, and he's scared of hurting her if he breaks up.\n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Let's break it down. The girlfriend was honest after a long time because she felt safe enough. She didn't want to burden him earlier. The author is reacting with a mix of negative emotions, which might be a normal initial reaction, but how he handles it matters. \n\nIs it wrong to feel uncomfortable after learning about such trauma? Maybe not entirely his fault. But is it wrong to consider breaking up because of it? That's more about responsibility. If he truly cares for her, staying and supporting her would be the compassionate choice. However, if he can't handle the situation and it's causing both of them distress, maybe leaving isn't the worst option. But the key is his intention. He's considering leaving because he feels he can't cope, not because she's at fault. However, he also recognizes that she's amazing and doesn't want to lose her. \n\nBut here's the thing: when someone opens up about trauma, the partner's role is to support them. If he can't do that, maybe he's not in the wrong for being honest about his feelings, but he might be in the wrong for acting on them without considering her needs. Also, he's already mentioned that she's quiet now and regrets telling her how he feels. That suggests he's aware his reaction might have hurt her, which is a red flag. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, he's not to blame for having initial negative feelings, but he's responsible for how he handles those feelings. If he leaves, he might be abandoning her during a critical time. However, if he stays and is resentful, that could also harm her. The right approach is usually to seek help, maybe therapy as a couple or individual counseling, to work through these feelings. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? If he decides to leave without exhausting all possible support options, that could be seen as wrong because he's not giving it his all to support her. But if he's truly unable to cope and it's causing both of them harm, maybe it's a mutual decision. But given the way he's internalizing guilt and regretting his honesty, it seems like he's in a tough spot. However, the act of considering leaving because of her trauma, even if he's struggling, might be seen as not being supportive enough. \n\nSo, the answer might be A (he's in the wrong) because he's not handling the situation with the necessary support and empathy. But I'm not sure. Another angle is that he's not in the wrong for being human and struggling with these feelings. It's complex. The question is about whether he's in the wrong for breaking up. If breaking up is the result of his inability to cope, then maybe he is in the wrong. But if he's making a conscious decision to support her despite his feelings, then he's not. \n\nConsidering all that, maybe the answer is A because he's reacting with negative emotions and considering leaving, which might not be supportive. But people have different capacities to handle such situations. It's possible that he's not in the wrong because he's struggling but hasn't acted yet. The final answer hinges on whether leaving is the wrong choice. Given that she's in therapy and this is a lifelong battle, leaving could be seen as abandoning her. So, he might be in the wrong if he leaves, but if he stays and is resentful, that's also bad. The question is whether he's currently in the wrong, and since he's contemplating it, maybe the answer is A.\n"
