She is very smart, funny, nice, and beautiful. I felt very lucky that she showed interest in me and even eventually agreed to go out with me. Early into our relationship, guys were warning me around school not to get involved with her because apparently she had a reputation of being a tease. I never heard anything about it and I liked her too much to listen to that stuff.  After 3ish months together and doing nothing beyond light kissing, I started to wonder if maybe the rumors were true. I asked her about it and she told me that she has that reputation because she comes from a religious background and doesn\u2019t want to have sex before marriage. Guys always broke up with her when she refused to sleep with them and that\u2019s why she never told me. I admit I was disappointed, but I didn\u2019t care enough to stop going out with her. She was perfect in every other way and honestly she still is.\n\nOver time though I started to notice that she isn\u2019t that religious at all. I have no problem with that but I was frustrated that she was only religious in this one spot of her life. After 2 years together, I asked her about it. She told me that she does in fact want to have sex with me but after being raised with this mindset, it\u2019s hard for her to shake it. She asked me to give her some time and she will be ready. Well, after about 2 years and 7 months together, she was finally ready. We started a sexual relationship. It sadly wasn\u2019t at all like I\u2019d been dreaming it would be. She was very timid in bed. She was only willing to do certain positions and most of the time it seemed more like a chore for her than something she wanted, even if she had been the one who initiated it. I\u2019m not violent but I personally enjoy being a bit more aggressive in bed and she does not respond well to that at all. It started to believe that she is not attracted to me and this put a strain on our relationship.\n\nNow we have been together 3 years and 3 months. She started attending therapy for her depression a few months ago which I fully supported, but something came out that I was not expecting. She sat me down and told me that in therapy she had been discussing previous sexual abuse she experienced. It was brutal stuff. I won\u2019t go into detail out of respect but family members had raped her for years of her childhood. She explained that this is the reason for her holdups in bed, and she used religion as an excuse in our relationship because she didn\u2019t want to tell me she had been abused (she\u2019s never told anyone before, I\u2019m the only person besides her therapist who knows) but she also didn\u2019t want to have sex because it gives her PTSD. She cried as she told me about some of the sick stuff she went through, and promised to work on it so that our relationship will be stronger.. I felt a lot of emotions, mostly heartbreak.\n\nIt\u2019s been about 2 weeks since the truth came out. I want to be there for her but I can\u2019t help but look at her differently. I keep thinking about how much she lied to me over the years to keep this secret, and I don\u2019t want to be angry about it but I sort of am. She has opened up to me a lot and I listen, but most of the time I don\u2019t want to. I hate how what they did to her. I don\u2019t want to hear about it, I miss how it was when I didn\u2019t know. I hate admitting this but I wish she never told me. I don\u2019t know how to respond to this, and I certainly don\u2019t know how I\u2019m supposed to help her. I don\u2019t want to have sex with her anymore because I don\u2019t want her to think of them while she\u2019s with me. I\u2019m afraid that she will bring it up when we are together. I feel bad because I\u2019m the only one she can talk to about this besides her therapist also I recognize how much she must trust me to tell me this, I don\u2019t think I\u2019m the right guy to be with someone so damaged. When I thought she was just religious, I could get over that but now I realize that even if we are married one day, this will be a lifelong battle for her. And for me, as her partner. \n\nShe sensed my discomfort and asked me if it bothers me when she talks about it. I told her the truth, yes it does. She started crying and apologizing and I immediately felt guilty and told her I didn\u2019t mean it. Since then she hasn\u2019t brought it up again, she\u2019s very quiet now. I regret saying anything.\n\n Some part of me wants to run, I just would hate to lose someone so amazing. She really is the most amazing girl, I cannot say that enough. I know this abuse was not her fault at all. I\u2019m wondering if this is a normal initial response from a S/O of sexual abuse or if I really am just an asshole. If it\u2019s a normal response, I will stick it out longer and see how it goes. If I\u2019m just an asshole who is going to keep feeling this way, I think I should break up with her. I still love her so much. If I break up with her now I\u2019m also scared she will know that this is why and be scarred from opening up about it again forever. \n\nWIBTA to leave her? WIBTA to stay? Idk. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe guy is in a long-term relationship with his girlfriend. She told him she was religious and didn't want sex before marriage, but later it turned out she was actually using that as an excuse because she had a history of sexual abuse. Now that she's opened up about the abuse, he's struggling with the knowledge and his feelings towards her. He's conflicted about whether to stay or break up. He's feeling uncomfortable, doesn't want to have sex anymore because he doesn't want her to think of her abusers, and is considering leaving because he feels he's not the right partner for her. But he also loves her a lot and doesn't want to hurt her.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no).\n\nFirst, I should consider the key points here. The girlfriend had a traumatic past that she kept hidden, using religion as a cover. She finally opened up after a year of therapy. The author is now dealing with the emotional fallout. He's feeling a mix of emotions\u2014guilt, discomfort, maybe even a bit of anger or fear. He's worried about their future and his ability to support her. He's also concerned that if he leaves, she might never open up again.\n\nNow, the main issue is whether the author's decision to potentially break up is wrong. Let's think about what's important here. The girlfriend's well-being is crucial. She has PTSD from abuse and needs support. The author is her only confidant besides her therapist. If he leaves, she might lose that support system, which could be harmful.\n\nBut then, relationships require mutual effort. If the author is struggling with his own feelings and can't support her, maybe it's not fair to stay in a relationship where he's unhappy or feels burdened. However, the question is about being \"in the wrong.\" Was the author wrong to feel the way he does? Or is he wrong to consider breaking up because of it?\n\nEmotionally, it's normal to feel overwhelmed by someone else's trauma, especially if it's something that affects intimacy and daily life. But in terms of moral responsibility, the author might feel conflicted. He's not at fault for having these feelings, but if he can't provide the necessary support, maybe leaving is a way to avoid being a toxic presence in her life. On the other hand, if he's the only one she can talk to, leaving might make things harder for her.\n\nAnother angle: he didn't know about the abuse for three years. She didn't tell him because of fear or stigma. Now that she's open, he's dealing with the truth. It's possible he's not in the wrong for feeling the way he does, but if he can't work through those feelings and support her, maybe staying isn't right. However, breaking up immediately might seem hasty, especially if he's not given her time to adjust or if he hasn't sought help for his own emotions.\n\nBut the question is whether he's in the wrong. If he's honest about his feelings and wants to support her but feels he can't, maybe it's not his fault. He's not the abuser, and he's not the one who caused the trauma. His feelings are valid, and if he can't handle the situation, maybe it's not entirely wrong to step back. However, relationships often require compromise and growth. If he's willing to work on his feelings and seek help, that might be a better approach than breaking up impulsively.\n\nAlso, the fact that he's honest with her about his discomfort shows he's trying to be truthful, even if it hurt her. That's a sign of integrity. But he's also aware that his reaction might be causing her pain. So he's in a tough spot.\n\nIn terms of moral judgment, the author isn't the one who abused her. He's trying to be supportive but is struggling. The wrongdoer here is the abuser, not the author. So, he's not in the wrong for having these feelings. However, if he's not willing to put in the work to support her, that could be a problem. But given his current state, it's understandable.\n\nSo, considering all this, I think the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). His feelings are complex, but he's not at fault for the situation. The key is whether he's making a conscious effort to support her, which he is, even if he's struggling. The wrong here isn't on his part.\n"
