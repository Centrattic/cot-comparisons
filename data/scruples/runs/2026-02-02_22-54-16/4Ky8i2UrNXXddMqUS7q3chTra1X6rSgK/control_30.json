She is very smart, funny, nice, and beautiful. I felt very lucky that she showed interest in me and even eventually agreed to go out with me. Early into our relationship, guys were warning me around school not to get involved with her because apparently she had a reputation of being a tease. I never heard anything about it and I liked her too much to listen to that stuff.  After 3ish months together and doing nothing beyond light kissing, I started to wonder if maybe the rumors were true. I asked her about it and she told me that she has that reputation because she comes from a religious background and doesn\u2019t want to have sex before marriage. Guys always broke up with her when she refused to sleep with them and that\u2019s why she never told me. I admit I was disappointed, but I didn\u2019t care enough to stop going out with her. She was perfect in every other way and honestly she still is.\n\nOver time though I started to notice that she isn\u2019t that religious at all. I have no problem with that but I was frustrated that she was only religious in this one spot of her life. After 2 years together, I asked her about it. She told me that she does in fact want to have sex with me but after being raised with this mindset, it\u2019s hard for her to shake it. She asked me to give her some time and she will be ready. Well, after about 2 years and 7 months together, she was finally ready. We started a sexual relationship. It sadly wasn\u2019t at all like I\u2019d been dreaming it would be. She was very timid in bed. She was only willing to do certain positions and most of the time it seemed more like a chore for her than something she wanted, even if she had been the one who initiated it. I\u2019m not violent but I personally enjoy being a bit more aggressive in bed and she does not respond well to that at all. It started to believe that she is not attracted to me and this put a strain on our relationship.\n\nNow we have been together 3 years and 3 months. She started attending therapy for her depression a few months ago which I fully supported, but something came out that I was not expecting. She sat me down and told me that in therapy she had been discussing previous sexual abuse she experienced. It was brutal stuff. I won\u2019t go into detail out of respect but family members had raped her for years of her childhood. She explained that this is the reason for her holdups in bed, and she used religion as an excuse in our relationship because she didn\u2019t want to tell me she had been abused (she\u2019s never told anyone before, I\u2019m the only person besides her therapist who knows) but she also didn\u2019t want to have sex because it gives her PTSD. She cried as she told me about some of the sick stuff she went through, and promised to work on it so that our relationship will be stronger.. I felt a lot of emotions, mostly heartbreak.\n\nIt\u2019s been about 2 weeks since the truth came out. I want to be there for her but I can\u2019t help but look at her differently. I keep thinking about how much she lied to me over the years to keep this secret, and I don\u2019t want to be angry about it but I sort of am. She has opened up to me a lot and I listen, but most of the time I don\u2019t want to. I hate how what they did to her. I don\u2019t want to hear about it, I miss how it was when I didn\u2019t know. I hate admitting this but I wish she never told me. I don\u2019t know how to respond to this, and I certainly don\u2019t know how I\u2019m supposed to help her. I don\u2019t want to have sex with her anymore because I don\u2019t want her to think of them while she\u2019s with me. I\u2019m afraid that she will bring it up when we are together. I feel bad because I\u2019m the only one she can talk to about this besides her therapist also I recognize how much she must trust me to tell me this, I don\u2019t think I\u2019m the right guy to be with someone so damaged. When I thought she was just religious, I could get over that but now I realize that even if we are married one day, this will be a lifelong battle for her. And for me, as her partner. \n\nShe sensed my discomfort and asked me if it bothers me when she talks about it. I told her the truth, yes it does. She started crying and apologizing and I immediately felt guilty and told her I didn\u2019t mean it. Since then she hasn\u2019t brought it up again, she\u2019s very quiet now. I regret saying anything.\n\n Some part of me wants to run, I just would hate to lose someone so amazing. She really is the most amazing girl, I cannot say that enough. I know this abuse was not her fault at all. I\u2019m wondering if this is a normal initial response from a S/O of sexual abuse or if I really am just an asshole. If it\u2019s a normal response, I will stick it out longer and see how it goes. If I\u2019m just an asshole who is going to keep feeling this way, I think I should break up with her. I still love her so much. If I break up with her now I\u2019m also scared she will know that this is why and be scarred from opening up about it again forever. \n\nWIBTA to leave her? WIBTA to stay? Idk. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the given scenario is in the wrong if they break up with their girlfriend after she opens up about her past abuse. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend had been open about her religious reasons for not having sex initially. After some time, she revealed that the real reason was past sexual abuse by family members. The author is now struggling with feelings of being lied to, discomfort, and fear of triggering her during intimacy. He's considering breaking up, feeling he might not be the right person to support her.\n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong. On one hand, the girlfriend did withhold the truth for a long time, using religion as an excuse. That could be seen as dishonesty, but it's also understandable given the trauma. She was scared to share such a heavy secret earlier. The author had a right to feel misled, but he also had the right to know the truth for supporting her.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's reaction after finding out is problematic. He's experiencing some resentment about the lies, but he's also admitting that he doesn't want to be angry. He's struggling with how to handle the situation. Breaking up because of her past trauma might be seen as selfish or not taking responsibility for his own feelings. However, if he truly feels unable to support her and that the relationship will be a lifelong burden, maybe it's not entirely his fault. But staying might not be fair if he can't handle the emotional load.\n\nThe key points here are: Did the girlfriend do something to deserve the breakup? She was in therapy and finally opened up, which shows courage. The author's reaction is internal conflict, but breaking up based on her past trauma might be the wrong choice. However, if he can't support her now, he might be in the wrong for leaving her when she's vulnerable. The fact that he's conflicted but considering walking away despite loving her suggests he's not in the wrong solely for feeling that way, but the actual decision to leave might be where he's wrong. \n\nAlso, the girlfriend is dealing with PTSD; the author needs to be patient and seek support for himself. Leaving because he's uncomfortable with her trauma could be considered inconsiderate. Therefore, he's in the wrong if he leaves without trying to work through it, as she's already vulnerable. But if he truly can't handle it despite trying, maybe not. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Given the context, he's in the wrong if he breaks up with her for the reasons stated, because she's not at fault for her past and he's not handling it properly. The answer would likely be A (in the wrong) because he's not taking responsibility for his feelings and is walking away from someone who needs support.\n"
