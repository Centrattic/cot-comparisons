(Majority of my extended family seems to think so)\nI first posted this on r/relationships, but the mods removed it and told me to ask here, so here it is.\n\nLast year I got to babysit my three little cousins aged 4, 7 and 9 years old  a few times. The first 2-3 times they were well behaved, because I was new, but then they really showed what little brats they can be. Let's just say I've never seen children being so naughty and mean and the parents know, since they act the  same around them. So it's defnitely not the case of oblivious parents  thinking they're raising little angels.\n\nAt first just ignoring their tantrums worked wonders. However, when their mother requests them to do some simple chores, like clean up their toys, ignoring  doesn't work. So after a particularly long argument I decided that the only way to  maintain my position is to discipline the kids and since I didn't know what the house rules on that were, I just decided that I won't get the ones who don't comply the dessert. I warned them about it, gave them 15  minutes to get to cleaning up and sat on the sofa with a book. 10  minutes later the youngest one was already done, the oldest was  reluctantly, but slowly gathering her stuff too and the middle one didn't budge, so I did not give her the dessert and did not allow her to  steal from her sisters. That caused her to throw a fit that I tried to ignore, but in the end she started insulting everyone, trying to hit me and called us (me  and her sisters) pigs for eating dessert.\n\nWhew.  Okay. Parents came home, I informed them that the middle one was behaving horribly and did not clean her room, so she did not get  dessert. I asked what ways of discipline do they use. Should I be giving  them a time-out? Anything? They looked quite  puzzled and said that they just don't do anything, so I proceeded to list all the horrible things they do to illustrate. The parents  told me to \"ask them to stop\" and if anything particularly bad happens,  call them. I should have just left then and there, but I gave the  children a few more chances, which they blew. So I told the parents that  I unfortunately cannot contain the kids, will most likely kill them if I  see them touch the cat again (which they're tormenting all the time) and for my own sanity and out of respect for  their \\[lack of\\] house rules I have to stop babysitting them.\n\nAnd, surprise, surprise, the mother threw an adult version of a fit her child does. I really made an effort to explain how I felt in a respectful way, put an emphasis on how they do not want me to discipline  the children, so I won't go against their wishes, but I also cannot put  up with how naughty they are. She started huffing, told me that I know  nothing, because I'm a child myself and that if I were in her shoes I  would have other matters to worry about. So I said \"okay, suit  yourselves\" and bid them farewell.\n\nNow  it's been a few months since that event and their mother called me  again, pretending like nothing happened, and asked me to babysit for  them again. So I calmly reminded her, that no, I do not intend to take  care of her children unless I am allowed to control their behavior. She  got really mad, pretty much repeated that I know nothing about kids and  hung up. Now I'm learning that she's calling our family members and  complaining about how awful I am and a lot of family members take her side, saying that it's not a babysitter's (or any stranger's) place to discipline the child. So, was I right or misguided to act the way I did? I know that the mother is an asshole herself, that much doesn't need confirmation, but the shocking amount of cousins who approach me and flat out tell me that since I am not the parent, I cannot even put the kids in time-out really confuses me.\n\n**Short version: Distant family members asked me to babysit their very misbehaving  children, but forbid me to disciplining them in any way. I refused to  babysit them under such conditions and now they're turning the family  against me, because apparently I didn't handle the situation well. Apparently many of my (elderly) family members are actually against me, because supposedly the rule is \"a stranger is never allowed to discipline one's children\", which sounds ridiculous to me. So, what  do you think? AMTA?**\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the user wrote about refusing to babysit their cousins because the parents don't allow any discipline. The parents then said that the babysitter shouldn't discipline the kids, and now the family is turning against the author.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation from both sides. The author is a babysitter, and they were dealing with kids who were being really difficult. They tried to use discipline, like taking away dessert, which the parents didn't allow. The parents said they don't discipline their kids, so the author felt that without the ability to manage the kids' behavior, they couldn't safely or effectively babysit. \n\nFrom the author's perspective, it's about safety and respect. If the kids are being violent or causing harm (like touching the cat, which the author mentions), and the parents aren't enforcing any rules, it's a problem. The author tried to follow the parents' rules but found that it wasn't working. They stood up for themselves and their boundaries, which is understandable. The parents, however, might see the author as overstepping by taking away dessert and then refusing to continue babysitting. They might think the author had no right to discipline the kids, even if it was to manage the situation.\n\nNow, the cultural aspect mentioned is that some family members believe that strangers (like the author) shouldn't discipline kids. That's a common belief in some families, but does that make the author wrong? The author is not a stranger; they're a relative, so maybe the family's perspective is a bit off. The key here is whether the author had the authority to discipline. The parents clearly stated they don't want any discipline, so the author's actions of taking away dessert might have been a breach of those rules. But the author felt it was necessary to maintain order, which leads to a conflict.\n\nThe parents' reaction\u2014throwing a fit and turning the family against the author\u2014doesn't help. It seems like the parents are being unreasonable, but the author's refusal to continue might be justified because they can't enforce rules if the parents don't support them. The author also tried to communicate their concerns but was met with hostility.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the author isn't in the wrong because they set boundaries for their own well-being and safety. The parents are responsible for setting discipline rules, but if they don't enforce them, the babysitter can't be expected to manage the chaos. The author's actions were a reasonable response to an impossible situation. The family's side is perhaps more about tradition or discomfort with the babysitter taking any disciplinary action, but that doesn't make the author wrong for prioritizing their own mental health and safety.\n"
