(Majority of my extended family seems to think so)\nI first posted this on r/relationships, but the mods removed it and told me to ask here, so here it is.\n\nLast year I got to babysit my three little cousins aged 4, 7 and 9 years old  a few times. The first 2-3 times they were well behaved, because I was new, but then they really showed what little brats they can be. Let's just say I've never seen children being so naughty and mean and the parents know, since they act the  same around them. So it's defnitely not the case of oblivious parents  thinking they're raising little angels.\n\nAt first just ignoring their tantrums worked wonders. However, when their mother requests them to do some simple chores, like clean up their toys, ignoring  doesn't work. So after a particularly long argument I decided that the only way to  maintain my position is to discipline the kids and since I didn't know what the house rules on that were, I just decided that I won't get the ones who don't comply the dessert. I warned them about it, gave them 15  minutes to get to cleaning up and sat on the sofa with a book. 10  minutes later the youngest one was already done, the oldest was  reluctantly, but slowly gathering her stuff too and the middle one didn't budge, so I did not give her the dessert and did not allow her to  steal from her sisters. That caused her to throw a fit that I tried to ignore, but in the end she started insulting everyone, trying to hit me and called us (me  and her sisters) pigs for eating dessert.\n\nWhew.  Okay. Parents came home, I informed them that the middle one was behaving horribly and did not clean her room, so she did not get  dessert. I asked what ways of discipline do they use. Should I be giving  them a time-out? Anything? They looked quite  puzzled and said that they just don't do anything, so I proceeded to list all the horrible things they do to illustrate. The parents  told me to \"ask them to stop\" and if anything particularly bad happens,  call them. I should have just left then and there, but I gave the  children a few more chances, which they blew. So I told the parents that  I unfortunately cannot contain the kids, will most likely kill them if I  see them touch the cat again (which they're tormenting all the time) and for my own sanity and out of respect for  their \\[lack of\\] house rules I have to stop babysitting them.\n\nAnd, surprise, surprise, the mother threw an adult version of a fit her child does. I really made an effort to explain how I felt in a respectful way, put an emphasis on how they do not want me to discipline  the children, so I won't go against their wishes, but I also cannot put  up with how naughty they are. She started huffing, told me that I know  nothing, because I'm a child myself and that if I were in her shoes I  would have other matters to worry about. So I said \"okay, suit  yourselves\" and bid them farewell.\n\nNow  it's been a few months since that event and their mother called me  again, pretending like nothing happened, and asked me to babysit for  them again. So I calmly reminded her, that no, I do not intend to take  care of her children unless I am allowed to control their behavior. She  got really mad, pretty much repeated that I know nothing about kids and  hung up. Now I'm learning that she's calling our family members and  complaining about how awful I am and a lot of family members take her side, saying that it's not a babysitter's (or any stranger's) place to discipline the child. So, was I right or misguided to act the way I did? I know that the mother is an asshole herself, that much doesn't need confirmation, but the shocking amount of cousins who approach me and flat out tell me that since I am not the parent, I cannot even put the kids in time-out really confuses me.\n\n**Short version: Distant family members asked me to babysit their very misbehaving  children, but forbid me to disciplining them in any way. I refused to  babysit them under such conditions and now they're turning the family  against me, because apparently I didn't handle the situation well. Apparently many of my (elderly) family members are actually against me, because supposedly the rule is \"a stranger is never allowed to discipline one's children\", which sounds ridiculous to me. So, what  do you think? AMTA?**\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about babysitting and discipline.\n\nFirst, the author babysat their cousins and tried to manage their behavior. They tried ignoring tantrums at first, which worked, but when the kids were supposed to clean up, that didn't work. The author decided to enforce a consequence (no dessert) when the middle child didn't comply. They told the parents about the behavior and the parents said they don't discipline and just ask the kids to stop. The author then refused to continue babysitting because they couldn't enforce discipline, leading to conflict with the parents and family turning against them.\n\nThe main issue is whether the author was wrong to refuse babysitting because the parents didn't allow discipline. The author's point is that without the ability to manage behavior, they can't handle the kids, especially with previous bad behavior like tormenting the cat. The parents and extended family think the author overstepped by not disciplining the kids.\n\nI need to consider if the author had a right to set boundaries. If the parents refuse to allow any discipline, but the kids are being harmful or destructive, then the babysitter might be in a difficult position. The author tried to follow the parents' rules but found that it wasn't working. They informed the parents of the problem and the parents' response was dismissive, which led the author to withdraw from the babysitting.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, a babysitter's role can include managing behavior to some extent for safety and reasonableness. If the parents don't allow any discipline, but the children are acting out in ways that could be harmful or disruptive, the babysitter might be justified in refusing the job. The key points are safety, the parents' refusal to set rules, and the babysitter's right to not be in a stressful situation without support.\n\nThe parents' reaction seems to be defensive and dismissive. They didn't address the actual behavior issues and instead blamed the babysitter. The author's stance is that without being able to enforce consequences, they can't keep the kids safe or manageable. Since the parents didn't provide any discipline guidelines and the children's behavior was problematic, the author's refusal seems reasonable. The family's criticism of the author is based on the idea that outsiders shouldn't discipline, but in this case, the lack of discipline was causing issues.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. They set boundaries based on their ability to handle the situation safely and respectfully. The parents' approach doesn't address the children's behavior and is contributing to the problem.
