(Majority of my extended family seems to think so)\nI first posted this on r/relationships, but the mods removed it and told me to ask here, so here it is.\n\nLast year I got to babysit my three little cousins aged 4, 7 and 9 years old  a few times. The first 2-3 times they were well behaved, because I was new, but then they really showed what little brats they can be. Let's just say I've never seen children being so naughty and mean and the parents know, since they act the  same around them. So it's defnitely not the case of oblivious parents  thinking they're raising little angels.\n\nAt first just ignoring their tantrums worked wonders. However, when their mother requests them to do some simple chores, like clean up their toys, ignoring  doesn't work. So after a particularly long argument I decided that the only way to  maintain my position is to discipline the kids and since I didn't know what the house rules on that were, I just decided that I won't get the ones who don't comply the dessert. I warned them about it, gave them 15  minutes to get to cleaning up and sat on the sofa with a book. 10  minutes later the youngest one was already done, the oldest was  reluctantly, but slowly gathering her stuff too and the middle one didn't budge, so I did not give her the dessert and did not allow her to  steal from her sisters. That caused her to throw a fit that I tried to ignore, but in the end she started insulting everyone, trying to hit me and called us (me  and her sisters) pigs for eating dessert.\n\nWhew.  Okay. Parents came home, I informed them that the middle one was behaving horribly and did not clean her room, so she did not get  dessert. I asked what ways of discipline do they use. Should I be giving  them a time-out? Anything? They looked quite  puzzled and said that they just don't do anything, so I proceeded to list all the horrible things they do to illustrate. The parents  told me to \"ask them to stop\" and if anything particularly bad happens,  call them. I should have just left then and there, but I gave the  children a few more chances, which they blew. So I told the parents that  I unfortunately cannot contain the kids, will most likely kill them if I  see them touch the cat again (which they're tormenting all the time) and for my own sanity and out of respect for  their \\[lack of\\] house rules I have to stop babysitting them.\n\nAnd, surprise, surprise, the mother threw an adult version of a fit her child does. I really made an effort to explain how I felt in a respectful way, put an emphasis on how they do not want me to discipline  the children, so I won't go against their wishes, but I also cannot put  up with how naughty they are. She started huffing, told me that I know  nothing, because I'm a child myself and that if I were in her shoes I  would have other matters to worry about. So I said \"okay, suit  yourselves\" and bid them farewell.\n\nNow  it's been a few months since that event and their mother called me  again, pretending like nothing happened, and asked me to babysit for  them again. So I calmly reminded her, that no, I do not intend to take  care of her children unless I am allowed to control their behavior. She  got really mad, pretty much repeated that I know nothing about kids and  hung up. Now I'm learning that she's calling our family members and  complaining about how awful I am and a lot of family members take her side, saying that it's not a babysitter's (or any stranger's) place to discipline the child. So, was I right or misguided to act the way I did? I know that the mother is an asshole herself, that much doesn't need confirmation, but the shocking amount of cousins who approach me and flat out tell me that since I am not the parent, I cannot even put the kids in time-out really confuses me.\n\n**Short version: Distant family members asked me to babysit their very misbehaving  children, but forbid me to disciplining them in any way. I refused to  babysit them under such conditions and now they're turning the family  against me, because apparently I didn't handle the situation well. Apparently many of my (elderly) family members are actually against me, because supposedly the rule is \"a stranger is never allowed to discipline one's children\", which sounds ridiculous to me. So, what  do you think? AMTA?**\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation is about refusing to babysit because the parents don't allow discipline. The author tried to manage the kids, took away dessert as a disciplinary action when the kids were being really bad, and then the parents got upset. Now the parents are badmouthing the author to the extended family, who are taking the parents' side, saying it's not a sitter's place to discipline.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is a babysitter, not a parent. The parents are the ones responsible for setting rules and discipline. The author tried to enforce some structure because the kids were out of control. The parents, however, don't allow any discipline, which the author finds problematic. The author's main issue is that without the ability to discipline, they can't manage the kids effectively, leading to a stressful situation. \n\nBut wait, the parents specifically said they don't want the sitter to discipline. So the author went against that by taking away dessert. That's a problem because the parents are the ones who have the authority and they set the boundaries. The author might have overstepped by using their own methods. However, the kids were being extremely disruptive and even harmful to the cat. The author felt that without the power to enforce rules, it's impossible to maintain order, which could be a valid concern for their own well-being.\n\nOn the other hand, the parents have a right to decide how their children are to be disciplined. If the author wasn't comfortable with the parents' approach, it's reasonable to decline the babysitting job. But the parents are upset because the author acted without their consent. The extended family's reaction is also a factor here. They might not see the value of a sitter having the ability to manage behavior, especially if they think that's the parents' role. \n\nThe key point is whether the author had the right to impose their own discipline without the parents' approval. While the author's intention was to maintain control and protect themselves, the parents' rules were clear. The author's actions could be seen as taking over the parents' role in discipline, which is a sensitive issue. However, the parents' approach of not disciplining at all might be harmful to the kids, which the author is trying to address. \n\nBut the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The parents hired the babysitter with the understanding that the sitter would follow their rules. The author didn't follow those rules, leading to a conflict. Even if the parents are flawed, the author's refusal to comply with their wishes when it comes to discipline could be considered not respecting the parents' authority. The author could have set boundaries from the start, like only babysitting if they could have some input or if the parents were more involved. But after taking disciplinary action without permission, the parents had a right to be upset. \n\nThe author's main justification is their own sanity and the kids' behavior, but the parents might not appreciate someone else imposing their methods. It's a clash between the sitter's responsibility to manage the children and the parents' authority. In many cases, it's expected that the sitter will enforce the parents' rules, not their own. The author might have been in the right to refuse further babysitting if the parents don't allow any discipline, but the initial action of disciplining without permission could be a point of contention. However, the parents' approach is also questionable since they're not setting any boundaries. \n\nSo, considering the parents' explicit instruction and the family's traditional views, the author might be seen as overstepping their role. But if the parents are neglecting their duty, the author's concern is valid. The answer hinges on the agreement between the author and the parents. If the parents agreed to the sitter having some autonomy in discipline, then the author is right. But if the parents clearly said not to discipline, the author didn't follow the agreement. The author's refusal to continue after the conflict might be justified, but the method of disciplining first without permission could be seen as wrong. \n\nIn the end, the author's actions were a bit of a gray area. They had the right to refuse the job if the conditions were incompatible, but enforcing their own rules without consent might not be the best approach. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong, but their approach could have been better. However, the parents are also wrong for not allowing any discipline. The consensus in such discussions usually leans towards the parents having the final say, so the author might be in the right to refuse, but the act of disciplining first is a mistake. But the user's question is whether the author is in the wrong overall. Since the author made a clear boundary and the parents are inconsiderate, the answer might still be B.\n"
