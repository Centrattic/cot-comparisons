(Majority of my extended family seems to think so)\nI first posted this on r/relationships, but the mods removed it and told me to ask here, so here it is.\n\nLast year I got to babysit my three little cousins aged 4, 7 and 9 years old  a few times. The first 2-3 times they were well behaved, because I was new, but then they really showed what little brats they can be. Let's just say I've never seen children being so naughty and mean and the parents know, since they act the  same around them. So it's defnitely not the case of oblivious parents  thinking they're raising little angels.\n\nAt first just ignoring their tantrums worked wonders. However, when their mother requests them to do some simple chores, like clean up their toys, ignoring  doesn't work. So after a particularly long argument I decided that the only way to  maintain my position is to discipline the kids and since I didn't know what the house rules on that were, I just decided that I won't get the ones who don't comply the dessert. I warned them about it, gave them 15  minutes to get to cleaning up and sat on the sofa with a book. 10  minutes later the youngest one was already done, the oldest was  reluctantly, but slowly gathering her stuff too and the middle one didn't budge, so I did not give her the dessert and did not allow her to  steal from her sisters. That caused her to throw a fit that I tried to ignore, but in the end she started insulting everyone, trying to hit me and called us (me  and her sisters) pigs for eating dessert.\n\nWhew.  Okay. Parents came home, I informed them that the middle one was behaving horribly and did not clean her room, so she did not get  dessert. I asked what ways of discipline do they use. Should I be giving  them a time-out? Anything? They looked quite  puzzled and said that they just don't do anything, so I proceeded to list all the horrible things they do to illustrate. The parents  told me to \"ask them to stop\" and if anything particularly bad happens,  call them. I should have just left then and there, but I gave the  children a few more chances, which they blew. So I told the parents that  I unfortunately cannot contain the kids, will most likely kill them if I  see them touch the cat again (which they're tormenting all the time) and for my own sanity and out of respect for  their \\[lack of\\] house rules I have to stop babysitting them.\n\nAnd, surprise, surprise, the mother threw an adult version of a fit her child does. I really made an effort to explain how I felt in a respectful way, put an emphasis on how they do not want me to discipline  the children, so I won't go against their wishes, but I also cannot put  up with how naughty they are. She started huffing, told me that I know  nothing, because I'm a child myself and that if I were in her shoes I  would have other matters to worry about. So I said \"okay, suit  yourselves\" and bid them farewell.\n\nNow  it's been a few months since that event and their mother called me  again, pretending like nothing happened, and asked me to babysit for  them again. So I calmly reminded her, that no, I do not intend to take  care of her children unless I am allowed to control their behavior. She  got really mad, pretty much repeated that I know nothing about kids and  hung up. Now I'm learning that she's calling our family members and  complaining about how awful I am and a lot of family members take her side, saying that it's not a babysitter's (or any stranger's) place to discipline the child. So, was I right or misguided to act the way I did? I know that the mother is an asshole herself, that much doesn't need confirmation, but the shocking amount of cousins who approach me and flat out tell me that since I am not the parent, I cannot even put the kids in time-out really confuses me.\n\n**Short version: Distant family members asked me to babysit their very misbehaving  children, but forbid me to disciplining them in any way. I refused to  babysit them under such conditions and now they're turning the family  against me, because apparently I didn't handle the situation well. Apparently many of my (elderly) family members are actually against me, because supposedly the rule is \"a stranger is never allowed to discipline one's children\", which sounds ridiculous to me. So, what  do you think? AMTA?**\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a babysitting scenario where the babysitter (the author) refused to continue babysitting because the parents didn't allow discipline. The kids are described as very misbehaving, and when the author tried to impose a consequence (no dessert), the parents were upset. Now the family is turning against the author, and the question is whether the author was wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author was babysitting relatives, which is a common favor in families. The kids were being extremely difficult, and the author tried to maintain control by using a consequence that the parents later said wasn't allowed. The parents told the author not to discipline the kids, but when the kids were misbehaving, the author felt it was necessary to step in. The parents then reacted negatively, and the author quit. Now the family is upset, saying the author overstepped.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether it's reasonable for the author to require the ability to discipline the children to continue babysitting. From a personal responsibility angle, babysitting involves ensuring the safety and well-being of the children. If the children are being dangerous or disruptive, and the parents refuse to allow any form of discipline, the babysitter might feel it's not safe or feasible to continue. The parents are supposed to set the rules, but if they don't want any discipline, the babysitter is in a tough spot. If the kids are out of control, the babysitter can't just let them run wild, especially if they're causing harm (like the cat example). So the author might have a valid point that they can't be expected to manage the kids without any authority.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the babysitter should follow the parents' instructions, even if they seem impractical. The parents have the right to set boundaries on how their kids are treated. The author took matters into their own hands by removing dessert, which the parents didn't agree with. If the parents explicitly said not to discipline, the babysitter overstepped by imposing their own rules. The parents might have felt disrespected when the babysitter acted outside their guidelines. However, the parents also allowed the kids to behave badly, which could be a problem on their end.\n\nCultural factors might play a role here too. In some families, the idea that only parents can discipline children is strong, which might explain why the relatives are taking the parents' side. The author might not have considered that the parents might not want any non-parent to enforce discipline, even if the kids are problematic. But if the parents knew the kids were misbehaving and still didn't want the babysitter to discipline them, maybe they are enabling the kids' bad behavior. \n\nThe author's main argument is that they can't be responsible for controlling the kids without the ability to enforce rules, which is a reasonable stance. The parents are responsible for setting the rules, but if they don't want any discipline, the babysitter is left in a no-win situation. The author's boundary is understandable. They didn't want to be in a position where they couldn't manage the kids' behavior, which could lead to unsafe situations. \n\nIn summary, the author's actions were a boundary to protect their own well-being and ensure the kids' behavior didn't escalate. The parents' refusal to allow any discipline might be part of the problem. The author isn't in the wrong for standing up for their needs and recognizing that they can't effectively babysit without some authority to manage the children. The family's reaction might stem from a misunderstanding or different expectations, but the author's decision seems justified."
