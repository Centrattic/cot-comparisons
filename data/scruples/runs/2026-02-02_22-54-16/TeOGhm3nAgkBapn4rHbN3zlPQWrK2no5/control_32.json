(Majority of my extended family seems to think so)\nI first posted this on r/relationships, but the mods removed it and told me to ask here, so here it is.\n\nLast year I got to babysit my three little cousins aged 4, 7 and 9 years old  a few times. The first 2-3 times they were well behaved, because I was new, but then they really showed what little brats they can be. Let's just say I've never seen children being so naughty and mean and the parents know, since they act the  same around them. So it's defnitely not the case of oblivious parents  thinking they're raising little angels.\n\nAt first just ignoring their tantrums worked wonders. However, when their mother requests them to do some simple chores, like clean up their toys, ignoring  doesn't work. So after a particularly long argument I decided that the only way to  maintain my position is to discipline the kids and since I didn't know what the house rules on that were, I just decided that I won't get the ones who don't comply the dessert. I warned them about it, gave them 15  minutes to get to cleaning up and sat on the sofa with a book. 10  minutes later the youngest one was already done, the oldest was  reluctantly, but slowly gathering her stuff too and the middle one didn't budge, so I did not give her the dessert and did not allow her to  steal from her sisters. That caused her to throw a fit that I tried to ignore, but in the end she started insulting everyone, trying to hit me and called us (me  and her sisters) pigs for eating dessert.\n\nWhew.  Okay. Parents came home, I informed them that the middle one was behaving horribly and did not clean her room, so she did not get  dessert. I asked what ways of discipline do they use. Should I be giving  them a time-out? Anything? They looked quite  puzzled and said that they just don't do anything, so I proceeded to list all the horrible things they do to illustrate. The parents  told me to \"ask them to stop\" and if anything particularly bad happens,  call them. I should have just left then and there, but I gave the  children a few more chances, which they blew. So I told the parents that  I unfortunately cannot contain the kids, will most likely kill them if I  see them touch the cat again (which they're tormenting all the time) and for my own sanity and out of respect for  their \\[lack of\\] house rules I have to stop babysitting them.\n\nAnd, surprise, surprise, the mother threw an adult version of a fit her child does. I really made an effort to explain how I felt in a respectful way, put an emphasis on how they do not want me to discipline  the children, so I won't go against their wishes, but I also cannot put  up with how naughty they are. She started huffing, told me that I know  nothing, because I'm a child myself and that if I were in her shoes I  would have other matters to worry about. So I said \"okay, suit  yourselves\" and bid them farewell.\n\nNow  it's been a few months since that event and their mother called me  again, pretending like nothing happened, and asked me to babysit for  them again. So I calmly reminded her, that no, I do not intend to take  care of her children unless I am allowed to control their behavior. She  got really mad, pretty much repeated that I know nothing about kids and  hung up. Now I'm learning that she's calling our family members and  complaining about how awful I am and a lot of family members take her side, saying that it's not a babysitter's (or any stranger's) place to discipline the child. So, was I right or misguided to act the way I did? I know that the mother is an asshole herself, that much doesn't need confirmation, but the shocking amount of cousins who approach me and flat out tell me that since I am not the parent, I cannot even put the kids in time-out really confuses me.\n\n**Short version: Distant family members asked me to babysit their very misbehaving  children, but forbid me to disciplining them in any way. I refused to  babysit them under such conditions and now they're turning the family  against me, because apparently I didn't handle the situation well. Apparently many of my (elderly) family members are actually against me, because supposedly the rule is \"a stranger is never allowed to discipline one's children\", which sounds ridiculous to me. So, what  do you think? AMTA?**\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for refusing to babysit because the parents didn't allow discipline. The key points here are the parents' stance on discipline, the kids' behavior, and the author's response.\n\nFirst, the author tried to manage the kids by implementing a dessert timeout, which worked for some but not all. The parents then said they don't discipline their kids, just ask them to stop. The author felt this wasn't effective and eventually quit, leading to the parents being upset and spreading negative things.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that without the ability to discipline, they can't manage the kids' behavior, especially when the kids are being harmful (like tormenting the cat). The parents, on the other hand, expect the babysitter to just ask the kids to stop and not impose any consequences.\n\nFrom a general perspective, the parents have the right to decide their parenting style, even if it's unconventional. However, the babysitter's role is to enforce the parents' rules. The author might have overstepped by implementing their own discipline (taking away dessert) without prior agreement. The parents didn't want that, so the author's refusal to continue under those conditions is a choice, but the method of discipline was unauthorized.\n\nBut then again, if the parents are aware the kids misbehave and are not enforcing any discipline, the babysitter's job is challenging. The author might feel that without any tools to manage behavior, it's unreasonable to take on the role. However, the parents didn't agree to any discipline, so the author's actions were against the parents' wishes.\n\nIn terms of family expectations, the author's actions of using dessert as a punishment might be seen as overstepping, especially if the parents didn't consent to that method. The author's refusal to continue is a personal decision, but the way they enforced discipline without permission could be seen as the author's fault. The parents have the right to enforce their own rules, even if they're lenient.\n\nSo, considering that the author acted against the parents' explicit instructions by using their own disciplinary method, they might be in the wrong. However, if the parents knew the kids were problematic and still expected the babysitter to manage without discipline, there's a middle ground. But the main issue is the unauthorized use of discipline, which the parents didn't agree to. Therefore, the author could be in the wrong for not adhering to the parents' wishes from the start.\n"
