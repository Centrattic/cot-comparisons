(Majority of my extended family seems to think so)\nI first posted this on r/relationships, but the mods removed it and told me to ask here, so here it is.\n\nLast year I got to babysit my three little cousins aged 4, 7 and 9 years old  a few times. The first 2-3 times they were well behaved, because I was new, but then they really showed what little brats they can be. Let's just say I've never seen children being so naughty and mean and the parents know, since they act the  same around them. So it's defnitely not the case of oblivious parents  thinking they're raising little angels.\n\nAt first just ignoring their tantrums worked wonders. However, when their mother requests them to do some simple chores, like clean up their toys, ignoring  doesn't work. So after a particularly long argument I decided that the only way to  maintain my position is to discipline the kids and since I didn't know what the house rules on that were, I just decided that I won't get the ones who don't comply the dessert. I warned them about it, gave them 15  minutes to get to cleaning up and sat on the sofa with a book. 10  minutes later the youngest one was already done, the oldest was  reluctantly, but slowly gathering her stuff too and the middle one didn't budge, so I did not give her the dessert and did not allow her to  steal from her sisters. That caused her to throw a fit that I tried to ignore, but in the end she started insulting everyone, trying to hit me and called us (me  and her sisters) pigs for eating dessert.\n\nWhew.  Okay. Parents came home, I informed them that the middle one was behaving horribly and did not clean her room, so she did not get  dessert. I asked what ways of discipline do they use. Should I be giving  them a time-out? Anything? They looked quite  puzzled and said that they just don't do anything, so I proceeded to list all the horrible things they do to illustrate. The parents  told me to \"ask them to stop\" and if anything particularly bad happens,  call them. I should have just left then and there, but I gave the  children a few more chances, which they blew. So I told the parents that  I unfortunately cannot contain the kids, will most likely kill them if I  see them touch the cat again (which they're tormenting all the time) and for my own sanity and out of respect for  their \\[lack of\\] house rules I have to stop babysitting them.\n\nAnd, surprise, surprise, the mother threw an adult version of a fit her child does. I really made an effort to explain how I felt in a respectful way, put an emphasis on how they do not want me to discipline  the children, so I won't go against their wishes, but I also cannot put  up with how naughty they are. She started huffing, told me that I know  nothing, because I'm a child myself and that if I were in her shoes I  would have other matters to worry about. So I said \"okay, suit  yourselves\" and bid them farewell.\n\nNow  it's been a few months since that event and their mother called me  again, pretending like nothing happened, and asked me to babysit for  them again. So I calmly reminded her, that no, I do not intend to take  care of her children unless I am allowed to control their behavior. She  got really mad, pretty much repeated that I know nothing about kids and  hung up. Now I'm learning that she's calling our family members and  complaining about how awful I am and a lot of family members take her side, saying that it's not a babysitter's (or any stranger's) place to discipline the child. So, was I right or misguided to act the way I did? I know that the mother is an asshole herself, that much doesn't need confirmation, but the shocking amount of cousins who approach me and flat out tell me that since I am not the parent, I cannot even put the kids in time-out really confuses me.\n\n**Short version: Distant family members asked me to babysit their very misbehaving  children, but forbid me to disciplining them in any way. I refused to  babysit them under such conditions and now they're turning the family  against me, because apparently I didn't handle the situation well. Apparently many of my (elderly) family members are actually against me, because supposedly the rule is \"a stranger is never allowed to discipline one's children\", which sounds ridiculous to me. So, what  do you think? AMTA?**\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong for refusing to babysit their relatives because the parents don't allow them to discipline the kids. The options are A (yes, they're wrong) or B (no, they're not wrong).\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation thoroughly. The author babysat three cousins, the kids were very mischievous, and when they tried to discipline the middle child by taking away dessert (as a way to enforce cleaning up), the parents didn't support that. The parents said they don't discipline and just ask the kids to stop. The author tried to follow the parents' wishes but the kids kept acting out. Eventually, the author decided not to babysit anymore because they couldn't handle the behavior and the parents weren't allowing any form of discipline. The mother reacted angrily, and now the author is facing criticism from family members who think a babysitter shouldn't discipline the kids.\n\nNow, considering the ethics and social norms here. Babysitting typically implies some level of supervision and discipline, especially if the kids are not well-behaved. However, the parents in this case explicitly stated they don't want the babysitter to discipline their children. The author tried to enforce some structure but was overruled. The parents' approach seems permissive to the point of enabling bad behavior, which might be a problem on their side.\n\nThe author is firm in their stance that they can't be responsible for children they can't discipline, which is a reasonable position. If the parents don't want their kids to be disciplined, they should either manage the behavior themselves or find a babysitter who can work within their rules. However, if the kids are being harmful or destructive, the babysitter has a right to refuse if they can't ensure safety and order.\n\nThe family members criticizing the author seem to be taking the parents' side, possibly due to traditional views about not allowing outsiders to discipline children. But from a modern perspective, especially in childcare situations, it's standard to have some form of discipline to manage behavior. The author's actions were in self-defense and to prevent harm, so they're justified in their decision.\n\nAlso, the parents' reaction and spreading negative things about the author after the fact indicate their own issues. The author was clear about their boundaries and followed through when those boundaries weren't respected.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. They stood up for their need to manage the children's behavior to ensure a safe environment, which is a reasonable expectation when providing childcare services.\n"
