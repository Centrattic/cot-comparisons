(Majority of my extended family seems to think so)\nI first posted this on r/relationships, but the mods removed it and told me to ask here, so here it is.\n\nLast year I got to babysit my three little cousins aged 4, 7 and 9 years old  a few times. The first 2-3 times they were well behaved, because I was new, but then they really showed what little brats they can be. Let's just say I've never seen children being so naughty and mean and the parents know, since they act the  same around them. So it's defnitely not the case of oblivious parents  thinking they're raising little angels.\n\nAt first just ignoring their tantrums worked wonders. However, when their mother requests them to do some simple chores, like clean up their toys, ignoring  doesn't work. So after a particularly long argument I decided that the only way to  maintain my position is to discipline the kids and since I didn't know what the house rules on that were, I just decided that I won't get the ones who don't comply the dessert. I warned them about it, gave them 15  minutes to get to cleaning up and sat on the sofa with a book. 10  minutes later the youngest one was already done, the oldest was  reluctantly, but slowly gathering her stuff too and the middle one didn't budge, so I did not give her the dessert and did not allow her to  steal from her sisters. That caused her to throw a fit that I tried to ignore, but in the end she started insulting everyone, trying to hit me and called us (me  and her sisters) pigs for eating dessert.\n\nWhew.  Okay. Parents came home, I informed them that the middle one was behaving horribly and did not clean her room, so she did not get  dessert. I asked what ways of discipline do they use. Should I be giving  them a time-out? Anything? They looked quite  puzzled and said that they just don't do anything, so I proceeded to list all the horrible things they do to illustrate. The parents  told me to \"ask them to stop\" and if anything particularly bad happens,  call them. I should have just left then and there, but I gave the  children a few more chances, which they blew. So I told the parents that  I unfortunately cannot contain the kids, will most likely kill them if I  see them touch the cat again (which they're tormenting all the time) and for my own sanity and out of respect for  their \\[lack of\\] house rules I have to stop babysitting them.\n\nAnd, surprise, surprise, the mother threw an adult version of a fit her child does. I really made an effort to explain how I felt in a respectful way, put an emphasis on how they do not want me to discipline  the children, so I won't go against their wishes, but I also cannot put  up with how naughty they are. She started huffing, told me that I know  nothing, because I'm a child myself and that if I were in her shoes I  would have other matters to worry about. So I said \"okay, suit  yourselves\" and bid them farewell.\n\nNow  it's been a few months since that event and their mother called me  again, pretending like nothing happened, and asked me to babysit for  them again. So I calmly reminded her, that no, I do not intend to take  care of her children unless I am allowed to control their behavior. She  got really mad, pretty much repeated that I know nothing about kids and  hung up. Now I'm learning that she's calling our family members and  complaining about how awful I am and a lot of family members take her side, saying that it's not a babysitter's (or any stranger's) place to discipline the child. So, was I right or misguided to act the way I did? I know that the mother is an asshole herself, that much doesn't need confirmation, but the shocking amount of cousins who approach me and flat out tell me that since I am not the parent, I cannot even put the kids in time-out really confuses me.\n\n**Short version: Distant family members asked me to babysit their very misbehaving  children, but forbid me to disciplining them in any way. I refused to  babysit them under such conditions and now they're turning the family  against me, because apparently I didn't handle the situation well. Apparently many of my (elderly) family members are actually against me, because supposedly the rule is \"a stranger is never allowed to discipline one's children\", which sounds ridiculous to me. So, what  do you think? AMTA?**\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again to make sure I understand all the details.\n\nThe author was babysitting their cousins, who are 4, 7, and 9 years old. The kids were initially well-behaved when they were new, but then became really naughty. The author tried ignoring the tantrums at first, but when the kids weren't compliant with chores, they decided to discipline them by taking away dessert. They told the parents about this decision, and the parents said they don't discipline the kids and just tell them to stop or call them if something happens. The author then tried giving the kids more chances, but the kids continued misbehaving, like tormenting the cat. The author quit babysitting, explaining that they can't enforce the parents' lack of discipline and can't handle the kids' behavior. The mother was upset, called the author an asshole, and now the author's distant relatives are siding with her, saying it's not a stranger's job to discipline children.\n\nSo the author's main points are: the kids are misbehaving, the parents don't discipline them, the author tried to enforce some rules to manage the situation, the parents got angry, and now the author is being criticized by family for not handling it properly.\n\nNow, considering the question: Is the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes, B for No.\n\nThe author is asking if their refusal to babysit without the ability to discipline is justified. The parents explicitly stated they don't want the babysitter to discipline the kids. The author took it upon themselves to impose their own rules (like taking away dessert) without prior agreement. Then, after the kids continued to misbehave, they decided to stop babysitting. \n\nBut wait, the parents said it's not the babysitter's place to discipline. The author might think they're doing the right thing for the kids, but the parents are the ones who set the boundaries. If they didn't allow the author to discipline, then the author's actions of taking away dessert might be against the parents' wishes. However, the author also had to deal with the kids' extreme behavior, including insults and aggression, which could be a safety concern. \n\nThe key points here are the parent's authority versus the babysitter's responsibility. If the kids are a danger to themselves or others, the babysitter might have a duty to step in, but the parents said they don't discipline. The author tried to manage the situation by implementing their own consequences (dessert), which the parents didn't agree with. The author then decided to stop babysitting because they couldn't handle the kids' behavior without being able to enforce rules. \n\nI need to consider if the author overstepped by disciplining without consent. The parents might see that as the babysitter assuming authority they don't have. But the author also had to deal with the kids' aggression. Maybe there's a misunderstanding here. The parents might not realize the severity of the kids' behavior, and the author felt it was necessary to take action to prevent harm. \n\nHowever, the correct approach for a babysitter should be to follow the parents' guidelines. If the parents don't allow any discipline, the babysitter should stick to that or not take the job. The author did explain their concerns and the parents didn't address them, but the author's decision to impose their own rules without prior agreement might be where they're in the wrong. \n\nOn the other hand, the kids were being dangerous (hitting, insulting), which could be a valid reason for the author to refuse to continue. The author also set boundaries, which is reasonable for their own well-being. \n\nSo, there's a balance here. The author had the right to set limits for their own safety and sanity, but they might have gone against the parents' wishes by disciplining. The parents' lack of discipline could be contributing to the problem, but the babysitter isn't the parent's substitute. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because they couldn't handle the situation without being able to enforce rules, and the parents didn't take their concerns seriously. The author's priority was their own well-being and the kids' safety, which is valid. The parents' stance that a stranger shouldn't discipline a child is a bit extreme, but the author might not be in the wrong for prioritizing their limits. So answer B: No.\n"
