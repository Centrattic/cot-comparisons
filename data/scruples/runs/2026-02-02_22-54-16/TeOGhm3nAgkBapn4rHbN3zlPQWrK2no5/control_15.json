(Majority of my extended family seems to think so)\nI first posted this on r/relationships, but the mods removed it and told me to ask here, so here it is.\n\nLast year I got to babysit my three little cousins aged 4, 7 and 9 years old  a few times. The first 2-3 times they were well behaved, because I was new, but then they really showed what little brats they can be. Let's just say I've never seen children being so naughty and mean and the parents know, since they act the  same around them. So it's defnitely not the case of oblivious parents  thinking they're raising little angels.\n\nAt first just ignoring their tantrums worked wonders. However, when their mother requests them to do some simple chores, like clean up their toys, ignoring  doesn't work. So after a particularly long argument I decided that the only way to  maintain my position is to discipline the kids and since I didn't know what the house rules on that were, I just decided that I won't get the ones who don't comply the dessert. I warned them about it, gave them 15  minutes to get to cleaning up and sat on the sofa with a book. 10  minutes later the youngest one was already done, the oldest was  reluctantly, but slowly gathering her stuff too and the middle one didn't budge, so I did not give her the dessert and did not allow her to  steal from her sisters. That caused her to throw a fit that I tried to ignore, but in the end she started insulting everyone, trying to hit me and called us (me  and her sisters) pigs for eating dessert.\n\nWhew.  Okay. Parents came home, I informed them that the middle one was behaving horribly and did not clean her room, so she did not get  dessert. I asked what ways of discipline do they use. Should I be giving  them a time-out? Anything? They looked quite  puzzled and said that they just don't do anything, so I proceeded to list all the horrible things they do to illustrate. The parents  told me to \"ask them to stop\" and if anything particularly bad happens,  call them. I should have just left then and there, but I gave the  children a few more chances, which they blew. So I told the parents that  I unfortunately cannot contain the kids, will most likely kill them if I  see them touch the cat again (which they're tormenting all the time) and for my own sanity and out of respect for  their \\[lack of\\] house rules I have to stop babysitting them.\n\nAnd, surprise, surprise, the mother threw an adult version of a fit her child does. I really made an effort to explain how I felt in a respectful way, put an emphasis on how they do not want me to discipline  the children, so I won't go against their wishes, but I also cannot put  up with how naughty they are. She started huffing, told me that I know  nothing, because I'm a child myself and that if I were in her shoes I  would have other matters to worry about. So I said \"okay, suit  yourselves\" and bid them farewell.\n\nNow  it's been a few months since that event and their mother called me  again, pretending like nothing happened, and asked me to babysit for  them again. So I calmly reminded her, that no, I do not intend to take  care of her children unless I am allowed to control their behavior. She  got really mad, pretty much repeated that I know nothing about kids and  hung up. Now I'm learning that she's calling our family members and  complaining about how awful I am and a lot of family members take her side, saying that it's not a babysitter's (or any stranger's) place to discipline the child. So, was I right or misguided to act the way I did? I know that the mother is an asshole herself, that much doesn't need confirmation, but the shocking amount of cousins who approach me and flat out tell me that since I am not the parent, I cannot even put the kids in time-out really confuses me.\n\n**Short version: Distant family members asked me to babysit their very misbehaving  children, but forbid me to disciplining them in any way. I refused to  babysit them under such conditions and now they're turning the family  against me, because apparently I didn't handle the situation well. Apparently many of my (elderly) family members are actually against me, because supposedly the rule is \"a stranger is never allowed to discipline one's children\", which sounds ridiculous to me. So, what  do you think? AMTA?**\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for refusing to babysit because the parents don't allow discipline. Their cousins were really misbehaving, and when they tried to discipline by taking away dessert, the parents got upset.\n\nSo, the key points here: The user was babysitting and found the kids difficult. They tried to discipline to manage the behavior, but the parents didn't want them to. The user then stopped babysitting because they couldn't handle it without discipline. Now, the parents are spreading complaints, and the extended family sides with them, saying the user shouldn't discipline as a stranger.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the user's actions. Babysitting can be a tough job, especially with kids who are challenging. The user tried ignoring at first, which worked for a while, but when that failed, they used their own method of taking away dessert. The parents didn't have a set discipline policy, so the user had to make a judgment call. However, the parents explicitly said they don't discipline and told the user to just ask the kids to stop or call them. The user felt forced to leave because they couldn't enforce any rules, leading to a conflict.\n\nNow, the question is whether the user was right or wrong. On one hand, the user is a babysitter, and part of the job is managing the kids' behavior. If the parents don't allow any discipline, the babysitter might be in a no-win situation. On the other hand, the parents might expect the babysitter to follow their rules, even if they're strict. The user's approach of using dessert as punishment might be seen as overstepping, especially if the parents didn't agree to it beforehand. \n\nBut the user clearly communicated their reasoning when they stopped babysitting. They explained that the kids were too difficult to manage without discipline. The parents' reaction was hostile, and now the relatives are taking their side, implying that the user shouldn't have disciplined the children. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the parents are the ones setting the house rules. If they don't want the babysitter to discipline, they need to have their own strategies. The user tried to follow the parents' initial instructions and then set boundaries based on their own limits. It's possible that the user acted in their own best interest and the children's well-being, as consistent discipline is important. However, the user might have overstepped by implementing their own discipline without prior agreement.\n\nBut given that the parents were aware of the children's behavior and still didn't provide a method for discipline, the user might be justified in refusing to continue without the necessary tools to manage the situation. The parents are in the wrong for expecting the babysitter to handle the kids without any authority. The user's refusal is about setting healthy boundaries. So, the user isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
