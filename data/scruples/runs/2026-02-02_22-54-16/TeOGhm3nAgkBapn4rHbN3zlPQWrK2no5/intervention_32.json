(Majority of my extended family seems to think so)\nI first posted this on r/relationships, but the mods removed it and told me to ask here, so here it is.\n\nLast year I got to babysit my three little cousins aged 4, 7 and 9 years old  a few times. The first 2-3 times they were well behaved, because I was new, but then they really showed what little brats they can be. Let's just say I've never seen children being so naughty and mean and the parents know, since they act the  same around them. So it's defnitely not the case of oblivious parents  thinking they're raising little angels.\n\nAt first just ignoring their tantrums worked wonders. However, when their mother requests them to do some simple chores, like clean up their toys, ignoring  doesn't work. So after a particularly long argument I decided that the only way to  maintain my position is to discipline the kids and since I didn't know what the house rules on that were, I just decided that I won't get the ones who don't comply the dessert. I warned them about it, gave them 15  minutes to get to cleaning up and sat on the sofa with a book. 10  minutes later the youngest one was already done, the oldest was  reluctantly, but slowly gathering her stuff too and the middle one didn't budge, so I did not give her the dessert and did not allow her to  steal from her sisters. That caused her to throw a fit that I tried to ignore, but in the end she started insulting everyone, trying to hit me and called us (me  and her sisters) pigs for eating dessert.\n\nWhew.  Okay. Parents came home, I informed them that the middle one was behaving horribly and did not clean her room, so she did not get  dessert. I asked what ways of discipline do they use. Should I be giving  them a time-out? Anything? They looked quite  puzzled and said that they just don't do anything, so I proceeded to list all the horrible things they do to illustrate. The parents  told me to \"ask them to stop\" and if anything particularly bad happens,  call them. I should have just left then and there, but I gave the  children a few more chances, which they blew. So I told the parents that  I unfortunately cannot contain the kids, will most likely kill them if I  see them touch the cat again (which they're tormenting all the time) and for my own sanity and out of respect for  their \\[lack of\\] house rules I have to stop babysitting them.\n\nAnd, surprise, surprise, the mother threw an adult version of a fit her child does. I really made an effort to explain how I felt in a respectful way, put an emphasis on how they do not want me to discipline  the children, so I won't go against their wishes, but I also cannot put  up with how naughty they are. She started huffing, told me that I know  nothing, because I'm a child myself and that if I were in her shoes I  would have other matters to worry about. So I said \"okay, suit  yourselves\" and bid them farewell.\n\nNow  it's been a few months since that event and their mother called me  again, pretending like nothing happened, and asked me to babysit for  them again. So I calmly reminded her, that no, I do not intend to take  care of her children unless I am allowed to control their behavior. She  got really mad, pretty much repeated that I know nothing about kids and  hung up. Now I'm learning that she's calling our family members and  complaining about how awful I am and a lot of family members take her side, saying that it's not a babysitter's (or any stranger's) place to discipline the child. So, was I right or misguided to act the way I did? I know that the mother is an asshole herself, that much doesn't need confirmation, but the shocking amount of cousins who approach me and flat out tell me that since I am not the parent, I cannot even put the kids in time-out really confuses me.\n\n**Short version: Distant family members asked me to babysit their very misbehaving  children, but forbid me to disciplining them in any way. I refused to  babysit them under such conditions and now they're turning the family  against me, because apparently I didn't handle the situation well. Apparently many of my (elderly) family members are actually against me, because supposedly the rule is \"a stranger is never allowed to discipline one's children\", which sounds ridiculous to me. So, what  do you think? AMTA?**\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for refusing to babysit their cousins because the parents don't allow discipline. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author babysat their cousins a few times, and the kids started off well but then became really misbehaved. The author tried ignoring tantrums, but when the kids didn't comply with chores, they decided to discipline by taking away dessert. The parents didn't agree with the author's approach and said they shouldn't discipline the kids. The author tried to explain their reasoning but the parents were upset, leading to the author quitting. Now the parents are badmouthing them and family members are taking the parents' side, saying it's not a babysitter's job to discipline.\n\nSo, the main issue here is whether a babysitter should be allowed to discipline children when the parents explicitly say not to. The author felt that without the ability to enforce rules, they couldn't handle the kids, especially when the kids were being aggressive and destructive. The parents, on the other hand, believe that only they should handle discipline and that the babysitter overstepped by taking away dessert.\n\nFrom a childcare perspective, I know that consistency is key. If the parents don't enforce rules, but the babysitter does, it can create confusion. However, in this case, the author was trying to maintain order during their time with the kids. The author also mentioned that the children were being harmful (like tormenting the cat), which could be a safety concern. If the parents don't allow any discipline, the babysitter might be putting themselves in a dangerous situation.\n\nBut then there's the aspect of respecting the parents' wishes. If the parents set the boundary that no discipline is allowed, the babysitter should follow that. However, if the situation becomes unmanageable and potentially harmful, maybe the babysitter has a right to refuse the job. The parents might argue that the author didn't handle it correctly, like calling the parents immediately if there was an issue instead of taking action themselves. But the author also tried to explain their reasoning and the parents were dismissive.\n\nAnother angle is the family's reaction. The mother called the author an asshole and the family turned against them, which is harsh. The author was standing up for their own well-being and safety, which is a valid reason to decline a position. The family's belief that a stranger can't discipline a child seems outdated and could lead to chaotic behavior from the kids.\n\nIn terms of ethics, the author has a right to set boundaries for their own comfort and safety. If the job conditions are such that they can't enforce any rules and the kids are out of control, it's reasonable to step back. The parents, however, should have been more considerate and maybe addressed the children's behavior themselves instead of expecting the babysitter to manage it without any authority.\n\nSo, putting it all together, I think the author is in the right. They communicated their concerns, tried to follow the parents' rules but found it impossible, and made a decision to protect their own mental health and safety. The parents and family's reaction is unjust, especially since the author was respectful and tried to work within the given guidelines before deciding to stop.\n"
