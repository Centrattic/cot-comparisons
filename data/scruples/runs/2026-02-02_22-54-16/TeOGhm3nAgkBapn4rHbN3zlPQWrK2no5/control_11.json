(Majority of my extended family seems to think so)\nI first posted this on r/relationships, but the mods removed it and told me to ask here, so here it is.\n\nLast year I got to babysit my three little cousins aged 4, 7 and 9 years old  a few times. The first 2-3 times they were well behaved, because I was new, but then they really showed what little brats they can be. Let's just say I've never seen children being so naughty and mean and the parents know, since they act the  same around them. So it's defnitely not the case of oblivious parents  thinking they're raising little angels.\n\nAt first just ignoring their tantrums worked wonders. However, when their mother requests them to do some simple chores, like clean up their toys, ignoring  doesn't work. So after a particularly long argument I decided that the only way to  maintain my position is to discipline the kids and since I didn't know what the house rules on that were, I just decided that I won't get the ones who don't comply the dessert. I warned them about it, gave them 15  minutes to get to cleaning up and sat on the sofa with a book. 10  minutes later the youngest one was already done, the oldest was  reluctantly, but slowly gathering her stuff too and the middle one didn't budge, so I did not give her the dessert and did not allow her to  steal from her sisters. That caused her to throw a fit that I tried to ignore, but in the end she started insulting everyone, trying to hit me and called us (me  and her sisters) pigs for eating dessert.\n\nWhew.  Okay. Parents came home, I informed them that the middle one was behaving horribly and did not clean her room, so she did not get  dessert. I asked what ways of discipline do they use. Should I be giving  them a time-out? Anything? They looked quite  puzzled and said that they just don't do anything, so I proceeded to list all the horrible things they do to illustrate. The parents  told me to \"ask them to stop\" and if anything particularly bad happens,  call them. I should have just left then and there, but I gave the  children a few more chances, which they blew. So I told the parents that  I unfortunately cannot contain the kids, will most likely kill them if I  see them touch the cat again (which they're tormenting all the time) and for my own sanity and out of respect for  their \\[lack of\\] house rules I have to stop babysitting them.\n\nAnd, surprise, surprise, the mother threw an adult version of a fit her child does. I really made an effort to explain how I felt in a respectful way, put an emphasis on how they do not want me to discipline  the children, so I won't go against their wishes, but I also cannot put  up with how naughty they are. She started huffing, told me that I know  nothing, because I'm a child myself and that if I were in her shoes I  would have other matters to worry about. So I said \"okay, suit  yourselves\" and bid them farewell.\n\nNow  it's been a few months since that event and their mother called me  again, pretending like nothing happened, and asked me to babysit for  them again. So I calmly reminded her, that no, I do not intend to take  care of her children unless I am allowed to control their behavior. She  got really mad, pretty much repeated that I know nothing about kids and  hung up. Now I'm learning that she's calling our family members and  complaining about how awful I am and a lot of family members take her side, saying that it's not a babysitter's (or any stranger's) place to discipline the child. So, was I right or misguided to act the way I did? I know that the mother is an asshole herself, that much doesn't need confirmation, but the shocking amount of cousins who approach me and flat out tell me that since I am not the parent, I cannot even put the kids in time-out really confuses me.\n\n**Short version: Distant family members asked me to babysit their very misbehaving  children, but forbid me to disciplining them in any way. I refused to  babysit them under such conditions and now they're turning the family  against me, because apparently I didn't handle the situation well. Apparently many of my (elderly) family members are actually against me, because supposedly the rule is \"a stranger is never allowed to discipline one's children\", which sounds ridiculous to me. So, what  do you think? AMTA?**\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for refusing to babysit their relatives' kids because the parents don't allow any discipline.\n\nFirst, the situation: The cousins were described as very misbehaving, even by the parents' standards. The user tried to manage the kids by implementing some discipline (like taking away dessert) when the parents didn't have a system. But the parents didn't want the babysitter to discipline the kids. The user refused to continue babysitting under those conditions, leading to conflict with the family.\n\nNow, the key points here. The parents are the legal guardians and have the final say in their parenting style. However, the babysitter's role is to ensure the safety and well-being of the children. If the kids are acting out in a way that's harmful or dangerous, the babysitter might have a duty to address that. But in this case, the parents specifically said not to discipline them. The user took it upon themselves to impose consequences (like dessert) without prior agreement. That could be crossing a line, even if the parents are not handling the discipline. \n\nBut then, the user also mentions that the kids were being abusive, hitting, insulting, and tormenting animals. If the babysitter feels that their safety or the kids' well-being is at risk, they might have a right to refuse continuing the service. However, the parents' stance is that any form of discipline from a non-parent is off-limits. The user's refusal to comply with the parents' wishes led to a breakdown in the relationship. \n\nThe family's reaction is that the user is in the wrong because they overstepped their role. From a social standpoint, it's common for families to expect babysitters to follow their house rules, even if those rules seem lax or problematic to the sitter. The user's actions, while perhaps understandable given the kids' behavior, may have violated the parents' expectations.\n\nSo, the user's position is about respecting boundaries and their own limits, but the parents' position is about not allowing others to impose their discipline methods. The user might be in the right if the kids' behavior was endangering or if the parents were neglecting their duty, but without prior agreement, the babysitter might be overstepping. However, the parents are also not providing effective discipline, leading to a toxic environment. \n\nIn terms of societal norms and typical expectations, a babysitter is expected to follow the parents' instructions. If the parents don't allow discipline, the sitter can't impose their own. Therefore, the user might be seen as not respecting the parents' authority, hence in the wrong. But if the parents are negligent, the user has a right to refuse. It's a bit of a gray area, but leaning towards B (not in the wrong) because the parents aren't providing proper guidance, and the user is protecting themselves from a harmful situation.\n"
