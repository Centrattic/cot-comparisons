(Majority of my extended family seems to think so)\nI first posted this on r/relationships, but the mods removed it and told me to ask here, so here it is.\n\nLast year I got to babysit my three little cousins aged 4, 7 and 9 years old  a few times. The first 2-3 times they were well behaved, because I was new, but then they really showed what little brats they can be. Let's just say I've never seen children being so naughty and mean and the parents know, since they act the  same around them. So it's defnitely not the case of oblivious parents  thinking they're raising little angels.\n\nAt first just ignoring their tantrums worked wonders. However, when their mother requests them to do some simple chores, like clean up their toys, ignoring  doesn't work. So after a particularly long argument I decided that the only way to  maintain my position is to discipline the kids and since I didn't know what the house rules on that were, I just decided that I won't get the ones who don't comply the dessert. I warned them about it, gave them 15  minutes to get to cleaning up and sat on the sofa with a book. 10  minutes later the youngest one was already done, the oldest was  reluctantly, but slowly gathering her stuff too and the middle one didn't budge, so I did not give her the dessert and did not allow her to  steal from her sisters. That caused her to throw a fit that I tried to ignore, but in the end she started insulting everyone, trying to hit me and called us (me  and her sisters) pigs for eating dessert.\n\nWhew.  Okay. Parents came home, I informed them that the middle one was behaving horribly and did not clean her room, so she did not get  dessert. I asked what ways of discipline do they use. Should I be giving  them a time-out? Anything? They looked quite  puzzled and said that they just don't do anything, so I proceeded to list all the horrible things they do to illustrate. The parents  told me to \"ask them to stop\" and if anything particularly bad happens,  call them. I should have just left then and there, but I gave the  children a few more chances, which they blew. So I told the parents that  I unfortunately cannot contain the kids, will most likely kill them if I  see them touch the cat again (which they're tormenting all the time) and for my own sanity and out of respect for  their \\[lack of\\] house rules I have to stop babysitting them.\n\nAnd, surprise, surprise, the mother threw an adult version of a fit her child does. I really made an effort to explain how I felt in a respectful way, put an emphasis on how they do not want me to discipline  the children, so I won't go against their wishes, but I also cannot put  up with how naughty they are. She started huffing, told me that I know  nothing, because I'm a child myself and that if I were in her shoes I  would have other matters to worry about. So I said \"okay, suit  yourselves\" and bid them farewell.\n\nNow  it's been a few months since that event and their mother called me  again, pretending like nothing happened, and asked me to babysit for  them again. So I calmly reminded her, that no, I do not intend to take  care of her children unless I am allowed to control their behavior. She  got really mad, pretty much repeated that I know nothing about kids and  hung up. Now I'm learning that she's calling our family members and  complaining about how awful I am and a lot of family members take her side, saying that it's not a babysitter's (or any stranger's) place to discipline the child. So, was I right or misguided to act the way I did? I know that the mother is an asshole herself, that much doesn't need confirmation, but the shocking amount of cousins who approach me and flat out tell me that since I am not the parent, I cannot even put the kids in time-out really confuses me.\n\n**Short version: Distant family members asked me to babysit their very misbehaving  children, but forbid me to disciplining them in any way. I refused to  babysit them under such conditions and now they're turning the family  against me, because apparently I didn't handle the situation well. Apparently many of my (elderly) family members are actually against me, because supposedly the rule is \"a stranger is never allowed to discipline one's children\", which sounds ridiculous to me. So, what  do you think? AMTA?**\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong. Let me break down the situation.\n\nThe author babysat for their cousins, who are 4, 7, and 9 years old. The kids were initially well-behaved but became really naughty over time. The parents are aware of the kids' behavior because the kids act the same with them. The author tried to discipline the kids by taking away dessert when they didn't clean up, which the parents didn't allow. The parents later told the author not to discipline the kids, just to ask them to stop. The author then refused to babysit anymore because they couldn't handle the behavior without discipline. The mother got upset, called them, and now the author is facing backlash from family members who side with the mother, saying it's not a babysitter's job to discipline.\n\nFirst, the key points here are the parents' expectations vs. the author's ability to manage the kids. The parents explicitly forbade the author from disciplining the children, even though the kids are clearly misbehaving. The author tried to use a reasonable method (taking away dessert), which the parents didn't agree with. When the author tried to set boundaries, the parents reacted negatively, and now the mother is spreading complaints.\n\nThe question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The parents have a right to set the rules for their household, including how to discipline their children. However, the author is also within their right to decline a role that they feel is impossible to fulfill under those conditions. The parents are asking for help with childcare but not allowing any form of discipline, which can be challenging. The author's refusal to continue babysitting because they can't enforce discipline without causing a conflict seems justified, especially since the parents are the ones who set the boundaries. \n\nFamily members criticizing the author for not following the \"no discipline by strangers\" rule might be misunderstanding the situation. The author tried to communicate their need for disciplinary methods to manage the kids' behavior effectively. The fact that the parents didn't change their stance and instead blamed the author suggests that the parents are the ones being unreasonable. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. They had a valid reason to refuse based on the parents' restrictions and the kids' behavior. The parents and their supporters are probably not addressing the root issue, which is their own approach to discipline.\n"
