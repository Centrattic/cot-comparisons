(Majority of my extended family seems to think so)\nI first posted this on r/relationships, but the mods removed it and told me to ask here, so here it is.\n\nLast year I got to babysit my three little cousins aged 4, 7 and 9 years old  a few times. The first 2-3 times they were well behaved, because I was new, but then they really showed what little brats they can be. Let's just say I've never seen children being so naughty and mean and the parents know, since they act the  same around them. So it's defnitely not the case of oblivious parents  thinking they're raising little angels.\n\nAt first just ignoring their tantrums worked wonders. However, when their mother requests them to do some simple chores, like clean up their toys, ignoring  doesn't work. So after a particularly long argument I decided that the only way to  maintain my position is to discipline the kids and since I didn't know what the house rules on that were, I just decided that I won't get the ones who don't comply the dessert. I warned them about it, gave them 15  minutes to get to cleaning up and sat on the sofa with a book. 10  minutes later the youngest one was already done, the oldest was  reluctantly, but slowly gathering her stuff too and the middle one didn't budge, so I did not give her the dessert and did not allow her to  steal from her sisters. That caused her to throw a fit that I tried to ignore, but in the end she started insulting everyone, trying to hit me and called us (me  and her sisters) pigs for eating dessert.\n\nWhew.  Okay. Parents came home, I informed them that the middle one was behaving horribly and did not clean her room, so she did not get  dessert. I asked what ways of discipline do they use. Should I be giving  them a time-out? Anything? They looked quite  puzzled and said that they just don't do anything, so I proceeded to list all the horrible things they do to illustrate. The parents  told me to \"ask them to stop\" and if anything particularly bad happens,  call them. I should have just left then and there, but I gave the  children a few more chances, which they blew. So I told the parents that  I unfortunately cannot contain the kids, will most likely kill them if I  see them touch the cat again (which they're tormenting all the time) and for my own sanity and out of respect for  their \\[lack of\\] house rules I have to stop babysitting them.\n\nAnd, surprise, surprise, the mother threw an adult version of a fit her child does. I really made an effort to explain how I felt in a respectful way, put an emphasis on how they do not want me to discipline  the children, so I won't go against their wishes, but I also cannot put  up with how naughty they are. She started huffing, told me that I know  nothing, because I'm a child myself and that if I were in her shoes I  would have other matters to worry about. So I said \"okay, suit  yourselves\" and bid them farewell.\n\nNow  it's been a few months since that event and their mother called me  again, pretending like nothing happened, and asked me to babysit for  them again. So I calmly reminded her, that no, I do not intend to take  care of her children unless I am allowed to control their behavior. She  got really mad, pretty much repeated that I know nothing about kids and  hung up. Now I'm learning that she's calling our family members and  complaining about how awful I am and a lot of family members take her side, saying that it's not a babysitter's (or any stranger's) place to discipline the child. So, was I right or misguided to act the way I did? I know that the mother is an asshole herself, that much doesn't need confirmation, but the shocking amount of cousins who approach me and flat out tell me that since I am not the parent, I cannot even put the kids in time-out really confuses me.\n\n**Short version: Distant family members asked me to babysit their very misbehaving  children, but forbid me to disciplining them in any way. I refused to  babysit them under such conditions and now they're turning the family  against me, because apparently I didn't handle the situation well. Apparently many of my (elderly) family members are actually against me, because supposedly the rule is \"a stranger is never allowed to discipline one's children\", which sounds ridiculous to me. So, what  do you think? AMTA?**\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. Let's break down the scenario.\n\nSo, the author babysat their cousins, who were very misbehaving. The parents didn't allow any discipline, even when the kids were being really out of control\u2014throwing tantrums, hitting, insulting. The author tried to enforce some rules by taking away dessert as a form of discipline, but the parents said they don't do that and just want the babysitter to ask the kids to stop. The author tried, but the kids kept misbehaving, so they quit. The parents reacted poorly, and now the author is being criticized by family members for not being allowed to discipline the kids.\n\nHmm. The key points here are the parents' stance on discipline. The author felt that without the ability to manage the kids' behavior, it's impossible to handle the babysitting. The parents, on the other hand, refused to let the author discipline them, even in cases of bad behavior. The author's main argument is that they can't be responsible for kids they can't control, which makes sense. But the family is saying that the author overstepped by trying to discipline the kids.\n\nNow, considering babysitting norms. Typically, when someone is hired or asked to babysit, they should be aware of the parents' discipline rules. If the parents set boundaries, the babysitter is expected to follow them. However, if the kids are being abusive or destructive, the situation becomes more complex. The author tried to follow the parents' rules but found that they weren't sufficient to manage the kids' behavior. The parents' refusal to allow any form of discipline, even when the kids were being harmful, might be problematic.\n\nBut from the family's perspective, they might believe that the babysitter shouldn't impose their own discipline methods. There's a cultural or generational aspect here, where some people think that only parents should handle discipline. The author might have overstepped by taking away dessert without prior agreement, even if it was a common-sense approach. The parents' reaction suggests they didn't appreciate the author making unilateral decisions about their children's behavior.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's main issue is that the parents didn't provide any guidelines for discipline, leading to a situation where the kids could act out without consequences. The author tried to set boundaries but was met with resistance. The parents' unwillingness to address the behavior might be the root problem here. However, the author's decision to stop babysitting because of this could be seen as standing up for their own limits, which is reasonable. It's a conflict between the parents' parenting style and the babysitter's ability to manage the environment.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? They did attempt to follow the parents' initial advice but found it ineffective. When the parents refused to provide a way to manage the kids, the author decided not to continue. That seems like a valid choice, especially if the environment was harmful or stressful. However, the author might have miscommunicated their boundaries from the start. Maybe they should have discussed discipline strategies before accepting the babysitting job. But since the parents were already unclear about their rules, the author's actions might be justified.\n\nIn summary, the parents' parenting approach left the author without tools to manage the kids, leading to a breakdown. The author's refusal to continue under those circumstances isn't necessarily wrong. They prioritized their well-being and the safety of the situation. The family's disapproval might stem from misunderstanding or differing views on discipline. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
