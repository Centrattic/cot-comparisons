(Majority of my extended family seems to think so)\nI first posted this on r/relationships, but the mods removed it and told me to ask here, so here it is.\n\nLast year I got to babysit my three little cousins aged 4, 7 and 9 years old  a few times. The first 2-3 times they were well behaved, because I was new, but then they really showed what little brats they can be. Let's just say I've never seen children being so naughty and mean and the parents know, since they act the  same around them. So it's defnitely not the case of oblivious parents  thinking they're raising little angels.\n\nAt first just ignoring their tantrums worked wonders. However, when their mother requests them to do some simple chores, like clean up their toys, ignoring  doesn't work. So after a particularly long argument I decided that the only way to  maintain my position is to discipline the kids and since I didn't know what the house rules on that were, I just decided that I won't get the ones who don't comply the dessert. I warned them about it, gave them 15  minutes to get to cleaning up and sat on the sofa with a book. 10  minutes later the youngest one was already done, the oldest was  reluctantly, but slowly gathering her stuff too and the middle one didn't budge, so I did not give her the dessert and did not allow her to  steal from her sisters. That caused her to throw a fit that I tried to ignore, but in the end she started insulting everyone, trying to hit me and called us (me  and her sisters) pigs for eating dessert.\n\nWhew.  Okay. Parents came home, I informed them that the middle one was behaving horribly and did not clean her room, so she did not get  dessert. I asked what ways of discipline do they use. Should I be giving  them a time-out? Anything? They looked quite  puzzled and said that they just don't do anything, so I proceeded to list all the horrible things they do to illustrate. The parents  told me to \"ask them to stop\" and if anything particularly bad happens,  call them. I should have just left then and there, but I gave the  children a few more chances, which they blew. So I told the parents that  I unfortunately cannot contain the kids, will most likely kill them if I  see them touch the cat again (which they're tormenting all the time) and for my own sanity and out of respect for  their \\[lack of\\] house rules I have to stop babysitting them.\n\nAnd, surprise, surprise, the mother threw an adult version of a fit her child does. I really made an effort to explain how I felt in a respectful way, put an emphasis on how they do not want me to discipline  the children, so I won't go against their wishes, but I also cannot put  up with how naughty they are. She started huffing, told me that I know  nothing, because I'm a child myself and that if I were in her shoes I  would have other matters to worry about. So I said \"okay, suit  yourselves\" and bid them farewell.\n\nNow  it's been a few months since that event and their mother called me  again, pretending like nothing happened, and asked me to babysit for  them again. So I calmly reminded her, that no, I do not intend to take  care of her children unless I am allowed to control their behavior. She  got really mad, pretty much repeated that I know nothing about kids and  hung up. Now I'm learning that she's calling our family members and  complaining about how awful I am and a lot of family members take her side, saying that it's not a babysitter's (or any stranger's) place to discipline the child. So, was I right or misguided to act the way I did? I know that the mother is an asshole herself, that much doesn't need confirmation, but the shocking amount of cousins who approach me and flat out tell me that since I am not the parent, I cannot even put the kids in time-out really confuses me.\n\n**Short version: Distant family members asked me to babysit their very misbehaving  children, but forbid me to disciplining them in any way. I refused to  babysit them under such conditions and now they're turning the family  against me, because apparently I didn't handle the situation well. Apparently many of my (elderly) family members are actually against me, because supposedly the rule is \"a stranger is never allowed to discipline one's children\", which sounds ridiculous to me. So, what  do you think? AMTA?**\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about refusing to babysit because the relatives don't allow discipline. The kids are described as very misbehaving, and the author tried to discipline them by taking away dessert, but the parents didn't want that. Now the family is upset, and the author is being criticized.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is a babysitter, which is typically someone who cares for children in the absence of parents. Discipline is a big part of childcare to manage behavior. But the parents in this case are against any form of discipline by the babysitter. The author felt that without the ability to enforce rules, it's impossible to manage the kids, leading to a stressful situation. \n\nThe key points are: the kids are misbehaving, the parents don't allow discipline, the author tried to handle it by using a consequence (dessert), but the parents didn't support it. The author then decided to stop babysitting, which led to conflict. \n\nI should think about the expectations in babysitting. Usually, a babysitter is expected to follow the parents' rules regarding discipline. If the parents say not to discipline, the babysitter has to adhere to that, even if they disagree. However, if the children's behavior is harmful or unmanageable, the babysitter has the right to refuse the job if they can't enforce necessary boundaries. \n\nIn this case, the parents explicitly told the author not to discipline the kids. The author, however, tried to use a consequence (no dessert) which the parents didn't agree with. That could be a problem because the babysitter is overstepping the parents' instructions. But the author did ask the parents about discipline methods and was told to just ask the kids to stop and call them if needed. The author then tried multiple times, but the kids kept misbehaving. \n\nThe parents' reaction was negative, and they're now spreading the narrative that the author was wrong. The author's reasoning is that without the ability to discipline, it's impossible to manage the kids, and their own well-being is at stake. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the parents clearly set the rules and the author went against them by disciplining, that's a problem. However, if the parents' rules make the situation unmanageable and the babysitter can't provide a safe environment, then refusing the job is reasonable. The line here is whether the author had the authority to decide on discipline without the parents' approval. Since the parents explicitly stated they don't want the babysitter to discipline, the author should have followed their instructions and perhaps discussed the issue before taking action. But the author tried to handle it and then decided to quit, which might be justified if the parents' approach is leading to harmful behavior.\n\nIn summary, the author's actions might be seen as overstepping the parents' wishes by disciplining without their approval. However, the parents' refusal to address the children's problematic behavior could also be a factor. The author's right to set boundaries for their own sanity and safety might be valid, but they should have perhaps communicated more clearly or refused the job from the start if they couldn't agree on discipline methods. So, the answer might lean towards the author not being in the wrong (B) because they had a reasonable concern for their well-being and the children's behavior, but there's a gray area about following the parents' rules.\n"
