(Majority of my extended family seems to think so)\nI first posted this on r/relationships, but the mods removed it and told me to ask here, so here it is.\n\nLast year I got to babysit my three little cousins aged 4, 7 and 9 years old  a few times. The first 2-3 times they were well behaved, because I was new, but then they really showed what little brats they can be. Let's just say I've never seen children being so naughty and mean and the parents know, since they act the  same around them. So it's defnitely not the case of oblivious parents  thinking they're raising little angels.\n\nAt first just ignoring their tantrums worked wonders. However, when their mother requests them to do some simple chores, like clean up their toys, ignoring  doesn't work. So after a particularly long argument I decided that the only way to  maintain my position is to discipline the kids and since I didn't know what the house rules on that were, I just decided that I won't get the ones who don't comply the dessert. I warned them about it, gave them 15  minutes to get to cleaning up and sat on the sofa with a book. 10  minutes later the youngest one was already done, the oldest was  reluctantly, but slowly gathering her stuff too and the middle one didn't budge, so I did not give her the dessert and did not allow her to  steal from her sisters. That caused her to throw a fit that I tried to ignore, but in the end she started insulting everyone, trying to hit me and called us (me  and her sisters) pigs for eating dessert.\n\nWhew.  Okay. Parents came home, I informed them that the middle one was behaving horribly and did not clean her room, so she did not get  dessert. I asked what ways of discipline do they use. Should I be giving  them a time-out? Anything? They looked quite  puzzled and said that they just don't do anything, so I proceeded to list all the horrible things they do to illustrate. The parents  told me to \"ask them to stop\" and if anything particularly bad happens,  call them. I should have just left then and there, but I gave the  children a few more chances, which they blew. So I told the parents that  I unfortunately cannot contain the kids, will most likely kill them if I  see them touch the cat again (which they're tormenting all the time) and for my own sanity and out of respect for  their \\[lack of\\] house rules I have to stop babysitting them.\n\nAnd, surprise, surprise, the mother threw an adult version of a fit her child does. I really made an effort to explain how I felt in a respectful way, put an emphasis on how they do not want me to discipline  the children, so I won't go against their wishes, but I also cannot put  up with how naughty they are. She started huffing, told me that I know  nothing, because I'm a child myself and that if I were in her shoes I  would have other matters to worry about. So I said \"okay, suit  yourselves\" and bid them farewell.\n\nNow  it's been a few months since that event and their mother called me  again, pretending like nothing happened, and asked me to babysit for  them again. So I calmly reminded her, that no, I do not intend to take  care of her children unless I am allowed to control their behavior. She  got really mad, pretty much repeated that I know nothing about kids and  hung up. Now I'm learning that she's calling our family members and  complaining about how awful I am and a lot of family members take her side, saying that it's not a babysitter's (or any stranger's) place to discipline the child. So, was I right or misguided to act the way I did? I know that the mother is an asshole herself, that much doesn't need confirmation, but the shocking amount of cousins who approach me and flat out tell me that since I am not the parent, I cannot even put the kids in time-out really confuses me.\n\n**Short version: Distant family members asked me to babysit their very misbehaving  children, but forbid me to disciplining them in any way. I refused to  babysit them under such conditions and now they're turning the family  against me, because apparently I didn't handle the situation well. Apparently many of my (elderly) family members are actually against me, because supposedly the rule is \"a stranger is never allowed to discipline one's children\", which sounds ridiculous to me. So, what  do you think? AMTA?**\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about babysitting for distant relatives and refusing to continue because the parents won't allow any discipline. The author disciplined the kids by taking away dessert, which the parents didn't agree with, and then when asked to not discipline, the author refused to babysit anymore. Now the family is turning against them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author was babysitting, which typically involves taking care of the kids, but the parents don't allow any discipline. The kids are described as very misbehaving, even by the parents' standards. The author tried to maintain order by using a form of discipline (withholding dessert), which the parents didn't support. Then the parents told the author not to discipline, but the kids continued to misbehave, leading the author to quit.\n\nThe parents are upset and spreading negative things about the author. The author argues that they can't babysit without the ability to discipline because the kids are too unruly. The family members side with the parents, saying it's not a babysitter's job to discipline.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, the parents have the final say in how their children are raised. The author tried to follow the parents' rules initially but when they didn't align with the author's ability to manage the kids, they quit. The parents didn't like that the author took initiative, so maybe there's a clash of expectations.\n\nBut also, the parents are the ones who set the rules. If they don't want the babysitter to discipline, they should have made that clear from the start. However, when the author tried to enforce some structure, the parents didn't support it. The author might feel that without the ability to discipline, the job is too stressful or impossible. So the author's decision to quit is based on the inability to manage the kids under the given conditions.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it depends on the expectations. The author isn't the parent, so they don't have the authority to enforce their own rules. However, the parents' approach of not disciplining leads to a problematic situation. The author is in a no-win scenario: either let the kids misbehave or act against the parents' wishes. The parents might see the author as overstepping, but the author sees it as necessary for safety and sanity.\n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because they tried to communicate their needs and set boundaries. The parents are responsible for their children's behavior and the rules. The author's refusal to continue when the conditions are unmanageable is reasonable. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
