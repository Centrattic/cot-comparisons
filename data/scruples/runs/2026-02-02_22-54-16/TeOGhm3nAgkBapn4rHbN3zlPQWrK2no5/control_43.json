(Majority of my extended family seems to think so)\nI first posted this on r/relationships, but the mods removed it and told me to ask here, so here it is.\n\nLast year I got to babysit my three little cousins aged 4, 7 and 9 years old  a few times. The first 2-3 times they were well behaved, because I was new, but then they really showed what little brats they can be. Let's just say I've never seen children being so naughty and mean and the parents know, since they act the  same around them. So it's defnitely not the case of oblivious parents  thinking they're raising little angels.\n\nAt first just ignoring their tantrums worked wonders. However, when their mother requests them to do some simple chores, like clean up their toys, ignoring  doesn't work. So after a particularly long argument I decided that the only way to  maintain my position is to discipline the kids and since I didn't know what the house rules on that were, I just decided that I won't get the ones who don't comply the dessert. I warned them about it, gave them 15  minutes to get to cleaning up and sat on the sofa with a book. 10  minutes later the youngest one was already done, the oldest was  reluctantly, but slowly gathering her stuff too and the middle one didn't budge, so I did not give her the dessert and did not allow her to  steal from her sisters. That caused her to throw a fit that I tried to ignore, but in the end she started insulting everyone, trying to hit me and called us (me  and her sisters) pigs for eating dessert.\n\nWhew.  Okay. Parents came home, I informed them that the middle one was behaving horribly and did not clean her room, so she did not get  dessert. I asked what ways of discipline do they use. Should I be giving  them a time-out? Anything? They looked quite  puzzled and said that they just don't do anything, so I proceeded to list all the horrible things they do to illustrate. The parents  told me to \"ask them to stop\" and if anything particularly bad happens,  call them. I should have just left then and there, but I gave the  children a few more chances, which they blew. So I told the parents that  I unfortunately cannot contain the kids, will most likely kill them if I  see them touch the cat again (which they're tormenting all the time) and for my own sanity and out of respect for  their \\[lack of\\] house rules I have to stop babysitting them.\n\nAnd, surprise, surprise, the mother threw an adult version of a fit her child does. I really made an effort to explain how I felt in a respectful way, put an emphasis on how they do not want me to discipline  the children, so I won't go against their wishes, but I also cannot put  up with how naughty they are. She started huffing, told me that I know  nothing, because I'm a child myself and that if I were in her shoes I  would have other matters to worry about. So I said \"okay, suit  yourselves\" and bid them farewell.\n\nNow  it's been a few months since that event and their mother called me  again, pretending like nothing happened, and asked me to babysit for  them again. So I calmly reminded her, that no, I do not intend to take  care of her children unless I am allowed to control their behavior. She  got really mad, pretty much repeated that I know nothing about kids and  hung up. Now I'm learning that she's calling our family members and  complaining about how awful I am and a lot of family members take her side, saying that it's not a babysitter's (or any stranger's) place to discipline the child. So, was I right or misguided to act the way I did? I know that the mother is an asshole herself, that much doesn't need confirmation, but the shocking amount of cousins who approach me and flat out tell me that since I am not the parent, I cannot even put the kids in time-out really confuses me.\n\n**Short version: Distant family members asked me to babysit their very misbehaving  children, but forbid me to disciplining them in any way. I refused to  babysit them under such conditions and now they're turning the family  against me, because apparently I didn't handle the situation well. Apparently many of my (elderly) family members are actually against me, because supposedly the rule is \"a stranger is never allowed to discipline one's children\", which sounds ridiculous to me. So, what  do you think? AMTA?**\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see here. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about refusing to babysit for distant relatives because they don't allow any discipline of the kids. The author had a bad experience where the kids were very misbehaving, and when they tried to impose a discipline (like taking away dessert), the parents didn't support it and instead told them not to discipline. The author then quit babysitting and is now being criticized by family members for being the bad one.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The parents said they don't want the babysitter to discipline the kids. The kids were being particularly naughty, even attacking the cat. The author tried to manage the situation by setting boundaries, but the parents didn't support that. The author then decided not to continue, which led to conflict. The family is now taking the parents' side, believing that a babysitter shouldn't discipline the kids.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author was right to refuse to babysit under those conditions. From a common-sense perspective, babysitters are expected to maintain discipline and safety. If the parents don't allow any disciplinary action, it's a recipe for chaos. The kids' behavior was so bad that the author felt it was necessary to set some rules. However, the parents didn't support that, which complicates the situation.\n\nBut the parents are the ones who set the rules. If they don't want their kids disciplined, the babysitter can't enforce their own methods. The author's actions might be seen as overstepping, especially since they took away dessert without prior agreement. Even though the parents didn't support discipline, the author might have handled it differently. Maybe they should have communicated their concerns earlier or set boundaries before taking action. \n\nOn the other hand, the parents are not standing by their own kids' misbehavior. The author tried to inform them and even asked about discipline methods. The parents' response was dismissive, which could mean they're in denial about their kids' behavior. The author's refusal to continue babysitting could be justified because they can't manage the situation without the parents' support.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, there's often an expectation that a babysitter can manage children's behavior. If the parents don't provide a way for the babysitter to do that, it's a problem. However, the author did take some unilateral actions (taking away dessert) which might not align with the parents' wishes, even if the parents are not enforcing discipline. \n\nSo, the author's main issue is that they tried to enforce discipline without the parents' approval, leading to conflict. The parents, while being poor at managing their kids, are the legal guardians and their rules should be followed. The author should have probably discussed the matter more thoroughly before taking actions that the parents didn't agree with. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for acting without the parents' consent, even if their intentions were good. However, the parents' approach is also problematic. It's a bit of a gray area, but the key point is that the author took actions the parents didn't agree to, which led to the conflict. So maybe the answer is A (author is in the wrong), but I'm a bit conflicted because the parents are also not handling their kids well. However, the parents' rules are what's important here.\n"
