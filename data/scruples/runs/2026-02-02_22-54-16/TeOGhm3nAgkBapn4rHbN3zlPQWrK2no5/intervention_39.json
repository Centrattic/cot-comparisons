(Majority of my extended family seems to think so)\nI first posted this on r/relationships, but the mods removed it and told me to ask here, so here it is.\n\nLast year I got to babysit my three little cousins aged 4, 7 and 9 years old  a few times. The first 2-3 times they were well behaved, because I was new, but then they really showed what little brats they can be. Let's just say I've never seen children being so naughty and mean and the parents know, since they act the  same around them. So it's defnitely not the case of oblivious parents  thinking they're raising little angels.\n\nAt first just ignoring their tantrums worked wonders. However, when their mother requests them to do some simple chores, like clean up their toys, ignoring  doesn't work. So after a particularly long argument I decided that the only way to  maintain my position is to discipline the kids and since I didn't know what the house rules on that were, I just decided that I won't get the ones who don't comply the dessert. I warned them about it, gave them 15  minutes to get to cleaning up and sat on the sofa with a book. 10  minutes later the youngest one was already done, the oldest was  reluctantly, but slowly gathering her stuff too and the middle one didn't budge, so I did not give her the dessert and did not allow her to  steal from her sisters. That caused her to throw a fit that I tried to ignore, but in the end she started insulting everyone, trying to hit me and called us (me  and her sisters) pigs for eating dessert.\n\nWhew.  Okay. Parents came home, I informed them that the middle one was behaving horribly and did not clean her room, so she did not get  dessert. I asked what ways of discipline do they use. Should I be giving  them a time-out? Anything? They looked quite  puzzled and said that they just don't do anything, so I proceeded to list all the horrible things they do to illustrate. The parents  told me to \"ask them to stop\" and if anything particularly bad happens,  call them. I should have just left then and there, but I gave the  children a few more chances, which they blew. So I told the parents that  I unfortunately cannot contain the kids, will most likely kill them if I  see them touch the cat again (which they're tormenting all the time) and for my own sanity and out of respect for  their \\[lack of\\] house rules I have to stop babysitting them.\n\nAnd, surprise, surprise, the mother threw an adult version of a fit her child does. I really made an effort to explain how I felt in a respectful way, put an emphasis on how they do not want me to discipline  the children, so I won't go against their wishes, but I also cannot put  up with how naughty they are. She started huffing, told me that I know  nothing, because I'm a child myself and that if I were in her shoes I  would have other matters to worry about. So I said \"okay, suit  yourselves\" and bid them farewell.\n\nNow  it's been a few months since that event and their mother called me  again, pretending like nothing happened, and asked me to babysit for  them again. So I calmly reminded her, that no, I do not intend to take  care of her children unless I am allowed to control their behavior. She  got really mad, pretty much repeated that I know nothing about kids and  hung up. Now I'm learning that she's calling our family members and  complaining about how awful I am and a lot of family members take her side, saying that it's not a babysitter's (or any stranger's) place to discipline the child. So, was I right or misguided to act the way I did? I know that the mother is an asshole herself, that much doesn't need confirmation, but the shocking amount of cousins who approach me and flat out tell me that since I am not the parent, I cannot even put the kids in time-out really confuses me.\n\n**Short version: Distant family members asked me to babysit their very misbehaving  children, but forbid me to disciplining them in any way. I refused to  babysit them under such conditions and now they're turning the family  against me, because apparently I didn't handle the situation well. Apparently many of my (elderly) family members are actually against me, because supposedly the rule is \"a stranger is never allowed to discipline one's children\", which sounds ridiculous to me. So, what  do you think? AMTA?**\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about refusing to babysit for distant relatives because they won't let them discipline the kids. The author had a bad experience where the kids were really misbehaving, tried to discipline them by taking away dessert, but the parents didn't support that. Now the parents are badmouthing them to the family, and the author is being criticized by relatives for not just following their rules.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is a babysitter, but not a formal one. They're a relative, or at least part of the extended family. The key issue is whether it's reasonable for the author to require the right to discipline the children when they're in their care. The parents are adamant that the babysitter can't discipline the kids, which leads to the author walking away from the situation.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, they're trying to manage a situation where the kids are being unreasonably destructive and disrespectful. They tried to use a form of discipline (withholding dessert) that the parents didn't approve of. The parents then expected the author to not discipline at all, which the author found impossible because of the behavior. The author's refusal to continue babysitting under those conditions makes sense from a self-preservation and safety standpoint. \n\nHowever, the family members are siding with the parents, believing that a babysitter (or a relative) shouldn't have the authority to discipline. That's a cultural norm they might be following, but that doesn't necessarily make the author wrong. The parents' lack of discipline at home is contributing to the problem. If the parents aren't enforcing rules, but expect the babysitter to do so, there's a conflict. But in this case, the parents explicitly said they don't want the babysitter to discipline the kids, which makes it impossible to manage the behavior.\n\nThe author's actions seem justified because they're trying to maintain a safe and respectful environment. The parents' reaction is hostile, but that doesn't reflect on the author's right decision. The author also tried to communicate their concerns and set boundaries, which is reasonable. The fact that the parents are now spreading negative things about the author suggests that the issue is on their side, not the author's.\n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). They had a valid reason to refuse further babysitting due to the parents' refusal to allow any form of discipline, especially when the children's behavior is harmful and disruptive. The author's priority is their own well-being and the safety of others, which is a legitimate concern.\n"
