(Majority of my extended family seems to think so)\nI first posted this on r/relationships, but the mods removed it and told me to ask here, so here it is.\n\nLast year I got to babysit my three little cousins aged 4, 7 and 9 years old  a few times. The first 2-3 times they were well behaved, because I was new, but then they really showed what little brats they can be. Let's just say I've never seen children being so naughty and mean and the parents know, since they act the  same around them. So it's defnitely not the case of oblivious parents  thinking they're raising little angels.\n\nAt first just ignoring their tantrums worked wonders. However, when their mother requests them to do some simple chores, like clean up their toys, ignoring  doesn't work. So after a particularly long argument I decided that the only way to  maintain my position is to discipline the kids and since I didn't know what the house rules on that were, I just decided that I won't get the ones who don't comply the dessert. I warned them about it, gave them 15  minutes to get to cleaning up and sat on the sofa with a book. 10  minutes later the youngest one was already done, the oldest was  reluctantly, but slowly gathering her stuff too and the middle one didn't budge, so I did not give her the dessert and did not allow her to  steal from her sisters. That caused her to throw a fit that I tried to ignore, but in the end she started insulting everyone, trying to hit me and called us (me  and her sisters) pigs for eating dessert.\n\nWhew.  Okay. Parents came home, I informed them that the middle one was behaving horribly and did not clean her room, so she did not get  dessert. I asked what ways of discipline do they use. Should I be giving  them a time-out? Anything? They looked quite  puzzled and said that they just don't do anything, so I proceeded to list all the horrible things they do to illustrate. The parents  told me to \"ask them to stop\" and if anything particularly bad happens,  call them. I should have just left then and there, but I gave the  children a few more chances, which they blew. So I told the parents that  I unfortunately cannot contain the kids, will most likely kill them if I  see them touch the cat again (which they're tormenting all the time) and for my own sanity and out of respect for  their \\[lack of\\] house rules I have to stop babysitting them.\n\nAnd, surprise, surprise, the mother threw an adult version of a fit her child does. I really made an effort to explain how I felt in a respectful way, put an emphasis on how they do not want me to discipline  the children, so I won't go against their wishes, but I also cannot put  up with how naughty they are. She started huffing, told me that I know  nothing, because I'm a child myself and that if I were in her shoes I  would have other matters to worry about. So I said \"okay, suit  yourselves\" and bid them farewell.\n\nNow  it's been a few months since that event and their mother called me  again, pretending like nothing happened, and asked me to babysit for  them again. So I calmly reminded her, that no, I do not intend to take  care of her children unless I am allowed to control their behavior. She  got really mad, pretty much repeated that I know nothing about kids and  hung up. Now I'm learning that she's calling our family members and  complaining about how awful I am and a lot of family members take her side, saying that it's not a babysitter's (or any stranger's) place to discipline the child. So, was I right or misguided to act the way I did? I know that the mother is an asshole herself, that much doesn't need confirmation, but the shocking amount of cousins who approach me and flat out tell me that since I am not the parent, I cannot even put the kids in time-out really confuses me.\n\n**Short version: Distant family members asked me to babysit their very misbehaving  children, but forbid me to disciplining them in any way. I refused to  babysit them under such conditions and now they're turning the family  against me, because apparently I didn't handle the situation well. Apparently many of my (elderly) family members are actually against me, because supposedly the rule is \"a stranger is never allowed to discipline one's children\", which sounds ridiculous to me. So, what  do you think? AMTA?**\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for refusing to babysit because the parents don't let them discipline the kids. The situation involves the kids being really misbehaved, and when the author tried to discipline them (like taking away dessert), the parents didn't support it. The author then quit and now the family is turning against them, saying that babysitters shouldn't discipline.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the responsibilities of a babysitter. Typically, a babysitter is expected to manage children under the parent's guidelines. If the parents don't allow any form of discipline, but the kids are out of control, the babysitter is in a tough spot. They can't just let the kids run wild, but they also can't enforce rules the parents didn't set.\n\nThe author tried to follow the parents' rules by not using time-outs or other methods they didn't approve. When they took away dessert, which the parents didn't mention as a permissible action, maybe that was crossing a line. But the parents also didn't provide any alternative strategies, leaving the author without tools to manage the behavior effectively.\n\nAnother angle is the parents' responsibility. If they know their kids are misbehaving and they're not providing a babysitter with the necessary authority to manage the situation, it's a problem on their end. The author is right to prioritize their own well-being and safety, especially if the kids are being aggressive or harmful (like tormenting the cat).\n\nHowever, the author's approach might have been too direct. Instead of quitting immediately, maybe they could have had a more structured conversation with the parents beforehand to set clear expectations. Walking out after the incident might have been seen as abrupt. But given the parents' response (throwing a fit and not addressing the underlying issues), the author's decision to stop babysitting seems justified.\n\nAlso, the family's reaction is concerning. If relatives are blaming the author for standing up for themselves and the parents' poor parenting, that reflects more on the family dynamics than the author's actions. The author isn't responsible for the parents' parenting style or the family's opinion.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong. They had a valid reason to refuse continuing babysitting under those conditions. The parents and family's reactions are misplaced. So, the answer should be B.\n"
