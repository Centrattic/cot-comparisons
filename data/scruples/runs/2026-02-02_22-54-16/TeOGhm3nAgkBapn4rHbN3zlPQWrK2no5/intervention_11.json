(Majority of my extended family seems to think so)\nI first posted this on r/relationships, but the mods removed it and told me to ask here, so here it is.\n\nLast year I got to babysit my three little cousins aged 4, 7 and 9 years old  a few times. The first 2-3 times they were well behaved, because I was new, but then they really showed what little brats they can be. Let's just say I've never seen children being so naughty and mean and the parents know, since they act the  same around them. So it's defnitely not the case of oblivious parents  thinking they're raising little angels.\n\nAt first just ignoring their tantrums worked wonders. However, when their mother requests them to do some simple chores, like clean up their toys, ignoring  doesn't work. So after a particularly long argument I decided that the only way to  maintain my position is to discipline the kids and since I didn't know what the house rules on that were, I just decided that I won't get the ones who don't comply the dessert. I warned them about it, gave them 15  minutes to get to cleaning up and sat on the sofa with a book. 10  minutes later the youngest one was already done, the oldest was  reluctantly, but slowly gathering her stuff too and the middle one didn't budge, so I did not give her the dessert and did not allow her to  steal from her sisters. That caused her to throw a fit that I tried to ignore, but in the end she started insulting everyone, trying to hit me and called us (me  and her sisters) pigs for eating dessert.\n\nWhew.  Okay. Parents came home, I informed them that the middle one was behaving horribly and did not clean her room, so she did not get  dessert. I asked what ways of discipline do they use. Should I be giving  them a time-out? Anything? They looked quite  puzzled and said that they just don't do anything, so I proceeded to list all the horrible things they do to illustrate. The parents  told me to \"ask them to stop\" and if anything particularly bad happens,  call them. I should have just left then and there, but I gave the  children a few more chances, which they blew. So I told the parents that  I unfortunately cannot contain the kids, will most likely kill them if I  see them touch the cat again (which they're tormenting all the time) and for my own sanity and out of respect for  their \\[lack of\\] house rules I have to stop babysitting them.\n\nAnd, surprise, surprise, the mother threw an adult version of a fit her child does. I really made an effort to explain how I felt in a respectful way, put an emphasis on how they do not want me to discipline  the children, so I won't go against their wishes, but I also cannot put  up with how naughty they are. She started huffing, told me that I know  nothing, because I'm a child myself and that if I were in her shoes I  would have other matters to worry about. So I said \"okay, suit  yourselves\" and bid them farewell.\n\nNow  it's been a few months since that event and their mother called me  again, pretending like nothing happened, and asked me to babysit for  them again. So I calmly reminded her, that no, I do not intend to take  care of her children unless I am allowed to control their behavior. She  got really mad, pretty much repeated that I know nothing about kids and  hung up. Now I'm learning that she's calling our family members and  complaining about how awful I am and a lot of family members take her side, saying that it's not a babysitter's (or any stranger's) place to discipline the child. So, was I right or misguided to act the way I did? I know that the mother is an asshole herself, that much doesn't need confirmation, but the shocking amount of cousins who approach me and flat out tell me that since I am not the parent, I cannot even put the kids in time-out really confuses me.\n\n**Short version: Distant family members asked me to babysit their very misbehaving  children, but forbid me to disciplining them in any way. I refused to  babysit them under such conditions and now they're turning the family  against me, because apparently I didn't handle the situation well. Apparently many of my (elderly) family members are actually against me, because supposedly the rule is \"a stranger is never allowed to discipline one's children\", which sounds ridiculous to me. So, what  do you think? AMTA?**\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about refusing to babysit for distant relatives because they don't allow discipline of the kids. The author's actions and the family's reaction are detailed.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the key points. The author tried to manage the kids, used their own judgment to enforce a rule (like taking away dessert) when parents didn't intervene, and then decided to stop babysitting when they were told not to discipline. The parents reacted negatively, and now the author is being criticized by family members.\n\nThe main question is about the author's right to discipline. The parents explicitly said not to discipline, so the author had to follow their instructions. However, the kids were being extremely difficult, and the author felt it was necessary to maintain order. But according to the parents' rules, the author overstepped by taking away dessert. Even though the kids were misbehaving, the parents are the ones who set the boundaries. The author's refusal to continue might be seen as standing up for their own limits, which is reasonable. However, the act of disciplining without the parents' approval might have been the initial issue. The author tried to communicate the problem but the parents didn't want any discipline, which led to conflict. \n\nSo, was the author in the wrong? On one hand, they followed through with their decision to stop babysitting because the parents' rules were unmanageable. On the other hand, they took disciplinary action without parental consent. But the parents did tell them not to discipline, so the author had to either comply or leave. The author's stance that they can't enforce discipline is valid if they believe it's necessary for their own well-being. The problem might be that the author tried to set boundaries in a way that the parents didn't agree with. However, the parents shouldn't expect someone to care for their children without any ability to manage behavior. \n\nIn many cultures, there's an expectation that a babysitter can manage children within reasonable limits, but maybe in this family's cultural context, they strictly oppose any external discipline. The author's actions might clash with those cultural norms, leading the family to side with the parents. But from an objective standpoint, the author's decision to refuse to continue when the situation was unsustainable for them is understandable. They prioritized their own mental health and safety, especially noting the kids were harming the cat. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because they clearly communicated their concerns and stood by their decision when the parents were uncooperative. The parents and family's reaction is problematic, but the author's actions were within their rights to protect themselves from a stressful and harmful situation.\n"
