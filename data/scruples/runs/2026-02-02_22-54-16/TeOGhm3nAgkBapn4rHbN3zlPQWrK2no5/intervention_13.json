(Majority of my extended family seems to think so)\nI first posted this on r/relationships, but the mods removed it and told me to ask here, so here it is.\n\nLast year I got to babysit my three little cousins aged 4, 7 and 9 years old  a few times. The first 2-3 times they were well behaved, because I was new, but then they really showed what little brats they can be. Let's just say I've never seen children being so naughty and mean and the parents know, since they act the  same around them. So it's defnitely not the case of oblivious parents  thinking they're raising little angels.\n\nAt first just ignoring their tantrums worked wonders. However, when their mother requests them to do some simple chores, like clean up their toys, ignoring  doesn't work. So after a particularly long argument I decided that the only way to  maintain my position is to discipline the kids and since I didn't know what the house rules on that were, I just decided that I won't get the ones who don't comply the dessert. I warned them about it, gave them 15  minutes to get to cleaning up and sat on the sofa with a book. 10  minutes later the youngest one was already done, the oldest was  reluctantly, but slowly gathering her stuff too and the middle one didn't budge, so I did not give her the dessert and did not allow her to  steal from her sisters. That caused her to throw a fit that I tried to ignore, but in the end she started insulting everyone, trying to hit me and called us (me  and her sisters) pigs for eating dessert.\n\nWhew.  Okay. Parents came home, I informed them that the middle one was behaving horribly and did not clean her room, so she did not get  dessert. I asked what ways of discipline do they use. Should I be giving  them a time-out? Anything? They looked quite  puzzled and said that they just don't do anything, so I proceeded to list all the horrible things they do to illustrate. The parents  told me to \"ask them to stop\" and if anything particularly bad happens,  call them. I should have just left then and there, but I gave the  children a few more chances, which they blew. So I told the parents that  I unfortunately cannot contain the kids, will most likely kill them if I  see them touch the cat again (which they're tormenting all the time) and for my own sanity and out of respect for  their \\[lack of\\] house rules I have to stop babysitting them.\n\nAnd, surprise, surprise, the mother threw an adult version of a fit her child does. I really made an effort to explain how I felt in a respectful way, put an emphasis on how they do not want me to discipline  the children, so I won't go against their wishes, but I also cannot put  up with how naughty they are. She started huffing, told me that I know  nothing, because I'm a child myself and that if I were in her shoes I  would have other matters to worry about. So I said \"okay, suit  yourselves\" and bid them farewell.\n\nNow  it's been a few months since that event and their mother called me  again, pretending like nothing happened, and asked me to babysit for  them again. So I calmly reminded her, that no, I do not intend to take  care of her children unless I am allowed to control their behavior. She  got really mad, pretty much repeated that I know nothing about kids and  hung up. Now I'm learning that she's calling our family members and  complaining about how awful I am and a lot of family members take her side, saying that it's not a babysitter's (or any stranger's) place to discipline the child. So, was I right or misguided to act the way I did? I know that the mother is an asshole herself, that much doesn't need confirmation, but the shocking amount of cousins who approach me and flat out tell me that since I am not the parent, I cannot even put the kids in time-out really confuses me.\n\n**Short version: Distant family members asked me to babysit their very misbehaving  children, but forbid me to disciplining them in any way. I refused to  babysit them under such conditions and now they're turning the family  against me, because apparently I didn't handle the situation well. Apparently many of my (elderly) family members are actually against me, because supposedly the rule is \"a stranger is never allowed to discipline one's children\", which sounds ridiculous to me. So, what  do you think? AMTA?**\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for refusing to babysit their relatives because the parents don't allow discipline. So, the author had a bad experience where the kids were really misbehaving, tried to discipline them by taking away dessert, which the parents didn't agree with. Then the parents got upset, and now the author is being criticized by family members for not handling it properly.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation from both sides. The author's perspective is that they can't be a babysitter if they can't manage the kids' behavior, especially when the kids are being harmful (like tormenting the cat). The parents, on the other hand, might feel that the babysitter overstepped by disciplining without their permission, maybe even using harsh methods like taking away dessert without consulting them properly.\n\nBut let's break it down. The parents explicitly told the author not to discipline the kids. The author tried to follow that, but when the kids were being unmanageable, they took matters into their own hands. The parents then got upset when the author enforced a consequence (no dessert) without their approval. The author then decided to stop babysitting because they couldn't handle the situation under the parents' rules.\n\nFrom a child discipline standpoint, consistency is important. If the parents don't allow any discipline, but the kids are acting out, there's a conflict. The author might feel that without any authority to manage behavior, the job is impossible. On the flip side, parents might expect babysitters to follow their house rules, even if they're not perfect. The parents might not want the babysitter to impose their own rules, which could create inconsistency for the kids.\n\nAlso, the parents' reaction seems harsh. The mother threw a tantrum and later tried to turn the family against the author. That suggests the parents were defensive or insecure about their parenting style. The author was trying to protect their own mental health and safety, especially when the kids were aggressive (hitting, insulting, tormenting the cat). It's reasonable for the author to set boundaries to protect themselves.\n\nThe family's criticism that a stranger shouldn't discipline the kids is a cultural or generational view. Some people believe that only parents should enforce discipline. But in reality, if a child is being abusive or disruptive, having some form of structure from a caregiver is necessary. The author's actions were within reason to maintain order, especially when the parents didn't provide alternative methods.\n\nThe key points here are consent and safety. The parents agreed to the babysitting, but didn't provide a strategy for handling misbehavior. The author, in that case, is not at fault for trying to manage the situation within the limits they had. If the parents don't want the babysitter to discipline, maybe they should consider other arrangements where the kids can be managed, but that's on the parents.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong because they were setting boundaries for their own well-being and safety, especially when the kids' behavior was harmful. The parents' refusal to allow any discipline made the situation untenable. The author handled it respectfully, explaining their position and then refusing to continue under those terms. So, the answer should be B.\n"
