(Majority of my extended family seems to think so)\nI first posted this on r/relationships, but the mods removed it and told me to ask here, so here it is.\n\nLast year I got to babysit my three little cousins aged 4, 7 and 9 years old  a few times. The first 2-3 times they were well behaved, because I was new, but then they really showed what little brats they can be. Let's just say I've never seen children being so naughty and mean and the parents know, since they act the  same around them. So it's defnitely not the case of oblivious parents  thinking they're raising little angels.\n\nAt first just ignoring their tantrums worked wonders. However, when their mother requests them to do some simple chores, like clean up their toys, ignoring  doesn't work. So after a particularly long argument I decided that the only way to  maintain my position is to discipline the kids and since I didn't know what the house rules on that were, I just decided that I won't get the ones who don't comply the dessert. I warned them about it, gave them 15  minutes to get to cleaning up and sat on the sofa with a book. 10  minutes later the youngest one was already done, the oldest was  reluctantly, but slowly gathering her stuff too and the middle one didn't budge, so I did not give her the dessert and did not allow her to  steal from her sisters. That caused her to throw a fit that I tried to ignore, but in the end she started insulting everyone, trying to hit me and called us (me  and her sisters) pigs for eating dessert.\n\nWhew.  Okay. Parents came home, I informed them that the middle one was behaving horribly and did not clean her room, so she did not get  dessert. I asked what ways of discipline do they use. Should I be giving  them a time-out? Anything? They looked quite  puzzled and said that they just don't do anything, so I proceeded to list all the horrible things they do to illustrate. The parents  told me to \"ask them to stop\" and if anything particularly bad happens,  call them. I should have just left then and there, but I gave the  children a few more chances, which they blew. So I told the parents that  I unfortunately cannot contain the kids, will most likely kill them if I  see them touch the cat again (which they're tormenting all the time) and for my own sanity and out of respect for  their \\[lack of\\] house rules I have to stop babysitting them.\n\nAnd, surprise, surprise, the mother threw an adult version of a fit her child does. I really made an effort to explain how I felt in a respectful way, put an emphasis on how they do not want me to discipline  the children, so I won't go against their wishes, but I also cannot put  up with how naughty they are. She started huffing, told me that I know  nothing, because I'm a child myself and that if I were in her shoes I  would have other matters to worry about. So I said \"okay, suit  yourselves\" and bid them farewell.\n\nNow  it's been a few months since that event and their mother called me  again, pretending like nothing happened, and asked me to babysit for  them again. So I calmly reminded her, that no, I do not intend to take  care of her children unless I am allowed to control their behavior. She  got really mad, pretty much repeated that I know nothing about kids and  hung up. Now I'm learning that she's calling our family members and  complaining about how awful I am and a lot of family members take her side, saying that it's not a babysitter's (or any stranger's) place to discipline the child. So, was I right or misguided to act the way I did? I know that the mother is an asshole herself, that much doesn't need confirmation, but the shocking amount of cousins who approach me and flat out tell me that since I am not the parent, I cannot even put the kids in time-out really confuses me.\n\n**Short version: Distant family members asked me to babysit their very misbehaving  children, but forbid me to disciplining them in any way. I refused to  babysit them under such conditions and now they're turning the family  against me, because apparently I didn't handle the situation well. Apparently many of my (elderly) family members are actually against me, because supposedly the rule is \"a stranger is never allowed to discipline one's children\", which sounds ridiculous to me. So, what  do you think? AMTA?**\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for refusing to babysit relatives because the parents don't allow discipline. I need to evaluate both sides.\n\nFirst, the author's perspective: They were babysitting cousins who were very misbehaved. They tried to manage the kids by using their own discipline, like taking away dessert, but the parents didn't allow any form of discipline. The author felt that without the ability to enforce rules, it's impossible to manage the kids, especially when they're destructive (like tormenting the cat). The parents reacted poorly, accused the author of being unqualified, and now are badmouthing them. The author's main issue is that the parents expect them to handle the kids without any authority, leading to a breakdown in care.\n\nOn the other side, family members and the parents argue that a babysitter shouldn't discipline kids unless the parents explicitly allow it. They might see the author as overstepping by taking away dessert without permission, which could be seen as taking authority that wasn't granted. The parents might feel that the author breached trust by imposing their own rules, leading to the conflict.\n\nLegally and ethically, babysitters usually follow the parents' guidelines. If the parents stated no discipline, the author shouldn't impose their own methods. However, the kids' behavior was extreme, posing a risk (like hitting or threatening the cat), which could justify some intervention for safety. The author's actions, while well-intentioned, might have crossed a line by not adhering strictly to the parents' rules.\n\nThe parents' reaction is also problematic. They dismissed the author's concerns and spread negative opinions, which isn't fair. However, the initial conflict stems from the author not following the parents' instructions. The author's refusal to continue is a valid professional decision if the environment is harmful or unmanageable. The core issue is the mismatch between expectations: the parents wanted a sitter without authority, while the author couldn't function without it.\n\nIn conclusion, while the parents' actions are unreasonable, the author may have overstepped by disciplining without consent. The right approach could have been communication to set boundaries beforehand or declining the job initially if they couldn't accept the parents' rules. Thus, the author has a valid reason but might share some responsibility in the conflict.\n"
