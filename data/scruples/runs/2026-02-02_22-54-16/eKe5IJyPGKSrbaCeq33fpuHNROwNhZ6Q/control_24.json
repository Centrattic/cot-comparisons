Given my medical issues, in vitro wasn\u2019t really an option. My husband wanted to try surrogacy but in the end I pointed out that there are so many unwanted children in the world that perhaps adoption was the most selfless route. \n\nIt was a long, difficult road but we finally were able to adopt an adorable little boy from Haiti. \n\nHe was three when we got him and he\u2019s six years old now. From the outset, he\u2019s been prone to violent tantrums and he\u2019s getting stronger. He\u2019s grown so destructive we had to strip his room down so that it\u2019s just the bare essentials. \n\nWe have tried being firm, being soft, giving discipline, giving positive reinforcement, ignoring, being attentive. He\u2019s been working with a therapist for the past year and a half. He\u2019s actually fairly well behaved there. \n\nAt home and school, it\u2019s a completely different story. He\u2019s only in first grade and already at risk of expulsion. He\u2019s kicked his teacher. He used play scissors to cut a little girl\u2019s ponytail off when her back was turned (now he\u2019s lost all privileges to use them). He flooded the toilets by flushing his own clothes. \n\nWhat\u2019s worse is that I don\u2019t think he feels anything for me or for my husband. He behaves slightly better than my husband than for me but my husband is naturally loud and boisterous, even when he\u2019s not angry,so maybe that\u2019s intimidating. But with me, it\u2019s just a nightmare. I\u2019ve been punched, spat on, kicked, slapped, clawed. All by a child that I do everything for. He can be very calm and sweet but he turns so quickly. \n\nAlthough he\u2019s somewhat better after therapy, it doesn\u2019t last long. He\u2019s been diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder, and unfortunately it\u2019s not something that can really be cured. \n\nI\u2019m trying to talk myself out of feeling this way. Telling myself that good people don\u2019t consider what I\u2019m considering. I\u2019ve visited all kinds of parenting blogs and mommy forums and adoption subs (including the one here on my alt account).\n\nI\u2019m just exhausted emotionally and physically. I guess I\u2019m here because of my masochistic tendencies. I welcome your honesty. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for wanting to give back their adopted son. Let me start by reading through the situation again to make sure I understand all the details.\n\nThe author and their husband decided to adopt because the wife is infertile and surrogacy wasn't an option. They adopted a three-year-old from Haiti, now six. The child has been having violent tantrums, is destructive, and has behavioral issues at home and school. He's been to a therapist for a year and a half, but the behavior doesn't stay improved. He's been diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder, which can't be cured. The parents are physically and emotionally exhausted, and the child has been violent towards the mother, with punches, kicks, etc. The author is considering giving the child back and is asking if they're in the wrong for wanting to do so.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to consider the factors here. Adoption is a life-changing commitment, and the parents made this decision knowing the challenges. However, they've tried various methods\u2014discipline, therapy, positive reinforcement\u2014and nothing's working. The child has a disorder that's not curable, leading to ongoing issues. The parents are being harmed physically, and the child's behavior is affecting school and home life. They're emotionally and physically drained.\n\nOn one hand, the parents are responsible for the child's well-being and safety. If they can't provide a safe environment, maybe giving him back is necessary. On the other hand, giving up might be seen as abandoning a child in need. But the parents have already given their all, tried everything, and the situation is unsustainable. The child's behavior is beyond their control despite their efforts. \n\nReactive attachment disorder is a serious condition where the child forms insecure attachments. This can lead to the behaviors described. The parents might not be doing anything wrong; the disorder is a medical issue. They've done what they can. The question is whether they're obligated to keep trying no matter what. But if the situation is harmful to the parents and the child isn't improving, maybe they're not in the wrong for seeking help elsewhere.\n\nAlso, considering the child's well-being, if the parents can't provide a stable home, maybe it's better for the child to be placed where he can get the necessary care. However, giving him back could be traumatic for him again. But the parents have already made significant efforts. \n\nLegally, adoption is permanent, so giving back would require legal steps, but that's not the question here. Ethically, the parents are in a tough spot. They've done everything possible, but the child's issues are too overwhelming. The parents' safety and mental health are also important. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the parents aren't in the wrong. They've tried their best, the situation is beyond their control due to the child's disorder, and they're acting in their own and the child's best interest by considering returning him. Therefore, the answer would be B (no, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
