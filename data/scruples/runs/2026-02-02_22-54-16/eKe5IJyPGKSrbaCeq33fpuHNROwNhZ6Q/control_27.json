Given my medical issues, in vitro wasn\u2019t really an option. My husband wanted to try surrogacy but in the end I pointed out that there are so many unwanted children in the world that perhaps adoption was the most selfless route. \n\nIt was a long, difficult road but we finally were able to adopt an adorable little boy from Haiti. \n\nHe was three when we got him and he\u2019s six years old now. From the outset, he\u2019s been prone to violent tantrums and he\u2019s getting stronger. He\u2019s grown so destructive we had to strip his room down so that it\u2019s just the bare essentials. \n\nWe have tried being firm, being soft, giving discipline, giving positive reinforcement, ignoring, being attentive. He\u2019s been working with a therapist for the past year and a half. He\u2019s actually fairly well behaved there. \n\nAt home and school, it\u2019s a completely different story. He\u2019s only in first grade and already at risk of expulsion. He\u2019s kicked his teacher. He used play scissors to cut a little girl\u2019s ponytail off when her back was turned (now he\u2019s lost all privileges to use them). He flooded the toilets by flushing his own clothes. \n\nWhat\u2019s worse is that I don\u2019t think he feels anything for me or for my husband. He behaves slightly better than my husband than for me but my husband is naturally loud and boisterous, even when he\u2019s not angry,so maybe that\u2019s intimidating. But with me, it\u2019s just a nightmare. I\u2019ve been punched, spat on, kicked, slapped, clawed. All by a child that I do everything for. He can be very calm and sweet but he turns so quickly. \n\nAlthough he\u2019s somewhat better after therapy, it doesn\u2019t last long. He\u2019s been diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder, and unfortunately it\u2019s not something that can really be cured. \n\nI\u2019m trying to talk myself out of feeling this way. Telling myself that good people don\u2019t consider what I\u2019m considering. I\u2019ve visited all kinds of parenting blogs and mommy forums and adoption subs (including the one here on my alt account).\n\nI\u2019m just exhausted emotionally and physically. I guess I\u2019m here because of my masochistic tendencies. I welcome your honesty. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about an adopted son with behavioral issues, and the parents are considering giving him back. Let me break down the key points.\n\nFirst, the parents decided to adopt because the mother is infertile and in vitro wasn't an option. They adopted a three-year-old from Haiti. The child has been acting out with violent tantrums, destructive behavior, and has been physically abusive towards the mother. He's been in therapy, but the problems persist at home and school, leading to potential expulsion. The child has been diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder (RAD), which is mentioned as incurable. The parents are emotionally and physically exhausted.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author (the mother) is in the wrong for considering returning the child. Let's think about adoption laws and ethics. Adoption is a legal process, but can it be reversed? In many places, once a child is adopted, it's a permanent legal status, but sometimes there are ways to reunify or place the child elsewhere if the adoption is failing. However, the process is complex and may require the consent of the other parent or the birth parents, unless it's a closed adoption. But the original post doesn't mention if the birth parents are involved or how the adoption was finalized.\n\nThe key here is the well-being of the child and the family. The parents have tried various methods: therapy, different parenting approaches. The child's behavior is severely problematic and affecting the family's health. RAD is a disorder where the child has difficulty forming emotional attachments, which can lead to behavioral issues. The parents are in a tough spot where they've invested a lot but are facing challenges beyond their control.\n\nIs it wrong to consider returning a child who is causing harm? On one hand, the child was adopted with the hope of providing a loving home, and the parents are struggling. On the other hand, the child may not have chosen his behavior and needs support. However, if the parents are in danger or the child is at risk of harm (e.g., if they can't provide a safe environment), then it might be a necessary decision.\n\nEthically, the parents have a responsibility to their child's well-being as well as their own. If they can't provide a safe home, maybe seeking help from social services or other resources is appropriate. But if they're considering giving up because it's too hard, that's a different angle. However, given the severity of the issues and the lack of progress, their decision might be seen as a last resort rather than giving up easily.\n\nThe author is asking if she's in the wrong. The answer depends on the circumstances. If they've exhausted all options and it's clear that the current situation isn't sustainable for anyone, including the child, then maybe they're not in the wrong. The child might be better off in a different environment where there are more resources or specialized care available. However, if there's a possibility of getting more support (like residential treatment, better therapy, or help from the school system), maybe they should explore that first. But the post says they've already tried various methods for a year and a half without lasting results.\n\nSo, considering all that, the parents are in a very difficult situation. They are not in the wrong for considering giving the child back if their health and safety are at risk and all other options have been exhausted. The child's well-being is also a factor\u2014if the parents can't provide a safe home, it's in the child's interest to be placed where they can receive appropriate care. Therefore, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
