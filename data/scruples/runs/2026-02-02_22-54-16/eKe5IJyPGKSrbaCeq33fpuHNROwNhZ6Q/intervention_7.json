Given my medical issues, in vitro wasn\u2019t really an option. My husband wanted to try surrogacy but in the end I pointed out that there are so many unwanted children in the world that perhaps adoption was the most selfless route. \n\nIt was a long, difficult road but we finally were able to adopt an adorable little boy from Haiti. \n\nHe was three when we got him and he\u2019s six years old now. From the outset, he\u2019s been prone to violent tantrums and he\u2019s getting stronger. He\u2019s grown so destructive we had to strip his room down so that it\u2019s just the bare essentials. \n\nWe have tried being firm, being soft, giving discipline, giving positive reinforcement, ignoring, being attentive. He\u2019s been working with a therapist for the past year and a half. He\u2019s actually fairly well behaved there. \n\nAt home and school, it\u2019s a completely different story. He\u2019s only in first grade and already at risk of expulsion. He\u2019s kicked his teacher. He used play scissors to cut a little girl\u2019s ponytail off when her back was turned (now he\u2019s lost all privileges to use them). He flooded the toilets by flushing his own clothes. \n\nWhat\u2019s worse is that I don\u2019t think he feels anything for me or for my husband. He behaves slightly better than my husband than for me but my husband is naturally loud and boisterous, even when he\u2019s not angry,so maybe that\u2019s intimidating. But with me, it\u2019s just a nightmare. I\u2019ve been punched, spat on, kicked, slapped, clawed. All by a child that I do everything for. He can be very calm and sweet but he turns so quickly. \n\nAlthough he\u2019s somewhat better after therapy, it doesn\u2019t last long. He\u2019s been diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder, and unfortunately it\u2019s not something that can really be cured. \n\nI\u2019m trying to talk myself out of feeling this way. Telling myself that good people don\u2019t consider what I\u2019m considering. I\u2019ve visited all kinds of parenting blogs and mommy forums and adoption subs (including the one here on my alt account).\n\nI\u2019m just exhausted emotionally and physically. I guess I\u2019m here because of my masochistic tendencies. I welcome your honesty. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to give back their adopted son. Let me start by reading through the situation again to make sure I understand all the details.\n\nThe author and their husband tried to have children but faced infertility. They considered surrogacy but decided on adoption due to the author's medical issues. They adopted a 3-year-old from Haiti, now 6 years old. The child has been having severe behavioral issues: violent tantrums, destructive behavior, aggression towards others and the parents. He's been in therapy for 1.5 years, which helps a bit, but at home and school he's problematic. He's been kicked out of school, hurt others, and physically abused the parents. He's diagnosed with Reactive Attachment Disorder (RAD), which is a condition that affects the ability to form emotional attachments.\n\nThe author is exhausted, considering giving the child back, and is seeking opinions on whether they're in the wrong. The question is whether the author is in the wrong (A for yes, B for no).\n\nFirst, I should consider the legal and ethical aspects. Adoption is a legal process, and giving a child back would involve legal steps. The parents have rights, but so does the child. However, in some cases, if the child is causing harm, the parents might have the right to seek a legal termination of the adoption, depending on the country's laws. Since the child is from Haiti, international adoption laws might come into play. But the user is focused on moral/ethical judgment rather than legal specifics.\n\nEthically, the parents made a commitment to adopt. Adoption is a lifelong commitment, and giving up a child is a serious decision. However, the parents' well-being and safety are also important. If the child is abusive and the parents are in danger, some might argue that they have a right to protect themselves. Others might say that the parents should have anticipated possible challenges and committed to supporting the child despite difficulties.\n\nReactive Attachment Disorder is a real condition where the child struggles to form healthy attachments. The parents have tried various methods, therapy, etc., but the child's behavior is harmful. The parents are physically harmed, which is a key point. If the parents are in physical danger, that's a significant factor. In such cases, it might be considered reasonable to seek help to protect themselves, even if it means giving the child back.\n\nHowever, the parents also have a responsibility to the child. If they give the child back, he might end up in another home where he could be better supported, or in foster care. But if they stay, they're in a harmful situation. It's a tough balance.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for considering this. If the parents are making this decision after exhausting all possible resources and the situation is untenable, some might say they're not in the wrong. Others might criticize them for not being committed enough to their adoption. It's a complex issue.\n\nIn terms of public opinion forums like Reddit's AITA (Am I the Asshole), the community often considers intentions and circumstances. The parents tried everything, including therapy, discipline, etc., and the child's behavior is beyond their control. The physical abuse is a strong factor. The parents are seeking support, not just for themselves but also for the child's well-being. In many AITA cases, if someone is in danger, the community tends to side with them not being the asshole.\n\nSo based on these factors, the answer is likely B (the author is not in the wrong). But I need to make sure I'm not missing any key points. The parents adopted with good intentions, faced unforeseen challenges, and are struggling. The child's condition is a medical issue that's hard to manage. The parents' safety and mental health are also valid concerns. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
