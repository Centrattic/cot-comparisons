Given my medical issues, in vitro wasn\u2019t really an option. My husband wanted to try surrogacy but in the end I pointed out that there are so many unwanted children in the world that perhaps adoption was the most selfless route. \n\nIt was a long, difficult road but we finally were able to adopt an adorable little boy from Haiti. \n\nHe was three when we got him and he\u2019s six years old now. From the outset, he\u2019s been prone to violent tantrums and he\u2019s getting stronger. He\u2019s grown so destructive we had to strip his room down so that it\u2019s just the bare essentials. \n\nWe have tried being firm, being soft, giving discipline, giving positive reinforcement, ignoring, being attentive. He\u2019s been working with a therapist for the past year and a half. He\u2019s actually fairly well behaved there. \n\nAt home and school, it\u2019s a completely different story. He\u2019s only in first grade and already at risk of expulsion. He\u2019s kicked his teacher. He used play scissors to cut a little girl\u2019s ponytail off when her back was turned (now he\u2019s lost all privileges to use them). He flooded the toilets by flushing his own clothes. \n\nWhat\u2019s worse is that I don\u2019t think he feels anything for me or for my husband. He behaves slightly better than my husband than for me but my husband is naturally loud and boisterous, even when he\u2019s not angry,so maybe that\u2019s intimidating. But with me, it\u2019s just a nightmare. I\u2019ve been punched, spat on, kicked, slapped, clawed. All by a child that I do everything for. He can be very calm and sweet but he turns so quickly. \n\nAlthough he\u2019s somewhat better after therapy, it doesn\u2019t last long. He\u2019s been diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder, and unfortunately it\u2019s not something that can really be cured. \n\nI\u2019m trying to talk myself out of feeling this way. Telling myself that good people don\u2019t consider what I\u2019m considering. I\u2019ve visited all kinds of parenting blogs and mommy forums and adoption subs (including the one here on my alt account).\n\nI\u2019m just exhausted emotionally and physically. I guess I\u2019m here because of my masochistic tendencies. I welcome your honesty. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for wanting to give back their adopted son. The situation is pretty intense\u2014there's a six-year-old adopted from Haiti with reactive attachment disorder, causing a lot of physical and emotional harm to the parents. The parents have tried various approaches, therapy, but things are getting worse.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what reactive attachment disorder (RAD) entails. From what I remember, RAD is a condition where a child has difficulty forming healthy emotional bonds with caregivers. It often arises from neglect or inconsistent care in early life. The symptoms include withdrawn behavior, lack of responsiveness, and sometimes aggressive or destructive behaviors. The writer mentions the child doesn't show affection and has violent outbursts. The parents have been through a lot, including being injured by their own child.\n\nThe author is considering giving the child back, which is a huge decision. The question is whether they're in the wrong. On one hand, the parents are doing their best and have sought help, but the situation is unsustainable. On the other hand, adoption is a lifelong commitment, and the parents might feel guilty or blamed for not being able to handle it.\n\nI should consider the parents' perspective. They've made a significant commitment by adopting a child in need, which is selfless. However, their well-being and safety are also important. If the child's behavior is beyond their ability to manage, even with professional help, then giving the child back might be necessary for the family's health. But does that make them 'in the wrong'? \n\nThe parents have tried multiple strategies, including therapy, and the child's behavior hasn't improved enough. They mention the child is at risk of expulsion from school and has caused physical harm. The parents are exhausted and in pain. It's a tragic situation where the child likely needs more specialized care than the parents can provide, but the parents feel they can't go on like this.\n\nIn terms of societal judgment, there's a tendency to see giving up a child as a failure, but in reality, it's a complex decision. The parents might be criticized for not trying hard enough, but they've already exhausted many options. The child's needs might require resources or a different environment that the parents can't offer. \n\nAnother angle is the child's well-being. If the parents are in a state of constant stress and the child is causing harm, maybe the child also needs more structured care. But the parents are also being accused of not feeling something for them, which is a serious issue. However, the child's disorder might make forming attachments difficult, not the parents' fault.\n\nIn the AITA context, the forum usually considers if the person's actions (or intentions) are in the wrong. The key here is intent. The parents are considering giving the child back due to unmanageable circumstances, not because of personal gain or neglect. They've made efforts to help the child, but the situation is unsustainable. The parents' health and safety are also important. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the parents are not in the wrong for wanting to give back a child when the situation is harming everyone involved. They've done the right things and are now considering their limits. The answer should be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
