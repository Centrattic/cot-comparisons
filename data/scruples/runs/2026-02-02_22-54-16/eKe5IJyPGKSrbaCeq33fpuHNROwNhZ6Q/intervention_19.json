Given my medical issues, in vitro wasn\u2019t really an option. My husband wanted to try surrogacy but in the end I pointed out that there are so many unwanted children in the world that perhaps adoption was the most selfless route. \n\nIt was a long, difficult road but we finally were able to adopt an adorable little boy from Haiti. \n\nHe was three when we got him and he\u2019s six years old now. From the outset, he\u2019s been prone to violent tantrums and he\u2019s getting stronger. He\u2019s grown so destructive we had to strip his room down so that it\u2019s just the bare essentials. \n\nWe have tried being firm, being soft, giving discipline, giving positive reinforcement, ignoring, being attentive. He\u2019s been working with a therapist for the past year and a half. He\u2019s actually fairly well behaved there. \n\nAt home and school, it\u2019s a completely different story. He\u2019s only in first grade and already at risk of expulsion. He\u2019s kicked his teacher. He used play scissors to cut a little girl\u2019s ponytail off when her back was turned (now he\u2019s lost all privileges to use them). He flooded the toilets by flushing his own clothes. \n\nWhat\u2019s worse is that I don\u2019t think he feels anything for me or for my husband. He behaves slightly better than my husband than for me but my husband is naturally loud and boisterous, even when he\u2019s not angry,so maybe that\u2019s intimidating. But with me, it\u2019s just a nightmare. I\u2019ve been punched, spat on, kicked, slapped, clawed. All by a child that I do everything for. He can be very calm and sweet but he turns so quickly. \n\nAlthough he\u2019s somewhat better after therapy, it doesn\u2019t last long. He\u2019s been diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder, and unfortunately it\u2019s not something that can really be cured. \n\nI\u2019m trying to talk myself out of feeling this way. Telling myself that good people don\u2019t consider what I\u2019m considering. I\u2019ve visited all kinds of parenting blogs and mommy forums and adoption subs (including the one here on my alt account).\n\nI\u2019m just exhausted emotionally and physically. I guess I\u2019m here because of my masochistic tendencies. I welcome your honesty. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the story is in the wrong for wanting to give back their adopted son. The situation is pretty intense. The parents adopted a three-year-old from Haiti, and now he's six, with serious behavioral issues. He has tantrums, is destructive, has been violent at home and school, and has a diagnosis of reactive attachment disorder. The mom is asking if she's in the wrong for considering giving him back.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points here. The parents had a difficult adoption process, faced challenges with the child's behavior, tried various methods including therapy, but the child is still causing them physical harm and is at risk of expulsion from school. The mother feels emotionally and physically drained.\n\nNow, I need to consider the ethical and legal aspects. Adoption is a legal process, so giving back the child would involve legal procedures. But from a moral standpoint, is the mother wrong? People adopt with the intention of providing a permanent home. However, the child has complex needs that the parents might not have fully anticipated. Reactive attachment disorder is a serious condition, and it's mentioned that it's not curable. This disorder affects the child's ability to form healthy attachments, which could explain the behaviors.\n\nThe parents have tried multiple approaches, but the situation is deteriorating. The child is causing them harm, and the mother is in a state of exhaustion. The question is whether the parents are in the wrong for considering giving the child back. \n\nOn one hand, the parents are doing their best, but the child's needs might be too overwhelming for them. It's not that they don't love the child, but the circumstances are beyond their capacity. On the other hand, giving back a child could be seen as breaking a commitment made during adoption. However, it's important to recognize that adoption is a lifelong commitment, but in cases where the child's needs are so high that it endangers the family's well-being, seeking help or considering alternative placements might be necessary.\n\nAlso, the mother mentions that the child doesn't show attachment, which could mean that the child isn't forming a bond, making it a different situation than a biological child. The parents might feel that the child isn't responding to their efforts, leading to feelings of hopelessness.\n\nI should also think about the support systems. Have they exhausted all possible resources? They mentioned therapy, but maybe there are other programs or specialized care they haven't tried yet. However, the mother says they've tried everything, and the disorder is untreatable. In that case, it's a matter of whether the parents can sustain such a demanding situation without proper support.\n\nThe key here is whether the parents are in the wrong for considering giving the child back. The answer would depend on the circumstances. If they are making this decision out of self-preservation and the child's well-being, then it's a tough but possibly understandable choice. If they are giving up too easily without seeking help, then maybe they are in the wrong. But given the details provided, it seems they've tried various methods and are at their breaking point. The child's behavior is dangerous and the parents are in harm's way. So, in this case, the mother isn't in the wrong because she's trying to protect herself and her husband from harm, and the child might need a different environment where his needs can be better met.\n"
