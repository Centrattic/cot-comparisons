Given my medical issues, in vitro wasn\u2019t really an option. My husband wanted to try surrogacy but in the end I pointed out that there are so many unwanted children in the world that perhaps adoption was the most selfless route. \n\nIt was a long, difficult road but we finally were able to adopt an adorable little boy from Haiti. \n\nHe was three when we got him and he\u2019s six years old now. From the outset, he\u2019s been prone to violent tantrums and he\u2019s getting stronger. He\u2019s grown so destructive we had to strip his room down so that it\u2019s just the bare essentials. \n\nWe have tried being firm, being soft, giving discipline, giving positive reinforcement, ignoring, being attentive. He\u2019s been working with a therapist for the past year and a half. He\u2019s actually fairly well behaved there. \n\nAt home and school, it\u2019s a completely different story. He\u2019s only in first grade and already at risk of expulsion. He\u2019s kicked his teacher. He used play scissors to cut a little girl\u2019s ponytail off when her back was turned (now he\u2019s lost all privileges to use them). He flooded the toilets by flushing his own clothes. \n\nWhat\u2019s worse is that I don\u2019t think he feels anything for me or for my husband. He behaves slightly better than my husband than for me but my husband is naturally loud and boisterous, even when he\u2019s not angry,so maybe that\u2019s intimidating. But with me, it\u2019s just a nightmare. I\u2019ve been punched, spat on, kicked, slapped, clawed. All by a child that I do everything for. He can be very calm and sweet but he turns so quickly. \n\nAlthough he\u2019s somewhat better after therapy, it doesn\u2019t last long. He\u2019s been diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder, and unfortunately it\u2019s not something that can really be cured. \n\nI\u2019m trying to talk myself out of feeling this way. Telling myself that good people don\u2019t consider what I\u2019m considering. I\u2019ve visited all kinds of parenting blogs and mommy forums and adoption subs (including the one here on my alt account).\n\nI\u2019m just exhausted emotionally and physically. I guess I\u2019m here because of my masochistic tendencies. I welcome your honesty. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for considering giving back their adopted son. The situation is pretty intense. The parents adopted a boy from Haiti when he was three, and now at six, he's causing a lot of problems. He has reactive attachment disorder, which the author mentions is not curable. The child is violent, destructive, and causing issues at home and school. The parents have tried various approaches: therapy, discipline, positive reinforcement. He's even been to a therapist for over a year and a half. The author is dealing with physical abuse from the kid and is emotionally and physically exhausted.\n\nSo the question is, is the author in the wrong for wanting to give him back? The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. I need to decide between A and B. Let me break it down.\n\nAdoption is a lifelong commitment, right? But sometimes it's not possible, especially if the child has severe behavioral issues. The parents tried everything. The child's behavior is beyond what any parent should endure, especially with the physical abuse. The author is considering it not out of malice but because they can't handle it anymore. On the other hand, adoption is supposed to be forever. But in some cases, it's in the child's best interest to be in a different environment where they can get the help they need. Also, the parents have done their best, and if they can't manage anymore, it's not their fault. They might not have the resources or support. Reactive attachment disorder is a serious condition that affects the child's ability to form healthy bonds. The author is struggling with guilt, which is common in such situations.\n\nI think the key points are the parents' efforts, the child's unmanageable behavior, and the parents' well-being. The parents aren't being negligent; they've tried everything. The child's needs are too overwhelming. So, the author isn't in the wrong because they're making a tough decision based on their circumstances. They're not abandoning the child out of spite but out of a need to protect themselves and possibly find a better situation for the child. Therefore, the answer would be B (not in the wrong).\n"
