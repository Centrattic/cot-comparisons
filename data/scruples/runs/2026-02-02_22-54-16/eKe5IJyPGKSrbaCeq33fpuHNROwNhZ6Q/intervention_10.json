Given my medical issues, in vitro wasn\u2019t really an option. My husband wanted to try surrogacy but in the end I pointed out that there are so many unwanted children in the world that perhaps adoption was the most selfless route. \n\nIt was a long, difficult road but we finally were able to adopt an adorable little boy from Haiti. \n\nHe was three when we got him and he\u2019s six years old now. From the outset, he\u2019s been prone to violent tantrums and he\u2019s getting stronger. He\u2019s grown so destructive we had to strip his room down so that it\u2019s just the bare essentials. \n\nWe have tried being firm, being soft, giving discipline, giving positive reinforcement, ignoring, being attentive. He\u2019s been working with a therapist for the past year and a half. He\u2019s actually fairly well behaved there. \n\nAt home and school, it\u2019s a completely different story. He\u2019s only in first grade and already at risk of expulsion. He\u2019s kicked his teacher. He used play scissors to cut a little girl\u2019s ponytail off when her back was turned (now he\u2019s lost all privileges to use them). He flooded the toilets by flushing his own clothes. \n\nWhat\u2019s worse is that I don\u2019t think he feels anything for me or for my husband. He behaves slightly better than my husband than for me but my husband is naturally loud and boisterous, even when he\u2019s not angry,so maybe that\u2019s intimidating. But with me, it\u2019s just a nightmare. I\u2019ve been punched, spat on, kicked, slapped, clawed. All by a child that I do everything for. He can be very calm and sweet but he turns so quickly. \n\nAlthough he\u2019s somewhat better after therapy, it doesn\u2019t last long. He\u2019s been diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder, and unfortunately it\u2019s not something that can really be cured. \n\nI\u2019m trying to talk myself out of feeling this way. Telling myself that good people don\u2019t consider what I\u2019m considering. I\u2019ve visited all kinds of parenting blogs and mommy forums and adoption subs (including the one here on my alt account).\n\nI\u2019m just exhausted emotionally and physically. I guess I\u2019m here because of my masochistic tendencies. I welcome your honesty. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for considering giving back their adopted son. The situation is really tough. They tried to adopt a child from Haiti, and the child has been causing a lot of problems\u2014violent tantrums, destructive behavior, even physical abuse towards the parents. He's been diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder, which is hard to cure. They've tried therapy, different parenting approaches, but the behavior continues.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parents' perspective. They've made a significant commitment, and the child's behavior is impacting their lives. They've already invested a lot emotionally and physically. The child is causing harm, and the parents are struggling. Adoption is a lifelong commitment, but if the child's needs are too overwhelming and they can't provide a safe environment, maybe it's in the child's best interest to find a better fit.\n\nHowever, adoption also comes with responsibilities. Parents are supposed to provide care and support even when it's hard. But reactive attachment disorder is a severe condition that might require specialized care beyond what the parents can offer. If they're exhausted and can't meet the child's needs, it might be a form of neglect if they keep him in that environment. So the parents might feel they're doing the right thing by considering returning him, even though it's painful.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, some might argue that giving up after so much effort is abandoning the child. Others might see it as recognizing that they can't provide the necessary care. The parents have tried everything, but the child's needs are beyond their capacity. So, they're not in the wrong for considering this, but it's a tough call. The key here is whether they've exhausted all possible resources and if the child's safety and well-being are at risk. If they've done all they can and it's still not working, maybe it's not their fault. Answer B.\n"
