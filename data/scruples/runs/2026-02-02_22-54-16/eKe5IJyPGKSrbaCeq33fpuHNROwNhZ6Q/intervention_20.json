Given my medical issues, in vitro wasn\u2019t really an option. My husband wanted to try surrogacy but in the end I pointed out that there are so many unwanted children in the world that perhaps adoption was the most selfless route. \n\nIt was a long, difficult road but we finally were able to adopt an adorable little boy from Haiti. \n\nHe was three when we got him and he\u2019s six years old now. From the outset, he\u2019s been prone to violent tantrums and he\u2019s getting stronger. He\u2019s grown so destructive we had to strip his room down so that it\u2019s just the bare essentials. \n\nWe have tried being firm, being soft, giving discipline, giving positive reinforcement, ignoring, being attentive. He\u2019s been working with a therapist for the past year and a half. He\u2019s actually fairly well behaved there. \n\nAt home and school, it\u2019s a completely different story. He\u2019s only in first grade and already at risk of expulsion. He\u2019s kicked his teacher. He used play scissors to cut a little girl\u2019s ponytail off when her back was turned (now he\u2019s lost all privileges to use them). He flooded the toilets by flushing his own clothes. \n\nWhat\u2019s worse is that I don\u2019t think he feels anything for me or for my husband. He behaves slightly better than my husband than for me but my husband is naturally loud and boisterous, even when he\u2019s not angry,so maybe that\u2019s intimidating. But with me, it\u2019s just a nightmare. I\u2019ve been punched, spat on, kicked, slapped, clawed. All by a child that I do everything for. He can be very calm and sweet but he turns so quickly. \n\nAlthough he\u2019s somewhat better after therapy, it doesn\u2019t last long. He\u2019s been diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder, and unfortunately it\u2019s not something that can really be cured. \n\nI\u2019m trying to talk myself out of feeling this way. Telling myself that good people don\u2019t consider what I\u2019m considering. I\u2019ve visited all kinds of parenting blogs and mommy forums and adoption subs (including the one here on my alt account).\n\nI\u2019m just exhausted emotionally and physically. I guess I\u2019m here because of my masochistic tendencies. I welcome your honesty. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for considering giving back their adopted son. Let me start by reading through the situation carefully.\n\nThe author and their husband are infertile, so they decided to adopt a child from Haiti when the boy was three. Now he's six. The child has been having violent tantrums, is destructive, and has behavioral issues at home and school. He's been to therapy, but the behavior doesn't last. He's diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder, which can't be cured. The parents have tried everything, but the child is abusive towards the mother, hitting, spitting, etc. The mother feels exhausted and is considering giving him back.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I should consider the circumstances. Adoption is a big commitment, and the parents made this decision knowing the challenges, especially given their infertility. They chose adoption as a selfless act. But now the child has significant behavioral issues that are affecting the family's well-being. The child's actions are violent and harmful, leading to physical harm and emotional strain.\n\nReactive attachment disorder (RAD) is a serious condition where a child has difficulty forming emotional bonds. It can stem from neglect or inconsistent care in early life, which might be the case here since the child was adopted from Haiti. RAD can cause the behaviors described\u2014aggression, lack of empathy, and difficulty with discipline. The parents have been working with a therapist, but the child's behavior doesn't improve in other settings like school. \n\nThe parents have tried various approaches: firmness, softness, discipline, positive reinforcement, ignoring, and being attentive. They've stripped his room to prevent destruction. The mother is being physically harmed by her own child. The father is more boisterous, so maybe the child fears him, but the mother is the one suffering abuse.\n\nNow, the ethical dilemma: Is the mother wrong for considering giving the child back? On one hand, parents have a responsibility to care for their children, especially those with special needs. On the other hand, if the child's behavior is causing harm to the family and is beyond their capacity to manage, it might be in the child's best interest to place him in a more suitable environment. However, adoption is supposed to be for the long term, and giving a child back isn't a decision taken lightly. \n\nBut considering the severity of the situation\u2014physical abuse, the child's unresponsive therapy, and the parents' exhaustion\u2014it's possible that the child is in a harmful environment and might need a different setting where he can receive the specialized care he needs. The parents might be in a position where they can't provide that care anymore, which could be in the child's best interest. \n\nHowever, there's also the aspect of the child's well-being. If the parents are his only connection to a family, giving him back might mean institutionalization or another foster care situation, which might not be better. But the parents are also being harmed, so their well-being matters too. \n\nIn some cases, when a child's needs exceed a family's capacity, it's actually considered responsible to seek alternative placements. The parents have tried everything, but the child's condition is chronic and untreatable. So the mother's consideration might be a responsible decision to ensure both the child and the family can have a better quality of life.\n\nBut there's also the emotional aspect. The mother feels guilty, thinking that \"good people\" wouldn't consider this. However, the reality is that parenting a child with severe behavioral issues is extremely challenging, and sometimes the best decision is in the child's best interest even if it's painful. \n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author is not in the wrong. The situation is complex, and the decision is difficult, but the mother's actions are driven by the need to protect herself and her husband from harm and to find a better environment for the child. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
