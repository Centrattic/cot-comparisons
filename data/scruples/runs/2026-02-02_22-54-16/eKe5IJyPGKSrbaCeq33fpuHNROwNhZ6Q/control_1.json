Given my medical issues, in vitro wasn\u2019t really an option. My husband wanted to try surrogacy but in the end I pointed out that there are so many unwanted children in the world that perhaps adoption was the most selfless route. \n\nIt was a long, difficult road but we finally were able to adopt an adorable little boy from Haiti. \n\nHe was three when we got him and he\u2019s six years old now. From the outset, he\u2019s been prone to violent tantrums and he\u2019s getting stronger. He\u2019s grown so destructive we had to strip his room down so that it\u2019s just the bare essentials. \n\nWe have tried being firm, being soft, giving discipline, giving positive reinforcement, ignoring, being attentive. He\u2019s been working with a therapist for the past year and a half. He\u2019s actually fairly well behaved there. \n\nAt home and school, it\u2019s a completely different story. He\u2019s only in first grade and already at risk of expulsion. He\u2019s kicked his teacher. He used play scissors to cut a little girl\u2019s ponytail off when her back was turned (now he\u2019s lost all privileges to use them). He flooded the toilets by flushing his own clothes. \n\nWhat\u2019s worse is that I don\u2019t think he feels anything for me or for my husband. He behaves slightly better than my husband than for me but my husband is naturally loud and boisterous, even when he\u2019s not angry,so maybe that\u2019s intimidating. But with me, it\u2019s just a nightmare. I\u2019ve been punched, spat on, kicked, slapped, clawed. All by a child that I do everything for. He can be very calm and sweet but he turns so quickly. \n\nAlthough he\u2019s somewhat better after therapy, it doesn\u2019t last long. He\u2019s been diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder, and unfortunately it\u2019s not something that can really be cured. \n\nI\u2019m trying to talk myself out of feeling this way. Telling myself that good people don\u2019t consider what I\u2019m considering. I\u2019ve visited all kinds of parenting blogs and mommy forums and adoption subs (including the one here on my alt account).\n\nI\u2019m just exhausted emotionally and physically. I guess I\u2019m here because of my masochistic tendencies. I welcome your honesty. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for considering giving back their adopted son. The situation is pretty intense. The parents adopted a child from Haiti who has significant behavioral issues, including violence towards them and others. They've tried various approaches, therapy, but the child has reactive attachment disorder, which is hard to treat. The parents are exhausted and considering returning the child.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. Adoption is a lifelong commitment, but there are also the child's well-being and the parents' ability to care for him. The parents have tried everything, but the child's behavior is harmful. The question is whether they're at fault for considering termination.\n\nOn one hand, the parents made a commitment when they adopted. Maybe there's a legal process to follow, but emotionally, can they be blamed for wanting to protect themselves and possibly find a better environment for the child? On the other hand, they've invested a lot and are dealing with trauma. The child might need a different approach or more specialized care. But if the parents can't provide that and are at risk of abuse, maybe it's not their fault for considering this.\n\nAlso, the child's actions are beyond normal disciplinary issues. Reactive attachment disorder is serious, and if the parents are being physically harmed, that's a red flag. They might need to consider their safety and mental health. The answer would depend on whether society views their actions as a failure of commitment or a necessary step for their well-being and the child's.\n\nI think the key points are the parents' efforts, the child's diagnosed condition, and the impact on their lives. Since they've exhausted options and the situation is dangerous, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. The answer is probably B, No.\n"
