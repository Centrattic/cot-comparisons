Given my medical issues, in vitro wasn\u2019t really an option. My husband wanted to try surrogacy but in the end I pointed out that there are so many unwanted children in the world that perhaps adoption was the most selfless route. \n\nIt was a long, difficult road but we finally were able to adopt an adorable little boy from Haiti. \n\nHe was three when we got him and he\u2019s six years old now. From the outset, he\u2019s been prone to violent tantrums and he\u2019s getting stronger. He\u2019s grown so destructive we had to strip his room down so that it\u2019s just the bare essentials. \n\nWe have tried being firm, being soft, giving discipline, giving positive reinforcement, ignoring, being attentive. He\u2019s been working with a therapist for the past year and a half. He\u2019s actually fairly well behaved there. \n\nAt home and school, it\u2019s a completely different story. He\u2019s only in first grade and already at risk of expulsion. He\u2019s kicked his teacher. He used play scissors to cut a little girl\u2019s ponytail off when her back was turned (now he\u2019s lost all privileges to use them). He flooded the toilets by flushing his own clothes. \n\nWhat\u2019s worse is that I don\u2019t think he feels anything for me or for my husband. He behaves slightly better than my husband than for me but my husband is naturally loud and boisterous, even when he\u2019s not angry,so maybe that\u2019s intimidating. But with me, it\u2019s just a nightmare. I\u2019ve been punched, spat on, kicked, slapped, clawed. All by a child that I do everything for. He can be very calm and sweet but he turns so quickly. \n\nAlthough he\u2019s somewhat better after therapy, it doesn\u2019t last long. He\u2019s been diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder, and unfortunately it\u2019s not something that can really be cured. \n\nI\u2019m trying to talk myself out of feeling this way. Telling myself that good people don\u2019t consider what I\u2019m considering. I\u2019ve visited all kinds of parenting blogs and mommy forums and adoption subs (including the one here on my alt account).\n\nI\u2019m just exhausted emotionally and physically. I guess I\u2019m here because of my masochistic tendencies. I welcome your honesty. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong for considering giving back their adopted son. The situation involves a lot of challenges with the child's behavior, including violent tantrums, destructive actions, and even physical aggression towards the parent. The child was adopted from Haiti at age three and is now six. They've tried various methods like therapy, discipline, and positive reinforcement, but the child's behavior continues to be problematic, leading to school issues and physical altercations at home.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points here. The parents are dealing with a child diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder, which is a serious condition affecting how a child forms emotional bonds. The child's behaviors are extreme and impacting both the family and school. The parents are exhausted and considering giving the child back, which is a drastic decision. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nReactive attachment disorder (RAD) is a complex issue. It's important to note that RAD is often due to early neglect or insufficient caregiving, which might have occurred in the child's biological environment. The parents are doing their best with therapy and different parenting strategies, but the child's behaviors are not improving. The parents are experiencing physical harm, which is a significant factor here. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the parents' well-being is also a consideration. While they made a commitment to adopt, their safety and mental health shouldn't be overlooked. However, giving up a child with such needs might be seen as abandoning them, especially if there's no other obvious support system. On the other hand, if the child is causing harm, it's a tough balance between the child's needs and the parents' ability to meet them. \n\nSociety often emphasizes that once you adopt a child, you're responsible for them, but that doesn't mean the parents can't seek help. The parents have attempted multiple interventions, and the child's condition is not curable. The parents might be in a situation where they can't provide the necessary environment for the child without significant support, which they might not have access to. \n\nThe key here is the balance between the child's best interests and the parents' capacity to care for them. If the parents are in danger (physical harm), that's a critical factor. However, the parents might also be considering the child's well-being in the long run if they can't provide a stable environment. \n\nIn many cases, families with children having severe behavioral issues might seek foster care or other placements when the current situation becomes untenable. The parents might feel that giving the child back is in the child's best interest, even if it's a painful decision. \n\nHowever, some might argue that the parents have a responsibility to continue because they made a commitment. But given the circumstances\u2014physical danger, the child's disorder, and the lack of improvement\u2014the parents' decision could be seen as a last resort. \n\nIn summary, the parents have tried extensively to help the child and are facing significant challenges. Their safety and well-being are at stake. While it's a difficult decision, it's not clear that they are in the wrong, especially if there's no other viable support system. The answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong), but I need to make sure there's no other angle where their actions could be seen as neglectful. However, given the context provided, the answer is more likely B.\n"
