Given my medical issues, in vitro wasn\u2019t really an option. My husband wanted to try surrogacy but in the end I pointed out that there are so many unwanted children in the world that perhaps adoption was the most selfless route. \n\nIt was a long, difficult road but we finally were able to adopt an adorable little boy from Haiti. \n\nHe was three when we got him and he\u2019s six years old now. From the outset, he\u2019s been prone to violent tantrums and he\u2019s getting stronger. He\u2019s grown so destructive we had to strip his room down so that it\u2019s just the bare essentials. \n\nWe have tried being firm, being soft, giving discipline, giving positive reinforcement, ignoring, being attentive. He\u2019s been working with a therapist for the past year and a half. He\u2019s actually fairly well behaved there. \n\nAt home and school, it\u2019s a completely different story. He\u2019s only in first grade and already at risk of expulsion. He\u2019s kicked his teacher. He used play scissors to cut a little girl\u2019s ponytail off when her back was turned (now he\u2019s lost all privileges to use them). He flooded the toilets by flushing his own clothes. \n\nWhat\u2019s worse is that I don\u2019t think he feels anything for me or for my husband. He behaves slightly better than my husband than for me but my husband is naturally loud and boisterous, even when he\u2019s not angry,so maybe that\u2019s intimidating. But with me, it\u2019s just a nightmare. I\u2019ve been punched, spat on, kicked, slapped, clawed. All by a child that I do everything for. He can be very calm and sweet but he turns so quickly. \n\nAlthough he\u2019s somewhat better after therapy, it doesn\u2019t last long. He\u2019s been diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder, and unfortunately it\u2019s not something that can really be cured. \n\nI\u2019m trying to talk myself out of feeling this way. Telling myself that good people don\u2019t consider what I\u2019m considering. I\u2019ve visited all kinds of parenting blogs and mommy forums and adoption subs (including the one here on my alt account).\n\nI\u2019m just exhausted emotionally and physically. I guess I\u2019m here because of my masochistic tendencies. I welcome your honesty. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author of this \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong for considering giving back their adopted son. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the background: The author and her husband faced infertility and chose adoption. They adopted a 3-year-old from Haiti. Now he's 6, with behavioral issues like tantrums, aggression, and destructive behavior. They've tried various methods, therapy, but he's been diagnosed with Reactive Attachment Disorder (RAD), which is hard to treat. The author is considering giving him back but feels guilty about it.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but wants others' opinions. The key here is whether the author is wrong for considering giving back the child. Let me consider the factors.\n\nReactive Attachment Disorder is a serious condition where a child has trouble forming emotional bonds. This can lead to behavior problems. The child's actions are harmful, both to others and to the adoptive parents. The parents have tried everything\u2014therapy, different parenting styles\u2014but nothing works. The child's behavior is escalating, and he's in first grade at risk of expulsion. The parents are physically and emotionally exhausted.\n\nNow, the question is about whether the author is wrong. The possible arguments against her would be that she's abandoning the child, but given the circumstances, is that a fair judgment? On the other hand, adoption is a legal process that can sometimes be reversed if it's in the child's best interest, especially if the child's behavior is causing harm and the parents are unable to cope.\n\nBut is the author in the wrong? Well, if giving the child back is for the child's own good, perhaps to place him in an environment where he can get the necessary help, then maybe not. Or if the parents are truly unable to provide a safe environment, that's a valid concern. However, the emotional toll on the parents is real, and they might not be in a position to meet the child's needs anymore.\n\nBut some might argue that once you adopt, you commit to it regardless of the challenges. However, the reality is that adoption can be complicated, and sometimes it's in the child's best interest to be placed with another family if the current one can't handle the situation. Also, the child's behavior is dangerous\u2014hurting others, destructive actions. The parents have been physically harmed. So, from a safety perspective, maybe they have a responsibility to seek a better placement.\n\nThe author is seeking honest opinions and considering the child's well-being. If they're considering returning him out of exhaustion but also because it's the best for the child, then they might not be in the wrong. However, if it's purely out of self-interest without considering the child's needs, that could be a problem. But the post suggests that they've tried everything and it's not working, and the child's disorder is chronic.\n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the parents are acting in the child's best interest. If they are, then B (not in the wrong) would be correct. If they're giving up due to personal stress without considering alternatives, maybe A. But the post indicates they've done all they can, so B seems more likely.\n"
