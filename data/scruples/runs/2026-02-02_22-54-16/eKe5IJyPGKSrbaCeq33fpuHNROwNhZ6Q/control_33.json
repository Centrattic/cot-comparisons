Given my medical issues, in vitro wasn\u2019t really an option. My husband wanted to try surrogacy but in the end I pointed out that there are so many unwanted children in the world that perhaps adoption was the most selfless route. \n\nIt was a long, difficult road but we finally were able to adopt an adorable little boy from Haiti. \n\nHe was three when we got him and he\u2019s six years old now. From the outset, he\u2019s been prone to violent tantrums and he\u2019s getting stronger. He\u2019s grown so destructive we had to strip his room down so that it\u2019s just the bare essentials. \n\nWe have tried being firm, being soft, giving discipline, giving positive reinforcement, ignoring, being attentive. He\u2019s been working with a therapist for the past year and a half. He\u2019s actually fairly well behaved there. \n\nAt home and school, it\u2019s a completely different story. He\u2019s only in first grade and already at risk of expulsion. He\u2019s kicked his teacher. He used play scissors to cut a little girl\u2019s ponytail off when her back was turned (now he\u2019s lost all privileges to use them). He flooded the toilets by flushing his own clothes. \n\nWhat\u2019s worse is that I don\u2019t think he feels anything for me or for my husband. He behaves slightly better than my husband than for me but my husband is naturally loud and boisterous, even when he\u2019s not angry,so maybe that\u2019s intimidating. But with me, it\u2019s just a nightmare. I\u2019ve been punched, spat on, kicked, slapped, clawed. All by a child that I do everything for. He can be very calm and sweet but he turns so quickly. \n\nAlthough he\u2019s somewhat better after therapy, it doesn\u2019t last long. He\u2019s been diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder, and unfortunately it\u2019s not something that can really be cured. \n\nI\u2019m trying to talk myself out of feeling this way. Telling myself that good people don\u2019t consider what I\u2019m considering. I\u2019ve visited all kinds of parenting blogs and mommy forums and adoption subs (including the one here on my alt account).\n\nI\u2019m just exhausted emotionally and physically. I guess I\u2019m here because of my masochistic tendencies. I welcome your honesty. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The question is asking if the person who wrote the post is wrong for wanting to give back their adopted son. The situation is complex, so I need to break it down.\n\nFirst, the background: The adoptive parents are struggling with a child who has reactive attachment disorder (RAD). He's been adopted from Haiti, is six years old, and has a history of violent outbursts, aggressive behavior at school and home, and even physical abuse towards the mother. They've tried various methods\u2014therapy, discipline, positive reinforcement\u2014but with limited success. The child's behavior is causing significant stress and danger in the home, leading the mother to consider giving him back.\n\nNow, the ethical dilemma here is about the responsibility of adoptive parents versus the child's well-being. On one hand, the parents have made a commitment through adoption, which is a legal and emotional process. They've also invested a lot of time, effort, and love into this child. On the other hand, the child is causing them harm and is not responding to interventions, which raises questions about the safety of the parents, especially the mother, and the child's own well-being if he's being raised in a harmful environment.\n\nReactive attachment disorder is a serious condition where a child has difficulty forming emotional bonds. It's often due to neglect or abuse in early life. The child's behavior suggests that he's not just acting out but has deep-seated issues that are hard to manage. The parents are doing their best with therapy and other methods, but it's clear that the situation is overwhelming.\n\nThe key here is whether the parents are in the wrong for considering returning the child. The mother is feeling physically and emotionally abused, which is a serious concern. If the parents can't provide a safe environment, maybe it's better for the child to be placed somewhere else. However, adoption is a lifelong commitment, and giving up might be seen as abandoning the child when he needs them most.\n\nBut then again, the parents' well-being is also important. If they are being harmed, they can't effectively care for the child. Also, the child might be better off in a different environment where there are more resources or specialists to handle his specific needs. The parents might not have enough support themselves.\n\nI need to consider the ethical implications. Is it selfish to return a child because it's too hard? Or is it realistic to assess that the current situation isn't working for anyone? The parents are trying, but the situation is deteriorating. The child's behavior is so severe that he's at risk of expulsion from school, which indicates that the parents might not be able to provide the necessary care. If they continue, the child might end up in the foster system again, but maybe through the adoption agency, there's a process to return him. However, that could also be traumatic for the child.\n\nIn some cases, it's possible that the parents are not equipped to handle such a severe case of RAD. They might need more professional help or a different approach. The fact that the child is in therapy but still not improving suggests that the current strategies aren't working. The mother's safety is a critical factor here\u2014being physically abused by a child is a serious issue that can't be ignored.\n\nOn the flip side, giving up the child could be seen as a failure in their parental commitment. They adopted him with the intention to raise him, and now considering giving him back might be seen as abandoning him. But if the child is causing harm, is it also in his best interest to stay in an environment where the parents are suffering and unable to provide consistent care?\n\nI think the answer hinges on the well-being of both the parents and the child. If the parents are in danger and the child isn't getting the help he needs, then returning him might be the responsible choice. The parents are not in the wrong for prioritizing their safety and seeking a solution that's better for the child's future, even if it's painful. The question is about whether they're being selfish or realistic. Given the severity of the situation, it's more about finding the best outcome for everyone involved, even if that means ending the adoption.\n"
