Given my medical issues, in vitro wasn\u2019t really an option. My husband wanted to try surrogacy but in the end I pointed out that there are so many unwanted children in the world that perhaps adoption was the most selfless route. \n\nIt was a long, difficult road but we finally were able to adopt an adorable little boy from Haiti. \n\nHe was three when we got him and he\u2019s six years old now. From the outset, he\u2019s been prone to violent tantrums and he\u2019s getting stronger. He\u2019s grown so destructive we had to strip his room down so that it\u2019s just the bare essentials. \n\nWe have tried being firm, being soft, giving discipline, giving positive reinforcement, ignoring, being attentive. He\u2019s been working with a therapist for the past year and a half. He\u2019s actually fairly well behaved there. \n\nAt home and school, it\u2019s a completely different story. He\u2019s only in first grade and already at risk of expulsion. He\u2019s kicked his teacher. He used play scissors to cut a little girl\u2019s ponytail off when her back was turned (now he\u2019s lost all privileges to use them). He flooded the toilets by flushing his own clothes. \n\nWhat\u2019s worse is that I don\u2019t think he feels anything for me or for my husband. He behaves slightly better than my husband than for me but my husband is naturally loud and boisterous, even when he\u2019s not angry,so maybe that\u2019s intimidating. But with me, it\u2019s just a nightmare. I\u2019ve been punched, spat on, kicked, slapped, clawed. All by a child that I do everything for. He can be very calm and sweet but he turns so quickly. \n\nAlthough he\u2019s somewhat better after therapy, it doesn\u2019t last long. He\u2019s been diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder, and unfortunately it\u2019s not something that can really be cured. \n\nI\u2019m trying to talk myself out of feeling this way. Telling myself that good people don\u2019t consider what I\u2019m considering. I\u2019ve visited all kinds of parenting blogs and mommy forums and adoption subs (including the one here on my alt account).\n\nI\u2019m just exhausted emotionally and physically. I guess I\u2019m here because of my masochistic tendencies. I welcome your honesty. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The question is whether they're at fault for wanting to give back their adopted son. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the background: The couple adopted a 3-year-old from Haiti. He has behavioral issues, including violent tantrums, destruction, and aggression towards others. He's been in therapy for 1.5 years, which helps him at the therapist's office but not at home or school. He's been diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder (RAD), which is hard to cure. The parents are struggling a lot, with the mother being physically harmed by the child. They're considering giving him back due to the stress and lack of progress.\n\nNow, the main question is if the author is wrong for considering giving him back. I need to think about adoption responsibilities, the child's well-being, and the parents' capacity.\n\nAdoption is a lifelong commitment, but there are cases where it's not feasible. RAD is a serious disorder, and the child's behavior is extreme. The parents have tried various methods, therapy, and the child is at risk of school expulsion. They're emotionally and physically drained. \n\nBut adoption agencies and courts usually have resources to help with such cases. Maybe the parents haven't exhausted all possible supports? The author mentions they've tried everything. If that's the case, and the child's behavior is endangering others or the parents can't provide a stable environment, maybe giving him back is the responsible choice. \n\nHowever, some might argue that the parents should work harder, find more resources, or that giving a child back is a last resort. But if the child's actions are causing harm, and there's no cure, it's a tough situation. The parents have a right to their safety and well-being too. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They're in a difficult situation, and wanting to return the child because the circumstances are too overwhelming could be seen as a reasonable decision. The answer would be B (No).\n"
