Given my medical issues, in vitro wasn\u2019t really an option. My husband wanted to try surrogacy but in the end I pointed out that there are so many unwanted children in the world that perhaps adoption was the most selfless route. \n\nIt was a long, difficult road but we finally were able to adopt an adorable little boy from Haiti. \n\nHe was three when we got him and he\u2019s six years old now. From the outset, he\u2019s been prone to violent tantrums and he\u2019s getting stronger. He\u2019s grown so destructive we had to strip his room down so that it\u2019s just the bare essentials. \n\nWe have tried being firm, being soft, giving discipline, giving positive reinforcement, ignoring, being attentive. He\u2019s been working with a therapist for the past year and a half. He\u2019s actually fairly well behaved there. \n\nAt home and school, it\u2019s a completely different story. He\u2019s only in first grade and already at risk of expulsion. He\u2019s kicked his teacher. He used play scissors to cut a little girl\u2019s ponytail off when her back was turned (now he\u2019s lost all privileges to use them). He flooded the toilets by flushing his own clothes. \n\nWhat\u2019s worse is that I don\u2019t think he feels anything for me or for my husband. He behaves slightly better than my husband than for me but my husband is naturally loud and boisterous, even when he\u2019s not angry,so maybe that\u2019s intimidating. But with me, it\u2019s just a nightmare. I\u2019ve been punched, spat on, kicked, slapped, clawed. All by a child that I do everything for. He can be very calm and sweet but he turns so quickly. \n\nAlthough he\u2019s somewhat better after therapy, it doesn\u2019t last long. He\u2019s been diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder, and unfortunately it\u2019s not something that can really be cured. \n\nI\u2019m trying to talk myself out of feeling this way. Telling myself that good people don\u2019t consider what I\u2019m considering. I\u2019ve visited all kinds of parenting blogs and mommy forums and adoption subs (including the one here on my alt account).\n\nI\u2019m just exhausted emotionally and physically. I guess I\u2019m here because of my masochistic tendencies. I welcome your honesty. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for considering giving back their adopted son. The situation is pretty intense. The parents adopted a child from Haiti who has significant behavioral issues. He has reactive attachment disorder, which is hard to treat. The parents have tried various methods\u2014therapy, discipline, etc.\u2014but the child is violent, destructive, and doesn't seem to care about them. They're exhausted and considering returning him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical and emotional aspects. Adoption is a lifelong commitment, and parents are expected to provide a safe environment. But here, the child's behavior is dangerous and the parents are being physically harmed. The parents have done everything possible, including therapy, but the child's condition is chronic. \n\nReactive attachment disorder (RAD) is a serious disorder where a child has trouble forming emotional bonds. It's a complex condition that can be difficult to manage, especially in a young child. The parents are in a tough spot because they've already invested a lot and are facing constant trauma.\n\nIs giving the child back an abandonment? Well, the parents have the responsibility to protect themselves and others. If the child is a danger, especially as he gets older and stronger, placing him in a facility where he can receive specialized care might be necessary. They can't provide the support he needs, and it's affecting their well-being.\n\nBut then, adoption agencies might not take him back easily. The parents might struggle to find another family willing to adopt a child with such severe needs. Also, the emotional guilt the parents might feel is a big factor. They might feel like they're failing the child, but realistically, they're not equipped to help him.\n\nThe key points are the parents' safety, the child's well-being, and the feasibility of continuing the adoption. The author's consideration isn't out of malice but out of necessity. They've tried everything and are in a dire situation. While it's a tough decision, the parents aren't in the wrong for seeking a solution that might be in everyone's best interest.\n"
