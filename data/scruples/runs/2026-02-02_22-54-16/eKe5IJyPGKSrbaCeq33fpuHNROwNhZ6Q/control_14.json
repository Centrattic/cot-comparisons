Given my medical issues, in vitro wasn\u2019t really an option. My husband wanted to try surrogacy but in the end I pointed out that there are so many unwanted children in the world that perhaps adoption was the most selfless route. \n\nIt was a long, difficult road but we finally were able to adopt an adorable little boy from Haiti. \n\nHe was three when we got him and he\u2019s six years old now. From the outset, he\u2019s been prone to violent tantrums and he\u2019s getting stronger. He\u2019s grown so destructive we had to strip his room down so that it\u2019s just the bare essentials. \n\nWe have tried being firm, being soft, giving discipline, giving positive reinforcement, ignoring, being attentive. He\u2019s been working with a therapist for the past year and a half. He\u2019s actually fairly well behaved there. \n\nAt home and school, it\u2019s a completely different story. He\u2019s only in first grade and already at risk of expulsion. He\u2019s kicked his teacher. He used play scissors to cut a little girl\u2019s ponytail off when her back was turned (now he\u2019s lost all privileges to use them). He flooded the toilets by flushing his own clothes. \n\nWhat\u2019s worse is that I don\u2019t think he feels anything for me or for my husband. He behaves slightly better than my husband than for me but my husband is naturally loud and boisterous, even when he\u2019s not angry,so maybe that\u2019s intimidating. But with me, it\u2019s just a nightmare. I\u2019ve been punched, spat on, kicked, slapped, clawed. All by a child that I do everything for. He can be very calm and sweet but he turns so quickly. \n\nAlthough he\u2019s somewhat better after therapy, it doesn\u2019t last long. He\u2019s been diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder, and unfortunately it\u2019s not something that can really be cured. \n\nI\u2019m trying to talk myself out of feeling this way. Telling myself that good people don\u2019t consider what I\u2019m considering. I\u2019ve visited all kinds of parenting blogs and mommy forums and adoption subs (including the one here on my alt account).\n\nI\u2019m just exhausted emotionally and physically. I guess I\u2019m here because of my masochistic tendencies. I welcome your honesty. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for considering giving back their adopted son. The story is pretty detailed.\n\nFirst, the author and their husband adopted a child from Haiti. The kid has been challenging\u2014violent tantrums, destructive behavior at home and school, even physical abuse towards the parents. He's been in therapy for over a year and a half, but it's not working well enough. They mention he has reactive attachment disorder, which is hard to cure. The parents are exhausted and considering giving him back.\n\nI need to figure out if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are the child's behavior and the parents' well-being. Adoption is supposed to be permanent, but there might be exceptions. However, the parents are clearly struggling, and the child is harming them. They've tried everything: different parenting styles, therapy, etc. The child's actions are dangerous and persistent.\n\nReactive attachment disorder is a real thing, where the child has difficulty forming emotional bonds. The parents might be doing the right things but it's not effective. The child's behavior is putting others at risk too, like the teacher and other kids. The parents are experiencing physical abuse from a young child, which is serious. \n\nBut is the author in the wrong? Well, they're not abandoning the child without trying. They've made multiple efforts. The child's actions are so severe that it's affecting the family's safety and mental health. The question is whether giving back the child is the wrong decision. \n\nIn many cases, when a child's behavior is harmful and the parents are in danger, it's a valid consideration. The parents' health and safety are important. The child might need more specialized care that the parents can't provide. So, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. They're trying to make a tough decision for the well-being of everyone involved.\n\nHowever, some might argue that once you adopt, you can't just give up. But the child's issues are beyond typical behavioral problems. The parents might not have the resources or support to handle such a severe disorder. So, considering the circumstances, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to give back the child. The answer would be B (No).\n"
