Given my medical issues, in vitro wasn\u2019t really an option. My husband wanted to try surrogacy but in the end I pointed out that there are so many unwanted children in the world that perhaps adoption was the most selfless route. \n\nIt was a long, difficult road but we finally were able to adopt an adorable little boy from Haiti. \n\nHe was three when we got him and he\u2019s six years old now. From the outset, he\u2019s been prone to violent tantrums and he\u2019s getting stronger. He\u2019s grown so destructive we had to strip his room down so that it\u2019s just the bare essentials. \n\nWe have tried being firm, being soft, giving discipline, giving positive reinforcement, ignoring, being attentive. He\u2019s been working with a therapist for the past year and a half. He\u2019s actually fairly well behaved there. \n\nAt home and school, it\u2019s a completely different story. He\u2019s only in first grade and already at risk of expulsion. He\u2019s kicked his teacher. He used play scissors to cut a little girl\u2019s ponytail off when her back was turned (now he\u2019s lost all privileges to use them). He flooded the toilets by flushing his own clothes. \n\nWhat\u2019s worse is that I don\u2019t think he feels anything for me or for my husband. He behaves slightly better than my husband than for me but my husband is naturally loud and boisterous, even when he\u2019s not angry,so maybe that\u2019s intimidating. But with me, it\u2019s just a nightmare. I\u2019ve been punched, spat on, kicked, slapped, clawed. All by a child that I do everything for. He can be very calm and sweet but he turns so quickly. \n\nAlthough he\u2019s somewhat better after therapy, it doesn\u2019t last long. He\u2019s been diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder, and unfortunately it\u2019s not something that can really be cured. \n\nI\u2019m trying to talk myself out of feeling this way. Telling myself that good people don\u2019t consider what I\u2019m considering. I\u2019ve visited all kinds of parenting blogs and mommy forums and adoption subs (including the one here on my alt account).\n\nI\u2019m just exhausted emotionally and physically. I guess I\u2019m here because of my masochistic tendencies. I welcome your honesty. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's start by understanding the situation here. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for considering giving back their adopted son. The author describes a challenging experience with their adopted son from Haiti, who has behavioral issues and a diagnosis of reactive attachment disorder. They've tried various parenting strategies, therapy, and are dealing with the emotional and physical toll, leading them to consider returning the child.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what reactive attachment disorder (RAD) entails. RAD is a rare condition where children don't form healthy emotional connections with their caregivers. It's often due to early neglect or abuse. The symptoms include difficulty showing affection, emotional instability, and behavioral problems. The author mentions the child has been working with a therapist for a year and a half, which is good, but the progress doesn't last at home or school. That's a key point because treatment for RAD can be long-term and challenging.\n\nThe author has tried multiple approaches\u2014being firm and soft, discipline, positive reinforcement, ignoring, and being attentive. They've also faced physical abuse from the child. It's important to note that they're exhausted, both emotionally and physically. The question is whether their considering returning the child is in the wrong.\n\nIn the AITA context, the community often looks at both sides of the story. The author's perspective is that they made a selfless choice to adopt, but now the situation is overwhelming. On the other hand, taking a child back into the system after adoption is a significant decision. However, considering the child's diagnosis and the severity of the behaviors, it's a complex ethical and practical issue.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the author's decision is influenced by their well-being and the child's potential for a better environment. If returning the child could provide a more suitable home where they can receive specialized care, it might be seen as responsible. However, there's also a concern about the child's stability and the impact of moving again after being adopted.\n\nBut the author is not inconsiderate; they've tried everything possible and sought help. The physical abuse and constant stress are valid factors. The community often shows empathy in such cases, recognizing the difficulty of the situation. The author isn't acting out of malice but out of necessity and self-preservation.\n\nOn the flip side, some might argue that once you adopt, you're committed, but adoption can be legally reversed in some cases, especially if it's in the child's best interest. The child's well-being is also a consideration. If the current environment is harmful, finding a more equipped family could be better for the child long-term.\n\nConsidering all these points, the author's intentions are not malicious. They're struggling with a difficult situation and seeking support. The community is more likely to side with them, recognizing the challenges and the lack of alternatives. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
