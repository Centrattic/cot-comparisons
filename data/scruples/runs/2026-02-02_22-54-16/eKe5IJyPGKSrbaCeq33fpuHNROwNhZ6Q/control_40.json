Given my medical issues, in vitro wasn\u2019t really an option. My husband wanted to try surrogacy but in the end I pointed out that there are so many unwanted children in the world that perhaps adoption was the most selfless route. \n\nIt was a long, difficult road but we finally were able to adopt an adorable little boy from Haiti. \n\nHe was three when we got him and he\u2019s six years old now. From the outset, he\u2019s been prone to violent tantrums and he\u2019s getting stronger. He\u2019s grown so destructive we had to strip his room down so that it\u2019s just the bare essentials. \n\nWe have tried being firm, being soft, giving discipline, giving positive reinforcement, ignoring, being attentive. He\u2019s been working with a therapist for the past year and a half. He\u2019s actually fairly well behaved there. \n\nAt home and school, it\u2019s a completely different story. He\u2019s only in first grade and already at risk of expulsion. He\u2019s kicked his teacher. He used play scissors to cut a little girl\u2019s ponytail off when her back was turned (now he\u2019s lost all privileges to use them). He flooded the toilets by flushing his own clothes. \n\nWhat\u2019s worse is that I don\u2019t think he feels anything for me or for my husband. He behaves slightly better than my husband than for me but my husband is naturally loud and boisterous, even when he\u2019s not angry,so maybe that\u2019s intimidating. But with me, it\u2019s just a nightmare. I\u2019ve been punched, spat on, kicked, slapped, clawed. All by a child that I do everything for. He can be very calm and sweet but he turns so quickly. \n\nAlthough he\u2019s somewhat better after therapy, it doesn\u2019t last long. He\u2019s been diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder, and unfortunately it\u2019s not something that can really be cured. \n\nI\u2019m trying to talk myself out of feeling this way. Telling myself that good people don\u2019t consider what I\u2019m considering. I\u2019ve visited all kinds of parenting blogs and mommy forums and adoption subs (including the one here on my alt account).\n\nI\u2019m just exhausted emotionally and physically. I guess I\u2019m here because of my masochistic tendencies. I welcome your honesty. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to give back their adopted son. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the parents adopted a child from Haiti when the mother was infertile. They went through a long process. The child is now six, and they've had a lot of behavioral issues since he was three. He has violent tantrums, is destructive, has been violent at school, and has a diagnosis of reactive attachment disorder. The parents have tried various methods, therapy, but the behavior persists. They feel physically and emotionally abused by the child. The author is considering giving him back but feels guilty about it.\n\nSo, the question is whether they're in the wrong. Let me think about adoption laws and ethics. In many places, once a child is adopted, the parents are the legal guardians and are expected to provide a safe environment. But if the child is causing harm, especially physical harm, that's a different story. The parents' well-being is also important. They can't take care of a child if they're being injured or emotionally drained to the point of breakdown.\n\nReactive attachment disorder (RAD) is mentioned. I know that RAD is a serious condition where a child has difficulty forming emotional attachments. It can result from early neglect or abuse. The parents might have taken in a child who already had significant trauma, which complicates things. However, even with RAD, the child still needs a stable environment. But if the parents feel they can't provide that safety because of the child's actions, maybe it's not in the child's best interest to stay in that home either.\n\nBut the parents are the ones who made the commitment to adopt him. Is there a way to get more help for the child before considering giving him back? They've already tried therapy, but maybe more specialized resources or residential treatment programs? Also, in some cases, there might be options like foster care with specific training, or working with adoption agencies for support.\n\nHowever, if the parents are being physically harmed, that's a red flag. Their safety is a priority. They can't function as parents if they're in danger. Legally, if the child is a threat to their safety, maybe there are procedures to relinquish custody. But this is a delicate situation. The parents aren't the biological parents, so their rights might differ, but they did adopt, which is a legal process.\n\nEthically, the parents might feel they're failing the child by not being able to handle his needs. But if they're also being harmed, it's a tough call. The child's needs versus the parents' well-being. However, if the parents can't provide a safe environment, then it's not in the child's best interest to stay there either. So maybe the parents aren't in the wrong. They're making the hard choice for the child's safety and their own.\n\nAnother angle: the parents might not have received adequate support post-adoption. Some agencies require post-placement services. If they didn't have access to that, maybe the system failed them. But the question is about the parents, not the system.\n\nSo, considering all that, the parents are in a very difficult situation. They've done everything they can, but the child's behavior is harmful. They're considering giving him back to protect themselves and possibly to find a better fit for the child. In that case, maybe they aren't in the wrong for wanting to give him back. The answer might be B (No).\n"
