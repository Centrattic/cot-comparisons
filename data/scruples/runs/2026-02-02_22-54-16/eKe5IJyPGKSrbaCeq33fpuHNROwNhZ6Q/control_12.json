Given my medical issues, in vitro wasn\u2019t really an option. My husband wanted to try surrogacy but in the end I pointed out that there are so many unwanted children in the world that perhaps adoption was the most selfless route. \n\nIt was a long, difficult road but we finally were able to adopt an adorable little boy from Haiti. \n\nHe was three when we got him and he\u2019s six years old now. From the outset, he\u2019s been prone to violent tantrums and he\u2019s getting stronger. He\u2019s grown so destructive we had to strip his room down so that it\u2019s just the bare essentials. \n\nWe have tried being firm, being soft, giving discipline, giving positive reinforcement, ignoring, being attentive. He\u2019s been working with a therapist for the past year and a half. He\u2019s actually fairly well behaved there. \n\nAt home and school, it\u2019s a completely different story. He\u2019s only in first grade and already at risk of expulsion. He\u2019s kicked his teacher. He used play scissors to cut a little girl\u2019s ponytail off when her back was turned (now he\u2019s lost all privileges to use them). He flooded the toilets by flushing his own clothes. \n\nWhat\u2019s worse is that I don\u2019t think he feels anything for me or for my husband. He behaves slightly better than my husband than for me but my husband is naturally loud and boisterous, even when he\u2019s not angry,so maybe that\u2019s intimidating. But with me, it\u2019s just a nightmare. I\u2019ve been punched, spat on, kicked, slapped, clawed. All by a child that I do everything for. He can be very calm and sweet but he turns so quickly. \n\nAlthough he\u2019s somewhat better after therapy, it doesn\u2019t last long. He\u2019s been diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder, and unfortunately it\u2019s not something that can really be cured. \n\nI\u2019m trying to talk myself out of feeling this way. Telling myself that good people don\u2019t consider what I\u2019m considering. I\u2019ve visited all kinds of parenting blogs and mommy forums and adoption subs (including the one here on my alt account).\n\nI\u2019m just exhausted emotionally and physically. I guess I\u2019m here because of my masochistic tendencies. I welcome your honesty. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for considering giving back their adopted son.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the situation. The couple adopted a 3-year-old from Haiti, and he's now 6. He has behavioral issues, including violence, destruction, and no empathy. They've tried therapy, different parenting approaches, but it's not working. He has Reactive Attachment Disorder, which is hard to treat. The mom has been physically harmed and is emotionally exhausted. She's considering giving him back but feels guilty.\n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nReactive Attachment Disorder is a serious condition where children have trouble forming emotional bonds. The child's actions are beyond typical childhood behavior. The parents have made every effort: therapy, different parenting styles, seeking help. The mom is in physical danger and overwhelmed. \n\nIn adoption scenarios, sometimes the circumstances aren't fully known, but they knew he was three, which is a challenging age for attachment. They've done what they can. The child's behavior is affecting the family's well-being. The mother isn't giving up without trying; she's considering it because it's not working despite all efforts. \n\nThe key points: the parents have tried extensively, the child's condition is severe, the mother is at risk, and the question is about whether she's wrong for considering returning him. Since the disorder is chronic and they've exhausted options, it's not about avoiding responsibility but about protecting their safety and mental health. \n\nSo the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). They've done everything they can, and the situation is beyond their control. It's understandable for them to consider giving him back to ensure safety and well-being.\n"
