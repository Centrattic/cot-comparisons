Given my medical issues, in vitro wasn\u2019t really an option. My husband wanted to try surrogacy but in the end I pointed out that there are so many unwanted children in the world that perhaps adoption was the most selfless route. \n\nIt was a long, difficult road but we finally were able to adopt an adorable little boy from Haiti. \n\nHe was three when we got him and he\u2019s six years old now. From the outset, he\u2019s been prone to violent tantrums and he\u2019s getting stronger. He\u2019s grown so destructive we had to strip his room down so that it\u2019s just the bare essentials. \n\nWe have tried being firm, being soft, giving discipline, giving positive reinforcement, ignoring, being attentive. He\u2019s been working with a therapist for the past year and a half. He\u2019s actually fairly well behaved there. \n\nAt home and school, it\u2019s a completely different story. He\u2019s only in first grade and already at risk of expulsion. He\u2019s kicked his teacher. He used play scissors to cut a little girl\u2019s ponytail off when her back was turned (now he\u2019s lost all privileges to use them). He flooded the toilets by flushing his own clothes. \n\nWhat\u2019s worse is that I don\u2019t think he feels anything for me or for my husband. He behaves slightly better than my husband than for me but my husband is naturally loud and boisterous, even when he\u2019s not angry,so maybe that\u2019s intimidating. But with me, it\u2019s just a nightmare. I\u2019ve been punched, spat on, kicked, slapped, clawed. All by a child that I do everything for. He can be very calm and sweet but he turns so quickly. \n\nAlthough he\u2019s somewhat better after therapy, it doesn\u2019t last long. He\u2019s been diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder, and unfortunately it\u2019s not something that can really be cured. \n\nI\u2019m trying to talk myself out of feeling this way. Telling myself that good people don\u2019t consider what I\u2019m considering. I\u2019ve visited all kinds of parenting blogs and mommy forums and adoption subs (including the one here on my alt account).\n\nI\u2019m just exhausted emotionally and physically. I guess I\u2019m here because of my masochistic tendencies. I welcome your honesty. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for considering giving back their adopted son. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe author and her husband tried to have children but couldn't due to infertility and medical issues. They chose adoption, bringing a 3-year-old boy from Haiti into their home. Now he's 6. The boy has behavioral issues: violent tantrums, destructive behavior, aggression towards others and the parents. He's been diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder (RAD), which is hard to cure. The parents have tried various methods\u2014therapy, discipline, etc.\u2014but the situation remains difficult. The author feels exhausted and is considering giving the boy back.\n\nSo the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical and emotional aspects. Adoption is a lifelong commitment, but the parents also have their well-being to consider. The boy's behavior is causing physical harm and emotional distress. The parents have done everything they can, including therapy and support. RAD is a serious condition that affects the child's ability to form attachments. If the parents can't manage the situation safely, maybe giving him back is the right call.\n\nHowever, some might argue that giving up a child is wrong, regardless of the circumstances. They might believe that all options should be exhausted before considering returning a child. But in this case, the parents have tried multiple approaches without success. The child's actions are harmful, not just to himself but to others. Also, the parents' health and safety are at risk. \n\nAnother angle: adoption agencies often have provisions for such situations, allowing returns if it's in the child's best interest or the family's. If the parents are at risk of injury and the child's behavior isn't improving despite efforts, it might be in everyone's best interest to rehome him. \n\nBut maybe there's a middle ground? The parents could seek more specialized support or alternative therapies. However, the author mentions they've already tried various methods. If those aren't working, what else is left? The author's well-being is also a factor. Chronic stress and trauma from physical abuse can't be ignored. \n\nIn terms of legal and ethical standards, adoption doesn't make the child a possession; it's a parental responsibility. However, when the situation becomes unsafe, authorities might step in. If the parents are considering returning the child to prevent further harm, that could be seen as responsible. \n\nOn the other hand, some might say that the parents have a moral obligation to keep trying, no matter the cost. But that's a heavy burden, especially when the child's issues are beyond their control.RAD is a complex disorder, and without proper treatment, it's challenging. \n\nIn summary, the author isn't being negligent or cruel; they've made a conscious effort to provide a good home. The child's behavior is extreme and potentially dangerous. The parents' decision is likely made out of necessity rather than malice. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
