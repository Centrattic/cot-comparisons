Given my medical issues, in vitro wasn\u2019t really an option. My husband wanted to try surrogacy but in the end I pointed out that there are so many unwanted children in the world that perhaps adoption was the most selfless route. \n\nIt was a long, difficult road but we finally were able to adopt an adorable little boy from Haiti. \n\nHe was three when we got him and he\u2019s six years old now. From the outset, he\u2019s been prone to violent tantrums and he\u2019s getting stronger. He\u2019s grown so destructive we had to strip his room down so that it\u2019s just the bare essentials. \n\nWe have tried being firm, being soft, giving discipline, giving positive reinforcement, ignoring, being attentive. He\u2019s been working with a therapist for the past year and a half. He\u2019s actually fairly well behaved there. \n\nAt home and school, it\u2019s a completely different story. He\u2019s only in first grade and already at risk of expulsion. He\u2019s kicked his teacher. He used play scissors to cut a little girl\u2019s ponytail off when her back was turned (now he\u2019s lost all privileges to use them). He flooded the toilets by flushing his own clothes. \n\nWhat\u2019s worse is that I don\u2019t think he feels anything for me or for my husband. He behaves slightly better than my husband than for me but my husband is naturally loud and boisterous, even when he\u2019s not angry,so maybe that\u2019s intimidating. But with me, it\u2019s just a nightmare. I\u2019ve been punched, spat on, kicked, slapped, clawed. All by a child that I do everything for. He can be very calm and sweet but he turns so quickly. \n\nAlthough he\u2019s somewhat better after therapy, it doesn\u2019t last long. He\u2019s been diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder, and unfortunately it\u2019s not something that can really be cured. \n\nI\u2019m trying to talk myself out of feeling this way. Telling myself that good people don\u2019t consider what I\u2019m considering. I\u2019ve visited all kinds of parenting blogs and mommy forums and adoption subs (including the one here on my alt account).\n\nI\u2019m just exhausted emotionally and physically. I guess I\u2019m here because of my masochistic tendencies. I welcome your honesty. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for considering giving back their adopted son. The situation is pretty intense. The parents adopted a child from Haiti who has behavioral issues and has been diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder. The child has caused a lot of emotional and physical distress, and the parents are exhausted.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The parents chose adoption over other options due to infertility and medical issues. They've made a significant commitment, but the child's behavior is causing them harm. Reactive attachment disorder (RAD) is a serious condition where children have difficulty forming emotional bonds. The parents have tried various methods: therapy, discipline, positive reinforcement, etc. The child's actions are escalating, leading to school problems and physical abuse towards the mother.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). The key here is to assess if the parents are making a selfish or reasonable decision. The parents clearly state they're trying to talk themselves out of feeling the way they do, suggesting they feel guilty. They've given the child multiple chances and resources, but the situation is deteriorating.\n\nIn such cases, the well-being of both the child and the parents is important. If the child is in a harmful environment, it's not good for them either. But the parents are the primary caregivers. If they can't provide a safe environment, perhaps the child needs a different placement. However, giving a child back is a serious decision, especially if they were adopted internationally. There might be legal and emotional hurdles. \n\nI should consider the parents' responsibilities. They've made a commitment to the child, and breaking that could be seen as abandoning. But if they're in danger, their safety is a priority. The question is whether the parents are in the wrong for considering this. From a moral standpoint, if they've exhausted all options and it's affecting their health, maybe they're not in the wrong. However, some might argue that they should try harder or seek more help before considering giving back the child.\n\nThe parents have tried therapy, different parenting styles, and the child's behavior isn't improving. The mother has been physically harmed. Their emotional and physical exhaustion is real. If they return the child, there's a possibility he could be adopted by another family where he might thrive. But it's a tough call because the parents love him but can't handle the situation.\n\nIn terms of societal judgment, the AITA (Am I the Asshole?) framework often looks at whether the person is being unreasonable. Here, the parents are seeking honest opinions, showing they're conflicted. They're not malicious; they're struggling. So, they might not be in the wrong. However, some might say that giving up on a child with special needs is selfish. But given the circumstances, if they're in danger and have tried everything, it's understandable.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the answer is likely B (No, the author is not in the wrong). They\u2019re in a difficult situation where they've done their best, and considering their safety and the child's potential for a better environment, their decision isn't necessarily wrong.\n"
