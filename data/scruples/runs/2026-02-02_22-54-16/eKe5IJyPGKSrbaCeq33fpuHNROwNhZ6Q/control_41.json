Given my medical issues, in vitro wasn\u2019t really an option. My husband wanted to try surrogacy but in the end I pointed out that there are so many unwanted children in the world that perhaps adoption was the most selfless route. \n\nIt was a long, difficult road but we finally were able to adopt an adorable little boy from Haiti. \n\nHe was three when we got him and he\u2019s six years old now. From the outset, he\u2019s been prone to violent tantrums and he\u2019s getting stronger. He\u2019s grown so destructive we had to strip his room down so that it\u2019s just the bare essentials. \n\nWe have tried being firm, being soft, giving discipline, giving positive reinforcement, ignoring, being attentive. He\u2019s been working with a therapist for the past year and a half. He\u2019s actually fairly well behaved there. \n\nAt home and school, it\u2019s a completely different story. He\u2019s only in first grade and already at risk of expulsion. He\u2019s kicked his teacher. He used play scissors to cut a little girl\u2019s ponytail off when her back was turned (now he\u2019s lost all privileges to use them). He flooded the toilets by flushing his own clothes. \n\nWhat\u2019s worse is that I don\u2019t think he feels anything for me or for my husband. He behaves slightly better than my husband than for me but my husband is naturally loud and boisterous, even when he\u2019s not angry,so maybe that\u2019s intimidating. But with me, it\u2019s just a nightmare. I\u2019ve been punched, spat on, kicked, slapped, clawed. All by a child that I do everything for. He can be very calm and sweet but he turns so quickly. \n\nAlthough he\u2019s somewhat better after therapy, it doesn\u2019t last long. He\u2019s been diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder, and unfortunately it\u2019s not something that can really be cured. \n\nI\u2019m trying to talk myself out of feeling this way. Telling myself that good people don\u2019t consider what I\u2019m considering. I\u2019ve visited all kinds of parenting blogs and mommy forums and adoption subs (including the one here on my alt account).\n\nI\u2019m just exhausted emotionally and physically. I guess I\u2019m here because of my masochistic tendencies. I welcome your honesty. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The question is whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for considering giving back their adopted son. I need to decide between A (yes, they're wrong) or B (no, they're not).\n\nFirst, let's break down the situation. The parents adopted a child from Haiti when the mother was infertile. The child has behavioral issues, including violent tantrums, destruction, and aggression. He's been through therapy, but the problems persist at home and school. The child has been diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder, which is hard to cure. The parent feels physically and emotionally exhausted, and is considering giving the child back.\n\nI need to evaluate if the parent is in the wrong here. Let's consider the factors:\n\n1. **Adoption Process**: They went through adoption with open eyes, knowing the challenges. However, no one can perfectly predict a child's behavior. The child's issues became apparent after adoption, which might not be their fault.\n\n2. **Efforts to Help the Child**: They've tried various parenting methods, therapy, and are working with professionals. The child's behavior is severe and not improving significantly. The parents are doing their best, but the child's condition is complex.\n\n3. **Reactive Attachment Disorder (RAD)**: This is a serious condition where children have difficulty forming emotional bonds. It's not a choice for the child, and the parents are dealing with the consequences. The disorder's impact on the family is significant.\n\n4. **Parental Well-being**: The parent is experiencing physical abuse from the child and is emotionally exhausted. Their mental health is at risk. They're questioning their own feelings, thinking they might be \"bad\" for considering giving the child up.\n\n5. **Ethical Considerations**: Is it wrong to put a child back for the family's well-being? If the situation is unsustainable and harmful, some might argue that placing the child in a better environment is in the child's best interest. However, others might say that once a child is adopted, the parent should never give up.\n\n6. **Legal and Ethical Responsibilities**: Adoption is a legal commitment, but it's also about the child's welfare. If the child is in a harmful environment, the parent has a responsibility to seek alternatives. However, giving the child back might be seen as a failure, but it's a difficult decision under pressure.\n\n7. **Alternatives**: Before giving up, are there other options? Maybe specialized care, foster care, or other support systems. The parent mentions being in forums and seeking advice, so they might have considered these.\n\nIn many cases, people would argue that the parent is not in the wrong because they are acting in the best interest of both the child and the family. The child needs a stable environment, and if the current one is causing harm and the parents are unable to cope, it's a hard but necessary decision. However, some might say that the parents should not give up, but that's a more judgmental view.\n\nAlso, the parent is struggling with guilt, which is common in such situations. The question is whether the desire to give the child back makes them \"in the wrong.\" Since they're acting under extreme duress and have made significant efforts, the answer is likely B (not in the wrong).\n"
