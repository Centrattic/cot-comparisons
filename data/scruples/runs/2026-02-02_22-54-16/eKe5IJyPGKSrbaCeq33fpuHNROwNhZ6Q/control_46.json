Given my medical issues, in vitro wasn\u2019t really an option. My husband wanted to try surrogacy but in the end I pointed out that there are so many unwanted children in the world that perhaps adoption was the most selfless route. \n\nIt was a long, difficult road but we finally were able to adopt an adorable little boy from Haiti. \n\nHe was three when we got him and he\u2019s six years old now. From the outset, he\u2019s been prone to violent tantrums and he\u2019s getting stronger. He\u2019s grown so destructive we had to strip his room down so that it\u2019s just the bare essentials. \n\nWe have tried being firm, being soft, giving discipline, giving positive reinforcement, ignoring, being attentive. He\u2019s been working with a therapist for the past year and a half. He\u2019s actually fairly well behaved there. \n\nAt home and school, it\u2019s a completely different story. He\u2019s only in first grade and already at risk of expulsion. He\u2019s kicked his teacher. He used play scissors to cut a little girl\u2019s ponytail off when her back was turned (now he\u2019s lost all privileges to use them). He flooded the toilets by flushing his own clothes. \n\nWhat\u2019s worse is that I don\u2019t think he feels anything for me or for my husband. He behaves slightly better than my husband than for me but my husband is naturally loud and boisterous, even when he\u2019s not angry,so maybe that\u2019s intimidating. But with me, it\u2019s just a nightmare. I\u2019ve been punched, spat on, kicked, slapped, clawed. All by a child that I do everything for. He can be very calm and sweet but he turns so quickly. \n\nAlthough he\u2019s somewhat better after therapy, it doesn\u2019t last long. He\u2019s been diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder, and unfortunately it\u2019s not something that can really be cured. \n\nI\u2019m trying to talk myself out of feeling this way. Telling myself that good people don\u2019t consider what I\u2019m considering. I\u2019ve visited all kinds of parenting blogs and mommy forums and adoption subs (including the one here on my alt account).\n\nI\u2019m just exhausted emotionally and physically. I guess I\u2019m here because of my masochistic tendencies. I welcome your honesty. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for wanting to give back their adopted son. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the couple adopted a child from Haiti who is now six. The child has significant behavioral issues, including violent tantrums, destruction, aggression towards others, and physical abuse towards the parents. They've tried various methods\u2014therapy, discipline, positive reinforcement\u2014but the child has been diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder, which is hard to cure. The parent feels exhausted and is considering giving the child back.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nI need to consider the ethical and emotional aspects here. The parent is clearly struggling and has tried multiple approaches. The child's behavior is extreme and potentially dangerous. Reactive attachment disorder is a serious condition that affects the child's ability to form healthy attachments. The parent's safety and well-being are at risk here. \n\nOn the other hand, the child isn't to blame for their condition. The parents made a commitment when they adopted, so giving up might be seen as a failure to follow through. However, the parents' safety and mental health are also important. If the situation is beyond their capacity to handle and there's a risk of harm, it might be a necessary decision. \n\nIn adoption, there are usually options for returning the child through legal means, especially if the child's needs are too great. The parents might need support or specialized resources, but if those aren't available, giving back could be an option. The key is whether the parents are choosing this out of self-preservation or neglect. The post mentions they've tried everything and are exhausted, suggesting it's not neglect but a difficult decision under stress.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer is B.\n"
