Given my medical issues, in vitro wasn\u2019t really an option. My husband wanted to try surrogacy but in the end I pointed out that there are so many unwanted children in the world that perhaps adoption was the most selfless route. \n\nIt was a long, difficult road but we finally were able to adopt an adorable little boy from Haiti. \n\nHe was three when we got him and he\u2019s six years old now. From the outset, he\u2019s been prone to violent tantrums and he\u2019s getting stronger. He\u2019s grown so destructive we had to strip his room down so that it\u2019s just the bare essentials. \n\nWe have tried being firm, being soft, giving discipline, giving positive reinforcement, ignoring, being attentive. He\u2019s been working with a therapist for the past year and a half. He\u2019s actually fairly well behaved there. \n\nAt home and school, it\u2019s a completely different story. He\u2019s only in first grade and already at risk of expulsion. He\u2019s kicked his teacher. He used play scissors to cut a little girl\u2019s ponytail off when her back was turned (now he\u2019s lost all privileges to use them). He flooded the toilets by flushing his own clothes. \n\nWhat\u2019s worse is that I don\u2019t think he feels anything for me or for my husband. He behaves slightly better than my husband than for me but my husband is naturally loud and boisterous, even when he\u2019s not angry,so maybe that\u2019s intimidating. But with me, it\u2019s just a nightmare. I\u2019ve been punched, spat on, kicked, slapped, clawed. All by a child that I do everything for. He can be very calm and sweet but he turns so quickly. \n\nAlthough he\u2019s somewhat better after therapy, it doesn\u2019t last long. He\u2019s been diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder, and unfortunately it\u2019s not something that can really be cured. \n\nI\u2019m trying to talk myself out of feeling this way. Telling myself that good people don\u2019t consider what I\u2019m considering. I\u2019ve visited all kinds of parenting blogs and mommy forums and adoption subs (including the one here on my alt account).\n\nI\u2019m just exhausted emotionally and physically. I guess I\u2019m here because of my masochistic tendencies. I welcome your honesty. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who adopted a child is in the wrong for considering giving the child back. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author and her husband adopted a six-year-old from Haiti. He has behavioral issues, including violence and destructive actions. They've tried various methods, therapy, but he's still acting out. He's been diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder, which is hard to cure. The author is physically and emotionally abused by the child, yet she feels guilty about wanting to return him.\n\nNow, the question is whether she's in the wrong. The user thinks she's not, but wants my opinion. \n\nConsidering the facts: Adoption is a significant commitment, but it's also a choice made with the child's best interest in mind. The child has complex needs that the parents might not be equipped to handle. Reactive attachment disorder is a serious condition that affects bonding and behavior. The parents have tried multiple interventions without success, and the child is causing them harm. \n\nThe key points here are the well-being of both the parents and the child. If the child is in a harmful environment or the parents can't provide a safe and stable home due to the child's issues, then placing the child with another family might be in his best interest. However, the parents might feel guilty, but that doesn't make them wrong. They did the right thing by trying all options first. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that once you adopt, you're committed. But the parents aren't giving up without effort; they've sought therapy, tried different parenting styles, and consulted professionals. The child's behavior puts others at risk, especially at school. \n\nIn such cases, the priority should be the safety and mental health of everyone involved. If the parents can't continue, it's not wrong to seek another solution. It's about recognizing that they've done their best and that the current situation is unsustainable. \n\nSo, the answer is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. They've made a difficult decision after exhausting all options, and their well-being and the child's safety are important.\n"
