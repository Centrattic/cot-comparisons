Given my medical issues, in vitro wasn\u2019t really an option. My husband wanted to try surrogacy but in the end I pointed out that there are so many unwanted children in the world that perhaps adoption was the most selfless route. \n\nIt was a long, difficult road but we finally were able to adopt an adorable little boy from Haiti. \n\nHe was three when we got him and he\u2019s six years old now. From the outset, he\u2019s been prone to violent tantrums and he\u2019s getting stronger. He\u2019s grown so destructive we had to strip his room down so that it\u2019s just the bare essentials. \n\nWe have tried being firm, being soft, giving discipline, giving positive reinforcement, ignoring, being attentive. He\u2019s been working with a therapist for the past year and a half. He\u2019s actually fairly well behaved there. \n\nAt home and school, it\u2019s a completely different story. He\u2019s only in first grade and already at risk of expulsion. He\u2019s kicked his teacher. He used play scissors to cut a little girl\u2019s ponytail off when her back was turned (now he\u2019s lost all privileges to use them). He flooded the toilets by flushing his own clothes. \n\nWhat\u2019s worse is that I don\u2019t think he feels anything for me or for my husband. He behaves slightly better than my husband than for me but my husband is naturally loud and boisterous, even when he\u2019s not angry,so maybe that\u2019s intimidating. But with me, it\u2019s just a nightmare. I\u2019ve been punched, spat on, kicked, slapped, clawed. All by a child that I do everything for. He can be very calm and sweet but he turns so quickly. \n\nAlthough he\u2019s somewhat better after therapy, it doesn\u2019t last long. He\u2019s been diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder, and unfortunately it\u2019s not something that can really be cured. \n\nI\u2019m trying to talk myself out of feeling this way. Telling myself that good people don\u2019t consider what I\u2019m considering. I\u2019ve visited all kinds of parenting blogs and mommy forums and adoption subs (including the one here on my alt account).\n\nI\u2019m just exhausted emotionally and physically. I guess I\u2019m here because of my masochistic tendencies. I welcome your honesty. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for wanting to give back their adopted son. The situation is pretty intense. The adoptive parents tried various methods, therapy, but the child has reactive attachment disorder and is causing a lot of harm.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The parents adopted a child from Haiti who was three years old. They've been through a lot, and the child's behavior is escalating. The parents are exhausted and have tried everything. The child has been diagnosed with an attachment disorder that's hard to cure. \n\nNow, the question is whether the parents are in the wrong. The options are A or B. The user thinks they're not in the wrong. But I need to think about possible angles. Are there any responsibilities they've neglected? Did they give it enough time? But the child is only six, and they've already tried multiple approaches. The child is harming them physically and causing issues at school. Reactive attachment disorder is a legitimate condition that can make bonding difficult. \n\nAdoption is a lifelong commitment, but sometimes it's not possible to meet the needs of the child. The parents might be considering giving him back to protect themselves and maybe find a better environment for the child. Also, the parents have a responsibility to their own well-being. If they can't provide a safe environment, maybe it's in the child's best interest too. \n\nBut some might argue that once you adopt, you have to stick it out. However, no one is expected to endure abuse. The parents are doing their best, and the situation is beyond their control. So, in this case, the parents aren't in the wrong for considering giving the child back. They've made a good-faith effort, sought help, but the circumstances are overwhelming. The answer is likely B.\n"
