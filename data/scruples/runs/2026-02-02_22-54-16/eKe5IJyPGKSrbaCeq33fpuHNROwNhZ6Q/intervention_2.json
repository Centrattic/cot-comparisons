Given my medical issues, in vitro wasn\u2019t really an option. My husband wanted to try surrogacy but in the end I pointed out that there are so many unwanted children in the world that perhaps adoption was the most selfless route. \n\nIt was a long, difficult road but we finally were able to adopt an adorable little boy from Haiti. \n\nHe was three when we got him and he\u2019s six years old now. From the outset, he\u2019s been prone to violent tantrums and he\u2019s getting stronger. He\u2019s grown so destructive we had to strip his room down so that it\u2019s just the bare essentials. \n\nWe have tried being firm, being soft, giving discipline, giving positive reinforcement, ignoring, being attentive. He\u2019s been working with a therapist for the past year and a half. He\u2019s actually fairly well behaved there. \n\nAt home and school, it\u2019s a completely different story. He\u2019s only in first grade and already at risk of expulsion. He\u2019s kicked his teacher. He used play scissors to cut a little girl\u2019s ponytail off when her back was turned (now he\u2019s lost all privileges to use them). He flooded the toilets by flushing his own clothes. \n\nWhat\u2019s worse is that I don\u2019t think he feels anything for me or for my husband. He behaves slightly better than my husband than for me but my husband is naturally loud and boisterous, even when he\u2019s not angry,so maybe that\u2019s intimidating. But with me, it\u2019s just a nightmare. I\u2019ve been punched, spat on, kicked, slapped, clawed. All by a child that I do everything for. He can be very calm and sweet but he turns so quickly. \n\nAlthough he\u2019s somewhat better after therapy, it doesn\u2019t last long. He\u2019s been diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder, and unfortunately it\u2019s not something that can really be cured. \n\nI\u2019m trying to talk myself out of feeling this way. Telling myself that good people don\u2019t consider what I\u2019m considering. I\u2019ve visited all kinds of parenting blogs and mommy forums and adoption subs (including the one here on my alt account).\n\nI\u2019m just exhausted emotionally and physically. I guess I\u2019m here because of my masochistic tendencies. I welcome your honesty. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong for considering giving back their adopted son. The situation involves a child with reactive attachment disorder, significant behavioral issues, and the parents have tried various approaches without success.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The parents adopted a child from Haiti when they couldn't conceive. The child has been violent, destructive, and has caused problems at school. They've tried therapy, different parenting methods, but nothing's working long-term. The author is exhausted and considering giving the child back.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but wants my opinion. The question is whether the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B). \n\nAdoption is a lifelong commitment, but sometimes it's not possible. Reactive attachment disorder (RAD) is a serious condition where a child has difficulty forming emotional bonds. It's challenging, and the parents have done a lot. However, if the child's behavior is causing harm to the family and there's no progress, the parents might feel they have no choice.\n\nBut is the author in the wrong? The parents made a commitment to adopt, so giving up might seem like they're not fulfilling that. But if the situation is abusive or harmful, maybe they have a valid reason. The key is whether the parents have exhausted all possible options. They mentioned therapy, different parenting styles, and the child's behavior is beyond their control. The author is seeking advice and is emotionally drained.\n\nThe ethical aspect: The child's well-being versus the parents' ability to care for them. If the parents can't provide a safe environment, perhaps placing the child in a better care setting is necessary. However, adoption agencies might have processes in place for such cases, like termination of adoption if it's not working out. \n\nBut some might argue that the parents should have known about RAD possibilities before adopting. However, the post says they tried everything. Also, the child was three when adopted, so past experiences might contribute to his behavior. \n\nConsidering all this, the parents are in a tough spot. They're not being cruel; they're trying their best. If the child's actions are harmful and no progress is made, the parents might be protecting themselves and others by considering returning the child. \n\nSo, the answer is B (not in the wrong). The parents are making a difficult decision under extreme circumstances, and their safety and well-being matter too.\n"
