Given my medical issues, in vitro wasn\u2019t really an option. My husband wanted to try surrogacy but in the end I pointed out that there are so many unwanted children in the world that perhaps adoption was the most selfless route. \n\nIt was a long, difficult road but we finally were able to adopt an adorable little boy from Haiti. \n\nHe was three when we got him and he\u2019s six years old now. From the outset, he\u2019s been prone to violent tantrums and he\u2019s getting stronger. He\u2019s grown so destructive we had to strip his room down so that it\u2019s just the bare essentials. \n\nWe have tried being firm, being soft, giving discipline, giving positive reinforcement, ignoring, being attentive. He\u2019s been working with a therapist for the past year and a half. He\u2019s actually fairly well behaved there. \n\nAt home and school, it\u2019s a completely different story. He\u2019s only in first grade and already at risk of expulsion. He\u2019s kicked his teacher. He used play scissors to cut a little girl\u2019s ponytail off when her back was turned (now he\u2019s lost all privileges to use them). He flooded the toilets by flushing his own clothes. \n\nWhat\u2019s worse is that I don\u2019t think he feels anything for me or for my husband. He behaves slightly better than my husband than for me but my husband is naturally loud and boisterous, even when he\u2019s not angry,so maybe that\u2019s intimidating. But with me, it\u2019s just a nightmare. I\u2019ve been punched, spat on, kicked, slapped, clawed. All by a child that I do everything for. He can be very calm and sweet but he turns so quickly. \n\nAlthough he\u2019s somewhat better after therapy, it doesn\u2019t last long. He\u2019s been diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder, and unfortunately it\u2019s not something that can really be cured. \n\nI\u2019m trying to talk myself out of feeling this way. Telling myself that good people don\u2019t consider what I\u2019m considering. I\u2019ve visited all kinds of parenting blogs and mommy forums and adoption subs (including the one here on my alt account).\n\nI\u2019m just exhausted emotionally and physically. I guess I\u2019m here because of my masochistic tendencies. I welcome your honesty. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for considering giving back their adopted son. The situation is pretty intense. The child has been adopted from Haiti, and since age three, he's had violent outbursts, destructive behavior, and even physically harmed parents and others. They've tried various methods, therapy, but the issues persist. The kid has reactive attachment disorder, which the author mentions is incurable. The parents are exhausted and considering returning him.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the moral and legal aspects. Adoption is a legal process, so there might be specific procedures or obligations. But the question is about moral wrongdoing, not legal. The author is considering giving the child back, which could be seen as breaking a commitment, but perhaps it's also about the child's well-being and the parents' ability to care for him.\n\nThe child's behavior is extremely challenging. The parents have tried everything\u2014therapy, discipline, etc. The child's actions, like violent tantrums, assaulting others, and destructive behavior, suggest that the parents are struggling to provide a safe environment. The child has RAD, which affects his ability to form attachments. So, the parents might not be at fault for the child's behavior; the disorder is a factor.\n\nThe parents are prioritizing their own well-being and the child's safety. If they can't manage the situation, it might be in the child's best interest to place him in a facility or another home that can provide the necessary care. However, adoption is a lifelong commitment, and deciding to return a child is a big step. But given the circumstances, is it wrong? \n\nSome might argue that the parents have a responsibility to stick it out, but others would say that if the child's needs exceed their capacity to provide care, returning him is a responsible decision. The key points are the child's well-being, the parents' safety, and the reality of their situation. They've already done everything possible and the situation isn't improving. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. They're facing an extremely difficult decision under very challenging circumstances, and their health and the child's safety are at stake. The answer should be B (No).\n"
