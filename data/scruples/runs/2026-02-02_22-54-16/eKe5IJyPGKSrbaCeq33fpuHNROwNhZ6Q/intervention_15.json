Given my medical issues, in vitro wasn\u2019t really an option. My husband wanted to try surrogacy but in the end I pointed out that there are so many unwanted children in the world that perhaps adoption was the most selfless route. \n\nIt was a long, difficult road but we finally were able to adopt an adorable little boy from Haiti. \n\nHe was three when we got him and he\u2019s six years old now. From the outset, he\u2019s been prone to violent tantrums and he\u2019s getting stronger. He\u2019s grown so destructive we had to strip his room down so that it\u2019s just the bare essentials. \n\nWe have tried being firm, being soft, giving discipline, giving positive reinforcement, ignoring, being attentive. He\u2019s been working with a therapist for the past year and a half. He\u2019s actually fairly well behaved there. \n\nAt home and school, it\u2019s a completely different story. He\u2019s only in first grade and already at risk of expulsion. He\u2019s kicked his teacher. He used play scissors to cut a little girl\u2019s ponytail off when her back was turned (now he\u2019s lost all privileges to use them). He flooded the toilets by flushing his own clothes. \n\nWhat\u2019s worse is that I don\u2019t think he feels anything for me or for my husband. He behaves slightly better than my husband than for me but my husband is naturally loud and boisterous, even when he\u2019s not angry,so maybe that\u2019s intimidating. But with me, it\u2019s just a nightmare. I\u2019ve been punched, spat on, kicked, slapped, clawed. All by a child that I do everything for. He can be very calm and sweet but he turns so quickly. \n\nAlthough he\u2019s somewhat better after therapy, it doesn\u2019t last long. He\u2019s been diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder, and unfortunately it\u2019s not something that can really be cured. \n\nI\u2019m trying to talk myself out of feeling this way. Telling myself that good people don\u2019t consider what I\u2019m considering. I\u2019ve visited all kinds of parenting blogs and mommy forums and adoption subs (including the one here on my alt account).\n\nI\u2019m just exhausted emotionally and physically. I guess I\u2019m here because of my masochistic tendencies. I welcome your honesty. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this post is in the wrong for considering giving back their adopted son. Let me start by reading through the situation again to understand the key points.\n\nThe couple decided to adopt because the wife is infertile and they couldn't use IVF. They adopted a three-year-old from Haiti, and now he's six. The child has been acting out with violent tantrums, destructive behavior, and has been physically aggressive towards the mother. He's been diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder, which isn't curable. They've tried various parenting strategies, therapy, and the child is making some progress in therapy but at home and school, he's problematic. The mother feels exhausted and is considering giving him back but is conflicted because she feels guilty about that.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to give the son back. The user thinks the author isn't wrong, but they want my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects of adoption. In many places, once a child is adopted, returning them isn't straightforward. There might be legal processes involved, and the well-being of the child is a major concern. However, the parents might have the right to make such a decision if the situation is unbearable and they can't provide a safe environment.\n\nNext, looking at the child's behavior. Reactive attachment disorder (RAD) is a serious condition where a child has difficulty forming emotional connections. The parents have tried multiple interventions, including therapy, but the child's behavior is still causing harm to the family. The mother is being physically harmed, which is a serious issue. If the parents are in danger, they have a right to protect themselves and seek help.\n\nEthically, the parents' well-being is important. They've made a significant commitment by adopting the child, but if the child's needs are beyond what the parents can handle, especially with medical and psychological factors, it's a complex situation. The parents might believe that placing the child in another environment where he can receive better support is in his best interest, even though it's a hard decision.\n\nHowever, considering the child's best interest is paramount. If giving the child back means he could end up in a system that doesn't provide adequate care, that's a problem. But if there's a possibility that another family or a specialized program can offer better support, then it might be the right decision.\n\nThe mother is feeling guilty and is questioning her feelings, which shows she cares deeply. The fact that she's seeking advice and trying to talk herself out of the decision indicates she's conflicted and not making the choice lightly. The community's response might be divided. Some might support her decision to protect her family, while others might feel she should try more options before considering returning him.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, there's no simple answer. Adoption is a lifelong commitment, but situations can change. If the parents are in a position where they can't safely care for the child anymore, they might be making a difficult but necessary decision. On the other hand, if there's a chance they could get more resources or help, they might feel obligated to try. The parents might not be in the wrong for considering this, especially given the child's mental health issues and the parents' own safety and well-being.\n\nSo, based on the information given, the author is facing an extremely challenging situation with a child who has severe behavioral issues that they've tried to address. They're considering giving the child back due to the harm and stress, and they're struggling with guilt. Since the child's condition is complex and the parents have exhausted many options, the author is not in the wrong for considering this decision. Therefore, the answer would be B (No).\n"
