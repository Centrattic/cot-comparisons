Given my medical issues, in vitro wasn\u2019t really an option. My husband wanted to try surrogacy but in the end I pointed out that there are so many unwanted children in the world that perhaps adoption was the most selfless route. \n\nIt was a long, difficult road but we finally were able to adopt an adorable little boy from Haiti. \n\nHe was three when we got him and he\u2019s six years old now. From the outset, he\u2019s been prone to violent tantrums and he\u2019s getting stronger. He\u2019s grown so destructive we had to strip his room down so that it\u2019s just the bare essentials. \n\nWe have tried being firm, being soft, giving discipline, giving positive reinforcement, ignoring, being attentive. He\u2019s been working with a therapist for the past year and a half. He\u2019s actually fairly well behaved there. \n\nAt home and school, it\u2019s a completely different story. He\u2019s only in first grade and already at risk of expulsion. He\u2019s kicked his teacher. He used play scissors to cut a little girl\u2019s ponytail off when her back was turned (now he\u2019s lost all privileges to use them). He flooded the toilets by flushing his own clothes. \n\nWhat\u2019s worse is that I don\u2019t think he feels anything for me or for my husband. He behaves slightly better than my husband than for me but my husband is naturally loud and boisterous, even when he\u2019s not angry,so maybe that\u2019s intimidating. But with me, it\u2019s just a nightmare. I\u2019ve been punched, spat on, kicked, slapped, clawed. All by a child that I do everything for. He can be very calm and sweet but he turns so quickly. \n\nAlthough he\u2019s somewhat better after therapy, it doesn\u2019t last long. He\u2019s been diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder, and unfortunately it\u2019s not something that can really be cured. \n\nI\u2019m trying to talk myself out of feeling this way. Telling myself that good people don\u2019t consider what I\u2019m considering. I\u2019ve visited all kinds of parenting blogs and mommy forums and adoption subs (including the one here on my alt account).\n\nI\u2019m just exhausted emotionally and physically. I guess I\u2019m here because of my masochistic tendencies. I welcome your honesty. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for considering giving back their adopted son. Let me start by reading through the situation again to get all the details.\n\nThe author and their husband decided to adopt because of infertility. They adopted a boy from Haiti when he was three. Now he's six. The child has a lot of behavioral issues: violent tantrums, destructive, has hurt the parents physically, and is in trouble at school. He's been diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder, which can't be cured. The parents have tried various methods, therapy, but things aren't improving. The author is feeling overwhelmed and considering giving the child back.\n\nThe question is whether they're in the wrong for wanting to return him. Let me break this down. First, the parents have done everything they can. They tried different approaches, therapy, etc. The child's behavior is extreme and not improving. The diagnosis is a factor here\u2014reactive attachment disorder is serious and challenging. The parents are clearly suffering and feel physically and emotionally exhausted.\n\nI remember that when someone adopts, they do so with the intention of providing a home. But if the child's needs become overwhelming and beyond the family's capacity, even with all the help they can get, it's a tough situation. The parents might feel guilty, but they're also responsible for their own well-being and safety. There's a point where the child's behavior is so harmful that keeping him could lead to more harm, not just to the parents but possibly to others. \n\nAlso, the parents have considered the child's best interest. They mentioned that he's better in therapy but not at home or school. If the child is at risk of expulsion and has already acted violently, maybe placing him in a facility or another home where he can get specialized care is in his best interest. The parents might not have the resources or expertise to handle his needs long-term. \n\nOn the other hand, adoption is a lifelong commitment, and some might argue that giving up could send a message that the child isn't worth the effort. But the parents have given it their all and still can't manage. They're not giving up without trying; they've exhausted all options. The key here is whether the parents have a duty to keep trying no matter what. But realistically, they can't be expected to put themselves in a dangerous situation. \n\nSo, considering all this, the parents are not in the wrong. They made a choice out of love, tried everything, and now are considering the best path forward for everyone involved. Their decision isn't selfish if it's to protect their safety and the child's well-being.\n"
