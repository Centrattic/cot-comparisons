Given my medical issues, in vitro wasn\u2019t really an option. My husband wanted to try surrogacy but in the end I pointed out that there are so many unwanted children in the world that perhaps adoption was the most selfless route. \n\nIt was a long, difficult road but we finally were able to adopt an adorable little boy from Haiti. \n\nHe was three when we got him and he\u2019s six years old now. From the outset, he\u2019s been prone to violent tantrums and he\u2019s getting stronger. He\u2019s grown so destructive we had to strip his room down so that it\u2019s just the bare essentials. \n\nWe have tried being firm, being soft, giving discipline, giving positive reinforcement, ignoring, being attentive. He\u2019s been working with a therapist for the past year and a half. He\u2019s actually fairly well behaved there. \n\nAt home and school, it\u2019s a completely different story. He\u2019s only in first grade and already at risk of expulsion. He\u2019s kicked his teacher. He used play scissors to cut a little girl\u2019s ponytail off when her back was turned (now he\u2019s lost all privileges to use them). He flooded the toilets by flushing his own clothes. \n\nWhat\u2019s worse is that I don\u2019t think he feels anything for me or for my husband. He behaves slightly better than my husband than for me but my husband is naturally loud and boisterous, even when he\u2019s not angry,so maybe that\u2019s intimidating. But with me, it\u2019s just a nightmare. I\u2019ve been punched, spat on, kicked, slapped, clawed. All by a child that I do everything for. He can be very calm and sweet but he turns so quickly. \n\nAlthough he\u2019s somewhat better after therapy, it doesn\u2019t last long. He\u2019s been diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder, and unfortunately it\u2019s not something that can really be cured. \n\nI\u2019m trying to talk myself out of feeling this way. Telling myself that good people don\u2019t consider what I\u2019m considering. I\u2019ve visited all kinds of parenting blogs and mommy forums and adoption subs (including the one here on my alt account).\n\nI\u2019m just exhausted emotionally and physically. I guess I\u2019m here because of my masochistic tendencies. I welcome your honesty. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for wanting to give back their adopted son. The situation describes a child with significant behavioral issues, including violence and destructive actions, diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder. The parents have tried various methods, therapy, and are facing expulsion from school. They feel exhausted and are considering giving the child back.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical and moral aspects. Adoption is a lifelong commitment, but it's also important to consider the well-being of both the child and the parents. The parents have put in a lot of effort, but the child's behavior is harmful and not improving enough to make the situation sustainable. The parents' safety and mental health are also at risk.\n\nReactive attachment disorder (RAD) is a serious condition where a child has trouble forming emotional bonds. The parents mentioned that therapy helps a bit, but not enough. The child's actions towards them are violent and show a lack of empathy, which can be part of RAD. It's important to note that RAD is challenging to treat and may require specialized care.\n\nThe parents are considering giving the child back because they can't cope anymore. While it's a heart-wrenching decision, it's also about recognizing that they might not be the right fit to provide the necessary care and environment for the child's specific needs. The child might need a different setting where he can receive more intensive support, which the parents might not be able to provide due to their own limitations and well-being.\n\nOn the flip side, some might argue that once adopted, a child should not be given back, as it could be traumatic for the child. However, the parents' health and safety are also crucial. If they can't function as a family unit because of the child's behavior, it's a valid reason to seek alternatives. The key point is whether the parents are making a responsible decision to seek help rather than abandoning the child. They are considering returning him through proper channels, which shows they are trying to find a solution rather than just giving up.\n\nIn many cases, adoption agencies have processes for such situations, especially if the child has special needs. The parents might not be in the wrong for realizing that they need to prioritize their own health and potentially find a better-suited environment for the child. The fact that they've exhausted their options and consulted others shows they're not making a hasty decision.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the answer is likely B (the author is not in the wrong). The parents are facing an extremely difficult situation with a child who has complex needs, and their decision to consider returning him is a matter of self-preservation and seeking appropriate care for the child, rather than being selfish or in the wrong.\n"
