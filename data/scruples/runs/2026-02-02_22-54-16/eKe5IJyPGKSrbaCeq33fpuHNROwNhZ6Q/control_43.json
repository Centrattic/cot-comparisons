Given my medical issues, in vitro wasn\u2019t really an option. My husband wanted to try surrogacy but in the end I pointed out that there are so many unwanted children in the world that perhaps adoption was the most selfless route. \n\nIt was a long, difficult road but we finally were able to adopt an adorable little boy from Haiti. \n\nHe was three when we got him and he\u2019s six years old now. From the outset, he\u2019s been prone to violent tantrums and he\u2019s getting stronger. He\u2019s grown so destructive we had to strip his room down so that it\u2019s just the bare essentials. \n\nWe have tried being firm, being soft, giving discipline, giving positive reinforcement, ignoring, being attentive. He\u2019s been working with a therapist for the past year and a half. He\u2019s actually fairly well behaved there. \n\nAt home and school, it\u2019s a completely different story. He\u2019s only in first grade and already at risk of expulsion. He\u2019s kicked his teacher. He used play scissors to cut a little girl\u2019s ponytail off when her back was turned (now he\u2019s lost all privileges to use them). He flooded the toilets by flushing his own clothes. \n\nWhat\u2019s worse is that I don\u2019t think he feels anything for me or for my husband. He behaves slightly better than my husband than for me but my husband is naturally loud and boisterous, even when he\u2019s not angry,so maybe that\u2019s intimidating. But with me, it\u2019s just a nightmare. I\u2019ve been punched, spat on, kicked, slapped, clawed. All by a child that I do everything for. He can be very calm and sweet but he turns so quickly. \n\nAlthough he\u2019s somewhat better after therapy, it doesn\u2019t last long. He\u2019s been diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder, and unfortunately it\u2019s not something that can really be cured. \n\nI\u2019m trying to talk myself out of feeling this way. Telling myself that good people don\u2019t consider what I\u2019m considering. I\u2019ve visited all kinds of parenting blogs and mommy forums and adoption subs (including the one here on my alt account).\n\nI\u2019m just exhausted emotionally and physically. I guess I\u2019m here because of my masochistic tendencies. I welcome your honesty. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to give back their adopted son. The situation is pretty intense. The parents adopted a child from Haiti who has significant behavioral issues, including violence and destruction. The child has been diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder, which I think is a disorder where kids have trouble forming emotional connections with caregivers. The parents have tried various methods, therapy, discipline, etc., but the child's behavior is causing problems at home and school. The mother is being physically harmed.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. Adoption is a legal process, and giving a child back might involve legal procedures. But the question is about moral wrong, not legal. The parents are considering terminating the adoption due to the child's behavior and their own well-being. Are they in the wrong?\n\nReactive attachment disorder is a real condition, but it's challenging. The parents have tried everything. The child isn't responding as hoped. The parents are exhausted and physically harmed. The child isn't showing attachment, which is part of the disorder. \n\nBut adoption is a lifelong commitment, and some might argue that the parents should not give up so easily. However, others might say that the parents have a right to their own safety and well-being. The child is in a dangerous environment if he's acting out violently. Also, the parents might not be in a position to provide the necessary care anymore. \n\nOn the other hand, giving a child back can have severe emotional impacts on the child. He might not understand why he's being returned. It could lead to further trauma. But in this case, the parents have already tried everything, and the child is at risk of expulsion from school and is causing harm. \n\nThe parents feel they are doing everything for the child but getting nothing in return. The mother's safety is compromised. So, from a personal responsibility angle, maybe they're not wrong. They have a right to live safely. But from a commitment perspective, some might argue they should stay. \n\nBut the key points here are the child's diagnosis, the parents' efforts, and their well-being. The parents have explored all options and are still struggling. The answer likely leans towards B (not in the wrong) because they're making a difficult decision under extreme circumstances, prioritizing their safety and the child's possible need for a more suitable environment. The child also needs a stable home, and if they can't provide that, returning him might be in his best interest. So, the answer would be B.\n"
