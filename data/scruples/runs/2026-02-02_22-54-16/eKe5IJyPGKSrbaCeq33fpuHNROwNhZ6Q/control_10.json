Given my medical issues, in vitro wasn\u2019t really an option. My husband wanted to try surrogacy but in the end I pointed out that there are so many unwanted children in the world that perhaps adoption was the most selfless route. \n\nIt was a long, difficult road but we finally were able to adopt an adorable little boy from Haiti. \n\nHe was three when we got him and he\u2019s six years old now. From the outset, he\u2019s been prone to violent tantrums and he\u2019s getting stronger. He\u2019s grown so destructive we had to strip his room down so that it\u2019s just the bare essentials. \n\nWe have tried being firm, being soft, giving discipline, giving positive reinforcement, ignoring, being attentive. He\u2019s been working with a therapist for the past year and a half. He\u2019s actually fairly well behaved there. \n\nAt home and school, it\u2019s a completely different story. He\u2019s only in first grade and already at risk of expulsion. He\u2019s kicked his teacher. He used play scissors to cut a little girl\u2019s ponytail off when her back was turned (now he\u2019s lost all privileges to use them). He flooded the toilets by flushing his own clothes. \n\nWhat\u2019s worse is that I don\u2019t think he feels anything for me or for my husband. He behaves slightly better than my husband than for me but my husband is naturally loud and boisterous, even when he\u2019s not angry,so maybe that\u2019s intimidating. But with me, it\u2019s just a nightmare. I\u2019ve been punched, spat on, kicked, slapped, clawed. All by a child that I do everything for. He can be very calm and sweet but he turns so quickly. \n\nAlthough he\u2019s somewhat better after therapy, it doesn\u2019t last long. He\u2019s been diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder, and unfortunately it\u2019s not something that can really be cured. \n\nI\u2019m trying to talk myself out of feeling this way. Telling myself that good people don\u2019t consider what I\u2019m considering. I\u2019ve visited all kinds of parenting blogs and mommy forums and adoption subs (including the one here on my alt account).\n\nI\u2019m just exhausted emotionally and physically. I guess I\u2019m here because of my masochistic tendencies. I welcome your honesty. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the person posting the situation is in the wrong for considering giving back their adopted son. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation thoroughly. The adoptive parents adopted a three-year-old from Haiti, and now he's six. The child has behavioral issues, including violent tantrums, destructive behavior, and aggression towards others. He's been diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder (RAD), which is a condition where a child has difficulty forming emotional bonds. The parents have tried various methods\u2014therapy, discipline, positive reinforcement\u2014but the behavior continues. The mother mentions being physically harmed by the child. They're considering giving him back.\n\nNext, I should consider the key factors here. Adoption is a lifelong commitment, and parents are expected to provide a stable environment. However, the child's diagnosis of RAD suggests that his behavior isn't just willful but may stem from deep emotional issues. The parents have made significant efforts to help him, including therapy and adjusting their parenting styles. Despite this, the situation remains challenging and harmful.\n\nThe question is whether the parents are in the wrong for wanting to give him up. Legally and ethically, parents aren't in the wrong for recognizing that they can't meet a child's needs. Especially with RAD, which is complex and may require specialized resources the parents might not have. The safety of the parents and the child is also a concern. If the child is in a home where he's being physically harmed, it's a serious issue.\n\nHowever, adoption does come with long-term responsibilities. The parents might feel guilt or societal judgment, but they aren't legally bound to keep the child if they can't provide adequate care. The child might benefit from a different environment where professionals can offer more support. The parents are considering this out of necessity, not malice.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that giving up a child with such needs could be seen as abandoning them, especially if there's a lack of alternative resources. But given the circumstances described, the parents are at their breaking point and have exhausted options. The child's actions are harmful, and the parents' well-being is also a factor.\n\nIn conclusion, the parents aren't acting out of selfishness or cruelty. They're trying to make a tough decision in the best interest of everyone involved, considering their limitations and the child's needs. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
