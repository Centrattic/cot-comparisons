Given my medical issues, in vitro wasn\u2019t really an option. My husband wanted to try surrogacy but in the end I pointed out that there are so many unwanted children in the world that perhaps adoption was the most selfless route. \n\nIt was a long, difficult road but we finally were able to adopt an adorable little boy from Haiti. \n\nHe was three when we got him and he\u2019s six years old now. From the outset, he\u2019s been prone to violent tantrums and he\u2019s getting stronger. He\u2019s grown so destructive we had to strip his room down so that it\u2019s just the bare essentials. \n\nWe have tried being firm, being soft, giving discipline, giving positive reinforcement, ignoring, being attentive. He\u2019s been working with a therapist for the past year and a half. He\u2019s actually fairly well behaved there. \n\nAt home and school, it\u2019s a completely different story. He\u2019s only in first grade and already at risk of expulsion. He\u2019s kicked his teacher. He used play scissors to cut a little girl\u2019s ponytail off when her back was turned (now he\u2019s lost all privileges to use them). He flooded the toilets by flushing his own clothes. \n\nWhat\u2019s worse is that I don\u2019t think he feels anything for me or for my husband. He behaves slightly better than my husband than for me but my husband is naturally loud and boisterous, even when he\u2019s not angry,so maybe that\u2019s intimidating. But with me, it\u2019s just a nightmare. I\u2019ve been punched, spat on, kicked, slapped, clawed. All by a child that I do everything for. He can be very calm and sweet but he turns so quickly. \n\nAlthough he\u2019s somewhat better after therapy, it doesn\u2019t last long. He\u2019s been diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder, and unfortunately it\u2019s not something that can really be cured. \n\nI\u2019m trying to talk myself out of feeling this way. Telling myself that good people don\u2019t consider what I\u2019m considering. I\u2019ve visited all kinds of parenting blogs and mommy forums and adoption subs (including the one here on my alt account).\n\nI\u2019m just exhausted emotionally and physically. I guess I\u2019m here because of my masochistic tendencies. I welcome your honesty. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the person in the AITA (Am I the Asshole?) post is in the wrong for considering giving back their adopted son. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The adoptive parents, after struggling with infertility, adopted a child from Haiti. The child has been violent, destructive, and unresponsive to various parenting strategies. He has Reactive Attachment Disorder (RAD), which is hard to treat. The mother is physically and emotionally abused by the child. She's considering giving him back but feels guilty about it.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. Now, I need to decide if the answer is A or B.\n\nEthically, this is a tough call. On one hand, the child is in a dangerous situation, being physically harmed. The parents have tried everything, including therapy, but it's not working. Their well-being is also at stake. On the other hand, adoption is a lifelong commitment, and giving up a child might be seen as a last resort.\n\nBut the parents have exhausted all options. RAD is a severe disorder. The child's behavior is not only harmful to the parents but also to others (like the teacher and other kids). If the parents can't ensure safety or provide the necessary care, perhaps it's not in the child's best interest to stay in an environment where the parents are also suffering. The mother is clearly at the breaking point.\n\nSo, in this case, the parents considering giving back the child isn't necessarily wrong because they're trying to protect themselves and possibly the child from a harmful situation. They've made a conscious effort to seek help and support. The question is about the parents' right to make that decision, and given the circumstances, it's a compassionate but hard choice. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
