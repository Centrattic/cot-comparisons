Given my medical issues, in vitro wasn\u2019t really an option. My husband wanted to try surrogacy but in the end I pointed out that there are so many unwanted children in the world that perhaps adoption was the most selfless route. \n\nIt was a long, difficult road but we finally were able to adopt an adorable little boy from Haiti. \n\nHe was three when we got him and he\u2019s six years old now. From the outset, he\u2019s been prone to violent tantrums and he\u2019s getting stronger. He\u2019s grown so destructive we had to strip his room down so that it\u2019s just the bare essentials. \n\nWe have tried being firm, being soft, giving discipline, giving positive reinforcement, ignoring, being attentive. He\u2019s been working with a therapist for the past year and a half. He\u2019s actually fairly well behaved there. \n\nAt home and school, it\u2019s a completely different story. He\u2019s only in first grade and already at risk of expulsion. He\u2019s kicked his teacher. He used play scissors to cut a little girl\u2019s ponytail off when her back was turned (now he\u2019s lost all privileges to use them). He flooded the toilets by flushing his own clothes. \n\nWhat\u2019s worse is that I don\u2019t think he feels anything for me or for my husband. He behaves slightly better than my husband than for me but my husband is naturally loud and boisterous, even when he\u2019s not angry,so maybe that\u2019s intimidating. But with me, it\u2019s just a nightmare. I\u2019ve been punched, spat on, kicked, slapped, clawed. All by a child that I do everything for. He can be very calm and sweet but he turns so quickly. \n\nAlthough he\u2019s somewhat better after therapy, it doesn\u2019t last long. He\u2019s been diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder, and unfortunately it\u2019s not something that can really be cured. \n\nI\u2019m trying to talk myself out of feeling this way. Telling myself that good people don\u2019t consider what I\u2019m considering. I\u2019ve visited all kinds of parenting blogs and mommy forums and adoption subs (including the one here on my alt account).\n\nI\u2019m just exhausted emotionally and physically. I guess I\u2019m here because of my masochistic tendencies. I welcome your honesty. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this situation. The user is asking whether the author of the given scenario is in the wrong for considering giving back their adopted son. Let me break down the details.\n\nFirst, the couple decided to adopt because the wife is infertile. They adopted a three-year-old from Haiti. Now the child is six. He has a history of violent tantrums, destructive behavior, and even physically harmed the parents and others. He's been in therapy for over a year and a half, which helps some but not enough. He's been diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder (RAD), which is difficult to treat.\n\nThe parents are exhausted, both emotionally and physically. They've tried various parenting strategies without success. The child doesn't seem to have a strong emotional bond with them, and his behavior is getting worse. The author is considering giving him back, feeling conflicted because they want to do what's right.\n\nNow, the question is whether they are in the wrong. Let's consider the possible angles. Adoption is a lifelong commitment, but it's also about the child's well-being. If the child is being harmed by the environment, maybe they should keep trying. On the other hand, the parents are at their breaking point, and the child's behavior is dangerous. If they keep him, the abuse could continue or escalate, which is harmful to everyone.\n\nReactive attachment disorder is a serious condition. The child might not have formed secure attachments early in life, making it hard to trust or bond with caregivers. The parents have done a lot to help him, but maybe it's not enough. The key here is whether giving him back is the right decision for his safety and development. Sometimes, when a child's behavior is beyond what a family can manage, especially with mental health issues, it might be better to find another home where he can get more specialized care.\n\nHowever, there's also the aspect of commitment in adoption. Many people adopt knowing the challenges, and some feel that they should not give up easily. But if the situation is harmful, maybe it's not selfish to prioritize the child's needs even if it means making a difficult decision.\n\nThe parents have tried everything\u2014therapy, different parenting techniques, and have exhausted their resources. If the child is in a better environment, maybe he can thrive more. The parents are physically and emotionally drained, which affects their ability to care for him properly. It's a tough call, but I think the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because the well-being of the child and the family's health are important.\n"
