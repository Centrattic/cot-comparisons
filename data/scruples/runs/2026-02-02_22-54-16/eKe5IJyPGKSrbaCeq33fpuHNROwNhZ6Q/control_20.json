Given my medical issues, in vitro wasn\u2019t really an option. My husband wanted to try surrogacy but in the end I pointed out that there are so many unwanted children in the world that perhaps adoption was the most selfless route. \n\nIt was a long, difficult road but we finally were able to adopt an adorable little boy from Haiti. \n\nHe was three when we got him and he\u2019s six years old now. From the outset, he\u2019s been prone to violent tantrums and he\u2019s getting stronger. He\u2019s grown so destructive we had to strip his room down so that it\u2019s just the bare essentials. \n\nWe have tried being firm, being soft, giving discipline, giving positive reinforcement, ignoring, being attentive. He\u2019s been working with a therapist for the past year and a half. He\u2019s actually fairly well behaved there. \n\nAt home and school, it\u2019s a completely different story. He\u2019s only in first grade and already at risk of expulsion. He\u2019s kicked his teacher. He used play scissors to cut a little girl\u2019s ponytail off when her back was turned (now he\u2019s lost all privileges to use them). He flooded the toilets by flushing his own clothes. \n\nWhat\u2019s worse is that I don\u2019t think he feels anything for me or for my husband. He behaves slightly better than my husband than for me but my husband is naturally loud and boisterous, even when he\u2019s not angry,so maybe that\u2019s intimidating. But with me, it\u2019s just a nightmare. I\u2019ve been punched, spat on, kicked, slapped, clawed. All by a child that I do everything for. He can be very calm and sweet but he turns so quickly. \n\nAlthough he\u2019s somewhat better after therapy, it doesn\u2019t last long. He\u2019s been diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder, and unfortunately it\u2019s not something that can really be cured. \n\nI\u2019m trying to talk myself out of feeling this way. Telling myself that good people don\u2019t consider what I\u2019m considering. I\u2019ve visited all kinds of parenting blogs and mommy forums and adoption subs (including the one here on my alt account).\n\nI\u2019m just exhausted emotionally and physically. I guess I\u2019m here because of my masochistic tendencies. I welcome your honesty. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong for wanting to give back their adopted son. Let's break down the details.\n\nFirst, the parents decided on adoption because of infertility issues. They adopted a three-year-old from Haiti. The child has been having severe behavioral issues: violent tantrums, destructive behavior, aggression towards others (like cutting a girl's hair, kicking a teacher), and physical abuse towards the mother. He's been in therapy for over a year and a half, but the behavior is worse at home and school. The child is diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder, which is hard to cure. The mother is extremely stressed, physically and emotionally exhausted, and considering giving him back.\n\nNow, the question is whether she's in the wrong. I need to consider the ethical implications here. On one hand, adoption is a lifelong commitment, and parents often go through challenges. There's a responsibility to provide a stable home, especially for a child who might not have had stability. On the other hand, the child's behavior is endangering the family's well-being. The mother is being physically harmed, and the child's actions are leading to potential expulsion from school. Reactive attachment disorder is a serious condition that makes forming healthy attachments difficult, which might mean the child is not getting the emotional support he needs in this environment.\n\nThe parents have tried various methods\u2014firmness, softness, different parenting styles, therapy. The child is responding better in some contexts (therapy) but not at home. The mother is considering giving him back because she's exhausted and can't handle it anymore. Is it wrong to prioritize one's mental health and safety over continuing to care for a child when all reasonable efforts have been made? \n\nI think the key factors here are the safety of the family and the well-being of the child. If the child's needs are beyond what the parents can provide, and the parents are at risk of harm, then wanting to give him back isn't necessarily wrong. The parents might need to seek alternative solutions like specialized care or foster care that can better handle the child's condition. The mother's decision might be a responsible one to prevent further harm to herself and her husband, ensuring the child gets the help he needs elsewhere. \n\nHowever, some might argue that giving up is not the right choice, especially when the child is from another country and might face more challenges if returned. But the parents have already made a significant commitment and are struggling. The question is whether they are in the wrong for considering it. Given the circumstances, I don't think they are. They are making a hard decision based on their current capacity to provide a safe environment. So the answer is B (No).\n"
