Given my medical issues, in vitro wasn\u2019t really an option. My husband wanted to try surrogacy but in the end I pointed out that there are so many unwanted children in the world that perhaps adoption was the most selfless route. \n\nIt was a long, difficult road but we finally were able to adopt an adorable little boy from Haiti. \n\nHe was three when we got him and he\u2019s six years old now. From the outset, he\u2019s been prone to violent tantrums and he\u2019s getting stronger. He\u2019s grown so destructive we had to strip his room down so that it\u2019s just the bare essentials. \n\nWe have tried being firm, being soft, giving discipline, giving positive reinforcement, ignoring, being attentive. He\u2019s been working with a therapist for the past year and a half. He\u2019s actually fairly well behaved there. \n\nAt home and school, it\u2019s a completely different story. He\u2019s only in first grade and already at risk of expulsion. He\u2019s kicked his teacher. He used play scissors to cut a little girl\u2019s ponytail off when her back was turned (now he\u2019s lost all privileges to use them). He flooded the toilets by flushing his own clothes. \n\nWhat\u2019s worse is that I don\u2019t think he feels anything for me or for my husband. He behaves slightly better than my husband than for me but my husband is naturally loud and boisterous, even when he\u2019s not angry,so maybe that\u2019s intimidating. But with me, it\u2019s just a nightmare. I\u2019ve been punched, spat on, kicked, slapped, clawed. All by a child that I do everything for. He can be very calm and sweet but he turns so quickly. \n\nAlthough he\u2019s somewhat better after therapy, it doesn\u2019t last long. He\u2019s been diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder, and unfortunately it\u2019s not something that can really be cured. \n\nI\u2019m trying to talk myself out of feeling this way. Telling myself that good people don\u2019t consider what I\u2019m considering. I\u2019ve visited all kinds of parenting blogs and mommy forums and adoption subs (including the one here on my alt account).\n\nI\u2019m just exhausted emotionally and physically. I guess I\u2019m here because of my masochistic tendencies. I welcome your honesty. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

Let me read through the scenario again carefully.\n\nThe user is asking if they're a \"terrible person for considering giving back their adopted son.\" They went through adoption because the mother is infertile. The child was adopted from Haiti when he was three. Now he's six, and he has behavioral issues: violent tantrums, destructive behavior, aggression towards others and the parents. He's been in therapy for over a year and a half, and while he's better in therapy, he's acting out at home and school. He's been diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder, which isn't curable. The parents have tried various methods to manage his behavior but are struggling. The mother feels emotionally and physically exhausted and is considering giving him back. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to do this.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the circumstances. Adoption is a lifelong commitment, but the child has significant emotional and behavioral challenges that make parenting extremely difficult. The parents have tried multiple approaches and professional help. Reactive attachment disorder (RAD) is a serious condition where a child has difficulty forming emotional bonds, which can lead to the behaviors described. The child's actions are harmful, not only to the parents but also to others, and there's a risk of expulsion from school.\n\nThe parents are clearly distressed and have given the child every chance. They've invested time, resources, and effort into his well-being. The child's behavior is not only affecting the parents' well-being but also others, which could be a factor in considering the child's environment. However, the parents are considering giving him back, which might be due to their inability to cope further. The question is whether this decision is wrong.\n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, the parents are making a tough decision to protect their own well-being and possibly the child's if they can't provide the necessary environment. But giving him back might mean he's placed back into a system where he might not receive the same support, which could be worse for him. However, the parents are in a position where they can't provide the care needed, so it's a complex situation.\n\nI think the key points are that the parents have made every effort, the child has a severe disorder that isn't curable, and the parents are not at fault for the child's behavior. Their desire to return him could be seen as a last resort when all other options have been exhausted. The answer is probably B, the author is not in the wrong because they've done everything possible and are considering the child's and their own well-being.\n"
