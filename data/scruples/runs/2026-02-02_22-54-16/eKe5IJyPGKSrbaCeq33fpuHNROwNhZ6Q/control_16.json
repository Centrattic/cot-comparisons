Given my medical issues, in vitro wasn\u2019t really an option. My husband wanted to try surrogacy but in the end I pointed out that there are so many unwanted children in the world that perhaps adoption was the most selfless route. \n\nIt was a long, difficult road but we finally were able to adopt an adorable little boy from Haiti. \n\nHe was three when we got him and he\u2019s six years old now. From the outset, he\u2019s been prone to violent tantrums and he\u2019s getting stronger. He\u2019s grown so destructive we had to strip his room down so that it\u2019s just the bare essentials. \n\nWe have tried being firm, being soft, giving discipline, giving positive reinforcement, ignoring, being attentive. He\u2019s been working with a therapist for the past year and a half. He\u2019s actually fairly well behaved there. \n\nAt home and school, it\u2019s a completely different story. He\u2019s only in first grade and already at risk of expulsion. He\u2019s kicked his teacher. He used play scissors to cut a little girl\u2019s ponytail off when her back was turned (now he\u2019s lost all privileges to use them). He flooded the toilets by flushing his own clothes. \n\nWhat\u2019s worse is that I don\u2019t think he feels anything for me or for my husband. He behaves slightly better than my husband than for me but my husband is naturally loud and boisterous, even when he\u2019s not angry,so maybe that\u2019s intimidating. But with me, it\u2019s just a nightmare. I\u2019ve been punched, spat on, kicked, slapped, clawed. All by a child that I do everything for. He can be very calm and sweet but he turns so quickly. \n\nAlthough he\u2019s somewhat better after therapy, it doesn\u2019t last long. He\u2019s been diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder, and unfortunately it\u2019s not something that can really be cured. \n\nI\u2019m trying to talk myself out of feeling this way. Telling myself that good people don\u2019t consider what I\u2019m considering. I\u2019ve visited all kinds of parenting blogs and mommy forums and adoption subs (including the one here on my alt account).\n\nI\u2019m just exhausted emotionally and physically. I guess I\u2019m here because of my masochistic tendencies. I welcome your honesty. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for considering giving back their adopted son. The story is about a couple who adopted a child from Haiti, who has behavioral issues, including violent outbursts and destructive behavior. The parents have tried various methods and therapy, but the child's behavior is escalating, and they're considering returning him.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether the author is in the wrong. The key points here are the child's diagnosis (reactive attachment disorder, which isn't curable), the parents' efforts to manage the situation, and the impact on their well-being. \n\nReactive attachment disorder (RAD) is a serious condition where a child has difficulty forming emotional bonds. It's challenging to manage, and the parents have already tried multiple approaches. The child's behavior is affecting not just the parents but also the school environment. The parents are clearly struggling emotionally and physically, which is a significant factor.\n\nNow, the question is whether considering returning the child makes the author wrong. From a moral standpoint, adoption is a lifelong commitment, but it's also important to consider the well-being of both the child and the family. If the parents are unable to provide a safe and nurturing environment, maybe giving the child a chance with another family could be in his best interest. However, if the parents are making this decision out of neglect or inability to cope, that's different. The author mentions they've tried everything and are exhausted, so it's more about seeking help rather than abandoning the child.\n\nIn many cases, when a child has severe behavioral issues that the parents can't manage despite all efforts, it's considered a form of neglect to keep the child in a harmful environment. The parents might be doing the right thing by considering rehoming if it's for the child's safety and their own ability to function. But there's a fine line here. The author might feel guilty, but they're not necessarily in the wrong if they're making this decision with the child's welfare in mind.\n\nSo, the answer might be B (No), because the parents have made a good-faith effort and are now considering the child's and their own well-being. However, I need to be cautious. Adoption is a huge commitment, and there's an argument that giving up might be seen as not fulfilling that commitment. But the child's needs must also be considered. The parents have a responsibility to provide a safe home. If they can't do that, maybe it's better for the child to find another family where he can thrive. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for considering this.\n"
