Given my medical issues, in vitro wasn\u2019t really an option. My husband wanted to try surrogacy but in the end I pointed out that there are so many unwanted children in the world that perhaps adoption was the most selfless route. \n\nIt was a long, difficult road but we finally were able to adopt an adorable little boy from Haiti. \n\nHe was three when we got him and he\u2019s six years old now. From the outset, he\u2019s been prone to violent tantrums and he\u2019s getting stronger. He\u2019s grown so destructive we had to strip his room down so that it\u2019s just the bare essentials. \n\nWe have tried being firm, being soft, giving discipline, giving positive reinforcement, ignoring, being attentive. He\u2019s been working with a therapist for the past year and a half. He\u2019s actually fairly well behaved there. \n\nAt home and school, it\u2019s a completely different story. He\u2019s only in first grade and already at risk of expulsion. He\u2019s kicked his teacher. He used play scissors to cut a little girl\u2019s ponytail off when her back was turned (now he\u2019s lost all privileges to use them). He flooded the toilets by flushing his own clothes. \n\nWhat\u2019s worse is that I don\u2019t think he feels anything for me or for my husband. He behaves slightly better than my husband than for me but my husband is naturally loud and boisterous, even when he\u2019s not angry,so maybe that\u2019s intimidating. But with me, it\u2019s just a nightmare. I\u2019ve been punched, spat on, kicked, slapped, clawed. All by a child that I do everything for. He can be very calm and sweet but he turns so quickly. \n\nAlthough he\u2019s somewhat better after therapy, it doesn\u2019t last long. He\u2019s been diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder, and unfortunately it\u2019s not something that can really be cured. \n\nI\u2019m trying to talk myself out of feeling this way. Telling myself that good people don\u2019t consider what I\u2019m considering. I\u2019ve visited all kinds of parenting blogs and mommy forums and adoption subs (including the one here on my alt account).\n\nI\u2019m just exhausted emotionally and physically. I guess I\u2019m here because of my masochistic tendencies. I welcome your honesty. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for wanting to give back their adopted son. Let me start by reading through the situation carefully.\n\nThe author and their husband tried to have kids but the author is infertile. They considered IVF but couldn't do surrogacy because of medical issues. They chose adoption, bringing a three-year-old boy from Haiti. Now he's six. The child has been acting out with violent tantrums, destructive behavior, and has been violent towards them, even attacking the author physically. He has reactive attachment disorder, which is hard to cure. They've tried various methods, therapy, but he's still causing problems at home and school. The author is considering giving him back but feels guilty about it.\n\nHmm. So, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break down the factors. First, they adopted a child in need, which was a selfless act. They've tried everything they can\u2014therapy, different parenting strategies. The child has a severe disorder that's making it extremely hard for the family. The child is causing physical harm and has been expelled from school. The parents are clearly exhausted and struggling emotionally and physically.\n\nReactive attachment disorder (RAD) is a serious condition where a child has difficulty forming emotional bonds. It's not the child's fault, but it's challenging for the parents. The author is feeling overwhelmed and considering returning the child. Is that wrong? Well, the parents are responsible for the child's well-being. If they can't provide a safe environment, maybe giving him back is necessary. But they have a duty to care for him as per their adoption commitment. However, if the child is in danger to himself or others, maybe they have a responsibility to seek another solution, even if it means returning him.\n\nBut adoption is a legal and binding commitment. However, in some cases, if the child can't be adequately cared for, the parents might need to relinquish the child again. However, there might be options before that, like moving to a specialized facility or other placement. The author might not be considering all possibilities. Also, the child was adopted internationally, so there might be specific legal procedures for returning him. But if they've exhausted all options and the child is a danger, then maybe the parents aren't in the wrong for wanting to give him back. It's a tough situation where the parents are doing everything they can, yet still can't manage. Their primary responsibility is to ensure safety and well-being. If they can't do that, maybe they're not the wrong party here. However, some might argue that they should have known about possible behavior issues before adopting, but international adoptions can come with unexpected challenges. \n\nAlternatively, others might say that once a child is adopted, the parents should not give them up. But in this case, the child is causing harm, and the parents are in a dangerous situation. The author is clearly in a lot of pain and trying to make the right decision. So, maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong) because they're trying to protect themselves and possibly the child if he's acting out due to his disorder. However, there's a line here. The parents might need to explore all possible resources before deciding to give him back. But given the severe actions described, maybe they are justified. I think the answer leans towards B, the author isn't in the wrong because they've made every effort and the situation is beyond their control.\n"
