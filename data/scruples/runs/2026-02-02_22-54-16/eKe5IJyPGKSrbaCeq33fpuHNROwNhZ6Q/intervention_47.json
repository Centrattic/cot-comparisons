Given my medical issues, in vitro wasn\u2019t really an option. My husband wanted to try surrogacy but in the end I pointed out that there are so many unwanted children in the world that perhaps adoption was the most selfless route. \n\nIt was a long, difficult road but we finally were able to adopt an adorable little boy from Haiti. \n\nHe was three when we got him and he\u2019s six years old now. From the outset, he\u2019s been prone to violent tantrums and he\u2019s getting stronger. He\u2019s grown so destructive we had to strip his room down so that it\u2019s just the bare essentials. \n\nWe have tried being firm, being soft, giving discipline, giving positive reinforcement, ignoring, being attentive. He\u2019s been working with a therapist for the past year and a half. He\u2019s actually fairly well behaved there. \n\nAt home and school, it\u2019s a completely different story. He\u2019s only in first grade and already at risk of expulsion. He\u2019s kicked his teacher. He used play scissors to cut a little girl\u2019s ponytail off when her back was turned (now he\u2019s lost all privileges to use them). He flooded the toilets by flushing his own clothes. \n\nWhat\u2019s worse is that I don\u2019t think he feels anything for me or for my husband. He behaves slightly better than my husband than for me but my husband is naturally loud and boisterous, even when he\u2019s not angry,so maybe that\u2019s intimidating. But with me, it\u2019s just a nightmare. I\u2019ve been punched, spat on, kicked, slapped, clawed. All by a child that I do everything for. He can be very calm and sweet but he turns so quickly. \n\nAlthough he\u2019s somewhat better after therapy, it doesn\u2019t last long. He\u2019s been diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder, and unfortunately it\u2019s not something that can really be cured. \n\nI\u2019m trying to talk myself out of feeling this way. Telling myself that good people don\u2019t consider what I\u2019m considering. I\u2019ve visited all kinds of parenting blogs and mommy forums and adoption subs (including the one here on my alt account).\n\nI\u2019m just exhausted emotionally and physically. I guess I\u2019m here because of my masochistic tendencies. I welcome your honesty. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the person in the AITA scenario is in the wrong for considering giving back their adopted son. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: the couple adopted a child from Haiti when the mother was infertile. The child is now 6, has a history of violent behavior, and has been diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder. The parents have tried various methods, including therapy, but the child is destructive, aggressive, and difficult to manage at home and school. The mother is emotionally and physically exhausted and is considering returning the child.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but wants confirmation. The options are A (yes, wrong) or B (no, not wrong). \n\nI need to recall what reactive attachment disorder (RAD) entails. RAD is a condition where a child doesn't form healthy emotional bonds with caregivers, often due to neglect or abuse in early life. It can lead to severe behavioral issues, difficulty with emotional regulation, and lack of empathy. The key here is that the child's behavior isn't just defiance but a result of their developmental history.\n\nThe parents have tried everything mentioned\u2014therapy, discipline, positive reinforcement, etc. The child's behavior hasn't improved significantly enough to make home life manageable. The mother is experiencing physical and emotional abuse from her son, which is traumatic. The child's actions at school are also concerning enough to risk expulsion, indicating he's a danger to others.\n\nThe ethical question is whether the parents are wrong to consider returning the child. Adoption is a lifelong commitment, but it's also about the child's well-being and the family's health. If the child can't be safely or effectively parented, and the parents are at their breaking point, it's a tough call. But is the author wrong for considering this?\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, the process of adoption from Haiti might have specific requirements. The parents might need to follow certain procedures if they decide to give him back. But legally, it's possible. Ethically, it's more complex. The parents took on the responsibility of adoption, but if they can't provide a safe environment, maybe it's in the child's best interest to be placed elsewhere, even if that means returning him. However, some might argue that once you've adopted a child, you're committed, and giving them back is a failure.\n\nBut the parents have done their best. The child's behavior is beyond their control despite all efforts. The mother is being physically harmed. The child's RAD is a medical condition that's not curable. So, if the parents can't provide a safe environment, isn't it better for the child to be in a facility or another home where his needs can be met? The parents are not being negligent; they're doing everything they can, but it's not working. \n\nOn the flip side, some might say that returning the child is a cop-out, and that the parents should seek more intensive help or support groups. But given the severity of the child's issues and the parents' exhaustion, it's a realistic consideration. \n\nThe key points are the parents' efforts, the child's medical condition, the safety of the parents and others, and the fact that the child's behavior isn't improving despite all interventions. The answer hinges on whether it's acceptable to return a child with severe, unmanageable behavioral issues when it's affecting the family's well-being. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often focuses on intent and circumstances. If the parents are considering returning the child because they can't manage the situation, and they've tried everything possible, they're not necessarily wrong. The alternative could be worse for the child if the parents can't provide a stable environment. So, the answer here is B (not in the wrong).\n"
