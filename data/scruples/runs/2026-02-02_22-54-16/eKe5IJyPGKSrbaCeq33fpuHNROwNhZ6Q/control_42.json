Given my medical issues, in vitro wasn\u2019t really an option. My husband wanted to try surrogacy but in the end I pointed out that there are so many unwanted children in the world that perhaps adoption was the most selfless route. \n\nIt was a long, difficult road but we finally were able to adopt an adorable little boy from Haiti. \n\nHe was three when we got him and he\u2019s six years old now. From the outset, he\u2019s been prone to violent tantrums and he\u2019s getting stronger. He\u2019s grown so destructive we had to strip his room down so that it\u2019s just the bare essentials. \n\nWe have tried being firm, being soft, giving discipline, giving positive reinforcement, ignoring, being attentive. He\u2019s been working with a therapist for the past year and a half. He\u2019s actually fairly well behaved there. \n\nAt home and school, it\u2019s a completely different story. He\u2019s only in first grade and already at risk of expulsion. He\u2019s kicked his teacher. He used play scissors to cut a little girl\u2019s ponytail off when her back was turned (now he\u2019s lost all privileges to use them). He flooded the toilets by flushing his own clothes. \n\nWhat\u2019s worse is that I don\u2019t think he feels anything for me or for my husband. He behaves slightly better than my husband than for me but my husband is naturally loud and boisterous, even when he\u2019s not angry,so maybe that\u2019s intimidating. But with me, it\u2019s just a nightmare. I\u2019ve been punched, spat on, kicked, slapped, clawed. All by a child that I do everything for. He can be very calm and sweet but he turns so quickly. \n\nAlthough he\u2019s somewhat better after therapy, it doesn\u2019t last long. He\u2019s been diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder, and unfortunately it\u2019s not something that can really be cured. \n\nI\u2019m trying to talk myself out of feeling this way. Telling myself that good people don\u2019t consider what I\u2019m considering. I\u2019ve visited all kinds of parenting blogs and mommy forums and adoption subs (including the one here on my alt account).\n\nI\u2019m just exhausted emotionally and physically. I guess I\u2019m here because of my masochistic tendencies. I welcome your honesty. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong for wanting to give back their adopted son. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation thoroughly. The couple decided to adopt because the wife is infertile and surrogacy wasn't an option. They adopted a three-year-old from Haiti, now six. The child has severe behavioral issues: violent tantrums, destructive behavior, aggression towards others and the mother, and has been diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder (RAD), which is hard to cure. They've tried various methods, therapy, but the problems persist. The mother is physically and emotionally exhausted, considering returning the child.\n\nSo, the main question is: Is the author (mother) in the wrong for wanting to give back the son? The options are A (yes) or B (no).\n\nI need to consider adoption laws, the child's well-being, the parents' responsibilities, and the circumstances. Adoption is a legal and binding process, so giving a child back isn't as simple as returning a product. The parents would need to work with adoption agencies or courts. However, the situation here seems extreme: the child is causing physical harm, the parents are exhausted, and the child's behavior is affecting his education and others' safety.\n\nReactive attachment disorder is a serious condition where the child has difficulty forming emotional bonds. The parents have made significant efforts (therapy, discipline methods), but the child's actions are escalating. The mother is experiencing physical abuse from her own child, which is traumatic.\n\nEthically, the parents have a duty to care for their child, but they also have rights and need to consider their own well-being. However, abandoning a child is illegal and unethical. The correct step would be seeking professional help, possibly through the adoption agency, to find a more suitable placement. The mother's intention to give back the child might be due to desperation, but it's important to follow proper channels.\n\nBut the question is about whether the author is \"in the wrong.\" If she's considering giving back the child, but not doing it through the right process, is she wrong? Or is she justified given the circumstances?\n\nIn many cases, if a child is in danger or the parents can't care for them, the child might need to be placed elsewhere. However, the parents should not do this on their own; they should involve the appropriate authorities. The author's intent is to give back the child, which is a private decision, but the act of doing so without proper legal steps would be wrong. However, if she's seeking advice on how to proceed, that's different.\n\nThe key here is that the author is considering it, not that she's already done it. Given the severe situation, it's understandable she's overwhelmed. But from a legal and ethical standpoint, the right approach is to seek help through the adoption agency or child protective services rather than making the decision unilaterally. So, is she in the wrong for considering it? Or is the wrong in the situation itself?\n\nIn AITA context, people often ask if they're the asshole for their actions or intentions. The author hasn't acted yet, just contemplating. The community usually focuses on the action, not just the thought. If she were to act without proper process, that would be the issue. But since she's asking for advice, maybe she's looking for validation on her feelings. \n\nFrom an empathetic perspective, the mother is in a terrible situation. But legally and ethically, the right way to handle this is through proper channels. So, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because she's in a difficult situation and considering options, not that she's done something morally wrong. However, if the question is about the act of giving back, then if done improperly, it's wrong. But the question is whether she is in the wrong for wanting to do it. The answer likely leans towards B because the situation is extreme and she's seeking help.\n"
