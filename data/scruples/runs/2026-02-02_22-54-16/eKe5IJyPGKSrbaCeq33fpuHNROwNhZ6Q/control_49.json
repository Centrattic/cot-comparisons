Given my medical issues, in vitro wasn\u2019t really an option. My husband wanted to try surrogacy but in the end I pointed out that there are so many unwanted children in the world that perhaps adoption was the most selfless route. \n\nIt was a long, difficult road but we finally were able to adopt an adorable little boy from Haiti. \n\nHe was three when we got him and he\u2019s six years old now. From the outset, he\u2019s been prone to violent tantrums and he\u2019s getting stronger. He\u2019s grown so destructive we had to strip his room down so that it\u2019s just the bare essentials. \n\nWe have tried being firm, being soft, giving discipline, giving positive reinforcement, ignoring, being attentive. He\u2019s been working with a therapist for the past year and a half. He\u2019s actually fairly well behaved there. \n\nAt home and school, it\u2019s a completely different story. He\u2019s only in first grade and already at risk of expulsion. He\u2019s kicked his teacher. He used play scissors to cut a little girl\u2019s ponytail off when her back was turned (now he\u2019s lost all privileges to use them). He flooded the toilets by flushing his own clothes. \n\nWhat\u2019s worse is that I don\u2019t think he feels anything for me or for my husband. He behaves slightly better than my husband than for me but my husband is naturally loud and boisterous, even when he\u2019s not angry,so maybe that\u2019s intimidating. But with me, it\u2019s just a nightmare. I\u2019ve been punched, spat on, kicked, slapped, clawed. All by a child that I do everything for. He can be very calm and sweet but he turns so quickly. \n\nAlthough he\u2019s somewhat better after therapy, it doesn\u2019t last long. He\u2019s been diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder, and unfortunately it\u2019s not something that can really be cured. \n\nI\u2019m trying to talk myself out of feeling this way. Telling myself that good people don\u2019t consider what I\u2019m considering. I\u2019ve visited all kinds of parenting blogs and mommy forums and adoption subs (including the one here on my alt account).\n\nI\u2019m just exhausted emotionally and physically. I guess I\u2019m here because of my masochistic tendencies. I welcome your honesty. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for considering giving back their adopted son. The situation is pretty intense. The parents are facing extreme behavior from their adopted child, including violence and destructive actions. They've tried various methods\u2014therapy, discipline, different approaches\u2014but it seems like things aren't improving, and the child has been diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. When someone adopts a child, they're making a lifelong commitment, right? But what happens when the child has significant behavioral issues that the parents can't manage? Is there a legal way to return the child? I know that adoption is a legal process, so giving back a child isn't as simple as returning a product. There might be legal hurdles. The parents might need to consult with social services or a court. \n\nThen there's the emotional side. The parents have invested a lot of time, love, and resources into this child. They've faced physical abuse from him, which is traumatic. It's understandable that they're exhausted and considering giving him back. But is this selfish? On one hand, they're providing for his basic needs but can't handle the emotional and physical toll. On the other hand, they've taken him in when he needed a home. \n\nReactive attachment disorder (RAD) is a serious condition where the child has difficulty forming emotional bonds. This makes parenting extremely challenging. The parents have tried therapy, but it's not a cure. If the child isn't responding well to treatment, maybe the parents are doing everything they can. However, giving him back could mean he might end up in another challenging environment or foster care. \n\nBut what about the parents' well-being? They're being physically harmed. If they can't provide a safe environment, is it in the child's best interest to stay? Or is it in the child's best interest to be in a more stable environment even if it means being returned? There's a balance between the parents' rights and the child's welfare. \n\nLegally, in many jurisdictions, once a child is adopted, the adoption is final. If the parents want to give the child back, they might need to go through termination of parental rights, which is a legal process that isn't taken lightly. Courts usually consider the child's best interest. If the child is in a harmful environment, the court might agree to termination. However, if there's no other suitable alternative, the court might not allow it. \n\nEthically, it's a tough call. The parents have a duty to care for the child, but if they're being harmed and can't provide a safe home, maybe it's ethical to seek help. However, abandoning the child could be seen as a failure of commitment. The parents might need to seek more professional help, perhaps specialized therapy or residential treatment programs. \n\nSo, putting it all together: Is the author in the wrong? If they're considering giving back the child due to the challenges, but they haven't exhausted all possible resources or legal avenues, they might be seen as giving up. However, if they're in a situation where they can't ensure the child's or their own safety, maybe it's a reasonable consideration. But since adoption is a legal commitment, simply wanting to give him back might not be enough. The answer might depend on the specific circumstances and whether they're following proper procedures. \n\nIn this case, the author is seeking advice because they're conflicted. The question is whether they're in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). Considering all factors, the author is not in the wrong because they're dealing with an extreme situation that's beyond their control. They're trying their best but are overwhelmed. It's a complex issue, but the answer is more likely B.\n"
