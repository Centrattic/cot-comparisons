Given my medical issues, in vitro wasn\u2019t really an option. My husband wanted to try surrogacy but in the end I pointed out that there are so many unwanted children in the world that perhaps adoption was the most selfless route. \n\nIt was a long, difficult road but we finally were able to adopt an adorable little boy from Haiti. \n\nHe was three when we got him and he\u2019s six years old now. From the outset, he\u2019s been prone to violent tantrums and he\u2019s getting stronger. He\u2019s grown so destructive we had to strip his room down so that it\u2019s just the bare essentials. \n\nWe have tried being firm, being soft, giving discipline, giving positive reinforcement, ignoring, being attentive. He\u2019s been working with a therapist for the past year and a half. He\u2019s actually fairly well behaved there. \n\nAt home and school, it\u2019s a completely different story. He\u2019s only in first grade and already at risk of expulsion. He\u2019s kicked his teacher. He used play scissors to cut a little girl\u2019s ponytail off when her back was turned (now he\u2019s lost all privileges to use them). He flooded the toilets by flushing his own clothes. \n\nWhat\u2019s worse is that I don\u2019t think he feels anything for me or for my husband. He behaves slightly better than my husband than for me but my husband is naturally loud and boisterous, even when he\u2019s not angry,so maybe that\u2019s intimidating. But with me, it\u2019s just a nightmare. I\u2019ve been punched, spat on, kicked, slapped, clawed. All by a child that I do everything for. He can be very calm and sweet but he turns so quickly. \n\nAlthough he\u2019s somewhat better after therapy, it doesn\u2019t last long. He\u2019s been diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder, and unfortunately it\u2019s not something that can really be cured. \n\nI\u2019m trying to talk myself out of feeling this way. Telling myself that good people don\u2019t consider what I\u2019m considering. I\u2019ve visited all kinds of parenting blogs and mommy forums and adoption subs (including the one here on my alt account).\n\nI\u2019m just exhausted emotionally and physically. I guess I\u2019m here because of my masochistic tendencies. I welcome your honesty. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for considering giving back their adopted son. The author and her husband adopted a child from Haiti, but the child has behavioral issues, including violent outbursts and aggression towards them and others. They've tried various methods, therapy, etc., but the child is diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder, which is hard to cure. The author is emotionally and physically exhausted and contemplating returning the child.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Adoption is a lifelong commitment, and the challenges they're facing are significant. The child's behavior is harmful, including physical abuse. The author's feelings of being overwhelmed and considering giving the child back is a serious decision, but it's important to weigh their well-being and the child's needs.\n\nReactive attachment disorder (RAD) is a complex condition that affects the ability to form healthy attachments. It's often due to early neglect or trauma. The child might not have the capacity to bond in a typical way, which could lead to the behaviors described. The parents have tried multiple interventions, but the child's actions at school and home are concerning and could indicate a need for more specialized care or resources.\n\nThe author's main conflict is between their commitment to the child and their own well-being. They feel responsible for the child but are being physically harmed. It's a tough situation. Legally, they can't just give the child back unless there's a legal pathway, but emotionally, the author is struggling.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, some might argue that giving up on a child with such needs could be seen as abandonment, but others might understand the toll it's taking on the author and the family. The key here is whether the author is in the wrong for considering this. The question isn't about whether the parents are justified in returning the child, but if they're in the wrong for even considering it.\n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong. They've done everything possible, the situation is beyond their control, and they're prioritizing their own well-being after significant abuse. However, it's a complex issue. The answer might be B (No), but I need to make sure I'm not missing any angles. The parents might need to explore more options before making such a decision, but the author's feelings are valid given the circumstances.\n"
