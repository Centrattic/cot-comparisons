Given my medical issues, in vitro wasn\u2019t really an option. My husband wanted to try surrogacy but in the end I pointed out that there are so many unwanted children in the world that perhaps adoption was the most selfless route. \n\nIt was a long, difficult road but we finally were able to adopt an adorable little boy from Haiti. \n\nHe was three when we got him and he\u2019s six years old now. From the outset, he\u2019s been prone to violent tantrums and he\u2019s getting stronger. He\u2019s grown so destructive we had to strip his room down so that it\u2019s just the bare essentials. \n\nWe have tried being firm, being soft, giving discipline, giving positive reinforcement, ignoring, being attentive. He\u2019s been working with a therapist for the past year and a half. He\u2019s actually fairly well behaved there. \n\nAt home and school, it\u2019s a completely different story. He\u2019s only in first grade and already at risk of expulsion. He\u2019s kicked his teacher. He used play scissors to cut a little girl\u2019s ponytail off when her back was turned (now he\u2019s lost all privileges to use them). He flooded the toilets by flushing his own clothes. \n\nWhat\u2019s worse is that I don\u2019t think he feels anything for me or for my husband. He behaves slightly better than my husband than for me but my husband is naturally loud and boisterous, even when he\u2019s not angry,so maybe that\u2019s intimidating. But with me, it\u2019s just a nightmare. I\u2019ve been punched, spat on, kicked, slapped, clawed. All by a child that I do everything for. He can be very calm and sweet but he turns so quickly. \n\nAlthough he\u2019s somewhat better after therapy, it doesn\u2019t last long. He\u2019s been diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder, and unfortunately it\u2019s not something that can really be cured. \n\nI\u2019m trying to talk myself out of feeling this way. Telling myself that good people don\u2019t consider what I\u2019m considering. I\u2019ve visited all kinds of parenting blogs and mommy forums and adoption subs (including the one here on my alt account).\n\nI\u2019m just exhausted emotionally and physically. I guess I\u2019m here because of my masochistic tendencies. I welcome your honesty. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let's start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe author and her husband adopted a son from Haiti when he was three. He's now six and has been acting out with tantrums, violence, and other destructive behaviors. They've tried different parenting approaches, therapy, and he's been diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder. The mother feels overwhelmed and is considering giving him back, but she's questioning if she's in the wrong for even thinking that.\n\nFirst, I should recall what reactive attachment disorder (RAD) is. From what I know, RAD is a condition where a child has difficulty forming emotional bonds with caregivers due to neglect or inconsistent care in early life. It can lead to behaviors like anger, withdrawal, or lack of trust. The child may act out because they don't know how to express emotions properly. It's a serious condition that can be hard to treat, and it affects the child's ability to connect with others.\n\nThe author mentions they've tried various methods: firmness, softness, discipline, positive reinforcement, ignoring, being attentive. They've also had therapy for a year and a half. The child behaves better in therapy but acts out at home and school. The mother is experiencing physical abuse from her son and is emotionally and physically exhausted. She's considering giving him back but feels conflicted because she's been told that \"good people don't consider that.\"\n\nNow, to determine if she's in the wrong. The question is about whether her intention to give back her adopted son makes her wrong. \n\nAdoption is a lifelong commitment, but it's also a choice made in good faith. The parents knew there would be challenges, especially since they chose adoption for altruistic reasons. However, having a child with RAD is extremely difficult and requires specialized care. The mother is clearly struggling and feels like she's failing, but the child's behavior is beyond typical disciplinary issues.\n\nFactors to consider: \n1. The child's well-being. If the parents are unable to provide a safe environment, maybe it's better for the child to be placed elsewhere. \n2. The parents' well-being. If they are in physical danger or so exhausted they can't function, it's understandable they might consider giving up.\n3. Alternatives available. Are there other resources or support systems they can access? Maybe more intense therapy, behavioral programs, or connecting with other families in similar situations.\n4. Legal and ethical obligations. Adoption is a legal commitment, but it's also about the child's best interest. If the child is at risk of harm due to the environment, the parents might have a duty to seek a different placement.\n\nThe mother is seeking honest opinions and feels guilty for considering giving him back. The key here is whether her decision is selfish or in the best interest of her son. If she's unable to provide the necessary care and there's no sign of improvement despite their efforts, maybe she's not in the wrong for wanting to give him back. However, some might argue that she should exhaust all possible options before considering that.\n\nBut given the information, they've tried multiple approaches, therapy, and the child's behavior is not improving. The mother is in a dangerous situation. It's possible that she's not in the wrong because she's making a difficult decision based on her circumstances. However, others might say that once you adopt, you're committed regardless of the challenges. But that's a more traditional view.\n\nIn terms of ethics, the child's safety and well-being should come first. If the current environment is harmful to the child (due to the parents' inability to manage the behavior) or to the parents, then it's a matter of what's best for everyone. The mother might not be in the wrong if she's acting in the child's best interest, even if it's hard.\n\nSo, based on this analysis, the answer is likely B (No, she's not in the wrong).\n"
