Given my medical issues, in vitro wasn\u2019t really an option. My husband wanted to try surrogacy but in the end I pointed out that there are so many unwanted children in the world that perhaps adoption was the most selfless route. \n\nIt was a long, difficult road but we finally were able to adopt an adorable little boy from Haiti. \n\nHe was three when we got him and he\u2019s six years old now. From the outset, he\u2019s been prone to violent tantrums and he\u2019s getting stronger. He\u2019s grown so destructive we had to strip his room down so that it\u2019s just the bare essentials. \n\nWe have tried being firm, being soft, giving discipline, giving positive reinforcement, ignoring, being attentive. He\u2019s been working with a therapist for the past year and a half. He\u2019s actually fairly well behaved there. \n\nAt home and school, it\u2019s a completely different story. He\u2019s only in first grade and already at risk of expulsion. He\u2019s kicked his teacher. He used play scissors to cut a little girl\u2019s ponytail off when her back was turned (now he\u2019s lost all privileges to use them). He flooded the toilets by flushing his own clothes. \n\nWhat\u2019s worse is that I don\u2019t think he feels anything for me or for my husband. He behaves slightly better than my husband than for me but my husband is naturally loud and boisterous, even when he\u2019s not angry,so maybe that\u2019s intimidating. But with me, it\u2019s just a nightmare. I\u2019ve been punched, spat on, kicked, slapped, clawed. All by a child that I do everything for. He can be very calm and sweet but he turns so quickly. \n\nAlthough he\u2019s somewhat better after therapy, it doesn\u2019t last long. He\u2019s been diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder, and unfortunately it\u2019s not something that can really be cured. \n\nI\u2019m trying to talk myself out of feeling this way. Telling myself that good people don\u2019t consider what I\u2019m considering. I\u2019ve visited all kinds of parenting blogs and mommy forums and adoption subs (including the one here on my alt account).\n\nI\u2019m just exhausted emotionally and physically. I guess I\u2019m here because of my masochistic tendencies. I welcome your honesty. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person in the original post is in the wrong for considering giving back their adopted son. The situation is pretty intense.\n\nFirst, the parents adopted a child from Haiti. The child has been challenging from the start, with violent tantrums, destructive behavior, and even physical aggression. They've tried various methods\u2014therapy, discipline, positive reinforcement\u2014but it's not working well. The child has RAD, which I know is Reactive Attachment Disorder, a condition where kids have trouble forming emotional bonds. It's hard to treat, and the parents are at their breaking point.\n\nSo the question is, is the author (the parent) at fault for even thinking about returning the child? The options are A (yes, they're in the wrong) or B (no). \n\nI need to consider the context. Adopting a child is a big commitment, and these parents went through a lot to adopt, especially given the mother's infertility. They tried adoption as a selfless choice. Now, the child's behavior is causing them physical harm and emotional distress. The parents have exhausted many resources, including therapy, but progress is minimal. The child's actions are harmful and disruptive, not just at home but also in school.\n\nLegally, in some places, adoptive parents can return a child if the adoption was through an agency, but it's not always straightforward. Emotionally, it's a tough call. The parents are clearly suffering and feeling unsupported. RAD is a serious condition, and without the right support, it's hard for any parent to manage. \n\nBut is the parent in the wrong for considering this? Well, they've already done their best with therapy and different approaches. They're not giving up immediately; they've tried for years. The child's behavior is endangering others as well\u2014like cutting another girl's hair. The parents' safety is also a concern since they've been physically harmed. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that once you adopt, you're supposed to stick it out no matter what. But that's a bit simplistic. The well-being of both the child and the parents is important. If the child is in a situation where the parents can't meet their needs, maybe giving them back could be in the child's best interest, especially if there's a chance another family might handle it better. \n\nBut then again, returning a child can be traumatic for the child. However, the current environment is unsafe and harmful. The parents are clearly at their limit, and the child isn't getting the support they need. \n\nIn terms of ethics, it's a complex situation. The parents are not choosing this lightly; they've tried everything. They feel they're failing the child but also can't keep going. The key points are the severity of the child's actions and the lack of progress despite efforts. \n\nSo, I think the answer would be B (not in the wrong). They've done their best, and the situation is beyond their control. The parents' health and the child's behavior make it a difficult decision, and they're seeking advice because they're struggling. They aren't being negligent; they've tried various approaches. The disorder is a medical issue that's hard to manage, so expecting them to keep trying under these circumstances is unreasonable.\n"
