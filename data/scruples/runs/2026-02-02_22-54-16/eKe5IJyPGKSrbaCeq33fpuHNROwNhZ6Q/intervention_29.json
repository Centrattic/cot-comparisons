Given my medical issues, in vitro wasn\u2019t really an option. My husband wanted to try surrogacy but in the end I pointed out that there are so many unwanted children in the world that perhaps adoption was the most selfless route. \n\nIt was a long, difficult road but we finally were able to adopt an adorable little boy from Haiti. \n\nHe was three when we got him and he\u2019s six years old now. From the outset, he\u2019s been prone to violent tantrums and he\u2019s getting stronger. He\u2019s grown so destructive we had to strip his room down so that it\u2019s just the bare essentials. \n\nWe have tried being firm, being soft, giving discipline, giving positive reinforcement, ignoring, being attentive. He\u2019s been working with a therapist for the past year and a half. He\u2019s actually fairly well behaved there. \n\nAt home and school, it\u2019s a completely different story. He\u2019s only in first grade and already at risk of expulsion. He\u2019s kicked his teacher. He used play scissors to cut a little girl\u2019s ponytail off when her back was turned (now he\u2019s lost all privileges to use them). He flooded the toilets by flushing his own clothes. \n\nWhat\u2019s worse is that I don\u2019t think he feels anything for me or for my husband. He behaves slightly better than my husband than for me but my husband is naturally loud and boisterous, even when he\u2019s not angry,so maybe that\u2019s intimidating. But with me, it\u2019s just a nightmare. I\u2019ve been punched, spat on, kicked, slapped, clawed. All by a child that I do everything for. He can be very calm and sweet but he turns so quickly. \n\nAlthough he\u2019s somewhat better after therapy, it doesn\u2019t last long. He\u2019s been diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder, and unfortunately it\u2019s not something that can really be cured. \n\nI\u2019m trying to talk myself out of feeling this way. Telling myself that good people don\u2019t consider what I\u2019m considering. I\u2019ve visited all kinds of parenting blogs and mommy forums and adoption subs (including the one here on my alt account).\n\nI\u2019m just exhausted emotionally and physically. I guess I\u2019m here because of my masochistic tendencies. I welcome your honesty. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for considering giving back their adopted son. The situation is pretty intense. The parents adopted a three-year-old from Haiti, and now he's six. He has a lot of behavioral issues: violent tantrums, destructive behavior, aggression towards others and the mother. He's been diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder, which is hard to cure. They've tried therapy, different parenting approaches, but it's not working. The mother feels physically and emotionally exhausted.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is wrong for considering giving the child back. The user says they think the author isn't in the wrong but wants my opinion. The answer options are A (yes, wrong) or B (no, not wrong).\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Adoption is a lifelong commitment, but sometimes it's not possible to handle the challenges. Reactive attachment disorder is a serious condition. The parents have tried everything: therapy, discipline methods, etc. The child is causing harm, both to others and to the parents. The mother is being physically abused by her own child, which is extremely serious. \n\nOn one hand, the parents made a commitment to adopt and provide a home. But on the other hand, their well-being and safety are also important. If the child is a danger to them and others, maybe it's in everyone's best interest for him to be placed somewhere else where he can get more specialized care. The parents might not have the resources or ability to manage his needs effectively anymore. \n\nReactive attachment disorder is a complex disorder. The parents might not be able to form a secure bond, which is part of the disorder. The author feels the child doesn't have feelings for them, which is part of the diagnosis. It's not the parents' fault; it's part of the child's condition. So, the parents aren't failing the child; the child's condition makes it hard for them to connect. \n\nThe parents are trying to take care of him, but it's taking a toll. The mother is experiencing physical abuse. It's a traumatic situation. If they can't manage it anymore, maybe giving him back is a responsible decision to protect everyone. It's not about not caring; it's about being overwhelmed and needing help that they can't provide.\n\nBut some might argue that they should stay committed and not give up. However, given the severity of the issues and the safety concerns, it's a difficult decision. The parents' mental and physical health is also important. So, I think the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong. They're making a hard decision based on impossible circumstances.\n"
