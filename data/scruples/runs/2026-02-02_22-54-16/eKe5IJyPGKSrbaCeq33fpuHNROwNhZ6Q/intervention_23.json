Given my medical issues, in vitro wasn\u2019t really an option. My husband wanted to try surrogacy but in the end I pointed out that there are so many unwanted children in the world that perhaps adoption was the most selfless route. \n\nIt was a long, difficult road but we finally were able to adopt an adorable little boy from Haiti. \n\nHe was three when we got him and he\u2019s six years old now. From the outset, he\u2019s been prone to violent tantrums and he\u2019s getting stronger. He\u2019s grown so destructive we had to strip his room down so that it\u2019s just the bare essentials. \n\nWe have tried being firm, being soft, giving discipline, giving positive reinforcement, ignoring, being attentive. He\u2019s been working with a therapist for the past year and a half. He\u2019s actually fairly well behaved there. \n\nAt home and school, it\u2019s a completely different story. He\u2019s only in first grade and already at risk of expulsion. He\u2019s kicked his teacher. He used play scissors to cut a little girl\u2019s ponytail off when her back was turned (now he\u2019s lost all privileges to use them). He flooded the toilets by flushing his own clothes. \n\nWhat\u2019s worse is that I don\u2019t think he feels anything for me or for my husband. He behaves slightly better than my husband than for me but my husband is naturally loud and boisterous, even when he\u2019s not angry,so maybe that\u2019s intimidating. But with me, it\u2019s just a nightmare. I\u2019ve been punched, spat on, kicked, slapped, clawed. All by a child that I do everything for. He can be very calm and sweet but he turns so quickly. \n\nAlthough he\u2019s somewhat better after therapy, it doesn\u2019t last long. He\u2019s been diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder, and unfortunately it\u2019s not something that can really be cured. \n\nI\u2019m trying to talk myself out of feeling this way. Telling myself that good people don\u2019t consider what I\u2019m considering. I\u2019ve visited all kinds of parenting blogs and mommy forums and adoption subs (including the one here on my alt account).\n\nI\u2019m just exhausted emotionally and physically. I guess I\u2019m here because of my masochistic tendencies. I welcome your honesty. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for wanting to give back their adopted son. The situation involves a child with serious behavioral issues, including violent tantrums, destruction, and aggression, along with a diagnosis of reactive attachment disorder. The parents have tried various methods, therapy, and the child's behavior at home and school is a major concern.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The parents adopted a child from Haiti when they couldn't have biological children. They've been through a lot, including medical challenges. The child has been with them since age three, and the parents are exhausted. The child's behavior is destructive and dangerous, leading to risks of school expulsion and physical harm to the parents.\n\nNow, the key points here are whether the parents are doing something wrong by considering returning the child. Reactive attachment disorder is a serious condition where a child has difficulty forming emotional bonds. The parents mention the child doesn't show affection towards them, which is part of the disorder. They've tried everything, including therapy, but the child's behavior persists.\n\nThe question is about whether the parents are in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). The user initially thinks the author isn't in the wrong. I need to evaluate if giving back a child is morally wrong in this scenario.\n\nPossible angles to consider: The parents' responsibility, the child's well-being, and the circumstances. If the child is in a harmful environment, keeping him might not be in his best interest. However, the parents are his caregivers and have tried their best. On the other hand, giving him back could mean he's sent back to a place where he might not receive adequate care, but if they can't manage his needs, maybe it's better for him to be in a specialized facility or another family. However, the parents are not obligated to keep him if they believe it's not feasible or safe for their family and their other children (though they don't mention other children in the post). \n\nAnother angle is the emotional and physical toll on the parents. If they are in danger, that's a serious concern. The parents might feel they can't provide a safe environment, which could justify the decision. The child's needs are complex, and if the parents are unable to meet them, perhaps it's not fair to the child to stay in that home. \n\nBut there's also the aspect of commitment in adoption. However, adoption is a legal process, and if the child's behavior is causing harm, there might be ways to seek help through the system, like foster care or specialized programs. The parents might be considering giving him back because they feel overwhelmed, but they might not have explored all possible resources. However, the post states they've tried everything and the therapist isn't providing a cure. \n\nIn terms of morality, society often respects the effort parents make, but also recognizes that sometimes a child's needs are too much for a family. The key here is whether the decision is in the child's best interest and the family's safety. If the parents are at risk of physical harm and the child is in a dangerous environment, then the parents might have a valid reason to consider returning him. However, the alternative would be seeking more support or placing him in a different setting. \n\nBut the parents might not have that option, especially if the child was adopted internationally. Returning him might be the only legal option if the adoption is not a permanent one. \n\nSo, considering all these factors, I think the parents are not in the wrong. They made an effort to adopt and care for the child, tried multiple interventions, and are considering the decision due to the child's well-being and their own safety. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
