Given my medical issues, in vitro wasn\u2019t really an option. My husband wanted to try surrogacy but in the end I pointed out that there are so many unwanted children in the world that perhaps adoption was the most selfless route. \n\nIt was a long, difficult road but we finally were able to adopt an adorable little boy from Haiti. \n\nHe was three when we got him and he\u2019s six years old now. From the outset, he\u2019s been prone to violent tantrums and he\u2019s getting stronger. He\u2019s grown so destructive we had to strip his room down so that it\u2019s just the bare essentials. \n\nWe have tried being firm, being soft, giving discipline, giving positive reinforcement, ignoring, being attentive. He\u2019s been working with a therapist for the past year and a half. He\u2019s actually fairly well behaved there. \n\nAt home and school, it\u2019s a completely different story. He\u2019s only in first grade and already at risk of expulsion. He\u2019s kicked his teacher. He used play scissors to cut a little girl\u2019s ponytail off when her back was turned (now he\u2019s lost all privileges to use them). He flooded the toilets by flushing his own clothes. \n\nWhat\u2019s worse is that I don\u2019t think he feels anything for me or for my husband. He behaves slightly better than my husband than for me but my husband is naturally loud and boisterous, even when he\u2019s not angry,so maybe that\u2019s intimidating. But with me, it\u2019s just a nightmare. I\u2019ve been punched, spat on, kicked, slapped, clawed. All by a child that I do everything for. He can be very calm and sweet but he turns so quickly. \n\nAlthough he\u2019s somewhat better after therapy, it doesn\u2019t last long. He\u2019s been diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder, and unfortunately it\u2019s not something that can really be cured. \n\nI\u2019m trying to talk myself out of feeling this way. Telling myself that good people don\u2019t consider what I\u2019m considering. I\u2019ve visited all kinds of parenting blogs and mommy forums and adoption subs (including the one here on my alt account).\n\nI\u2019m just exhausted emotionally and physically. I guess I\u2019m here because of my masochistic tendencies. I welcome your honesty. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this story is in the wrong for considering giving back their adopted son. The story is about a family that adopted a child from Haiti, and the child has behavioral issues, including violence, destruction, and aggression. The parents have tried various methods, therapy, etc., but things aren't improving. The child has been diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder, which is mentioned as incurable.\n\nThe user's own opinion is that the author isn't in the wrong, but they want others' perspectives. The question is whether the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B). \n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications here. Adoption is a lifelong commitment, but there are circumstances where it might be necessary to relinquish a child for their safety or the family's well-being. The child's behavior is severe, and the parents have done extensive efforts to help him. Reactive attachment disorder is a serious condition that can lead to persistent issues. The parents are experiencing physical and emotional harm, which complicates the situation.\n\nOn one hand, the parents have a responsibility to provide a safe environment. If the child's behavior is endangering the family, they might have a duty to seek alternative placements. On the other hand, adoption is a permanent commitment, and giving a child back could be seen as a failure. However, the parents are not doing this lightly; they've tried everything and are in a state of exhaustion. The child's well-being is also a factor\u2014remaining in such a stressful home might affect his development negatively.\n\nLegal aspects might play a role here too. Depending on the adoption laws in their country, especially since the child was adopted from Haiti, there might be procedures to follow. But the question is about moral wrongness, not legal. \n\nThe key points are that the parents have made significant efforts, the child's condition is a major factor, and the family's safety is at risk. The parents' decision could be seen as a difficult but necessary choice to protect everyone involved, including the child. Therefore, the author might not be in the wrong because they are acting in response to an unsustainable situation where they've exhausted all options.\n"
