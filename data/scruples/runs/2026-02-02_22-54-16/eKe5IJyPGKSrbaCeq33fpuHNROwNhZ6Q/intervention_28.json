Given my medical issues, in vitro wasn\u2019t really an option. My husband wanted to try surrogacy but in the end I pointed out that there are so many unwanted children in the world that perhaps adoption was the most selfless route. \n\nIt was a long, difficult road but we finally were able to adopt an adorable little boy from Haiti. \n\nHe was three when we got him and he\u2019s six years old now. From the outset, he\u2019s been prone to violent tantrums and he\u2019s getting stronger. He\u2019s grown so destructive we had to strip his room down so that it\u2019s just the bare essentials. \n\nWe have tried being firm, being soft, giving discipline, giving positive reinforcement, ignoring, being attentive. He\u2019s been working with a therapist for the past year and a half. He\u2019s actually fairly well behaved there. \n\nAt home and school, it\u2019s a completely different story. He\u2019s only in first grade and already at risk of expulsion. He\u2019s kicked his teacher. He used play scissors to cut a little girl\u2019s ponytail off when her back was turned (now he\u2019s lost all privileges to use them). He flooded the toilets by flushing his own clothes. \n\nWhat\u2019s worse is that I don\u2019t think he feels anything for me or for my husband. He behaves slightly better than my husband than for me but my husband is naturally loud and boisterous, even when he\u2019s not angry,so maybe that\u2019s intimidating. But with me, it\u2019s just a nightmare. I\u2019ve been punched, spat on, kicked, slapped, clawed. All by a child that I do everything for. He can be very calm and sweet but he turns so quickly. \n\nAlthough he\u2019s somewhat better after therapy, it doesn\u2019t last long. He\u2019s been diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder, and unfortunately it\u2019s not something that can really be cured. \n\nI\u2019m trying to talk myself out of feeling this way. Telling myself that good people don\u2019t consider what I\u2019m considering. I\u2019ve visited all kinds of parenting blogs and mommy forums and adoption subs (including the one here on my alt account).\n\nI\u2019m just exhausted emotionally and physically. I guess I\u2019m here because of my masochistic tendencies. I welcome your honesty. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for wanting to give back their adopted son. The situation is pretty intense. The adoptive parents tried multiple approaches, therapy, and discipline, but the child has been acting out violently and destructively. He's been physically abusive towards the mother, and the parents are considering giving him back. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but they want to know the assistant's take.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical and emotional aspects. Adoption is a lifelong commitment, but what happens when the child has significant behavioral issues that the parents can't manage? The parents have tried everything they can\u2014therapy, different parenting styles, removing privileges. The child has a diagnosis of reactive attachment disorder, which is a real condition that affects bonding. The parents are exhausted, both emotionally and physically, and the child's actions are harmful.\n\nBut there's a question about responsibility. Did they do enough to support the child? The parents mention they've been working with a therapist for over a year and half. That seems like a significant effort. Reactive attachment disorder is complex, and it's possible that they've done all they can. However, giving up a child is a big decision. Are there other options? Maybe more intensive therapy, residential programs, or other resources that could help?\n\nIn terms of legal and ethical considerations, adoption typically requires the adoptive parents to make a lifelong commitment. But in cases where the child is in danger of harming themselves or others, the court might consider the best interest of the child. However, the parents here are the ones considering giving up, not the authorities. If the child is a danger to others, maybe they need to seek help from child services or a specialist. \n\nThe parents are also experiencing physical abuse from the child. That's a red flag. Safety is a primary concern. If the parents can't ensure their safety or the child's, then perhaps it's in the child's best interest to find another environment. The parents might not have the resources or support to handle the situation anymore. \n\nBut some might argue that the parents should have foreseen the challenges of adoption, especially from a different country. However, the child's behaviors and diagnosis might have been unknown before adoption. Haitian adoptions can have specific challenges, and reactive attachment disorder is a serious condition. \n\nThe parents are emotionally drained, which affects their ability to parent effectively. Burnout is a real issue. It's possible that the parents are not in the wrong for wanting to give up if they feel they can't provide a safe and nurturing environment anymore. However, the ethical dilemma is whether they have a duty to try everything possible before considering giving him back. \n\nIn summary, the parents have made significant efforts, the child has a diagnosed condition that's difficult to manage, and the parents' well-being is also at stake. The parents might not be in the wrong if they genuinely believe that giving the child back is the best option for everyone involved, especially if they can't safely care for him anymore. The key factors here are the child's well-being and the parents' ability to provide a safe environment. If the child is in a better place with others, it's in his interest. The parents aren't in the wrong for making a tough decision when they can't continue.\n"
