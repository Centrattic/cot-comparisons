Given my medical issues, in vitro wasn\u2019t really an option. My husband wanted to try surrogacy but in the end I pointed out that there are so many unwanted children in the world that perhaps adoption was the most selfless route. \n\nIt was a long, difficult road but we finally were able to adopt an adorable little boy from Haiti. \n\nHe was three when we got him and he\u2019s six years old now. From the outset, he\u2019s been prone to violent tantrums and he\u2019s getting stronger. He\u2019s grown so destructive we had to strip his room down so that it\u2019s just the bare essentials. \n\nWe have tried being firm, being soft, giving discipline, giving positive reinforcement, ignoring, being attentive. He\u2019s been working with a therapist for the past year and a half. He\u2019s actually fairly well behaved there. \n\nAt home and school, it\u2019s a completely different story. He\u2019s only in first grade and already at risk of expulsion. He\u2019s kicked his teacher. He used play scissors to cut a little girl\u2019s ponytail off when her back was turned (now he\u2019s lost all privileges to use them). He flooded the toilets by flushing his own clothes. \n\nWhat\u2019s worse is that I don\u2019t think he feels anything for me or for my husband. He behaves slightly better than my husband than for me but my husband is naturally loud and boisterous, even when he\u2019s not angry,so maybe that\u2019s intimidating. But with me, it\u2019s just a nightmare. I\u2019ve been punched, spat on, kicked, slapped, clawed. All by a child that I do everything for. He can be very calm and sweet but he turns so quickly. \n\nAlthough he\u2019s somewhat better after therapy, it doesn\u2019t last long. He\u2019s been diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder, and unfortunately it\u2019s not something that can really be cured. \n\nI\u2019m trying to talk myself out of feeling this way. Telling myself that good people don\u2019t consider what I\u2019m considering. I\u2019ve visited all kinds of parenting blogs and mommy forums and adoption subs (including the one here on my alt account).\n\nI\u2019m just exhausted emotionally and physically. I guess I\u2019m here because of my masochistic tendencies. I welcome your honesty. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for considering giving back their adopted son. The situation is pretty intense. The parents adopted a child from Haiti who has significant behavioral issues, including violence and destructive behavior. They've tried various methods, therapy, and the child has a diagnosis of reactive attachment disorder. The author is exhausted and contemplating giving the child back.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Adoption is a big commitment, and the parents made the decision with the best intentions, especially since they couldn't have biological children. They've put a lot of effort into parenting this child, tried multiple strategies, and even sought professional help. The child's behavior is severe enough that the parents are in physical danger and the child is at risk of being expelled from school. \n\nReactive attachment disorder is a serious condition where a child has difficulty forming emotional bonds. The parents mention that it can't really be cured, which means long-term challenges. The author is struggling with the emotional and physical toll, which is understandable. They're not doing this for selfish reasons; they adopted the child to provide a home, not to abandon him. \n\nI should also think about the legal and ethical aspects. Adoption is a legal process, and returning a child isn't as simple as giving them back. There might be legal procedures and the child's best interests to consider. However, the question is about whether the author is \"in the wrong,\" which is more about moral responsibility rather than legalities. \n\nThe parents have tried everything they can, and the child's behavior is beyond typical childhood tantrums. The author feels they can't handle it anymore, and the child doesn't seem to have any attachment to them. In such cases, it's possible that the child might need a different environment or specialized care that the parents can't provide. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that once you adopt a child, you're responsible for them. But given the circumstances\u2014especially the child's diagnosed condition and the extent of the parents' efforts\u2014it's a complex situation. The parents are not neglecting the child; they're overwhelmed. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. They made a decision based on their circumstances and the child's needs, even if it's a difficult one. The key points are the child's severe disorder, the parents' efforts, and the lack of improvement despite interventions. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
