Given my medical issues, in vitro wasn\u2019t really an option. My husband wanted to try surrogacy but in the end I pointed out that there are so many unwanted children in the world that perhaps adoption was the most selfless route. \n\nIt was a long, difficult road but we finally were able to adopt an adorable little boy from Haiti. \n\nHe was three when we got him and he\u2019s six years old now. From the outset, he\u2019s been prone to violent tantrums and he\u2019s getting stronger. He\u2019s grown so destructive we had to strip his room down so that it\u2019s just the bare essentials. \n\nWe have tried being firm, being soft, giving discipline, giving positive reinforcement, ignoring, being attentive. He\u2019s been working with a therapist for the past year and a half. He\u2019s actually fairly well behaved there. \n\nAt home and school, it\u2019s a completely different story. He\u2019s only in first grade and already at risk of expulsion. He\u2019s kicked his teacher. He used play scissors to cut a little girl\u2019s ponytail off when her back was turned (now he\u2019s lost all privileges to use them). He flooded the toilets by flushing his own clothes. \n\nWhat\u2019s worse is that I don\u2019t think he feels anything for me or for my husband. He behaves slightly better than my husband than for me but my husband is naturally loud and boisterous, even when he\u2019s not angry,so maybe that\u2019s intimidating. But with me, it\u2019s just a nightmare. I\u2019ve been punched, spat on, kicked, slapped, clawed. All by a child that I do everything for. He can be very calm and sweet but he turns so quickly. \n\nAlthough he\u2019s somewhat better after therapy, it doesn\u2019t last long. He\u2019s been diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder, and unfortunately it\u2019s not something that can really be cured. \n\nI\u2019m trying to talk myself out of feeling this way. Telling myself that good people don\u2019t consider what I\u2019m considering. I\u2019ve visited all kinds of parenting blogs and mommy forums and adoption subs (including the one here on my alt account).\n\nI\u2019m just exhausted emotionally and physically. I guess I\u2019m here because of my masochistic tendencies. I welcome your honesty. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to give back their adopted son. Let's start by breaking down the situation.\n\nFirst, the couple decided to adopt after facing infertility issues. They adopted a three-year-old from Haiti. The child has been challenging, with violent tantrums, destructive behavior, and even physical aggression towards the mother. They've tried various methods\u2014firmness, discipline, therapy\u2014but the behavior persists. The child has been diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder, which is hard to cure. The mother is emotionally and physically exhausted and is considering giving the child back. The question is whether she's in the wrong for considering that.\n\nNow, thinking about adoption and the responsibilities involved. Adoption is a lifelong commitment, right? But when a child has severe behavioral issues that can't be managed, is it wrong to consider returning them? On one hand, the parents have made a significant commitment, and the child needs stability. On the other hand, the parents' well-being and safety are important too. The mother is being physically harmed, which is a serious concern.\n\nReactive attachment disorder (RAD) is a real disorder where a child has trouble forming emotional attachments. It's a challenging condition to manage. The parents have tried everything\u2014therapy, discipline, different approaches. The fact that the child behaves better in therapy but worse at home and school suggests that the environment plays a role, but the parents have given it their all.\n\nBut there's also the ethical aspect. If the child is being harmed by being placed in a situation where the parents can't manage his needs, then maybe returning him to the adoption agency or finding another home could be better for him. However, the original intention was to provide a loving home, and giving him back could be seen as a failure. But is it wrong to prioritize their safety and mental health?\n\nI need to consider cultural and societal norms. In many places, adoption is considered a lifelong commitment, but there are also resources for families who struggle. Maybe the parents haven't explored all possible options, like more intensive therapy or specialized schools. However, the mother mentions that they've tried a lot already, and the child is at risk of expulsion from school despite their efforts.\n\nThe key points are the child's well-being versus the parents' ability to care for him. If the parents can't provide a safe environment, maybe it's in the child's best interest to be placed elsewhere. But the parents are feeling that they can't continue, which is a valid emotional response. The question is whether that makes them wrong.\n\nIn terms of legal and ethical responsibilities, when you adopt, you do take on a commitment, but there are also systems in place for when that commitment becomes unsustainable. The parents might need to seek professional help to evaluate all options before making a decision. However, the mother is clearly at her breaking point, and it's reasonable to consider her perspective.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The parents have given it their all, the child has a condition that's hard to manage, the parents are in a dangerous situation, and the mother's well-being is compromised. It's a tough situation, but considering the circumstances, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for considering returning the child. The answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
