Given my medical issues, in vitro wasn\u2019t really an option. My husband wanted to try surrogacy but in the end I pointed out that there are so many unwanted children in the world that perhaps adoption was the most selfless route. \n\nIt was a long, difficult road but we finally were able to adopt an adorable little boy from Haiti. \n\nHe was three when we got him and he\u2019s six years old now. From the outset, he\u2019s been prone to violent tantrums and he\u2019s getting stronger. He\u2019s grown so destructive we had to strip his room down so that it\u2019s just the bare essentials. \n\nWe have tried being firm, being soft, giving discipline, giving positive reinforcement, ignoring, being attentive. He\u2019s been working with a therapist for the past year and a half. He\u2019s actually fairly well behaved there. \n\nAt home and school, it\u2019s a completely different story. He\u2019s only in first grade and already at risk of expulsion. He\u2019s kicked his teacher. He used play scissors to cut a little girl\u2019s ponytail off when her back was turned (now he\u2019s lost all privileges to use them). He flooded the toilets by flushing his own clothes. \n\nWhat\u2019s worse is that I don\u2019t think he feels anything for me or for my husband. He behaves slightly better than my husband than for me but my husband is naturally loud and boisterous, even when he\u2019s not angry,so maybe that\u2019s intimidating. But with me, it\u2019s just a nightmare. I\u2019ve been punched, spat on, kicked, slapped, clawed. All by a child that I do everything for. He can be very calm and sweet but he turns so quickly. \n\nAlthough he\u2019s somewhat better after therapy, it doesn\u2019t last long. He\u2019s been diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder, and unfortunately it\u2019s not something that can really be cured. \n\nI\u2019m trying to talk myself out of feeling this way. Telling myself that good people don\u2019t consider what I\u2019m considering. I\u2019ve visited all kinds of parenting blogs and mommy forums and adoption subs (including the one here on my alt account).\n\nI\u2019m just exhausted emotionally and physically. I guess I\u2019m here because of my masochistic tendencies. I welcome your honesty. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole?) post is in the wrong. The situation is about a parent considering giving back their adopted son due to severe behavioral issues. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points of the story. The couple adopted a child from Haiti when the mother was infertile. The child, now six, has been violent and destructive, with diagnoses like reactive attachment disorder. They've tried various methods, therapy, but the behavior at home and school is extreme. The parent is feeling abused and is emotionally and physically exhausted, contemplating giving the child back.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nI should consider the ethical and emotional aspects here. Adoption is a lifelong commitment, but the situation described seems extremely challenging. The child's behavior is not only difficult but dangerous. The parent is being physically harmed\u2014punched, spat on, etc. Reactive attachment disorder is a serious condition, and it's mentioned it's not curable. \n\nThe parent has already sought professional help (therapist for 1.5 years), tried different parenting approaches, and the child's behavior hasn't improved. The school is at risk of expelling him, and he's only in first grade. The parent is clearly struggling and feels they can't go on like this. \n\nIs it wrong to consider giving the child back? It's a tough decision. On one hand, the parent made a commitment through adoption. On the other, the child's needs might be beyond what the parent can handle, and the parent's well-being is critical. Also, the child's behavior could be a result of his disorder and past trauma, not his fault. However, the parent's safety and mental health are also important. \n\nIn many cases, when a child's needs are too overwhelming and the parents can't provide the necessary care without harm to themselves or others, seeking alternative placements can be considered a responsible decision. The parent is not acting out of malice but out of exhaustion and inability to cope. The question is whether the parent is in the wrong for considering this. \n\nMost likely, the community would empathize with the parent's situation. They've tried everything, and the child's issues are severe. It's not that the parent is being selfish, but they might need to find a better environment for the child where he can get the specialized care he needs. So, the answer is probably B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
