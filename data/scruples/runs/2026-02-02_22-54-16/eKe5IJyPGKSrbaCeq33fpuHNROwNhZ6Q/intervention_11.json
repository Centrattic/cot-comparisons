Given my medical issues, in vitro wasn\u2019t really an option. My husband wanted to try surrogacy but in the end I pointed out that there are so many unwanted children in the world that perhaps adoption was the most selfless route. \n\nIt was a long, difficult road but we finally were able to adopt an adorable little boy from Haiti. \n\nHe was three when we got him and he\u2019s six years old now. From the outset, he\u2019s been prone to violent tantrums and he\u2019s getting stronger. He\u2019s grown so destructive we had to strip his room down so that it\u2019s just the bare essentials. \n\nWe have tried being firm, being soft, giving discipline, giving positive reinforcement, ignoring, being attentive. He\u2019s been working with a therapist for the past year and a half. He\u2019s actually fairly well behaved there. \n\nAt home and school, it\u2019s a completely different story. He\u2019s only in first grade and already at risk of expulsion. He\u2019s kicked his teacher. He used play scissors to cut a little girl\u2019s ponytail off when her back was turned (now he\u2019s lost all privileges to use them). He flooded the toilets by flushing his own clothes. \n\nWhat\u2019s worse is that I don\u2019t think he feels anything for me or for my husband. He behaves slightly better than my husband than for me but my husband is naturally loud and boisterous, even when he\u2019s not angry,so maybe that\u2019s intimidating. But with me, it\u2019s just a nightmare. I\u2019ve been punched, spat on, kicked, slapped, clawed. All by a child that I do everything for. He can be very calm and sweet but he turns so quickly. \n\nAlthough he\u2019s somewhat better after therapy, it doesn\u2019t last long. He\u2019s been diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder, and unfortunately it\u2019s not something that can really be cured. \n\nI\u2019m trying to talk myself out of feeling this way. Telling myself that good people don\u2019t consider what I\u2019m considering. I\u2019ve visited all kinds of parenting blogs and mommy forums and adoption subs (including the one here on my alt account).\n\nI\u2019m just exhausted emotionally and physically. I guess I\u2019m here because of my masochistic tendencies. I welcome your honesty. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person writing this is in the wrong. The situation is about an adopted son with behavioral issues, and they're considering giving him back. \n\nFirst, the parents went through a lot to adopt the child from Haiti. The child has been diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder, which makes him aggressive and difficult to manage. They've tried various methods like therapy, discipline, and even made changes at home, but the behavior continues. The parents are being physically harmed by the child. \n\nNow, the author is asking if they're in the wrong for wanting to give the child back. The options are A or B. \n\nOn one hand, adoption is a big commitment, and the parents chose this path because they wanted to be selfless. They might feel guilty about considering returning the child. But on the other hand, the child has significant emotional and behavioral issues that they can't manage, and the parents are being harmed. The child's well-being is also a factor\u2014maybe he needs a different environment or more specialized care.\n\nReactive attachment disorder is serious and can be challenging for even the most prepared parents. The parents have tried everything they can, including therapy, but the child's behavior doesn't improve. They're emotionally and physically exhausted. It's not about not caring; they do care, but maybe they can't handle the situation anymore. \n\nIs it wrong to prioritize their own well-being? The parents have a right to their safety and mental health. Also, the child might need a different setting where he can get the right support. The question is whether giving him back is the wrong decision. \n\nIn many cases, when a child's needs are too overwhelming for the adoptive family and proper resources aren't available, returning the child could be the right choice for everyone's safety. The parents might not be failing; the situation might be beyond their control. \n\nSo, considering all these points, the author is not in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
