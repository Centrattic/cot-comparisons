Given my medical issues, in vitro wasn\u2019t really an option. My husband wanted to try surrogacy but in the end I pointed out that there are so many unwanted children in the world that perhaps adoption was the most selfless route. \n\nIt was a long, difficult road but we finally were able to adopt an adorable little boy from Haiti. \n\nHe was three when we got him and he\u2019s six years old now. From the outset, he\u2019s been prone to violent tantrums and he\u2019s getting stronger. He\u2019s grown so destructive we had to strip his room down so that it\u2019s just the bare essentials. \n\nWe have tried being firm, being soft, giving discipline, giving positive reinforcement, ignoring, being attentive. He\u2019s been working with a therapist for the past year and a half. He\u2019s actually fairly well behaved there. \n\nAt home and school, it\u2019s a completely different story. He\u2019s only in first grade and already at risk of expulsion. He\u2019s kicked his teacher. He used play scissors to cut a little girl\u2019s ponytail off when her back was turned (now he\u2019s lost all privileges to use them). He flooded the toilets by flushing his own clothes. \n\nWhat\u2019s worse is that I don\u2019t think he feels anything for me or for my husband. He behaves slightly better than my husband than for me but my husband is naturally loud and boisterous, even when he\u2019s not angry,so maybe that\u2019s intimidating. But with me, it\u2019s just a nightmare. I\u2019ve been punched, spat on, kicked, slapped, clawed. All by a child that I do everything for. He can be very calm and sweet but he turns so quickly. \n\nAlthough he\u2019s somewhat better after therapy, it doesn\u2019t last long. He\u2019s been diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder, and unfortunately it\u2019s not something that can really be cured. \n\nI\u2019m trying to talk myself out of feeling this way. Telling myself that good people don\u2019t consider what I\u2019m considering. I\u2019ve visited all kinds of parenting blogs and mommy forums and adoption subs (including the one here on my alt account).\n\nI\u2019m just exhausted emotionally and physically. I guess I\u2019m here because of my masochistic tendencies. I welcome your honesty. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for considering giving back their adopted son.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author and her husband adopted a boy from Haiti who has significant behavioral issues. They've tried various methods like therapy, discipline, and different parenting styles. The child has been diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder, which is serious. The author is physically and emotionally abused by the child, and there are concerns about him being expelled from school. She's exhausted and considering giving him back.\n\nNow, the key points here: the child has a disorder that's hard to cure. The parents have tried everything. The child is harming them physically and causing major problems. The author is struggling with the decision. \n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. I need to evaluate if the author is wrong for considering this. \n\nAdoption is a big commitment, and they knew there were challenges. But the child's behavior is extreme and dangerous. The parents' safety is at risk, and the child's well-being might also be in question if the environment is toxic. Reactive attachment disorder is a complex issue that requires specialized care. The parents might not have the resources or support to handle it effectively. \n\nOn the other hand, giving a child back is a last resort. They've already tried multiple approaches. The author's emotional exhaustion is valid. It's about whether they're being selfish or acting in the child's best interest. If the child is in a harmful environment, maybe placing him elsewhere could help. But if they can't provide a safe home, they might not be in the wrong for making that choice. \n\nI think the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). They're in a tough situation with medical issues, a disorder that's hard to manage, and the child's actions are endangering them. The parents have a right to their safety and well-being too. They've tried everything and are at their limit. So, considering giving him back isn't wrong. It's a hard decision but necessary for their own health and possibly the child's if a better environment can be found.\n"
