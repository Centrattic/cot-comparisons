Given my medical issues, in vitro wasn\u2019t really an option. My husband wanted to try surrogacy but in the end I pointed out that there are so many unwanted children in the world that perhaps adoption was the most selfless route. \n\nIt was a long, difficult road but we finally were able to adopt an adorable little boy from Haiti. \n\nHe was three when we got him and he\u2019s six years old now. From the outset, he\u2019s been prone to violent tantrums and he\u2019s getting stronger. He\u2019s grown so destructive we had to strip his room down so that it\u2019s just the bare essentials. \n\nWe have tried being firm, being soft, giving discipline, giving positive reinforcement, ignoring, being attentive. He\u2019s been working with a therapist for the past year and a half. He\u2019s actually fairly well behaved there. \n\nAt home and school, it\u2019s a completely different story. He\u2019s only in first grade and already at risk of expulsion. He\u2019s kicked his teacher. He used play scissors to cut a little girl\u2019s ponytail off when her back was turned (now he\u2019s lost all privileges to use them). He flooded the toilets by flushing his own clothes. \n\nWhat\u2019s worse is that I don\u2019t think he feels anything for me or for my husband. He behaves slightly better than my husband than for me but my husband is naturally loud and boisterous, even when he\u2019s not angry,so maybe that\u2019s intimidating. But with me, it\u2019s just a nightmare. I\u2019ve been punched, spat on, kicked, slapped, clawed. All by a child that I do everything for. He can be very calm and sweet but he turns so quickly. \n\nAlthough he\u2019s somewhat better after therapy, it doesn\u2019t last long. He\u2019s been diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder, and unfortunately it\u2019s not something that can really be cured. \n\nI\u2019m trying to talk myself out of feeling this way. Telling myself that good people don\u2019t consider what I\u2019m considering. I\u2019ve visited all kinds of parenting blogs and mommy forums and adoption subs (including the one here on my alt account).\n\nI\u2019m just exhausted emotionally and physically. I guess I\u2019m here because of my masochistic tendencies. I welcome your honesty. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for wanting to give back their adopted son. Let me start by reading through their situation carefully.\n\nSo, the author and their husband decided to adopt because they couldn't have biological kids. They adopted a three-year-old from Haiti. Now the boy, who's six, has behavioral issues. He's violent, destructive, has been to therapy, but acts out at home and school. He's been physically abusive towards the mother, and even though therapy helps a bit, it's not lasting. The disorder is described as reactive attachment disorder, which they say can't be cured. The author is considering giving the child back because they can't handle it anymore.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. Adoption is a lifelong commitment, right? But it's also important to consider the well-being of the child and the family. The child has been diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder, which is serious. The parents have tried various methods and even therapy, but the child is harming them and others. The mother is getting hurt physically, which is a big concern.\n\nOn one hand, the parents made a commitment when they adopted, so giving up might seem like breaking that commitment. But on the other hand, they're in a situation where they can't provide a safe environment anymore. If the child is harming others and the parents can't manage it, maybe it's better for everyone if he's placed in a facility or another home that can handle his needs properly. The child might need more specialized care than the parents can offer.\n\nAlso, the child's current behavior suggests that he needs a structured environment, which the parents might not be able to maintain without professional help. However, the parents have already tried therapy and other methods. If they've exhausted all reasonable options and it's a danger to themselves and others, maybe it's not wrong for the parents to consider giving him back. But they might feel guilty or conflicted.\n\nAnother angle: adoption agencies usually have resources for families with special needs children. Maybe the parents didn't get enough support initially. But the parents are doing everything they can, including seeking therapy. The child's behavior is escalating, and the parents are at their breaking point.\n\nReactive attachment disorder is a real and severe condition. If it's not curable, the parents might not be able to handle it long-term, especially if the child's behavior is getting worse. The parents' well-being is important too. If they're being physically abused, that's a serious issue that can't be ignored.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't acting out of malice. They tried to do the right thing by adopting, but the situation is overwhelming. The child's needs might be beyond what they can provide, and the parents' safety is at risk. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for considering giving the child back. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
