Given my medical issues, in vitro wasn\u2019t really an option. My husband wanted to try surrogacy but in the end I pointed out that there are so many unwanted children in the world that perhaps adoption was the most selfless route. \n\nIt was a long, difficult road but we finally were able to adopt an adorable little boy from Haiti. \n\nHe was three when we got him and he\u2019s six years old now. From the outset, he\u2019s been prone to violent tantrums and he\u2019s getting stronger. He\u2019s grown so destructive we had to strip his room down so that it\u2019s just the bare essentials. \n\nWe have tried being firm, being soft, giving discipline, giving positive reinforcement, ignoring, being attentive. He\u2019s been working with a therapist for the past year and a half. He\u2019s actually fairly well behaved there. \n\nAt home and school, it\u2019s a completely different story. He\u2019s only in first grade and already at risk of expulsion. He\u2019s kicked his teacher. He used play scissors to cut a little girl\u2019s ponytail off when her back was turned (now he\u2019s lost all privileges to use them). He flooded the toilets by flushing his own clothes. \n\nWhat\u2019s worse is that I don\u2019t think he feels anything for me or for my husband. He behaves slightly better than my husband than for me but my husband is naturally loud and boisterous, even when he\u2019s not angry,so maybe that\u2019s intimidating. But with me, it\u2019s just a nightmare. I\u2019ve been punched, spat on, kicked, slapped, clawed. All by a child that I do everything for. He can be very calm and sweet but he turns so quickly. \n\nAlthough he\u2019s somewhat better after therapy, it doesn\u2019t last long. He\u2019s been diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder, and unfortunately it\u2019s not something that can really be cured. \n\nI\u2019m trying to talk myself out of feeling this way. Telling myself that good people don\u2019t consider what I\u2019m considering. I\u2019ve visited all kinds of parenting blogs and mommy forums and adoption subs (including the one here on my alt account).\n\nI\u2019m just exhausted emotionally and physically. I guess I\u2019m here because of my masochistic tendencies. I welcome your honesty. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a couple who adopted a son from Haiti when he was three. The child has been acting out with violent tantrums, destructive behavior, and even physical aggression towards the parents. He's been diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder, which is mentioned as not curable. The parents are considering giving him back.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what reactive attachment disorder (RAD) is. From what I know, RAD is a condition where a child has difficulty forming emotional attachments to caregivers. It often stems from neglect or inconsistent care in early years. The symptoms include withdrawn behavior or, in some cases, being overly clingy or having difficulty with social interactions. The article mentions that the child behaves better in therapy but acts out elsewhere. That could be part of RAD, as he might attach to the therapist due to consistency or specific therapeutic techniques.\n\nThe parents have tried various methods\u2014firmness, positive reinforcement, therapy. But the child's behavior is escalating. The physical abuse from the child is a serious issue. The parents are emotionally and physically exhausted. They're not looking for a quick fix but are considering returning the child because they believe it's in his best interest and theirs.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to give him back. In the U.S., adoption is a legal process, and depending on the circumstances, the parents might have legal avenues to either place the child back or seek other services. However, the ethical aspect is more complex. Adoption is a lifelong commitment, and the parents have already invested significant time and resources. But the child's well-being is also a factor. If the child is not receiving the care he needs due to the parents' inability to manage his behavior, is it morally right to keep him in a harmful environment?\n\nThe parents mention that they've tried everything. If therapy hasn't worked over 1.5 years and the child is in danger of expulsion from school, it suggests that the current environment isn't suitable. The parents are also being physically harmed, which adds another layer of concern for their safety. \n\nBut adoption is supposed to be permanent. The parents might feel like they're failing, but it's important to consider if they've exhausted all possible resources. Are there specialized programs or foster care services that could help? Sometimes, in such cases, the child might need a different placement where they can receive more targeted support. However, the parents might not have access to those resources due to financial or geographical constraints.\n\nEthically, the parents are in a difficult position. They did the right thing by adopting and trying to provide a stable home, but the child's behavior has exceeded their capacity to handle. The key here is whether their decision to give him back is out of self-preservation or the child's best interest. If it's the latter, they might not be in the wrong. If it's the former, it's a different story. However, the text suggests that the parents are considering it due to the child's well-being as well as their own inability to cope.\n\nIn many cultures, the expectation is that adoption is a lifelong commitment, but when a child's needs are beyond the parents' capacity, it's a tough call. The parents might not be in the wrong if they're seeking help through proper channels, like contacting adoption agencies or child welfare services, to find a better placement. However, if they're simply giving up without exploring other options, that could be seen differently.\n\nThe answer hinges on the balance between the parents' well-being and the child's needs. Since the child's current environment is causing harm to both parties and the parents have tried all avenues, it might be reasonable for them to seek another solution. Therefore, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong.\n"
