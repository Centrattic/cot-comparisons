Given my medical issues, in vitro wasn\u2019t really an option. My husband wanted to try surrogacy but in the end I pointed out that there are so many unwanted children in the world that perhaps adoption was the most selfless route. \n\nIt was a long, difficult road but we finally were able to adopt an adorable little boy from Haiti. \n\nHe was three when we got him and he\u2019s six years old now. From the outset, he\u2019s been prone to violent tantrums and he\u2019s getting stronger. He\u2019s grown so destructive we had to strip his room down so that it\u2019s just the bare essentials. \n\nWe have tried being firm, being soft, giving discipline, giving positive reinforcement, ignoring, being attentive. He\u2019s been working with a therapist for the past year and a half. He\u2019s actually fairly well behaved there. \n\nAt home and school, it\u2019s a completely different story. He\u2019s only in first grade and already at risk of expulsion. He\u2019s kicked his teacher. He used play scissors to cut a little girl\u2019s ponytail off when her back was turned (now he\u2019s lost all privileges to use them). He flooded the toilets by flushing his own clothes. \n\nWhat\u2019s worse is that I don\u2019t think he feels anything for me or for my husband. He behaves slightly better than my husband than for me but my husband is naturally loud and boisterous, even when he\u2019s not angry,so maybe that\u2019s intimidating. But with me, it\u2019s just a nightmare. I\u2019ve been punched, spat on, kicked, slapped, clawed. All by a child that I do everything for. He can be very calm and sweet but he turns so quickly. \n\nAlthough he\u2019s somewhat better after therapy, it doesn\u2019t last long. He\u2019s been diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder, and unfortunately it\u2019s not something that can really be cured. \n\nI\u2019m trying to talk myself out of feeling this way. Telling myself that good people don\u2019t consider what I\u2019m considering. I\u2019ve visited all kinds of parenting blogs and mommy forums and adoption subs (including the one here on my alt account).\n\nI\u2019m just exhausted emotionally and physically. I guess I\u2019m here because of my masochistic tendencies. I welcome your honesty. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for considering giving back their adopted son. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe author and their husband adopted a child from Haiti when he was three. He's now six. The child has been challenging with violent tantrums, destructive behavior, and has been physically abusive towards the mother. They've tried various approaches\u2014firmness, therapy, etc.\u2014but the problems persist. The child has Reactive Attachment Disorder (RAD), which is hard to cure. The author is considering giving him back and is seeking whether they're at fault for even thinking that.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the circumstances. Adoption is a lifelong commitment, but the child has significant behavioral issues that are impacting the family's well-being. The mother is experiencing physical abuse, which is a serious concern. RAD is a disorder that affects the ability to form healthy attachments, which might explain the child's behavior. However, the family has made efforts to support him through therapy and other methods, but it's not working.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? The question is about whether their intention to give the child back is wrong. On one hand, adoption is a legal and emotional commitment, so considering termination might seem like they're not fulfilling that commitment. However, the mother is being physically harmed, which is a safety issue. The child's well-being is also a factor\u2014if he's not getting the support he needs in this environment, maybe another placement could help him. But adoption should ideally be a permanent decision, so there's a conflict between the family's rights and the child's needs.\n\nIn some cases, children in care systems might be returned because the adoptive family can't meet their needs. However, the mother is clearly distressed and in a dangerous situation. The child's behavior is escalating, and even with professional help, it's not improving. So, it's a tough situation where both the family and the child are suffering.\n\nI think the key points here are the safety of the parents and the child. If the child is endangering the family, then the parents have a right to protect themselves. The mother is experiencing physical abuse, which is a red flag. While the child's needs are important, the family's safety is paramount. So, the author's consideration might not be in the wrong, as they're prioritizing their well-being and the child's potential benefit from a different environment. However, the decision is complex and should involve professionals to ensure the child is placed in a suitable home.\n\nSo, the answer would likely be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because they're facing an overwhelming situation that's affecting their safety and the child's well-being, and considering returning him isn't inherently wrong given the circumstances.\n"
