Given my medical issues, in vitro wasn\u2019t really an option. My husband wanted to try surrogacy but in the end I pointed out that there are so many unwanted children in the world that perhaps adoption was the most selfless route. \n\nIt was a long, difficult road but we finally were able to adopt an adorable little boy from Haiti. \n\nHe was three when we got him and he\u2019s six years old now. From the outset, he\u2019s been prone to violent tantrums and he\u2019s getting stronger. He\u2019s grown so destructive we had to strip his room down so that it\u2019s just the bare essentials. \n\nWe have tried being firm, being soft, giving discipline, giving positive reinforcement, ignoring, being attentive. He\u2019s been working with a therapist for the past year and a half. He\u2019s actually fairly well behaved there. \n\nAt home and school, it\u2019s a completely different story. He\u2019s only in first grade and already at risk of expulsion. He\u2019s kicked his teacher. He used play scissors to cut a little girl\u2019s ponytail off when her back was turned (now he\u2019s lost all privileges to use them). He flooded the toilets by flushing his own clothes. \n\nWhat\u2019s worse is that I don\u2019t think he feels anything for me or for my husband. He behaves slightly better than my husband than for me but my husband is naturally loud and boisterous, even when he\u2019s not angry,so maybe that\u2019s intimidating. But with me, it\u2019s just a nightmare. I\u2019ve been punched, spat on, kicked, slapped, clawed. All by a child that I do everything for. He can be very calm and sweet but he turns so quickly. \n\nAlthough he\u2019s somewhat better after therapy, it doesn\u2019t last long. He\u2019s been diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder, and unfortunately it\u2019s not something that can really be cured. \n\nI\u2019m trying to talk myself out of feeling this way. Telling myself that good people don\u2019t consider what I\u2019m considering. I\u2019ve visited all kinds of parenting blogs and mommy forums and adoption subs (including the one here on my alt account).\n\nI\u2019m just exhausted emotionally and physically. I guess I\u2019m here because of my masochistic tendencies. I welcome your honesty. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The person is asking if the author is in the wrong for considering giving back their adopted son. The author and their husband adopted a child from Haiti who has significant behavioral issues, including violence and aggression. They've tried various methods to manage his behavior, therapy, and it's clear they put a lot of effort into parenting him. However, the child has been diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder, which is a serious condition. The parent feels exhausted and is considering giving him back.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. Adoption is a big commitment, and sometimes it doesn't work out despite everyone's best efforts. The parent is considering giving the child back, which is a difficult decision. They mention they've tried everything and the child's behavior is causing them physical and emotional harm. The key points here are the well-being of the child and the parents. \n\nReactive attachment disorder (RAD) is a condition where a child has trouble forming emotional attachments. It's often due to neglect or abuse in early life, which can make parenting extremely challenging. The parent might feel that they can't provide the necessary care anymore, leading to the thought of giving the child back. But is this the wrong thing to do?\n\nOn one hand, the parent might feel they're failing the child if they can't manage his behavior. On the other hand, if the child isn't getting the support he needs, staying in a stressful environment could be harmful. However, the parent has already made significant efforts to help him. The question is whether giving him back is in his best interest or if there's a better solution.\n\nAdoption is a lifelong commitment, but sometimes it's necessary to make hard decisions for the child's sake. The parent might believe that another family or a specialized facility could provide better care. However, there's also the ethical consideration of breaking the bond they've formed. But given the child's condition and the parent's inability to manage, it might be in the child's best interest to be placed in a more suitable environment.\n\nThe parent isn't in the wrong because they're making this decision out of love and concern for the child's well-being, even though it's painful. They've tried everything possible and are exhausted. It's a difficult situation where both the parents and the child are suffering. The decision to give him back might be the most responsible choice to ensure the child gets the help he needs, even if it's hard for the parents. So, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
