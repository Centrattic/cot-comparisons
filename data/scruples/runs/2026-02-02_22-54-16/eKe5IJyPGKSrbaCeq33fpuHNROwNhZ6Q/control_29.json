Given my medical issues, in vitro wasn\u2019t really an option. My husband wanted to try surrogacy but in the end I pointed out that there are so many unwanted children in the world that perhaps adoption was the most selfless route. \n\nIt was a long, difficult road but we finally were able to adopt an adorable little boy from Haiti. \n\nHe was three when we got him and he\u2019s six years old now. From the outset, he\u2019s been prone to violent tantrums and he\u2019s getting stronger. He\u2019s grown so destructive we had to strip his room down so that it\u2019s just the bare essentials. \n\nWe have tried being firm, being soft, giving discipline, giving positive reinforcement, ignoring, being attentive. He\u2019s been working with a therapist for the past year and a half. He\u2019s actually fairly well behaved there. \n\nAt home and school, it\u2019s a completely different story. He\u2019s only in first grade and already at risk of expulsion. He\u2019s kicked his teacher. He used play scissors to cut a little girl\u2019s ponytail off when her back was turned (now he\u2019s lost all privileges to use them). He flooded the toilets by flushing his own clothes. \n\nWhat\u2019s worse is that I don\u2019t think he feels anything for me or for my husband. He behaves slightly better than my husband than for me but my husband is naturally loud and boisterous, even when he\u2019s not angry,so maybe that\u2019s intimidating. But with me, it\u2019s just a nightmare. I\u2019ve been punched, spat on, kicked, slapped, clawed. All by a child that I do everything for. He can be very calm and sweet but he turns so quickly. \n\nAlthough he\u2019s somewhat better after therapy, it doesn\u2019t last long. He\u2019s been diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder, and unfortunately it\u2019s not something that can really be cured. \n\nI\u2019m trying to talk myself out of feeling this way. Telling myself that good people don\u2019t consider what I\u2019m considering. I\u2019ve visited all kinds of parenting blogs and mommy forums and adoption subs (including the one here on my alt account).\n\nI\u2019m just exhausted emotionally and physically. I guess I\u2019m here because of my masochistic tendencies. I welcome your honesty. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for wanting to give back their adopted son. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation thoroughly. The parents adopted a 3-year-old boy from Haiti who is now 6. He has a history of violent behavior, has been diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder (RAD), and is causing issues at home and school despite therapy. The mother is experiencing physical abuse from the child and is emotionally and physically exhausted. \n\nReactive attachment disorder is a serious condition where a child has difficulty forming emotional bonds. The parents have tried various methods\u2014discipline, therapy, positive reinforcement\u2014but nothing seems to work consistently. The child behaves better in therapy but acts out at home and school. The mother feels the child doesn't care about her and is considering giving him back.\n\nNow, the ethical dilemma here is whether the parents are wrong to consider returning the child. On one hand, adoption is a lifelong commitment, and giving back a child might feel like a failure. On the other hand, the child's behavior is dangerous, and the parents are suffering. They might not have the resources or support to handle RAD effectively, and continuing might harm the child, the parents, and other children. \n\nI should consider the parents' intentions. They adopted with the best intentions, seeking to provide a home. If they are considering returning him because they can't cope, maybe they feel it's better for the child to find a home where he can get better support. However, there's also the aspect of breaking the bond they've formed, which is painful. \n\nThe fact that the child has RAD complicates things because it's a disorder that's hard to treat. The parents might not be at fault for his behavior; it's part of his diagnosis. But they are in a tough spot. Returning him could be seen as the right choice to protect themselves and possibly the child, who might need more specialized care.\n\nI need to check if there are any other factors. The parents have tried everything, including therapy. If there's no improvement and the situation is unsafe, it's reasonable to question if they should continue. But they also might face judgment for considering this, as society often stigmatizes people who can't handle adopted children. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? The answer would depend on whether their intention to seek a better environment for the child (and themselves) is justified. They might not be in the wrong, especially given the severity of the situation. However, some might argue that they should try harder or seek more help. But with RAD, and the current efforts, it might be a matter of realistic expectations. \n\nTherefore, the answer is likely B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
