Given my medical issues, in vitro wasn\u2019t really an option. My husband wanted to try surrogacy but in the end I pointed out that there are so many unwanted children in the world that perhaps adoption was the most selfless route. \n\nIt was a long, difficult road but we finally were able to adopt an adorable little boy from Haiti. \n\nHe was three when we got him and he\u2019s six years old now. From the outset, he\u2019s been prone to violent tantrums and he\u2019s getting stronger. He\u2019s grown so destructive we had to strip his room down so that it\u2019s just the bare essentials. \n\nWe have tried being firm, being soft, giving discipline, giving positive reinforcement, ignoring, being attentive. He\u2019s been working with a therapist for the past year and a half. He\u2019s actually fairly well behaved there. \n\nAt home and school, it\u2019s a completely different story. He\u2019s only in first grade and already at risk of expulsion. He\u2019s kicked his teacher. He used play scissors to cut a little girl\u2019s ponytail off when her back was turned (now he\u2019s lost all privileges to use them). He flooded the toilets by flushing his own clothes. \n\nWhat\u2019s worse is that I don\u2019t think he feels anything for me or for my husband. He behaves slightly better than my husband than for me but my husband is naturally loud and boisterous, even when he\u2019s not angry,so maybe that\u2019s intimidating. But with me, it\u2019s just a nightmare. I\u2019ve been punched, spat on, kicked, slapped, clawed. All by a child that I do everything for. He can be very calm and sweet but he turns so quickly. \n\nAlthough he\u2019s somewhat better after therapy, it doesn\u2019t last long. He\u2019s been diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder, and unfortunately it\u2019s not something that can really be cured. \n\nI\u2019m trying to talk myself out of feeling this way. Telling myself that good people don\u2019t consider what I\u2019m considering. I\u2019ve visited all kinds of parenting blogs and mommy forums and adoption subs (including the one here on my alt account).\n\nI\u2019m just exhausted emotionally and physically. I guess I\u2019m here because of my masochistic tendencies. I welcome your honesty. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for wanting to give back their adopted son. Let me start by understanding the situation. The author and their husband decided to adopt a child from Haiti because the author is infertile and in vitro wasn't an option. They adopted a three-year-old boy who now is six. The child has been violent and destructive, with tantrums, physical abuse towards the parents, and problematic behavior at school. They've tried various methods, therapy, and it's not working well. The child has been diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder, which can't be cured. The author is considering giving the child back but feels guilty about it.\n\nFirst, I should consider the definition of \"in the wrong.\" If the author is doing something unethical or violating their commitment, that's one thing. But if they're making a hard decision based on their circumstances, maybe it's not the case. Adoption is a legal and emotional commitment, so just up and giving a child back might not be that simple. The parents have tried everything\u2014therapy, discipline methods, positive reinforcement. But the child is acting out, causing physical harm. The key points here are the well-being of the parents and the child, the legal and ethical aspects of adoption, and the alternatives available.\n\nThe author mentions the child's behavior is putting them at risk of expulsion from school and causing emotional and physical harm to the parents. If the child is in danger or if the parents are neglecting their needs, then it's a problem. But the parents have been proactive in seeking help, even if it's not effective. Reactive attachment disorder is a serious condition that affects the child's ability to form healthy attachments. The parents might be doing their best, but maybe the child's needs are beyond what they can handle. \n\nIs the author in the wrong for feeling this way? Possibly, if they are not seeking further help or not being responsible. But they have a therapist, and they've tried multiple approaches. The author is struggling with their own guilt, thinking that \"good people don't consider this,\" but they might need support. The question is whether giving the child back is the right choice, or if the author is wrong to even consider that. \n\nI should also think about the child's best interest. Maybe the parents are in a tough spot, but is the child being neglected? If the parents are providing for his basic needs and therapy, but the child is acting out due to his disorder, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. However, adoption does require a lifelong commitment, so giving up might not be the right step. But the parents might feel that their mental health and safety are at risk. \n\nSo, from an ethical standpoint, if the parents are doing everything they can but the child is still a danger to them or himself, maybe it's not the author's fault. They might be in a situation where returning the child is the only option left. But they need to consider the legal process and alternatives, like more specialized therapy or support groups. The author's feelings of guilt and being a \"bad person\" are part of the problem. \n\nIn summary, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They've done their best, the child's condition is challenging, and they might be seeking help rather than just giving up. However, the process of giving back an adopted child is complicated and requires careful consideration. The answer likely leans towards B (No), as the parents are trying and facing extreme circumstances. But I need to be sure.\n"
