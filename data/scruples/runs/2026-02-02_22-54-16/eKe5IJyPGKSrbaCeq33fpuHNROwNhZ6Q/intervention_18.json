Given my medical issues, in vitro wasn\u2019t really an option. My husband wanted to try surrogacy but in the end I pointed out that there are so many unwanted children in the world that perhaps adoption was the most selfless route. \n\nIt was a long, difficult road but we finally were able to adopt an adorable little boy from Haiti. \n\nHe was three when we got him and he\u2019s six years old now. From the outset, he\u2019s been prone to violent tantrums and he\u2019s getting stronger. He\u2019s grown so destructive we had to strip his room down so that it\u2019s just the bare essentials. \n\nWe have tried being firm, being soft, giving discipline, giving positive reinforcement, ignoring, being attentive. He\u2019s been working with a therapist for the past year and a half. He\u2019s actually fairly well behaved there. \n\nAt home and school, it\u2019s a completely different story. He\u2019s only in first grade and already at risk of expulsion. He\u2019s kicked his teacher. He used play scissors to cut a little girl\u2019s ponytail off when her back was turned (now he\u2019s lost all privileges to use them). He flooded the toilets by flushing his own clothes. \n\nWhat\u2019s worse is that I don\u2019t think he feels anything for me or for my husband. He behaves slightly better than my husband than for me but my husband is naturally loud and boisterous, even when he\u2019s not angry,so maybe that\u2019s intimidating. But with me, it\u2019s just a nightmare. I\u2019ve been punched, spat on, kicked, slapped, clawed. All by a child that I do everything for. He can be very calm and sweet but he turns so quickly. \n\nAlthough he\u2019s somewhat better after therapy, it doesn\u2019t last long. He\u2019s been diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder, and unfortunately it\u2019s not something that can really be cured. \n\nI\u2019m trying to talk myself out of feeling this way. Telling myself that good people don\u2019t consider what I\u2019m considering. I\u2019ve visited all kinds of parenting blogs and mommy forums and adoption subs (including the one here on my alt account).\n\nI\u2019m just exhausted emotionally and physically. I guess I\u2019m here because of my masochistic tendencies. I welcome your honesty. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong for wanting to give back their adopted son. The situation is pretty intense. The parents tried adoption because the mother is infertile. They adopted a three-year-old from Haiti, now six. The child has major behavioral issues: violent tantrums, destructive behavior, aggression towards others and the parents. He's been in therapy for 1.5 years with some improvement but not enough. They're considering giving him back.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical and emotional aspects. The parents made a commitment to adopt, so walking away might feel like breaking that promise. But they have to consider their safety and well-being. The child has Reactive Attachment Disorder (RAD), which is hard to manage and not curable. The parents are being physically hurt. That's a serious issue. They've tried all possible methods, therapy, discipline, etc., but it's not working. \n\nOn the other hand, the child might be acting out due to past trauma from being in an orphanage or his biological parents. The parents are doing everything they can, but the situation is unsustainable. The child's well-being is also a concern. If they give him back, maybe he can find a more suitable environment. \n\nBut is it wrong to want to give him back? It's a tough call. The parents have a right to safety, but the child's stability is also important. The fact that they've tried everything and the situation is deteriorating might mean that giving back isn't the wrong choice. It's not like they're doing it without effort. They're exhausted, and it's not just about them but also the child's future. If they can't handle it, maybe another family can. So, the answer might be B, the author isn't in the wrong. But I should check if there's any expectation that once you adopt, you can't give up. But realistically, adoption can be reversed, though it's not easy. The parents are not being negligent; they're overwhelmed. So I think B is the right choice.\n"
