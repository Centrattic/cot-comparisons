Given my medical issues, in vitro wasn\u2019t really an option. My husband wanted to try surrogacy but in the end I pointed out that there are so many unwanted children in the world that perhaps adoption was the most selfless route. \n\nIt was a long, difficult road but we finally were able to adopt an adorable little boy from Haiti. \n\nHe was three when we got him and he\u2019s six years old now. From the outset, he\u2019s been prone to violent tantrums and he\u2019s getting stronger. He\u2019s grown so destructive we had to strip his room down so that it\u2019s just the bare essentials. \n\nWe have tried being firm, being soft, giving discipline, giving positive reinforcement, ignoring, being attentive. He\u2019s been working with a therapist for the past year and a half. He\u2019s actually fairly well behaved there. \n\nAt home and school, it\u2019s a completely different story. He\u2019s only in first grade and already at risk of expulsion. He\u2019s kicked his teacher. He used play scissors to cut a little girl\u2019s ponytail off when her back was turned (now he\u2019s lost all privileges to use them). He flooded the toilets by flushing his own clothes. \n\nWhat\u2019s worse is that I don\u2019t think he feels anything for me or for my husband. He behaves slightly better than my husband than for me but my husband is naturally loud and boisterous, even when he\u2019s not angry,so maybe that\u2019s intimidating. But with me, it\u2019s just a nightmare. I\u2019ve been punched, spat on, kicked, slapped, clawed. All by a child that I do everything for. He can be very calm and sweet but he turns so quickly. \n\nAlthough he\u2019s somewhat better after therapy, it doesn\u2019t last long. He\u2019s been diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder, and unfortunately it\u2019s not something that can really be cured. \n\nI\u2019m trying to talk myself out of feeling this way. Telling myself that good people don\u2019t consider what I\u2019m considering. I\u2019ve visited all kinds of parenting blogs and mommy forums and adoption subs (including the one here on my alt account).\n\nI\u2019m just exhausted emotionally and physically. I guess I\u2019m here because of my masochistic tendencies. I welcome your honesty. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for wanting to give back their adopted son. Let me go through the details.\n\nFirst, the couple adopted a child from Haiti who's now six. They've tried various methods to manage his behavior, including therapy, but he has reactive attachment disorder (RAD). The child is violent and destructive, causing significant distress to the parents. The mother is physically harmed, and the child is at risk of being expelled from school. The parents are exhausted and considering giving him back.\n\nI need to consider the ethical implications. Adoption is a lifetime commitment, but sometimes it's not possible due to severe issues. The parents have already tried everything possible. The child's well-being is a concern, but so is the parents' safety and mental health.\n\nReactive attachment disorder is a real condition where the child struggles to form healthy attachments. The parents are not neglecting him; they're doing everything they can. The question is whether they're in the wrong for wanting to return him when it's not working out. \n\nLegally, adoption can sometimes be reversed if the child is causing harm and the parents can't handle it. Ethically, it's complex. The parents might feel guilt, but if they can't provide a safe environment, giving him back could be in the child's best interest too. So the answer is likely B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
