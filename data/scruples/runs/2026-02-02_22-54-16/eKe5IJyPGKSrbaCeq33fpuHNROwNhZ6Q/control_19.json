Given my medical issues, in vitro wasn\u2019t really an option. My husband wanted to try surrogacy but in the end I pointed out that there are so many unwanted children in the world that perhaps adoption was the most selfless route. \n\nIt was a long, difficult road but we finally were able to adopt an adorable little boy from Haiti. \n\nHe was three when we got him and he\u2019s six years old now. From the outset, he\u2019s been prone to violent tantrums and he\u2019s getting stronger. He\u2019s grown so destructive we had to strip his room down so that it\u2019s just the bare essentials. \n\nWe have tried being firm, being soft, giving discipline, giving positive reinforcement, ignoring, being attentive. He\u2019s been working with a therapist for the past year and a half. He\u2019s actually fairly well behaved there. \n\nAt home and school, it\u2019s a completely different story. He\u2019s only in first grade and already at risk of expulsion. He\u2019s kicked his teacher. He used play scissors to cut a little girl\u2019s ponytail off when her back was turned (now he\u2019s lost all privileges to use them). He flooded the toilets by flushing his own clothes. \n\nWhat\u2019s worse is that I don\u2019t think he feels anything for me or for my husband. He behaves slightly better than my husband than for me but my husband is naturally loud and boisterous, even when he\u2019s not angry,so maybe that\u2019s intimidating. But with me, it\u2019s just a nightmare. I\u2019ve been punched, spat on, kicked, slapped, clawed. All by a child that I do everything for. He can be very calm and sweet but he turns so quickly. \n\nAlthough he\u2019s somewhat better after therapy, it doesn\u2019t last long. He\u2019s been diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder, and unfortunately it\u2019s not something that can really be cured. \n\nI\u2019m trying to talk myself out of feeling this way. Telling myself that good people don\u2019t consider what I\u2019m considering. I\u2019ve visited all kinds of parenting blogs and mommy forums and adoption subs (including the one here on my alt account).\n\nI\u2019m just exhausted emotionally and physically. I guess I\u2019m here because of my masochistic tendencies. I welcome your honesty. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for considering giving back their adopted son. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author and her husband adopted a child from Haiti when they couldn't have biological kids. The child is now 6, has been through therapy, but is causing a lot of problems at home and school. He's violent, destructive, and the author has been physically harmed. They've tried various approaches, but nothing seems to work long-term. The child has reactive attachment disorder, which is hard to cure. The author is considering returning the child but feels guilty about it.\n\nNow, the question is whether she's in the wrong. On one hand, parents have a responsibility to their child, and adoption is a lifelong commitment. On the other hand, the child's behavior is extremely harmful, and the parents are exhausted and in danger. \n\nI should consider the legal and ethical aspects. Legally, adoption can be reversed in some cases, though it's difficult. Ethically, the parents' well-being matters too. If the child is a danger to them, they might have a right to protect themselves. However, the child's best interest is a major factor. If returning him means he could end up in a worse situation, that's a problem. But if there's another family who can better meet his needs, maybe that's better for the child too.\n\nThe author is struggling with guilt, which is natural. Many people in similar situations feel they've failed. But the reality is that some children need specialized care that adoptive parents can't provide. It's not about being in the wrong; it's about making a hard decision for the well-being of everyone involved.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? I think not. They've made a commitment, but given the circumstances, seeking help for the child and themselves is reasonable. Choosing to return the child doesn't make them bad people, especially if it's for safety and better care. The answer is probably B (No).\n"
