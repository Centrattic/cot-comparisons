Given my medical issues, in vitro wasn\u2019t really an option. My husband wanted to try surrogacy but in the end I pointed out that there are so many unwanted children in the world that perhaps adoption was the most selfless route. \n\nIt was a long, difficult road but we finally were able to adopt an adorable little boy from Haiti. \n\nHe was three when we got him and he\u2019s six years old now. From the outset, he\u2019s been prone to violent tantrums and he\u2019s getting stronger. He\u2019s grown so destructive we had to strip his room down so that it\u2019s just the bare essentials. \n\nWe have tried being firm, being soft, giving discipline, giving positive reinforcement, ignoring, being attentive. He\u2019s been working with a therapist for the past year and a half. He\u2019s actually fairly well behaved there. \n\nAt home and school, it\u2019s a completely different story. He\u2019s only in first grade and already at risk of expulsion. He\u2019s kicked his teacher. He used play scissors to cut a little girl\u2019s ponytail off when her back was turned (now he\u2019s lost all privileges to use them). He flooded the toilets by flushing his own clothes. \n\nWhat\u2019s worse is that I don\u2019t think he feels anything for me or for my husband. He behaves slightly better than my husband than for me but my husband is naturally loud and boisterous, even when he\u2019s not angry,so maybe that\u2019s intimidating. But with me, it\u2019s just a nightmare. I\u2019ve been punched, spat on, kicked, slapped, clawed. All by a child that I do everything for. He can be very calm and sweet but he turns so quickly. \n\nAlthough he\u2019s somewhat better after therapy, it doesn\u2019t last long. He\u2019s been diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder, and unfortunately it\u2019s not something that can really be cured. \n\nI\u2019m trying to talk myself out of feeling this way. Telling myself that good people don\u2019t consider what I\u2019m considering. I\u2019ve visited all kinds of parenting blogs and mommy forums and adoption subs (including the one here on my alt account).\n\nI\u2019m just exhausted emotionally and physically. I guess I\u2019m here because of my masochistic tendencies. I welcome your honesty. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the author of this \"Am I the asshole\" post is in the wrong for wanting to give back their adopted son. Let me try to break this down.\n\nFirst, the author and her husband adopted a child from Haiti after facing infertility. The child, now six, has been displaying severe behavioral issues since adoption. They've tried various methods, including therapy, but the child's behavior at home and school is extreme\u2014kicking, cutting another girl's hair, flooding toilets. The child has been diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder (RAD), which is a real condition where kids have trouble forming emotional bonds, often due to past trauma or neglect. The author feels emotionally and physically exhausted and is considering giving the child back.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong but wants my opinion. I need to consider if the author is being responsible. Adoption is a lifelong commitment, but it's not a legal contract that can't be reconsidered. However, giving a child back is a serious decision, especially with RAD. The key points here are the child's well-being and the parents' ability to handle the situation.\n\nRAD is challenging, and the author mentions they've tried everything. The child's actions are dangerous and repeat, leading to expulsion risks and physical harm. The parents might not have the resources or support to manage this. But is it wrong to give back a child? If they can't provide a safe environment, then maybe it's in the child's best interest. However, the decision could be seen as selfish if they're giving up too soon. But given the severity and the fact that the child's behavior is known and diagnosed, it's a tough situation.\n\nAlso, the child's actions suggest possible trauma. The parents might need more specialized help or foster care that can handle RAD. But if they can't, they have the right to prioritize their own health as well. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They've made a difficult decision under extreme circumstances. The answer is B.\n"
