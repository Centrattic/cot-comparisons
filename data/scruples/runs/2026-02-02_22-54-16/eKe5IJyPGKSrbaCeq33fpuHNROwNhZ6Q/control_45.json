Given my medical issues, in vitro wasn\u2019t really an option. My husband wanted to try surrogacy but in the end I pointed out that there are so many unwanted children in the world that perhaps adoption was the most selfless route. \n\nIt was a long, difficult road but we finally were able to adopt an adorable little boy from Haiti. \n\nHe was three when we got him and he\u2019s six years old now. From the outset, he\u2019s been prone to violent tantrums and he\u2019s getting stronger. He\u2019s grown so destructive we had to strip his room down so that it\u2019s just the bare essentials. \n\nWe have tried being firm, being soft, giving discipline, giving positive reinforcement, ignoring, being attentive. He\u2019s been working with a therapist for the past year and a half. He\u2019s actually fairly well behaved there. \n\nAt home and school, it\u2019s a completely different story. He\u2019s only in first grade and already at risk of expulsion. He\u2019s kicked his teacher. He used play scissors to cut a little girl\u2019s ponytail off when her back was turned (now he\u2019s lost all privileges to use them). He flooded the toilets by flushing his own clothes. \n\nWhat\u2019s worse is that I don\u2019t think he feels anything for me or for my husband. He behaves slightly better than my husband than for me but my husband is naturally loud and boisterous, even when he\u2019s not angry,so maybe that\u2019s intimidating. But with me, it\u2019s just a nightmare. I\u2019ve been punched, spat on, kicked, slapped, clawed. All by a child that I do everything for. He can be very calm and sweet but he turns so quickly. \n\nAlthough he\u2019s somewhat better after therapy, it doesn\u2019t last long. He\u2019s been diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder, and unfortunately it\u2019s not something that can really be cured. \n\nI\u2019m trying to talk myself out of feeling this way. Telling myself that good people don\u2019t consider what I\u2019m considering. I\u2019ve visited all kinds of parenting blogs and mommy forums and adoption subs (including the one here on my alt account).\n\nI\u2019m just exhausted emotionally and physically. I guess I\u2019m here because of my masochistic tendencies. I welcome your honesty. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The question is whether they're at fault for considering giving back their adopted son. The situation is pretty intense. The parents adopted a child from Haiti who is now six and has been acting out with violent behavior\u2014tantrums, destructive actions at home and school, even physical abuse towards the parents. They've tried various methods to manage his behavior, therapy, but it's not working well enough. The child has reactive attachment disorder, which the parents mention is incurable.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parents' perspective. They adopted this child with the intention of providing a selfless home, but the child's behavior is causing them significant emotional and physical distress. The mother mentions being punched, spat on, kicked, etc. The father is more boisterous, which might make the child behave slightly better around him, but the mother is suffering. They've tried everything possible, but the child isn't responding adequately. The parents are exhausted and considering giving the child back, which is a huge decision.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong for considering this? Reactive attachment disorder (RAD) is a serious condition, but it's also a diagnosis that can be challenging for families. The parents have made a commitment to adoption, but they're facing extreme challenges. However, giving a child back is not a decision to be made lightly. The parents are in a tough spot where they might feel like they can't provide the environment the child needs, but the child might also not be in a good environment if given back. \n\nThere's a lot of factors to consider. The well-being of the child is important\u2014being in a home where the parents are suffering and the child isn't getting the support they need. On the other hand, the parents have done everything they can, including therapy, and it's not working. The question is whether they're at fault for wanting to give him back because they're not getting the emotional satisfaction from parenting or because they can't handle the situation. \n\nIn terms of ethical considerations, the parents have a responsibility to the child's best interests. If they feel they can't provide a safe and nurturing environment, then giving him back might be in his best interest. However, it's also possible that continuing to work through the challenges, even with the strain, is the right choice. But the parents are clearly at their breaking point. \n\nI should also consider that the child might benefit more from a different family setting where they can specialize in RAD. The parents might not have the resources or support to handle such a complex case. In that case, giving him back could actually be the right decision for the child's well-being. \n\nOn the flip side, giving him up might mean he ends up in another challenging situation, but it's also a chance for him to find a better fit. The parents are not in the wrong for prioritizing their own ability to provide care, especially when the current situation is unsustainable and harmful. \n\nSo, considering all factors, the author is not in the wrong for considering giving back the child, especially given the extreme circumstances and the child's needs. The parents have tried their best, and it's a difficult decision made out of necessity, not malice.\n"
