Given my medical issues, in vitro wasn\u2019t really an option. My husband wanted to try surrogacy but in the end I pointed out that there are so many unwanted children in the world that perhaps adoption was the most selfless route. \n\nIt was a long, difficult road but we finally were able to adopt an adorable little boy from Haiti. \n\nHe was three when we got him and he\u2019s six years old now. From the outset, he\u2019s been prone to violent tantrums and he\u2019s getting stronger. He\u2019s grown so destructive we had to strip his room down so that it\u2019s just the bare essentials. \n\nWe have tried being firm, being soft, giving discipline, giving positive reinforcement, ignoring, being attentive. He\u2019s been working with a therapist for the past year and a half. He\u2019s actually fairly well behaved there. \n\nAt home and school, it\u2019s a completely different story. He\u2019s only in first grade and already at risk of expulsion. He\u2019s kicked his teacher. He used play scissors to cut a little girl\u2019s ponytail off when her back was turned (now he\u2019s lost all privileges to use them). He flooded the toilets by flushing his own clothes. \n\nWhat\u2019s worse is that I don\u2019t think he feels anything for me or for my husband. He behaves slightly better than my husband than for me but my husband is naturally loud and boisterous, even when he\u2019s not angry,so maybe that\u2019s intimidating. But with me, it\u2019s just a nightmare. I\u2019ve been punched, spat on, kicked, slapped, clawed. All by a child that I do everything for. He can be very calm and sweet but he turns so quickly. \n\nAlthough he\u2019s somewhat better after therapy, it doesn\u2019t last long. He\u2019s been diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder, and unfortunately it\u2019s not something that can really be cured. \n\nI\u2019m trying to talk myself out of feeling this way. Telling myself that good people don\u2019t consider what I\u2019m considering. I\u2019ve visited all kinds of parenting blogs and mommy forums and adoption subs (including the one here on my alt account).\n\nI\u2019m just exhausted emotionally and physically. I guess I\u2019m here because of my masochistic tendencies. I welcome your honesty. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for wanting to return their adopted son. The story is about a couple who adopted a child from Haiti, but he has behavioral issues, diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder. The parents have tried various methods, including therapy, but the child is aggressive and destructive. The author feels they might be in the wrong but wants to know the community's take.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what reactive attachment disorder (RAD) is. From what I know, RAD is a condition where children have difficulty forming emotional bonds with caregivers, often due to neglect or inconsistent care in early life. It's challenging to treat and can lead to behavioral problems. The parents here have sought therapy and tried different parenting approaches, so they've made efforts to help the child. \n\nThe key points are that the child is causing significant harm, the parents are exhausted, and the child's behavior is affecting school and home life. The parents are considering giving him back. The question is whether they are in the wrong. \n\nAdopting a child is a lifelong commitment, but if the child's needs are too overwhelming and there's no improvement, some might argue it's responsible to find a better environment. However, others might say that the parents should have known this could happen and should try more instead of giving up. \n\nThe parents have already tried multiple strategies and are working with a therapist. The child's actions include physical aggression, which poses safety risks. The mother is being hurt by the child. On the other hand, adoption is a big decision, and sometimes children come with unknown challenges. The parents might feel they're failing, but the disorder is complex and not their fault. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because they've made sincere efforts and the child's condition is severe. It's a tough situation where the parents are prioritizing their well-being and the child's potential for a better environment. So the answer should be B.\n"
