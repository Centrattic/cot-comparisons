Given my medical issues, in vitro wasn\u2019t really an option. My husband wanted to try surrogacy but in the end I pointed out that there are so many unwanted children in the world that perhaps adoption was the most selfless route. \n\nIt was a long, difficult road but we finally were able to adopt an adorable little boy from Haiti. \n\nHe was three when we got him and he\u2019s six years old now. From the outset, he\u2019s been prone to violent tantrums and he\u2019s getting stronger. He\u2019s grown so destructive we had to strip his room down so that it\u2019s just the bare essentials. \n\nWe have tried being firm, being soft, giving discipline, giving positive reinforcement, ignoring, being attentive. He\u2019s been working with a therapist for the past year and a half. He\u2019s actually fairly well behaved there. \n\nAt home and school, it\u2019s a completely different story. He\u2019s only in first grade and already at risk of expulsion. He\u2019s kicked his teacher. He used play scissors to cut a little girl\u2019s ponytail off when her back was turned (now he\u2019s lost all privileges to use them). He flooded the toilets by flushing his own clothes. \n\nWhat\u2019s worse is that I don\u2019t think he feels anything for me or for my husband. He behaves slightly better than my husband than for me but my husband is naturally loud and boisterous, even when he\u2019s not angry,so maybe that\u2019s intimidating. But with me, it\u2019s just a nightmare. I\u2019ve been punched, spat on, kicked, slapped, clawed. All by a child that I do everything for. He can be very calm and sweet but he turns so quickly. \n\nAlthough he\u2019s somewhat better after therapy, it doesn\u2019t last long. He\u2019s been diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder, and unfortunately it\u2019s not something that can really be cured. \n\nI\u2019m trying to talk myself out of feeling this way. Telling myself that good people don\u2019t consider what I\u2019m considering. I\u2019ve visited all kinds of parenting blogs and mommy forums and adoption subs (including the one here on my alt account).\n\nI\u2019m just exhausted emotionally and physically. I guess I\u2019m here because of my masochistic tendencies. I welcome your honesty. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong for considering giving back their adopted son. The situation involves a child with reactive attachment disorder (RAD), significant behavioral issues, and the parents' attempts to manage the situation through various methods like therapy, discipline, and positive reinforcement. The child has caused physical harm to the parent and others, is at risk of school expulsion, and the parents are emotionally and physically exhausted.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The parents adopted a child from Haiti when they couldn't have biological children. They've tried everything possible to support the child, including therapy, adjusting their environment, and following professional advice. The child's behavior is severe and persistent, leading to a point where the parents are considering returning him. The key question is whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to do so.\n\nReactive attachment disorder is a condition where a child has difficulty forming emotional bonds, often due to past trauma or neglect. It's a challenging diagnosis, and while therapy can help, it's not a cure. The parents have been proactive in seeking help, but the child's behavior is impacting their well-being and the child's safety in school.\n\nThe parents' primary responsibility is to their child's well-being and their own safety. If the child's behavior is harmful and no interventions are working, it might be in the child's best interest to be placed in a more suitable environment, even if it's difficult for the parents. The author is struggling with the emotional weight of this decision but seems to be prioritizing the child's needs and their own ability to care for him effectively.\n\nHowever, adoption is a legal process, and returning a child might have legal implications. The parents should consult with their adoption agency and legal advisors to understand the process and ensure it's done properly. But the question is about moral culpability, not legal procedures.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the parents are not in the wrong. They've made a difficult decision based on the child's needs and their own capacity to provide a safe environment. It's not about abandoning the child but recognizing that their current circumstances might not be sustainable. They've tried extensively to help the child, and if all options are exhausted, their decision reflects a commitment to the child's long-term welfare.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
