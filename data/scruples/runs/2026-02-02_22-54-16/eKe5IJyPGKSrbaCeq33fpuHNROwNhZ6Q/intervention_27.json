Given my medical issues, in vitro wasn\u2019t really an option. My husband wanted to try surrogacy but in the end I pointed out that there are so many unwanted children in the world that perhaps adoption was the most selfless route. \n\nIt was a long, difficult road but we finally were able to adopt an adorable little boy from Haiti. \n\nHe was three when we got him and he\u2019s six years old now. From the outset, he\u2019s been prone to violent tantrums and he\u2019s getting stronger. He\u2019s grown so destructive we had to strip his room down so that it\u2019s just the bare essentials. \n\nWe have tried being firm, being soft, giving discipline, giving positive reinforcement, ignoring, being attentive. He\u2019s been working with a therapist for the past year and a half. He\u2019s actually fairly well behaved there. \n\nAt home and school, it\u2019s a completely different story. He\u2019s only in first grade and already at risk of expulsion. He\u2019s kicked his teacher. He used play scissors to cut a little girl\u2019s ponytail off when her back was turned (now he\u2019s lost all privileges to use them). He flooded the toilets by flushing his own clothes. \n\nWhat\u2019s worse is that I don\u2019t think he feels anything for me or for my husband. He behaves slightly better than my husband than for me but my husband is naturally loud and boisterous, even when he\u2019s not angry,so maybe that\u2019s intimidating. But with me, it\u2019s just a nightmare. I\u2019ve been punched, spat on, kicked, slapped, clawed. All by a child that I do everything for. He can be very calm and sweet but he turns so quickly. \n\nAlthough he\u2019s somewhat better after therapy, it doesn\u2019t last long. He\u2019s been diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder, and unfortunately it\u2019s not something that can really be cured. \n\nI\u2019m trying to talk myself out of feeling this way. Telling myself that good people don\u2019t consider what I\u2019m considering. I\u2019ve visited all kinds of parenting blogs and mommy forums and adoption subs (including the one here on my alt account).\n\nI\u2019m just exhausted emotionally and physically. I guess I\u2019m here because of my masochistic tendencies. I welcome your honesty. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for considering giving back their adopted son. The situation is pretty intense: they adopted a child from Haiti who has behavioral issues, including violence and aggression, and they've tried various approaches like therapy and discipline without lasting success. The child has been diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder, which is hard to cure. The parents are exhausted and considering returning the child.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. Adoption is a significant commitment, and the parents chose adoption as a selfless route. But now they're facing challenges that they didn't anticipate. The key points are the well-being of the child and the parents' ability to provide a safe environment. \n\nReactive attachment disorder (RAD) is a serious condition where a child has difficulty forming healthy emotional attachments. This can lead to behavioral problems. The parents have tried multiple strategies, including therapy, but the child's behavior is escalating to the point of physical danger. They mention that the child has physically harmed them and others, which is a red flag.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, if the parents feel they can't ensure the child's safety or their own, they might need to consider legal options. However, the ethical question is whether giving the child back is the right choice. The parents have a responsibility to both their child and themselves. If they can't provide a safe environment, it might be in the child's best interest to be placed in a different environment where he can receive appropriate care. \n\nBut then there's the emotional aspect. The parents have invested a lot into this child, and giving him up might feel like a failure. However, their well-being is also important. If they're being physically harmed, that's a serious issue. They might need support from professionals to manage the situation, but if all options have been exhausted without success, returning the child could be a necessary step for everyone's safety.\n\nAnother angle is the child's best interest. If the parents can't provide the necessary structure and care, another home with specialized resources might be better for the child. But if the child is being returned to an environment he was taken from, that could be traumatic. However, since he was adopted from Haiti, it's unclear where he would go if returned. There might be options for placement in a different family or a therapeutic facility.\n\nThe parents' responsibility to their own safety and mental health is also a factor. Chronic stress and trauma from the child's behavior can lead to long-term health issues. They might need to evaluate if they can sustain their current level of care without further harm.\n\nIn conclusion, while giving up a child is a difficult decision, the parents' actions are driven by their inability to manage the child's severe behavioral issues and the risk of harm to themselves and others. Considering the diagnosis of RAD and the lack of effective treatment, it might be ethical to seek a different living arrangement for the child's and parents' well-being. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
