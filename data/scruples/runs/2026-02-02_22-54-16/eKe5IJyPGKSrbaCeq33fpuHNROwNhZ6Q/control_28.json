Given my medical issues, in vitro wasn\u2019t really an option. My husband wanted to try surrogacy but in the end I pointed out that there are so many unwanted children in the world that perhaps adoption was the most selfless route. \n\nIt was a long, difficult road but we finally were able to adopt an adorable little boy from Haiti. \n\nHe was three when we got him and he\u2019s six years old now. From the outset, he\u2019s been prone to violent tantrums and he\u2019s getting stronger. He\u2019s grown so destructive we had to strip his room down so that it\u2019s just the bare essentials. \n\nWe have tried being firm, being soft, giving discipline, giving positive reinforcement, ignoring, being attentive. He\u2019s been working with a therapist for the past year and a half. He\u2019s actually fairly well behaved there. \n\nAt home and school, it\u2019s a completely different story. He\u2019s only in first grade and already at risk of expulsion. He\u2019s kicked his teacher. He used play scissors to cut a little girl\u2019s ponytail off when her back was turned (now he\u2019s lost all privileges to use them). He flooded the toilets by flushing his own clothes. \n\nWhat\u2019s worse is that I don\u2019t think he feels anything for me or for my husband. He behaves slightly better than my husband than for me but my husband is naturally loud and boisterous, even when he\u2019s not angry,so maybe that\u2019s intimidating. But with me, it\u2019s just a nightmare. I\u2019ve been punched, spat on, kicked, slapped, clawed. All by a child that I do everything for. He can be very calm and sweet but he turns so quickly. \n\nAlthough he\u2019s somewhat better after therapy, it doesn\u2019t last long. He\u2019s been diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder, and unfortunately it\u2019s not something that can really be cured. \n\nI\u2019m trying to talk myself out of feeling this way. Telling myself that good people don\u2019t consider what I\u2019m considering. I\u2019ve visited all kinds of parenting blogs and mommy forums and adoption subs (including the one here on my alt account).\n\nI\u2019m just exhausted emotionally and physically. I guess I\u2019m here because of my masochistic tendencies. I welcome your honesty. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong when considering returning their adopted son. The situation is pretty intense. The couple adopted a child from Haiti, and he has behavioral issues, including violence and aggression. They've tried various methods and therapy, but the child is still causing problems at home and school. The parents are exhausted and considering giving him back.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. Adoption is a legal process, so the parents have legal responsibility. But does that mean they must keep the child no matter what? The child has been diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder, which the parent mentions is not curable. The parents have tried their best with therapy and different approaches. They\u2019ve tried everything, but the child's behavior is escalating.\n\nThe parents are asking if they're in the wrong for even considering returning the child. The question is about whether they are morally or ethically in the wrong. The key points here are the parents' well-being, the child's needs, and the possibility of rehoming the child to a more suitable environment.\n\nOn one hand, the parents made a commitment when they adopted the child. They took on the responsibility of caring for him, and that's a big deal. But the situation is causing them physical harm and extreme stress. They might not be providing the environment the child needs, especially if the child's issues are beyond their ability to handle. The child might benefit from another family better equipped to manage his specific needs.\n\nOn the other hand, giving the child back could be seen as abandoning him, especially considering he's from a different country. There might be legal complexities in returning an adopted child, and the parents might feel they have a duty to stick it out. However, if the parents are at risk of harm and the child isn't thriving, maybe it's in the child's best interest to find a more suitable home.\n\nThe parents are also considering their own mental health. Chronic stress and physical abuse from a child can lead to long-term psychological issues. It's important to prioritize their safety and well-being. If they can't provide a safe environment, it's not fair to the child either.\n\nReactive attachment disorder is a serious condition that requires specialized care. If the parents are not able to access that or if the child's behaviors are too much, returning him might be the ethical choice to ensure he gets the help he needs. The parents might not have the resources or capacity to manage his needs effectively.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the parents aren't in the wrong for considering this. They've made a good faith effort and are now recognizing that their limits are being pushed beyond what they can handle. It's a tough situation, but their well-being and the child's welfare should be considered. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
