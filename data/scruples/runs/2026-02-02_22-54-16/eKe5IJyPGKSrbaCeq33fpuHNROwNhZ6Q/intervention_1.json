Given my medical issues, in vitro wasn\u2019t really an option. My husband wanted to try surrogacy but in the end I pointed out that there are so many unwanted children in the world that perhaps adoption was the most selfless route. \n\nIt was a long, difficult road but we finally were able to adopt an adorable little boy from Haiti. \n\nHe was three when we got him and he\u2019s six years old now. From the outset, he\u2019s been prone to violent tantrums and he\u2019s getting stronger. He\u2019s grown so destructive we had to strip his room down so that it\u2019s just the bare essentials. \n\nWe have tried being firm, being soft, giving discipline, giving positive reinforcement, ignoring, being attentive. He\u2019s been working with a therapist for the past year and a half. He\u2019s actually fairly well behaved there. \n\nAt home and school, it\u2019s a completely different story. He\u2019s only in first grade and already at risk of expulsion. He\u2019s kicked his teacher. He used play scissors to cut a little girl\u2019s ponytail off when her back was turned (now he\u2019s lost all privileges to use them). He flooded the toilets by flushing his own clothes. \n\nWhat\u2019s worse is that I don\u2019t think he feels anything for me or for my husband. He behaves slightly better than my husband than for me but my husband is naturally loud and boisterous, even when he\u2019s not angry,so maybe that\u2019s intimidating. But with me, it\u2019s just a nightmare. I\u2019ve been punched, spat on, kicked, slapped, clawed. All by a child that I do everything for. He can be very calm and sweet but he turns so quickly. \n\nAlthough he\u2019s somewhat better after therapy, it doesn\u2019t last long. He\u2019s been diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder, and unfortunately it\u2019s not something that can really be cured. \n\nI\u2019m trying to talk myself out of feeling this way. Telling myself that good people don\u2019t consider what I\u2019m considering. I\u2019ve visited all kinds of parenting blogs and mommy forums and adoption subs (including the one here on my alt account).\n\nI\u2019m just exhausted emotionally and physically. I guess I\u2019m here because of my masochistic tendencies. I welcome your honesty. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The person is asking if the author is in the wrong for considering returning their adopted son. The situation is pretty intense. They've adopted a child from Haiti, and he has Reactive Attachment Disorder (RAD), which makes it really hard to bond and causes behavioral issues. The child is violent towards the parents and others, and even though they've tried therapy and different approaches, the behavior is getting worse.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Adoption is a big commitment, especially when there are special needs involved. RAD is a serious condition that affects how a child forms attachments. The parents have tried multiple strategies, including therapy and discipline methods. The child's actions are dangerous\u2014kicking teachers, cutting another child's hair, flooding toilets, and physical abuse towards the mother. These are not just typical childhood misbehaviors but serious issues that impact safety and well-being.\n\nThe parents are exhausted both emotionally and physically. They mention that they've tried to convince themselves not to consider giving the child back, but they're struggling. The question is whether they're in the wrong for considering this. \n\nOn one hand, some people might argue that adoption is a lifelong commitment, and giving up could be seen as abandoning a child in need. On the other hand, the parents' safety and mental health are also important. If the child's behavior is so severe that it's causing harm, then maybe it's a matter of whether they can provide the necessary support. The parents have already invested a lot, but if the child's needs are beyond their capacity, they might need help, not blame.\n\nReactive Attachment Disorder is a diagnosis that can make it difficult for a child to form healthy attachments. The parents might not be doing anything wrong; the child's behavior stems from his disorder. In such cases, professionals might recommend specialized care or placement that can better handle the child's needs. That doesn't mean the parents are in the wrong for considering it if they feel they can't provide the necessary care anymore.\n\nI should also consider that the parents have already sought help through therapy and are trying their best. The key here is whether they are at fault for their feelings of being overwhelmed. It's important to recognize that sometimes people reach their limits, and that doesn't make them bad parents. The author might feel guilty, but if the situation is beyond their ability to handle, then they aren't necessarily in the wrong. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer is likely B (No), the author is not in the wrong because they are dealing with a child's severe conditions that are impacting their family's well-being, and their consideration of returning the child is a response to an unsustainable situation, not a failure on their part.\n"
