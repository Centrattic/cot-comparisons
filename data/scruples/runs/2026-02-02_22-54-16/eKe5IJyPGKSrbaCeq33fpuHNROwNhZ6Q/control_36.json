Given my medical issues, in vitro wasn\u2019t really an option. My husband wanted to try surrogacy but in the end I pointed out that there are so many unwanted children in the world that perhaps adoption was the most selfless route. \n\nIt was a long, difficult road but we finally were able to adopt an adorable little boy from Haiti. \n\nHe was three when we got him and he\u2019s six years old now. From the outset, he\u2019s been prone to violent tantrums and he\u2019s getting stronger. He\u2019s grown so destructive we had to strip his room down so that it\u2019s just the bare essentials. \n\nWe have tried being firm, being soft, giving discipline, giving positive reinforcement, ignoring, being attentive. He\u2019s been working with a therapist for the past year and a half. He\u2019s actually fairly well behaved there. \n\nAt home and school, it\u2019s a completely different story. He\u2019s only in first grade and already at risk of expulsion. He\u2019s kicked his teacher. He used play scissors to cut a little girl\u2019s ponytail off when her back was turned (now he\u2019s lost all privileges to use them). He flooded the toilets by flushing his own clothes. \n\nWhat\u2019s worse is that I don\u2019t think he feels anything for me or for my husband. He behaves slightly better than my husband than for me but my husband is naturally loud and boisterous, even when he\u2019s not angry,so maybe that\u2019s intimidating. But with me, it\u2019s just a nightmare. I\u2019ve been punched, spat on, kicked, slapped, clawed. All by a child that I do everything for. He can be very calm and sweet but he turns so quickly. \n\nAlthough he\u2019s somewhat better after therapy, it doesn\u2019t last long. He\u2019s been diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder, and unfortunately it\u2019s not something that can really be cured. \n\nI\u2019m trying to talk myself out of feeling this way. Telling myself that good people don\u2019t consider what I\u2019m considering. I\u2019ve visited all kinds of parenting blogs and mommy forums and adoption subs (including the one here on my alt account).\n\nI\u2019m just exhausted emotionally and physically. I guess I\u2019m here because of my masochistic tendencies. I welcome your honesty. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for considering giving back their adopted son.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author and husband adopted a child from Haiti who is now 6. The child has Reactive Attachment Disorder (RAD), which makes it hard for him to form emotional bonds. He has behavioral issues like violence, destruction, and aggression. They've tried various methods, therapy, etc., but it's not working. The author is considering giving the child back because they're exhausted.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). I need to evaluate this based on ethical considerations, the circumstances, and societal norms.\n\nAdoption is a big commitment, and the author knew when they adopted that it might be challenging. However, the child has severe emotional and behavioral issues that are beyond typical childhood behavior. The parents have tried everything possible, including therapy, but the child's condition (RAD) is a disorder that's hard to treat. The parent is experiencing physical abuse and emotional strain. The child's actions are putting him at risk of being expelled from school and are harmful to others.\n\nOn one hand, some might argue that giving up on a child is selfish, especially since they were adopted from a situation where he might not have another chance. But on the other hand, the parents are doing what they can and are in a state of burnout. The child's behavior is endangering others and causing harm. Also, RAD can lead to lifelong issues if not properly addressed, and the parents may not be able to provide the necessary support.\n\nThe parent is seeking honest opinions and mentions feeling masochistic, indicating they're struggling with guilt. They're not looking for an easy answer but want to know if their feelings are valid. In such cases, the community usually considers the well-being of both the child and the parents. If the child's behavior is causing harm and the parents can't provide a safe environment, then returning him might be the responsible choice. However, the parents might face criticism for not trying harder, but the reality is they've exhausted all options.\n\nIn the AITA subreddit, people often consider the intent and the circumstances. The parents adopted with good intentions, tried everything, but the situation is escalating. The child's well-being is also a factor\u2014if returning him to the agency or another family might give him a better chance. However, the parents might be in the wrong if they're giving up too easily, but given the severity of the issues and the lack of improvement despite efforts, it's a gray area.\n\nBut considering all factors\u2014the lack of progress, the safety of others, and the parents' safety\u2014the parents might not be in the wrong. They're trying to make a difficult decision in their best interest and for the child's possible betterment elsewhere. So the answer would be B (not in the wrong).\n"
