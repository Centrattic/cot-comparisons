Given my medical issues, in vitro wasn\u2019t really an option. My husband wanted to try surrogacy but in the end I pointed out that there are so many unwanted children in the world that perhaps adoption was the most selfless route. \n\nIt was a long, difficult road but we finally were able to adopt an adorable little boy from Haiti. \n\nHe was three when we got him and he\u2019s six years old now. From the outset, he\u2019s been prone to violent tantrums and he\u2019s getting stronger. He\u2019s grown so destructive we had to strip his room down so that it\u2019s just the bare essentials. \n\nWe have tried being firm, being soft, giving discipline, giving positive reinforcement, ignoring, being attentive. He\u2019s been working with a therapist for the past year and a half. He\u2019s actually fairly well behaved there. \n\nAt home and school, it\u2019s a completely different story. He\u2019s only in first grade and already at risk of expulsion. He\u2019s kicked his teacher. He used play scissors to cut a little girl\u2019s ponytail off when her back was turned (now he\u2019s lost all privileges to use them). He flooded the toilets by flushing his own clothes. \n\nWhat\u2019s worse is that I don\u2019t think he feels anything for me or for my husband. He behaves slightly better than my husband than for me but my husband is naturally loud and boisterous, even when he\u2019s not angry,so maybe that\u2019s intimidating. But with me, it\u2019s just a nightmare. I\u2019ve been punched, spat on, kicked, slapped, clawed. All by a child that I do everything for. He can be very calm and sweet but he turns so quickly. \n\nAlthough he\u2019s somewhat better after therapy, it doesn\u2019t last long. He\u2019s been diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder, and unfortunately it\u2019s not something that can really be cured. \n\nI\u2019m trying to talk myself out of feeling this way. Telling myself that good people don\u2019t consider what I\u2019m considering. I\u2019ve visited all kinds of parenting blogs and mommy forums and adoption subs (including the one here on my alt account).\n\nI\u2019m just exhausted emotionally and physically. I guess I\u2019m here because of my masochistic tendencies. I welcome your honesty. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this adoption story is in the wrong. The question is whether they should give back their adopted son, and they want to know if they're at fault here.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author and her husband decided to adopt because of infertility. They adopted a three-year-old from Haiti, but he's having severe behavioral issues. There's violence at home and school, and he's been diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder, which isn't curable. They've tried various methods and therapy, but the problems persist. The author is considering giving him back but is struggling with that decision.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but wants to know more. So, I need to assess from both angles. On one hand, the author made a commitment to adoption, which is a lifelong decision, so some might argue they're responsible for his well-being. On the other hand, they're facing extreme challenges beyond their control, especially with a disorder that's hard to manage and the child's behavior being dangerous and abusive. The author is exhausted and seeking honest opinions, which shows they're struggling but haven't given up.\n\nReactive attachment disorder (RAD) is a serious condition where a child has difficulty forming emotional bonds. It's often due to early neglect or abuse. The child's actions are severe and may be a result of his past traumas. The parents tried multiple strategies and therapy, but the child's behavior is deteriorating. In such cases, it's not necessarily the parents' fault if the child's needs are too overwhelming. The parents might be doing everything right but still need to consider their safety and well-being, as well as the child's. Sometimes, in cases of RAD, the child may need specialized care that the adoptive parents can't provide, which could mean the child might face challenges in any placement, not just this one.\n\nAlso, the author mentions they're considering giving the child back, which is a big decision. People might judge them for it, but given the circumstances, it's a valid option. They're not abandoning the child but seeking a situation where he can get better help. The key here is whether the parents have made a reasonable effort and if the child's behavior is a result of his condition rather than their parenting. Since they've done everything possible and the disorder is a known issue, it's more about the child's needs than the parents' failures.\n\nSo, the answer is B. The author isn't in the wrong. They made a difficult choice, tried their best, and the child's behavior is due to a disorder that's hard to manage. It's a complex situation where the parents are doing their best under challenging circumstances.\n"
