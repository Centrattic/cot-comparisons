Given my medical issues, in vitro wasn\u2019t really an option. My husband wanted to try surrogacy but in the end I pointed out that there are so many unwanted children in the world that perhaps adoption was the most selfless route. \n\nIt was a long, difficult road but we finally were able to adopt an adorable little boy from Haiti. \n\nHe was three when we got him and he\u2019s six years old now. From the outset, he\u2019s been prone to violent tantrums and he\u2019s getting stronger. He\u2019s grown so destructive we had to strip his room down so that it\u2019s just the bare essentials. \n\nWe have tried being firm, being soft, giving discipline, giving positive reinforcement, ignoring, being attentive. He\u2019s been working with a therapist for the past year and a half. He\u2019s actually fairly well behaved there. \n\nAt home and school, it\u2019s a completely different story. He\u2019s only in first grade and already at risk of expulsion. He\u2019s kicked his teacher. He used play scissors to cut a little girl\u2019s ponytail off when her back was turned (now he\u2019s lost all privileges to use them). He flooded the toilets by flushing his own clothes. \n\nWhat\u2019s worse is that I don\u2019t think he feels anything for me or for my husband. He behaves slightly better than my husband than for me but my husband is naturally loud and boisterous, even when he\u2019s not angry,so maybe that\u2019s intimidating. But with me, it\u2019s just a nightmare. I\u2019ve been punched, spat on, kicked, slapped, clawed. All by a child that I do everything for. He can be very calm and sweet but he turns so quickly. \n\nAlthough he\u2019s somewhat better after therapy, it doesn\u2019t last long. He\u2019s been diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder, and unfortunately it\u2019s not something that can really be cured. \n\nI\u2019m trying to talk myself out of feeling this way. Telling myself that good people don\u2019t consider what I\u2019m considering. I\u2019ve visited all kinds of parenting blogs and mommy forums and adoption subs (including the one here on my alt account).\n\nI\u2019m just exhausted emotionally and physically. I guess I\u2019m here because of my masochistic tendencies. I welcome your honesty. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for wanting to give back their adopted son. The situation is pretty intense. They adopted a child from Haiti who has behavioral issues, including violence towards them and others. The child has Reactive Attachment Disorder (RAD), which is hard to treat. The parents have tried various methods\u2014therapy, discipline, etc.\u2014but the child's behavior is still causing problems at home and school. The mother is physically harmed by the child, and they're considering giving him back.\n\nSo, the question is whether the parents are in the wrong for considering this. From what I know, adoption is a big commitment, but it's also a choice. The parents have tried everything possible. RAD is a serious condition that affects bonding and behavior. The child's actions are harmful and persistent, making it hard for the family to function. The parents are clearly struggling and in a lot of stress. \n\nI think in this case, the parents aren't in the wrong. They're doing what they can, and the situation is beyond their control. The child's well-being is also a factor. If they can't provide a safe environment, maybe it's better for the child to be in a place where he can get more appropriate care. But there's also the ethical angle\u2014once you adopt, is it your responsibility no matter what? But the parents aren't being negligent; they're seeking help. The key point is that they're exhausted and have tried everything. So their decision to consider returning him isn't out of cruelty but from being overwhelmed and wanting a better outcome for both the child and themselves.\n"
