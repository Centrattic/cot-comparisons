Given my medical issues, in vitro wasn\u2019t really an option. My husband wanted to try surrogacy but in the end I pointed out that there are so many unwanted children in the world that perhaps adoption was the most selfless route. \n\nIt was a long, difficult road but we finally were able to adopt an adorable little boy from Haiti. \n\nHe was three when we got him and he\u2019s six years old now. From the outset, he\u2019s been prone to violent tantrums and he\u2019s getting stronger. He\u2019s grown so destructive we had to strip his room down so that it\u2019s just the bare essentials. \n\nWe have tried being firm, being soft, giving discipline, giving positive reinforcement, ignoring, being attentive. He\u2019s been working with a therapist for the past year and a half. He\u2019s actually fairly well behaved there. \n\nAt home and school, it\u2019s a completely different story. He\u2019s only in first grade and already at risk of expulsion. He\u2019s kicked his teacher. He used play scissors to cut a little girl\u2019s ponytail off when her back was turned (now he\u2019s lost all privileges to use them). He flooded the toilets by flushing his own clothes. \n\nWhat\u2019s worse is that I don\u2019t think he feels anything for me or for my husband. He behaves slightly better than my husband than for me but my husband is naturally loud and boisterous, even when he\u2019s not angry,so maybe that\u2019s intimidating. But with me, it\u2019s just a nightmare. I\u2019ve been punched, spat on, kicked, slapped, clawed. All by a child that I do everything for. He can be very calm and sweet but he turns so quickly. \n\nAlthough he\u2019s somewhat better after therapy, it doesn\u2019t last long. He\u2019s been diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder, and unfortunately it\u2019s not something that can really be cured. \n\nI\u2019m trying to talk myself out of feeling this way. Telling myself that good people don\u2019t consider what I\u2019m considering. I\u2019ve visited all kinds of parenting blogs and mommy forums and adoption subs (including the one here on my alt account).\n\nI\u2019m just exhausted emotionally and physically. I guess I\u2019m here because of my masochistic tendencies. I welcome your honesty. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for considering giving back their adopted son. The situation involves a child with serious behavioral issues, including Reactive Attachment Disorder (RAD), and the parents are struggling with physical abuse and the child's destructive behavior.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The parents adopted a child from Haiti who's now six. They've tried various methods to manage his behavior, including therapy and school interventions. The child's actions are violent and inappropriate, and the parents are emotionally and physically exhausted. The mother mentions being physically harmed\u2014punched, spat on, kicked, etc. The child has been diagnosed with RAD, which is a disorder where a child has difficulty forming emotional attachments, and it's not curable.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong but wants confirmation. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, adoption is a significant commitment, and parents are expected to provide care and support. However, in cases where the child's behavior is harmful and the parents are at their breaking point, it's a complex situation. The parents have made numerous efforts to address the issues through therapy, discipline methods, etc., and the child's condition is a medical diagnosis. The parents' well-being is also a factor here. If they are being physically harmed, that's a serious concern.\n\nThe key factors here are the parents' efforts, the child's medical condition, the impact on the family, and the parents' safety. The fact that the child has RAD, which is a recognized psychological condition affecting attachment, might mitigate blame. The parents aren't ignoring the child or failing to seek help; they've tried multiple approaches. The child's violent behavior is out of their control despite their efforts. \n\nIn such cases, some people might argue that giving the child up is a last resort, but others might say the parents are doing the right thing by prioritizing their safety and seeking a better environment for the child. The parents might feel they're in the wrong because they're considering giving up after a commitment, but given the circumstances, it's a difficult decision made out of necessity rather than neglect.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is likely B (the author is not in the wrong). They've made a conscious choice to adopt despite infertility, have tried everything possible, and are facing extreme challenges beyond their control. Their decision to consider returning the child is driven by a need to protect themselves and possibly find a better fit for the child's needs.\n"
