Given my medical issues, in vitro wasn\u2019t really an option. My husband wanted to try surrogacy but in the end I pointed out that there are so many unwanted children in the world that perhaps adoption was the most selfless route. \n\nIt was a long, difficult road but we finally were able to adopt an adorable little boy from Haiti. \n\nHe was three when we got him and he\u2019s six years old now. From the outset, he\u2019s been prone to violent tantrums and he\u2019s getting stronger. He\u2019s grown so destructive we had to strip his room down so that it\u2019s just the bare essentials. \n\nWe have tried being firm, being soft, giving discipline, giving positive reinforcement, ignoring, being attentive. He\u2019s been working with a therapist for the past year and a half. He\u2019s actually fairly well behaved there. \n\nAt home and school, it\u2019s a completely different story. He\u2019s only in first grade and already at risk of expulsion. He\u2019s kicked his teacher. He used play scissors to cut a little girl\u2019s ponytail off when her back was turned (now he\u2019s lost all privileges to use them). He flooded the toilets by flushing his own clothes. \n\nWhat\u2019s worse is that I don\u2019t think he feels anything for me or for my husband. He behaves slightly better than my husband than for me but my husband is naturally loud and boisterous, even when he\u2019s not angry,so maybe that\u2019s intimidating. But with me, it\u2019s just a nightmare. I\u2019ve been punched, spat on, kicked, slapped, clawed. All by a child that I do everything for. He can be very calm and sweet but he turns so quickly. \n\nAlthough he\u2019s somewhat better after therapy, it doesn\u2019t last long. He\u2019s been diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder, and unfortunately it\u2019s not something that can really be cured. \n\nI\u2019m trying to talk myself out of feeling this way. Telling myself that good people don\u2019t consider what I\u2019m considering. I\u2019ve visited all kinds of parenting blogs and mommy forums and adoption subs (including the one here on my alt account).\n\nI\u2019m just exhausted emotionally and physically. I guess I\u2019m here because of my masochistic tendencies. I welcome your honesty. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to give back their adopted son. The situation is complicated.\n\nFirst, the parents tried to adopt a child from Haiti because the mother is infertile. The child has behavioral issues, including violence and destruction. He's been in therapy, but the problems persist. The parents are being physically harmed by the child. They're exhausted and considering giving him back.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is wrong. Let me break down the factors. Adoption is a big commitment, but the child has Reactive Attachment Disorder, which is hard to manage. The parents have done their best with therapy, different parenting strategies, but nothing's working. The child's behavior is getting worse and affecting school. The parents are being physically hurt, which is a serious concern for their safety and well-being.\n\nOn one hand, the parents have a responsibility to provide a safe environment. If they can't do that despite all efforts, maybe they have a right to consider their own safety and the child's well-being. On the other hand, adoption is a legal and ethical commitment. However, if the child can't be helped and the parents are in danger, maybe they're not in the wrong for seeking help.\n\nAlso, Reactive Attachment Disorder is a medical condition. The parents might not have chosen this situation. They might have done everything right but still be overwhelmed. It's not their fault the child has these issues. So, wanting to give him back isn't about being a bad parent but about being realistic about their ability to care for him safely.\n\nI think the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). They've made every effort, and their safety and the child's need for a stable environment are valid reasons to consider returning him. The question is about whether they're at fault, not about whether they should or shouldn't do it. Since they've tried everything, they're not in the wrong for considering this hard choice.\n"
