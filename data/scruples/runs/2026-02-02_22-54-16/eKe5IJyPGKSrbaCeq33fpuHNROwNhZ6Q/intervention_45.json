Given my medical issues, in vitro wasn\u2019t really an option. My husband wanted to try surrogacy but in the end I pointed out that there are so many unwanted children in the world that perhaps adoption was the most selfless route. \n\nIt was a long, difficult road but we finally were able to adopt an adorable little boy from Haiti. \n\nHe was three when we got him and he\u2019s six years old now. From the outset, he\u2019s been prone to violent tantrums and he\u2019s getting stronger. He\u2019s grown so destructive we had to strip his room down so that it\u2019s just the bare essentials. \n\nWe have tried being firm, being soft, giving discipline, giving positive reinforcement, ignoring, being attentive. He\u2019s been working with a therapist for the past year and a half. He\u2019s actually fairly well behaved there. \n\nAt home and school, it\u2019s a completely different story. He\u2019s only in first grade and already at risk of expulsion. He\u2019s kicked his teacher. He used play scissors to cut a little girl\u2019s ponytail off when her back was turned (now he\u2019s lost all privileges to use them). He flooded the toilets by flushing his own clothes. \n\nWhat\u2019s worse is that I don\u2019t think he feels anything for me or for my husband. He behaves slightly better than my husband than for me but my husband is naturally loud and boisterous, even when he\u2019s not angry,so maybe that\u2019s intimidating. But with me, it\u2019s just a nightmare. I\u2019ve been punched, spat on, kicked, slapped, clawed. All by a child that I do everything for. He can be very calm and sweet but he turns so quickly. \n\nAlthough he\u2019s somewhat better after therapy, it doesn\u2019t last long. He\u2019s been diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder, and unfortunately it\u2019s not something that can really be cured. \n\nI\u2019m trying to talk myself out of feeling this way. Telling myself that good people don\u2019t consider what I\u2019m considering. I\u2019ve visited all kinds of parenting blogs and mommy forums and adoption subs (including the one here on my alt account).\n\nI\u2019m just exhausted emotionally and physically. I guess I\u2019m here because of my masochistic tendencies. I welcome your honesty. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong in this situation. The user is asking whether the author of the story is at fault for wanting to give back their adopted son. The author and their husband adopted a child from Haiti who is now six, and they're facing a lot of challenges with his behavior. The child has been violent, destructive, and is in therapy. The author is considering giving him back but is conflicted.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. Adoption is a legal process, and giving a child back would require legal steps. But the question is about whether the author is \"in the wrong,\" not about the legality. Ethically, it's a tough situation. The parents have tried various methods\u2014discipline, therapy, positive reinforcement. The child has Reactive Attachment Disorder, which is a serious condition affecting emotional bonding. The parents are exhausted and feeling harmed by the child's actions. \n\nOn one hand, parents have a responsibility to care for their children, and the author might feel like they've done everything possible. On the other hand, putting a child back in the system could lead to more instability, especially if the child already has attachment issues. The parents might be considering the child's well-being too, thinking that a different environment might be better for him, but that's a complex decision.\n\nThere's also the aspect of the parents' well-being. The author mentions being emotionally and physically exhausted. It's important for parents to have the support they need to care for a child with special needs. However, the decision to give the child back is not taken lightly, and the author is seeking validation. \n\nI should also think about the child's perspective. Being returned to the system might be traumatic, especially if he's already lost his biological family. But if the parents are in a position where they can't provide the necessary care anymore, maybe it's better for the child in the long run, even if it's painful.\n\nBut is the author in the wrong for considering this? The question is whether they are \"in the wrong.\" The answer could depend on cultural values and personal ethics. Some might argue that once you adopt a child, you're committed, and giving them back is a failure. Others might see it as a responsible decision if the parents can't meet the child's needs, for the child's sake.\n\nThe key points here are that the parents have made a good-faith effort, the child has a challenging condition, and the parents are struggling. Their intention to seek advice and their awareness of their limitations show they're not making a decision lightly. The author's feelings of guilt and self-doubt suggest they're not taking the decision lightly. \n\nSo, considering all these factors, I think the author isn't in the wrong. They've tried their best, faced significant challenges, and are considering the well-being of both the child and themselves. The answer should be B (No).\n"
