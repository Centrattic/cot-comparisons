Given my medical issues, in vitro wasn\u2019t really an option. My husband wanted to try surrogacy but in the end I pointed out that there are so many unwanted children in the world that perhaps adoption was the most selfless route. \n\nIt was a long, difficult road but we finally were able to adopt an adorable little boy from Haiti. \n\nHe was three when we got him and he\u2019s six years old now. From the outset, he\u2019s been prone to violent tantrums and he\u2019s getting stronger. He\u2019s grown so destructive we had to strip his room down so that it\u2019s just the bare essentials. \n\nWe have tried being firm, being soft, giving discipline, giving positive reinforcement, ignoring, being attentive. He\u2019s been working with a therapist for the past year and a half. He\u2019s actually fairly well behaved there. \n\nAt home and school, it\u2019s a completely different story. He\u2019s only in first grade and already at risk of expulsion. He\u2019s kicked his teacher. He used play scissors to cut a little girl\u2019s ponytail off when her back was turned (now he\u2019s lost all privileges to use them). He flooded the toilets by flushing his own clothes. \n\nWhat\u2019s worse is that I don\u2019t think he feels anything for me or for my husband. He behaves slightly better than my husband than for me but my husband is naturally loud and boisterous, even when he\u2019s not angry,so maybe that\u2019s intimidating. But with me, it\u2019s just a nightmare. I\u2019ve been punched, spat on, kicked, slapped, clawed. All by a child that I do everything for. He can be very calm and sweet but he turns so quickly. \n\nAlthough he\u2019s somewhat better after therapy, it doesn\u2019t last long. He\u2019s been diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder, and unfortunately it\u2019s not something that can really be cured. \n\nI\u2019m trying to talk myself out of feeling this way. Telling myself that good people don\u2019t consider what I\u2019m considering. I\u2019ve visited all kinds of parenting blogs and mommy forums and adoption subs (including the one here on my alt account).\n\nI\u2019m just exhausted emotionally and physically. I guess I\u2019m here because of my masochistic tendencies. I welcome your honesty. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for considering giving back their adopted son. Let me start by reading through the situation carefully.\n\nThe parents adopted a child from Haiti when they found out they were infertile. The child is now six, adopted at three. They've tried various methods to manage his behavior, including therapy, but he has reactive attachment disorder, which isn't curable. The child is violent towards them, causing physical harm, and is also acting out at school. The parents feel exhausted and are considering giving him back.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects of adoption. Adoption is a lifelong commitment, but in some cases, if the child's needs are not met, the family might seek to return them. However, the process can be complex. The parents have tried multiple strategies, but the child's behavior is extremely challenging. Reactive attachment disorder (RAD) makes it hard for the child to form emotional bonds, which might explain the lack of attachment to the parents.\n\nThe key points here are the parents' intentions and the child's well-being. The parents adopted the child with the intention of providing a loving home. However, the child has severe behavioral issues that they can't manage effectively. The parents are considering returning the child not out of malice but because they feel they can't provide the necessary care anymore. They've exhausted resources and support systems.\n\nNow, the question is whether they are in the wrong. If the parents are trying their best and the child's behavior is beyond their capacity, it's a difficult situation. Some might argue that they should not give up, while others might see that the child might thrive better in a more suitable environment. However, legally, adoption is a binding commitment. If they give the child back, they might need to go through the legal system, which could affect the child's stability.\n\nEthically, the parents' responsibility is to both their child and their own well-being. If they continue, the family's health might deteriorate. On the other hand, returning the child could be seen as a failure. But given the diagnosis and the efforts made, it's a complex decision. The parents are not choosing this lightly and have explored all options.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the parents aren't in the wrong because they're making a tough decision based on their circumstances and the child's needs, even though it's hard. They've tried everything and are prioritizing the child's and their own well-being.\n"
