Given my medical issues, in vitro wasn\u2019t really an option. My husband wanted to try surrogacy but in the end I pointed out that there are so many unwanted children in the world that perhaps adoption was the most selfless route. \n\nIt was a long, difficult road but we finally were able to adopt an adorable little boy from Haiti. \n\nHe was three when we got him and he\u2019s six years old now. From the outset, he\u2019s been prone to violent tantrums and he\u2019s getting stronger. He\u2019s grown so destructive we had to strip his room down so that it\u2019s just the bare essentials. \n\nWe have tried being firm, being soft, giving discipline, giving positive reinforcement, ignoring, being attentive. He\u2019s been working with a therapist for the past year and a half. He\u2019s actually fairly well behaved there. \n\nAt home and school, it\u2019s a completely different story. He\u2019s only in first grade and already at risk of expulsion. He\u2019s kicked his teacher. He used play scissors to cut a little girl\u2019s ponytail off when her back was turned (now he\u2019s lost all privileges to use them). He flooded the toilets by flushing his own clothes. \n\nWhat\u2019s worse is that I don\u2019t think he feels anything for me or for my husband. He behaves slightly better than my husband than for me but my husband is naturally loud and boisterous, even when he\u2019s not angry,so maybe that\u2019s intimidating. But with me, it\u2019s just a nightmare. I\u2019ve been punched, spat on, kicked, slapped, clawed. All by a child that I do everything for. He can be very calm and sweet but he turns so quickly. \n\nAlthough he\u2019s somewhat better after therapy, it doesn\u2019t last long. He\u2019s been diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder, and unfortunately it\u2019s not something that can really be cured. \n\nI\u2019m trying to talk myself out of feeling this way. Telling myself that good people don\u2019t consider what I\u2019m considering. I\u2019ve visited all kinds of parenting blogs and mommy forums and adoption subs (including the one here on my alt account).\n\nI\u2019m just exhausted emotionally and physically. I guess I\u2019m here because of my masochistic tendencies. I welcome your honesty. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to give back their adopted son. Let's look at the details provided.\n\nFirst, the couple decided to adopt because the mother is infertile and they couldn't use in vitro. They adopted a three-year-old from Haiti. Now the child is six and has significant behavioral issues\u2014violent tantrums, destructive behavior, aggression towards them and others. He's been to therapy for 1.5 years, which helps somewhat but not enough. He's been diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder, which isn't curable. The parents are exhausted and considering giving him back.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, adoption is a big commitment, and the parents have made significant efforts to manage the child's behavior. They've tried various methods, therapy, etc. However, the child's actions are harmful\u2014attacking the parents and others, causing harm at school. The parents are in a difficult position where they're providing care but also facing physical and emotional abuse. \n\nReactive attachment disorder (RAD) is a serious condition where the child has difficulty forming emotional bonds. The parents might feel they can't meet the child's needs anymore. While giving a child back is a major decision, the parents' well-being and safety are also important. They might not be in the wrong if they feel they can't provide a safe environment. \n\nHowever, some might argue that they should stick it out despite the challenges. But given the severity of the situation, including physical abuse, the parents have a right to prioritize their safety. Also, the child's needs might require more resources than the parents can provide. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). They've made a valiant effort and the circumstances are extremely challenging, making their decision understandable.\n"
