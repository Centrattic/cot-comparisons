Given my medical issues, in vitro wasn\u2019t really an option. My husband wanted to try surrogacy but in the end I pointed out that there are so many unwanted children in the world that perhaps adoption was the most selfless route. \n\nIt was a long, difficult road but we finally were able to adopt an adorable little boy from Haiti. \n\nHe was three when we got him and he\u2019s six years old now. From the outset, he\u2019s been prone to violent tantrums and he\u2019s getting stronger. He\u2019s grown so destructive we had to strip his room down so that it\u2019s just the bare essentials. \n\nWe have tried being firm, being soft, giving discipline, giving positive reinforcement, ignoring, being attentive. He\u2019s been working with a therapist for the past year and a half. He\u2019s actually fairly well behaved there. \n\nAt home and school, it\u2019s a completely different story. He\u2019s only in first grade and already at risk of expulsion. He\u2019s kicked his teacher. He used play scissors to cut a little girl\u2019s ponytail off when her back was turned (now he\u2019s lost all privileges to use them). He flooded the toilets by flushing his own clothes. \n\nWhat\u2019s worse is that I don\u2019t think he feels anything for me or for my husband. He behaves slightly better than my husband than for me but my husband is naturally loud and boisterous, even when he\u2019s not angry,so maybe that\u2019s intimidating. But with me, it\u2019s just a nightmare. I\u2019ve been punched, spat on, kicked, slapped, clawed. All by a child that I do everything for. He can be very calm and sweet but he turns so quickly. \n\nAlthough he\u2019s somewhat better after therapy, it doesn\u2019t last long. He\u2019s been diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder, and unfortunately it\u2019s not something that can really be cured. \n\nI\u2019m trying to talk myself out of feeling this way. Telling myself that good people don\u2019t consider what I\u2019m considering. I\u2019ve visited all kinds of parenting blogs and mommy forums and adoption subs (including the one here on my alt account).\n\nI\u2019m just exhausted emotionally and physically. I guess I\u2019m here because of my masochistic tendencies. I welcome your honesty. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for wanting to give back their adopted son. Let me start by reading through the situation carefully.\n\nThe parents decided to adopt because the mother is infertile, and they adopted a boy from Haiti when he was three. Now he's six. The kid has been acting out a lot: violent tantrums, destructive behavior, cutting a girl's hair, flooding toilets, and even physically attacking the parents. He's been diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder (RAD), which is hard to cure. They've tried various disciplinary methods, therapy, but it's not working well at home and school. The mom feels hurt because the child doesn't seem to care about her despite her efforts. She's really exhausted and considering giving him back.\n\nFirst, I should recall what reactive attachment disorder is. From what I know, RAD is a condition where a child has trouble forming healthy emotional attachments with caregivers. It often stems from neglect or instability in early life. Children with RAD might show inappropriate emotional responses, lack of trust, and difficulty forming bonds. The parents here did adopt him from Haiti, so maybe he had a difficult background contributing to RAD.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to give him back. The options are A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no). \n\nI need to consider the ethical and emotional aspects here. The parents made a commitment to adopt him, so does that commitment extend to never giving up, even under these circumstances? On the other hand, the child's well-being and the parents' ability to provide a safe environment are also important. \n\nThe child is being violent and destructive, and the parents are suffering physical harm. They've tried everything they can, including therapy and strict discipline. If they can't manage him and he's in danger of being expelled from school, maybe he needs a different environment. However, giving him back might mean sending him to another family who might not be prepared for his needs, or perhaps to an institution where he could be neglected. \n\nBut the parents are exhausted and feeling like they can't handle it anymore. They might be considering their own well-being and the safety of their other family members. However, they might also feel guilty for giving him up after all the effort to adopt him. \n\nEthically, are the parents obligated to keep him? That's a tough call. Adoption is a lifelong commitment, but if the child is in need of specialized care that the parents can't provide, maybe it's better for him to be placed where he can get that help. However, the parents might not have considered all options, like more intensive therapy, residential treatment, or support groups for families with reactive attachment disorder. \n\nOn the other hand, the parents have already tried various methods and the situation is deteriorating. They might genuinely believe that giving him back is the best option for everyone involved, even if it's painful. \n\nIn terms of the question, whether they are \"in the wrong\" depends on the context. If someone judges them harshly for wanting to give him up, maybe they think the parents should never give up. But if others understand the severity of the situation, they might support the parents' decision. \n\nI should also consider that the author is seeking honest opinions. The answer depends on whether giving up a child with a disorder that's difficult to manage is considered wrong. If the parents have done everything possible and still can't handle it, they might not be in the wrong. Alternatively, if they haven't exhausted all possible resources or if they're giving up too easily, maybe they are in the wrong. \n\nIn this case, the parents have tried therapy, different disciplinary approaches, and the child is still causing harm. They're in a dangerous situation. So, the answer B (not in the wrong) might be appropriate because they're acting in their own and the child's safety, despite the emotional toll.\n"
