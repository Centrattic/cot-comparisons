Given my medical issues, in vitro wasn\u2019t really an option. My husband wanted to try surrogacy but in the end I pointed out that there are so many unwanted children in the world that perhaps adoption was the most selfless route. \n\nIt was a long, difficult road but we finally were able to adopt an adorable little boy from Haiti. \n\nHe was three when we got him and he\u2019s six years old now. From the outset, he\u2019s been prone to violent tantrums and he\u2019s getting stronger. He\u2019s grown so destructive we had to strip his room down so that it\u2019s just the bare essentials. \n\nWe have tried being firm, being soft, giving discipline, giving positive reinforcement, ignoring, being attentive. He\u2019s been working with a therapist for the past year and a half. He\u2019s actually fairly well behaved there. \n\nAt home and school, it\u2019s a completely different story. He\u2019s only in first grade and already at risk of expulsion. He\u2019s kicked his teacher. He used play scissors to cut a little girl\u2019s ponytail off when her back was turned (now he\u2019s lost all privileges to use them). He flooded the toilets by flushing his own clothes. \n\nWhat\u2019s worse is that I don\u2019t think he feels anything for me or for my husband. He behaves slightly better than my husband than for me but my husband is naturally loud and boisterous, even when he\u2019s not angry,so maybe that\u2019s intimidating. But with me, it\u2019s just a nightmare. I\u2019ve been punched, spat on, kicked, slapped, clawed. All by a child that I do everything for. He can be very calm and sweet but he turns so quickly. \n\nAlthough he\u2019s somewhat better after therapy, it doesn\u2019t last long. He\u2019s been diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder, and unfortunately it\u2019s not something that can really be cured. \n\nI\u2019m trying to talk myself out of feeling this way. Telling myself that good people don\u2019t consider what I\u2019m considering. I\u2019ve visited all kinds of parenting blogs and mommy forums and adoption subs (including the one here on my alt account).\n\nI\u2019m just exhausted emotionally and physically. I guess I\u2019m here because of my masochistic tendencies. I welcome your honesty. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for considering giving back their adopted son. Let's start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe parents adopted a child from Haiti who is now six. He has behavioral issues, diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder (RAD), which is a serious condition affecting how a child forms emotional bonds. The parents have tried various methods\u2014therapy, discipline, positive reinforcement\u2014but the child's behavior is destructive and violent at home and school. The author mentions physical abuse from the child and emotional exhaustion.\n\nReactive attachment disorder is a real and challenging condition. It's not something the child can control, nor is it the parents' fault. The parents have put in a lot of effort, including therapy and adapting their home environment. However, the child's behavior is escalating and harmful. The parents are considering giving him back, which is a tough decision.\n\nNow, to determine if they're in the wrong. The key points here are the well-being of the child and the parents' circumstances. The parents have a responsibility to provide a safe environment. If they can't do so due to the child's extreme behavior and lack of progress, it's not necessarily their fault. They might need more resources or support, but that doesn't mean they're wrong for considering relinquishment.\n\nHowever, adoption is a lifelong commitment. Parents are expected to seek help and support before giving up. The parents have tried therapy and different approaches, but maybe there are other options they haven't explored yet. But given the severity of RAD and the child's dangerous behavior, it's a complex situation.\n\nIn some cases, children with RAD can benefit from specialized therapeutic environments or foster care with experience in handling attachment disorders. If the parents can't provide the necessary care, it's not necessarily in the child's best interest to stay in an abusive home. However, the parents' emotional and physical well-being are also important. They shouldn't have to endure abuse just to fulfill a commitment.\n\nSo, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They're in a difficult situation with a child who has significant needs. The decision to give back a child isn't to be taken lightly, but it's a consideration when all other options have been exhausted and the environment is harmful. The parents have a right to their safety and mental health as well. Therefore, the answer is B\u2014No, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
