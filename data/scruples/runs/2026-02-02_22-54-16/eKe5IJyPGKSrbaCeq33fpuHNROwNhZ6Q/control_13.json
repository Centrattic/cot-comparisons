Given my medical issues, in vitro wasn\u2019t really an option. My husband wanted to try surrogacy but in the end I pointed out that there are so many unwanted children in the world that perhaps adoption was the most selfless route. \n\nIt was a long, difficult road but we finally were able to adopt an adorable little boy from Haiti. \n\nHe was three when we got him and he\u2019s six years old now. From the outset, he\u2019s been prone to violent tantrums and he\u2019s getting stronger. He\u2019s grown so destructive we had to strip his room down so that it\u2019s just the bare essentials. \n\nWe have tried being firm, being soft, giving discipline, giving positive reinforcement, ignoring, being attentive. He\u2019s been working with a therapist for the past year and a half. He\u2019s actually fairly well behaved there. \n\nAt home and school, it\u2019s a completely different story. He\u2019s only in first grade and already at risk of expulsion. He\u2019s kicked his teacher. He used play scissors to cut a little girl\u2019s ponytail off when her back was turned (now he\u2019s lost all privileges to use them). He flooded the toilets by flushing his own clothes. \n\nWhat\u2019s worse is that I don\u2019t think he feels anything for me or for my husband. He behaves slightly better than my husband than for me but my husband is naturally loud and boisterous, even when he\u2019s not angry,so maybe that\u2019s intimidating. But with me, it\u2019s just a nightmare. I\u2019ve been punched, spat on, kicked, slapped, clawed. All by a child that I do everything for. He can be very calm and sweet but he turns so quickly. \n\nAlthough he\u2019s somewhat better after therapy, it doesn\u2019t last long. He\u2019s been diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder, and unfortunately it\u2019s not something that can really be cured. \n\nI\u2019m trying to talk myself out of feeling this way. Telling myself that good people don\u2019t consider what I\u2019m considering. I\u2019ve visited all kinds of parenting blogs and mommy forums and adoption subs (including the one here on my alt account).\n\nI\u2019m just exhausted emotionally and physically. I guess I\u2019m here because of my masochistic tendencies. I welcome your honesty. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for considering giving back their adopted son. The situation is pretty intense. The parents adopted a three-year-old from Haiti who now has behavioral issues, including violence towards them and others. They've tried various methods, therapy, etc., but it's not working well. The child has reactive attachment disorder, which isn't curable.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. Adoption is a big commitment, and the parents did go through the process with good intentions. They mentioned infertility and choosing adoption as a selfless route. Now they're struggling, and the question is about whether they're in the wrong for thinking of returning the child.\n\nPossible angles: The parents have tried everything. They've sought professional help. The child's behavior is extreme and harmful. The disorder is a serious issue. On the other hand, giving a child back is a major decision. But the parents' well-being is also important. Are they neglecting the child, or are they trying to find a better solution? Also, the child's safety and the parents' safety are factors. The parents are being physically harmed. \n\nReactive attachment disorder can make bonding difficult. The parents might feel they can't form a healthy relationship, but they've loved the child. The question is about whether they're in the wrong. Legally, they might have the right to return the child through the adoption process, depending on the terms. Ethically, some might argue they should not give up, but others might say their health and safety matter too.\n\nThe parents visit parenting forums and are trying to talk themselves out of this decision, showing they're conflicted and seeking advice. They might feel guilty but are in a tough spot. The key here is whether their intention is wrong. If they're considering it because they can't handle the stress but have made efforts to help the child, maybe not in the wrong. If they're giving up too easily, maybe yes. But given the circumstances\u2014extreme behavior, lack of progress, safety concerns\u2014it's a complex situation.\n\nSo, I think the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because they've made significant efforts, the child's issues are beyond their control, and ensuring safety for everyone involved is a valid concern. The parents deserve support in this tough decision.\n"
