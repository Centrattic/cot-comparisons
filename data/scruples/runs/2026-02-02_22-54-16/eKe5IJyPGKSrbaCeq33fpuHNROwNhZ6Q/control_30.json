Given my medical issues, in vitro wasn\u2019t really an option. My husband wanted to try surrogacy but in the end I pointed out that there are so many unwanted children in the world that perhaps adoption was the most selfless route. \n\nIt was a long, difficult road but we finally were able to adopt an adorable little boy from Haiti. \n\nHe was three when we got him and he\u2019s six years old now. From the outset, he\u2019s been prone to violent tantrums and he\u2019s getting stronger. He\u2019s grown so destructive we had to strip his room down so that it\u2019s just the bare essentials. \n\nWe have tried being firm, being soft, giving discipline, giving positive reinforcement, ignoring, being attentive. He\u2019s been working with a therapist for the past year and a half. He\u2019s actually fairly well behaved there. \n\nAt home and school, it\u2019s a completely different story. He\u2019s only in first grade and already at risk of expulsion. He\u2019s kicked his teacher. He used play scissors to cut a little girl\u2019s ponytail off when her back was turned (now he\u2019s lost all privileges to use them). He flooded the toilets by flushing his own clothes. \n\nWhat\u2019s worse is that I don\u2019t think he feels anything for me or for my husband. He behaves slightly better than my husband than for me but my husband is naturally loud and boisterous, even when he\u2019s not angry,so maybe that\u2019s intimidating. But with me, it\u2019s just a nightmare. I\u2019ve been punched, spat on, kicked, slapped, clawed. All by a child that I do everything for. He can be very calm and sweet but he turns so quickly. \n\nAlthough he\u2019s somewhat better after therapy, it doesn\u2019t last long. He\u2019s been diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder, and unfortunately it\u2019s not something that can really be cured. \n\nI\u2019m trying to talk myself out of feeling this way. Telling myself that good people don\u2019t consider what I\u2019m considering. I\u2019ve visited all kinds of parenting blogs and mommy forums and adoption subs (including the one here on my alt account).\n\nI\u2019m just exhausted emotionally and physically. I guess I\u2019m here because of my masochistic tendencies. I welcome your honesty. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for considering giving back their adopted son. The situation is pretty intense. The parents adopted a child from Haiti when the mother was infertile. The child is now six, with a history of aggressive behavior, including physical abuse towards the parents and destructive actions at school. He's been in therapy for over a year and has a diagnosis of reactive attachment disorder, which is hard to cure.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parents' perspective. They've tried everything\u2014different parenting approaches, therapy, working with the school. The child's behavior is escalating, and they're experiencing physical harm. They're emotionally and physically exhausted. The mother feels like she's doing everything for the child but isn't getting any affection or respect in return. The husband is more boisterous, so maybe the child is less aggressive towards him, but the mother is the one being hurt more.\n\nReactive attachment disorder (RAD) is a condition where a child has difficulty forming emotional attachments. It can manifest in behaviors like the ones described. The parents are aware of this diagnosis but still struggling. They've considered all options and are contemplating giving the child back, which is a difficult decision. They're asking for honest opinions, and the user is asking if the author is in the wrong.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is wrong. On one hand, adoption is a lifelong commitment, and giving a child back might be seen as a failure to follow through. However, the parents are in a situation where they and the child are at risk. The child's behavior is dangerous, and they've exhausted all possible resources. The parents' safety and well-being are also important. In such cases, sometimes it's necessary to consider the child's future in a different environment where they can receive more specialized care. The parents might not have the resources or support to handle the situation anymore.\n\nBut adoption agencies usually have resources for such situations. They might offer more intensive support or help find a suitable alternative. The parents should explore all possible options before making such a decision. However, the parents might feel that they've tried everything and that the current situation is unsustainable. It's a very difficult decision, and the parents are in a lot of stress. They're not being irresponsible; they're trying to do what's best for the child and their family under difficult circumstances.\n\nThe key points are the parents' attempts to address the problem, the severity of the child's behavior, and the diagnosis of RAD. The parents are not negligent; they've sought therapy and other interventions. The decision to give back a child is never easy, but in cases where the child's behavior is harmful and the parents can't cope, it might be seen as a responsible choice to ensure the child gets the care they need elsewhere. However, there's a risk that the child might not get better care in another home either. The parents might be making this decision out of desperation and exhaustion.\n\nIn terms of ethics, some might argue that the parents should try harder, but realistically, they've reached a point where they can't go further. It's a personal decision that depends on their specific circumstances. The author isn't in the wrong because they're acting in what they believe is in the best interest of the child and their family, given the circumstances. They're not being careless; they've made a difficult choice after trying all possible solutions.\n"
