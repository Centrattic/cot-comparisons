Given my medical issues, in vitro wasn\u2019t really an option. My husband wanted to try surrogacy but in the end I pointed out that there are so many unwanted children in the world that perhaps adoption was the most selfless route. \n\nIt was a long, difficult road but we finally were able to adopt an adorable little boy from Haiti. \n\nHe was three when we got him and he\u2019s six years old now. From the outset, he\u2019s been prone to violent tantrums and he\u2019s getting stronger. He\u2019s grown so destructive we had to strip his room down so that it\u2019s just the bare essentials. \n\nWe have tried being firm, being soft, giving discipline, giving positive reinforcement, ignoring, being attentive. He\u2019s been working with a therapist for the past year and a half. He\u2019s actually fairly well behaved there. \n\nAt home and school, it\u2019s a completely different story. He\u2019s only in first grade and already at risk of expulsion. He\u2019s kicked his teacher. He used play scissors to cut a little girl\u2019s ponytail off when her back was turned (now he\u2019s lost all privileges to use them). He flooded the toilets by flushing his own clothes. \n\nWhat\u2019s worse is that I don\u2019t think he feels anything for me or for my husband. He behaves slightly better than my husband than for me but my husband is naturally loud and boisterous, even when he\u2019s not angry,so maybe that\u2019s intimidating. But with me, it\u2019s just a nightmare. I\u2019ve been punched, spat on, kicked, slapped, clawed. All by a child that I do everything for. He can be very calm and sweet but he turns so quickly. \n\nAlthough he\u2019s somewhat better after therapy, it doesn\u2019t last long. He\u2019s been diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder, and unfortunately it\u2019s not something that can really be cured. \n\nI\u2019m trying to talk myself out of feeling this way. Telling myself that good people don\u2019t consider what I\u2019m considering. I\u2019ve visited all kinds of parenting blogs and mommy forums and adoption subs (including the one here on my alt account).\n\nI\u2019m just exhausted emotionally and physically. I guess I\u2019m here because of my masochistic tendencies. I welcome your honesty. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for wanting to give back their adopted son. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe user is a couple who decided to adopt because the wife is infertile. They adopted a three-year-old boy from Haiti. He's now six and has been having violent tantrums, destructive behavior, and aggression towards others. They've tried various discipline methods and therapy, which works better at the therapist's office. He's been kicked out of school, injured others, and even attacked the mother. He's diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder, which is hard to cure. The mother feels exhausted and is considering giving him back but is conflicted about whether she's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I should consider the legal and ethical aspects. Adoption is a legal process, and depending on the country's laws, the ability to relinquish a child might involve legal hurdles. The user mentioned Haiti, so I should check if international adoption has specific regulations. But since the question is more about moral responsibility rather than legal feasibility, maybe the focus is on the ethics.\n\nNext, the parents made a commitment to adopt, which is a lifelong decision. However, the child has significant behavioral issues that the parents might not have anticipated. Reactive attachment disorder (RAD) is a serious condition where a child has trouble forming emotional connections. The parents have tried everything, including therapy, but the child isn't responding well. The mother is being physically harmed, and the child is at risk of being expelled from school. This suggests that the child's needs might be beyond what the parents can handle, especially given the mother's injuries and the child's aggression.\n\nThe user is struggling with guilt because they feel they should be able to handle this as a responsible parent. However, it's important to note that even the best parents can face situations beyond their control. The child's behavior might be a result of trauma from his early life, which could affect attachment. The parents did the right thing by seeking therapy, but if it's not working, maybe they're not at fault for considering giving him back to find a better environment for both the child and themselves.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that giving up on a child with special needs is not the right choice, and that the parents should try harder. But given the severity of the situation, including physical abuse and the child's diagnosed condition, it's a complex case. The parents might not have the resources or support to handle such a challenging case. It's also possible that the child would benefit from a different environment or specialized care that the parents can't provide.\n\nI should also consider the emotional and physical toll on the parents. The mother has been injured multiple times, which is a serious issue. Their well-being is also important. If they continue to be in this situation, it could lead to further harm or burnout. The parents might be doing the best they can, but the circumstances have become unsustainable.\n\nIn conclusion, the parents are facing a very difficult situation that they might not have anticipated. They've made a good-faith effort with therapy and different parenting strategies. However, if the child's needs exceed their capacity to care for him safely and effectively, it's not necessarily the parents' fault. The key factor here is the child's well-being and the parents' ability to provide a safe environment. Given that the child is causing harm and the parents are struggling, the author might not be in the wrong for considering returning him to find a better match where he can receive the appropriate care and support.\n"
