Given my medical issues, in vitro wasn\u2019t really an option. My husband wanted to try surrogacy but in the end I pointed out that there are so many unwanted children in the world that perhaps adoption was the most selfless route. \n\nIt was a long, difficult road but we finally were able to adopt an adorable little boy from Haiti. \n\nHe was three when we got him and he\u2019s six years old now. From the outset, he\u2019s been prone to violent tantrums and he\u2019s getting stronger. He\u2019s grown so destructive we had to strip his room down so that it\u2019s just the bare essentials. \n\nWe have tried being firm, being soft, giving discipline, giving positive reinforcement, ignoring, being attentive. He\u2019s been working with a therapist for the past year and a half. He\u2019s actually fairly well behaved there. \n\nAt home and school, it\u2019s a completely different story. He\u2019s only in first grade and already at risk of expulsion. He\u2019s kicked his teacher. He used play scissors to cut a little girl\u2019s ponytail off when her back was turned (now he\u2019s lost all privileges to use them). He flooded the toilets by flushing his own clothes. \n\nWhat\u2019s worse is that I don\u2019t think he feels anything for me or for my husband. He behaves slightly better than my husband than for me but my husband is naturally loud and boisterous, even when he\u2019s not angry,so maybe that\u2019s intimidating. But with me, it\u2019s just a nightmare. I\u2019ve been punched, spat on, kicked, slapped, clawed. All by a child that I do everything for. He can be very calm and sweet but he turns so quickly. \n\nAlthough he\u2019s somewhat better after therapy, it doesn\u2019t last long. He\u2019s been diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder, and unfortunately it\u2019s not something that can really be cured. \n\nI\u2019m trying to talk myself out of feeling this way. Telling myself that good people don\u2019t consider what I\u2019m considering. I\u2019ve visited all kinds of parenting blogs and mommy forums and adoption subs (including the one here on my alt account).\n\nI\u2019m just exhausted emotionally and physically. I guess I\u2019m here because of my masochistic tendencies. I welcome your honesty. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole?) post is in the wrong for considering giving back their adopted son. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe author and her husband adopted a boy from Haiti when he was three. Now he's six and has significant behavioral issues: violent tantrums, destructive behavior, aggression towards others, and even physical abuse towards the parents. He's been diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder (RAD), which is a disorder where a child has trouble forming emotional bonds and may exhibit challenging behaviors. They've tried various strategies, therapy, and it's not working well. The parents are exhausted and considering giving the child back.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. Adoption is a legal process, and in many places, once finalized, it's difficult to reverse. The parents might need to go through legal channels like termination of parental rights, which is a serious matter. However, the question isn't about legality but moral/ethical responsibility.\n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, the parents are doing what they believe is best for their child and themselves. The child has severe issues that aren't improving, and the parents are suffering both emotionally and physically. The child isn't bonded to them, and the parents feel unable to provide the necessary care. On the other hand, sending a child back could be traumatic and affect his well-being. There's also the consideration of the child's best interest.\n\nReactive attachment disorder is complex. The child's behavior is not his fault, but the parents might feel they're not equipped to handle it. The parents have tried multiple interventions. They might feel that placing the child in a more suitable environment could be in his best interest, even if it's hard.\n\nHowever, others might argue that the parents have a responsibility to their child, especially since they've already invested so much. They might see the decision as giving up rather than continuing to seek help. The parents might also feel guilty, but they're prioritizing their own well-being, which is understandable.\n\nIn the AITA context, the community often looks at intentions. The parents' intention is to find the best outcome for the child, even if it's difficult. They've tried everything and are at a breaking point. On the other hand, the child's stability and continuity might be disrupted if they're returned. But if the current environment is harmful, then it's better for him to be in a different setting.\n\nI think the key points are the well-being of the child versus the well-being of the parents, the efforts made by the parents, and the impact of RAD. The parents aren't negligent; they've done their best. The situation is tragic, but they might not be in the wrong for considering the hardest choice.\n"
