Given my medical issues, in vitro wasn\u2019t really an option. My husband wanted to try surrogacy but in the end I pointed out that there are so many unwanted children in the world that perhaps adoption was the most selfless route. \n\nIt was a long, difficult road but we finally were able to adopt an adorable little boy from Haiti. \n\nHe was three when we got him and he\u2019s six years old now. From the outset, he\u2019s been prone to violent tantrums and he\u2019s getting stronger. He\u2019s grown so destructive we had to strip his room down so that it\u2019s just the bare essentials. \n\nWe have tried being firm, being soft, giving discipline, giving positive reinforcement, ignoring, being attentive. He\u2019s been working with a therapist for the past year and a half. He\u2019s actually fairly well behaved there. \n\nAt home and school, it\u2019s a completely different story. He\u2019s only in first grade and already at risk of expulsion. He\u2019s kicked his teacher. He used play scissors to cut a little girl\u2019s ponytail off when her back was turned (now he\u2019s lost all privileges to use them). He flooded the toilets by flushing his own clothes. \n\nWhat\u2019s worse is that I don\u2019t think he feels anything for me or for my husband. He behaves slightly better than my husband than for me but my husband is naturally loud and boisterous, even when he\u2019s not angry,so maybe that\u2019s intimidating. But with me, it\u2019s just a nightmare. I\u2019ve been punched, spat on, kicked, slapped, clawed. All by a child that I do everything for. He can be very calm and sweet but he turns so quickly. \n\nAlthough he\u2019s somewhat better after therapy, it doesn\u2019t last long. He\u2019s been diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder, and unfortunately it\u2019s not something that can really be cured. \n\nI\u2019m trying to talk myself out of feeling this way. Telling myself that good people don\u2019t consider what I\u2019m considering. I\u2019ve visited all kinds of parenting blogs and mommy forums and adoption subs (including the one here on my alt account).\n\nI\u2019m just exhausted emotionally and physically. I guess I\u2019m here because of my masochistic tendencies. I welcome your honesty. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the given situation is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). The scenario is about a parent considering giving back their adopted son due to behavioral issues.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The couple adopted a child from Haiti when they couldn't have biological children. The child has been violent, destructive, and is in therapy but still causing problems. The parent is exhausted and considering returning the child.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. The key points are the child's behavior, the parents' efforts to help, and the emotional toll. The child has reactive attachment disorder, which is hard to cure. The parents have tried various methods and therapy. The parent is struggling but is still considering giving the child back, which is a tough decision.\n\nIn terms of ethics, adoption is a lifelong commitment, but it's also about the well-being of the child and the family. If the child's behavior is harmful and the parents can't provide a safe environment, maybe it's in the child's best interest to be in a better-suited home. However, the parent feels a sense of guilt and is seeking validation.\n\nBut the question is whether the author is \"in the wrong.\" The parent is considering a difficult choice due to overwhelming circumstances. It's not necessarily wrong to consider giving the child back if it's for the child's good or the family's survival, even though it's hard. The author isn't maliciously wanting to give the child up; they're struggling and seeking advice. So, the answer would likely be B (not in the wrong).\n"
