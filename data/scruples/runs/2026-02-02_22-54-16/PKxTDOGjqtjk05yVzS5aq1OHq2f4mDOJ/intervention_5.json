      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA question is in the wrong. The situation involves dinners with his ex and son, and his current girlfriend doesn't like that she isn't included.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the facts. The author has a six-year-old child with his ex, and they have a good relationship. He sees his son regularly, sometimes every other week for dinner. Now he's dating a new girlfriend for four months. She's upset that he's having these dinners without her and calls them dates. He's not comfortable including her yet but acknowledges her feelings.\n\nHmm, so the main issue here is whether it's wrong to spend time with his son and ex without involving his girlfriend. Well, visiting his child is a parental right, not a romantic one. The ex is the custodial parent, so the author's right to see his son isn't conditional on his girlfriend's approval. The girlfriend's discomfort might stem from insecurity or fear of being compared to the ex or not being included early on. But is that the author's fault?\n\nI think the key points here are: 1) The dinners are necessary for his relationship with his son. 2) The girlfriend's request to be included might be reasonable in a long-term relationship but could be premature at four months. 3) The author is being honest about not wanting to include her yet but is open to it in the future.\n\nThe author isn't doing anything unethical here. He's maintaining a bond with his child, which is important. The girlfriend's feelings are valid, but he's not obligated to include her in every aspect of his life immediately. Maybe communication between them is needed to address her concerns without forcing inclusion. So, I don't see the author as being in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
