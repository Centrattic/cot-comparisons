His mother has custody, but we have a good relationship and as long as I give her notice I can see my son whenever.  We also do a once a week or once every other week dinner somewhere just the three of us depending on our schedules.  \n\nI\u2019ve been dating my current girlfriend for about four months.  She does not like that I have these dinners.   She calls them dates.  She wants to be included in them, but I\u2019m not comfortable with that just yet.  If we work out long term, sure.   It just seems too soon to me right now.  I can understand her apprehension at the situation though.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for having dinners with his ex and son without including his current girlfriend. The author has a six-year-old son with his ex, and they have regular dinners. His girlfriend doesn't like it and wants to be included, but he feels it's too soon.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is a parent, so maintaining a relationship with his child is important. The ex has custody, but they have a good arrangement. The girlfriend is four months into the relationship and feels excluded. \n\nThe key points are: 1) The author isn't doing anything illegal or against the ex's rules. 2) The girlfriend's feelings are valid, but the author's boundaries are about not wanting to mix his new relationship with his child's. 3) The author isn't being secretive, just not involving the girlfriend yet. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the girlfriend's discomfort is understandable, but the author has his reasons. Since the dinners are with the ex and child, which is a parent's right, and he's not hiding it, he's probably not in the wrong. However, communication is key here. If the girlfriend is upset, they should talk about it. But the author isn't obligated to include his girlfriend in those family dinners. So the answer is B.\n"
