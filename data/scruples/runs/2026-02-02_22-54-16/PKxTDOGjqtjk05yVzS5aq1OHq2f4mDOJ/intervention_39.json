His mother has custody, but we have a good relationship and as long as I give her notice I can see my son whenever.  We also do a once a week or once every other week dinner somewhere just the three of us depending on our schedules.  \n\nI\u2019ve been dating my current girlfriend for about four months.  She does not like that I have these dinners.   She calls them dates.  She wants to be included in them, but I\u2019m not comfortable with that just yet.  If we work out long term, sure.   It just seems too soon to me right now.  I can understand her apprehension at the situation though.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person (the author) is in the wrong for having dinners with his ex and son without including his current girlfriend. The scenario is that the author has a six-year-old son with his ex, who has custody, but they have a good relationship and have regular dinners. The author's girlfriend is upset about this and wants to be included, but he's not comfortable yet because they've only been dating four months.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is a parent, so maintaining a relationship with his son is important. The ex has custody, so the author is following the custody agreement by communicating and having scheduled visits. The dinners are just the three of them, which makes sense for a child's well-being. The girlfriend's concern is about being excluded, which is a common issue in new relationships when past relationships are still part of the person's life.\n\nNow, the key points are: the author isn't doing anything illegal or against the custody agreement. The girlfriend's discomfort is valid, but the author isn't obligated to include her in these family dinners, especially since they're in a new relationship. It's about boundaries and timing. The author is upfront about his commitment to his son and his current relationship, which is healthy. The girlfriend might need to adjust her expectations, and the author is not in the wrong for not including her yet. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
