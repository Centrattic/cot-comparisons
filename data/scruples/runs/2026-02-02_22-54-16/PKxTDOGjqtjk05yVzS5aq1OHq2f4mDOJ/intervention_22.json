      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The scenario is about a guy having dinners with his ex and their son without including his current girlfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author sees his son regularly, which is allowed under custody arrangements. The dinners are every week or every other week, just the three of them. The girlfriend, who's been dating him for four months, doesn't like this and wants to be included. He's not comfortable with that yet but acknowledges her feelings.\n\nNow, legal custody isn't the issue here; it's about the girlfriend's feelings. The author is in a new relationship and feels it's too soon to include her in these family dinners. The ex has custody, so she's the one facilitating the visits. The girlfriend is calling the dinners \"dates,\" which might be a misinterpretation. The author is trying to balance his responsibilities as a father with his new relationship.\n\nI need to consider societal norms. It's common for non-custodial parents to have regular visits with their children, which are necessary for the child's well-being. The girlfriend's request to be included might stem from insecurity, but the author has a right to prioritize his parental relationship with his son. However, communication is key. The author should be clear about his intentions and the nature of these dinners to avoid misunderstandings.\n\nThe girlfriend's feelings are valid, but the author isn't necessarily being inconsiderate. He's not in the wrong if he's being honest and respectful. The dinners are for the child, not romantic, so the girlfriend's discomfort might need to be addressed through dialogue. The answer hinges on whether the author is being fair and communicative. Since he's not including the girlfriend out of malice but due to the situation, he's likely not in the wrong.\n\nSo, the answer should be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
