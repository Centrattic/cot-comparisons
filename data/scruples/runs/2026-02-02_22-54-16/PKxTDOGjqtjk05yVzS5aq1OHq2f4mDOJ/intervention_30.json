His mother has custody, but we have a good relationship and as long as I give her notice I can see my son whenever.  We also do a once a week or once every other week dinner somewhere just the three of us depending on our schedules.  \n\nI\u2019ve been dating my current girlfriend for about four months.  She does not like that I have these dinners.   She calls them dates.  She wants to be included in them, but I\u2019m not comfortable with that just yet.  If we work out long term, sure.   It just seems too soon to me right now.  I can understand her apprehension at the situation though.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for having dinners with their ex and son without including their current girlfriend. \n\nFirst, the author has a six-year-old son with custody to the ex. They have regular dinners, which are not unusual for co-parenting arrangements. The ex and the author share a good relationship, and the dinners are about the child, not a date. The girlfriend is upset because she feels left out, but the author isn't comfortable including her yet.\n\nI need to consider the dynamics here. The key point is whether the dinners are appropriate. Since they're for the child and not a romantic setting, the author isn't doing anything wrong. The girlfriend's discomfort is valid, but the author isn't obligated to include her in these family dinners. It's about co-parenting, not dating the ex. The author's hesitation to include the girlfriend is reasonable because it's too soon. So the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
