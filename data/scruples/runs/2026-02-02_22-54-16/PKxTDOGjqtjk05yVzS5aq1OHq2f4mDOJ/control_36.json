      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person is in the wrong for having dinners with their ex and their son without including their current girlfriend. \n\nFirst, the situation: The person has a 6-year-old son, and the ex has custody. They have a good relationship with the ex and can see the son whenever if they give notice. They have weekly or bi-weekly dinners with the ex and the son. Now, the current girlfriend, who they've been dating for four months, doesn't like that and calls them dates. She wants to be included, but the author isn't comfortable with that yet.\n\nI need to consider the dynamics here. The author is in a new relationship, so four months isn't that long. The dinners with the ex and son are likely for the child's well-being. However, the girlfriend's feelings are being hurt, which is a valid concern. The key points are:\n\n1. **Communication and Comfort**: The author isn't comfortable including the girlfriend yet. That's their right, but they should communicate this clearly. If the girlfriend feels excluded, maybe the author should explain why these dinners are for the child and not a romantic date.\n\n2. **Timing of Inclusion**: Four months is a short time in a relationship. Expecting the author to include the new girlfriend in family time might be too soon. However, if the girlfriend is his current partner, some level of inclusion might be expected, especially if it's a regular occurrence.\n\n3. **Intent of the Dinners**: The dinners are with the ex and son, which is standard for co-parenting. The girlfriend might be misinterpreting the dinners as the author still being close or intimate with the ex, which could be a red flag if that's the case. But if the author is maintaining a platonic, co-parenting relationship, then it's reasonable.\n\n4. **Respect and Boundaries**: The author should respect the girlfriend's feelings but also set boundaries that make them comfortable. There's a balance here between respecting the new relationship and maintaining necessary family routines.\n\nPotential issues: If the author is intentionally keeping the ex involved in a way that could be seen as undermining the current relationship, that's a problem. But if the dinners are purely for the child's benefit and the author has been upfront about it, then the girlfriend might need to adjust her expectations. \n\nThe author isn't wrong if they're being honest and the dinners are for the child. However, if they haven't communicated clearly or if the dinners are more about their ex than the child, then maybe they are in the wrong. Since the user mentions they have a good relationship with the ex and that the dinners are scheduled with notice, it seems more about co-parenting. \n\nBut the girlfriend's inclusion expectation might stem from a desire to feel part of their life. The author should discuss this to address her concerns without compromising their relationship with the child. So, the answer might be that the author isn't in the wrong, but they should consider the girlfriend's feelings and communicate better.\n"
