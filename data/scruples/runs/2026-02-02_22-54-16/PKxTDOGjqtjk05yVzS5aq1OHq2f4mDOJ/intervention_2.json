We also do a once a week or once every other week dinner somewhere just the three of us depending on our schedules.  \n\nI\u2019ve been dating my current girlfriend for about four months.  She does not like that I have these dinners.   She calls them dates.  She wants to be included in them, but I\u2019m not comfortable with that just yet.  If we work out long term, sure.   It just seems too soon to me right now.  I can understand her apprehension at the situation though.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for having dinners with their ex and son without including their current girlfriend. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author has a six-year-old son with joint custody, and they have regular dinners with the ex and the child. The girlfriend, after four months, is uncomfortable with these dinners and wants to be included. The author feels it's too soon for that.\n\nI need to consider a few factors. The primary relationship here is between the author and their current partner. The dinners with the ex are part of maintaining a relationship with their child, which is a significant responsibility. However, the girlfriend feels left out, which could indicate a communication issue or differing expectations about commitment.\n\nFrom a general perspective, it's common for people to have boundaries, especially in new relationships. The author might not be wrong in setting those boundaries, especially since the child is involved. On the other hand, the girlfriend's feelings are valid too; she might feel insecure or not respected if the author isn't including her in important family time.\n\nBut the key points here are that the dinners are with the ex and son, not a romantic setup. The author is maintaining a necessary relationship for their child. The girlfriend's desire to be included could be a test of commitment, but four months is a short time, and it's reasonable for the author to want to maintain the current dynamic until the relationship is more secure.\n\nAlso, the ex's role here is as a parent, not a romantic partner. The author is fulfilling their parental duties, which is a separate issue from the romantic relationship. The girlfriend's discomfort might stem from insecurity rather than the situation itself. The author isn't doing anything unethical or legally wrong by spending time with their son.\n\nIn conclusion, while the girlfriend's feelings are important and should be addressed through communication, the author isn't in the wrong for maintaining their existing arrangement with the ex and child. The answer should be B.\n"
