His mother has custody, but we have a good relationship and as long as I give her notice I can see my son whenever.  We also do a once a week or once every other week dinner somewhere just the three of us depending on our schedules.  \n\nI\u2019ve been dating my current girlfriend for about four months.  She does not like that I have these dinners.   She calls them dates.  She wants to be included in them, but I\u2019m not comfortable with that just yet.  If we work out long term, sure.   It just seems too soon to me right now.  I can understand her apprehension at the situation though.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The user is asking for my opinion on whether the person who wrote the scenario is at fault.\n\nFirst, the situation: the author has a six-year-old son with his ex, and they have regular dinners together. Now, he's dating a new girlfriend who's upset because he's not including her in these dinners. He's been with her four months and doesn't feel comfortable bringing her along yet. The ex has custody but they have a good relationship. The girlfriend calls the dinners \"dates\" and wants to be included, but the author thinks it's too soon.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about boundaries, expectations in a new relationship, and co-parenting. The author is spending time with his son, which is a parental responsibility. The ex is the custodial parent, so maybe the dinners are part of the custody arrangement. The girlfriend's issue is about inclusion, but the author feels it's not the right time. \n\nI need to consider both sides. The author might not be wrong because he's prioritizing his child and hasn't introduced the girlfriend yet. In new relationships, people often take time before introducing each other to family or significant others. The girlfriend's discomfort could stem from insecurity or wanting to be part of his life, but his hesitation is reasonable. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might feel that his ongoing dinners with the ex could affect the relationship, especially if there's a perception of lingering emotional ties. But the author is clear that he's committed to the new relationship long-term if it works out. The ex has custody, so the arrangement is about the child's well-being, not necessarily about the author's personal life. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong here. He's being respectful to his child and ex, maintaining a necessary relationship for the child's upbringing. The girlfriend's feelings are valid, but his decision to wait is a personal choice that's common in new relationships. So the answer should be B.\n"
