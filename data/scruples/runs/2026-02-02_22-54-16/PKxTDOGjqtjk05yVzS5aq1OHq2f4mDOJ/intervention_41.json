      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for having dinners with their ex and son without including their current girlfriend.\n\nSo, the situation: the author has a six-year-old son, and the ex has custody. They have a good co-parenting relationship and have regular dinners just the three of them (author, ex, son). The current girlfriend, who's been dating for four months, doesn't like this and calls them dates, wanting to be included. The author isn't comfortable with that yet but acknowledges the girlfriend's feelings.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The dinners are with the ex and son, which is a co-parenting arrangement. The girlfriend is upset because she's not included. The author is in a four-month relationship and feels it's too soon to involve the girlfriend in these dinners. The ex has custody, so the author might be spending more time with the son as part of their parenting agreement.\n\nCo-parenting is important for the child's well-being, and the author is maintaining a positive relationship with the ex for that purpose. The girlfriend's request to be included might be coming from a place of feeling left out or insecure. The author's reasoning is that it's too soon, which is a common sentiment in relationships. There's no mention of the ex trying to exclude the father or the girlfriend being a mother figure in the son's life, which complicates things. However, the primary issue here is the girlfriend's discomfort versus the author's need to maintain co-parenting.\n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong for not including the girlfriend. The answer depends on context. If the dinners are strictly for co-parenting and the son's benefit, the author isn't obligated to include the girlfriend. However, if the girlfriend is feeling that these dinners are a form of attention the author is giving the ex that they wish to receive, that's a different angle. But the author is in a new relationship, and four months is a short time. It's reasonable to set boundaries, especially if the girlfriend is not part of the child's legal guardianship.\n\nAlso, the author does acknowledge the girlfriend's feelings, which shows they're considerate. The girlfriend might need to communicate her concerns more effectively or understand the co-parenting necessity. Since the author isn't doing anything that harms the son or violates agreements, and the girlfriend's issue is more about their relationship dynamics, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer is B.\n"
