      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author having dinners with their ex and son, and the current girlfriend is upset because she wants to be included. The author has been dating the girlfriend for four months and isn't comfortable including her yet.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author has a six-year-old son and a good relationship with the ex. Since the ex has custody, the author's visits are likely regular and necessary for the child's well-being. The dinners are just the three of them, which makes sense for a young child. \n\nNow, the girlfriend is upset because she feels excluded. She perceives the dinners as dates, which might be a misunderstanding. The author is in a four-month relationship and isn't ready to bring the girlfriend into these family dinners. That seems reasonable because building trust and comfort in a new relationship takes time. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the author isn't doing anything illegal or unethical. They're maintaining a relationship with their child, which is important. The girlfriend's feelings are valid, but the author isn't obligated to include a new partner in family matters immediately. It's about communication. The author should talk to the girlfriend to explain the situation and set boundaries, but that doesn't mean they're wrong for not including her yet. \n\nAlso, considering that the ex has custody, the author's visits are part of their parenting arrangement. The girlfriend might need to adjust her expectations if the author isn't ready to integrate her into family time. The key here is that the author's actions are about their child, not about the new relationship. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer is B. The author isn't in the wrong for wanting to take things slow with the girlfriend regarding family dinners. They have a right to maintain their relationship with their child without pressure from a new partner to be included immediately. Communication is important, but the author isn't at fault here.\n"
