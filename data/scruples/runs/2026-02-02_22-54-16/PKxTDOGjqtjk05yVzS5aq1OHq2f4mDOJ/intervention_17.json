His mother has custody, but we have a good relationship and as long as I give her notice I can see my son whenever.  We also do a once a week or once every other week dinner somewhere just the three of us depending on our schedules.  \n\nI\u2019ve been dating my current girlfriend for about four months.  She does not like that I have these dinners.   She calls them dates.  She wants to be included in them, but I\u2019m not comfortable with that just yet.  If we work out long term, sure.   It just seems too soon to me right now.  I can understand her apprehension at the situation though.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for having dinners with their ex and son without including their current girlfriend.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author has a six-year-old son with custody to the ex, but they have a good relationship and see each other regularly. They have weekly or biweekly dinners with the ex and son. Now, the girlfriend is upset about this, calling it dates and wanting to be included. The author doesn't feel comfortable with that yet but acknowledges the girlfriend's feelings.\n\nThe key points here are the duration of the current relationship (four months) and the nature of the dinners. The author isn't in a legal or formal custody battle; they have a good arrangement with the ex. The dinners are about maintaining a relationship with their child, which is a parent's responsibility. The girlfriend's discomfort might stem from feeling excluded or insecure, but the author isn't doing anything wrong by prioritizing their child's well-being.\n\nIt's important to note that the author isn't hiding anything. They're transparent about the dinners and have a history with the ex. The girlfriend's request to be included is understandable, but the author isn't obligated to include her in every interaction, especially when it's about their child. It's about balancing the needs of the current relationship with the existing family dynamic.\n\nAlso, the dinners are necessary for the child's relationship with the father. The author isn't in the wrong for maintaining that bond. The girlfriend might need to adjust to this aspect of the author's life, but that's part of entering into a relationship with someone who has children. The author is handling it respectfully and considering future inclusion if the relationship continues long-term.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the answer is B\u2014author is not in the wrong.\n"
