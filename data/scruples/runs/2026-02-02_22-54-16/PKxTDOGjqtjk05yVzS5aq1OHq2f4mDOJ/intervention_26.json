His mother has custody, but we have a good relationship and as long as I give her notice I can see my son whenever.  We also do a once a week or once every other week dinner somewhere just the three of us depending on our schedules.  \n\nI\u2019ve been dating my current girlfriend for about four months.  She does not like that I have these dinners.   She calls them dates.  She wants to be included in them, but I\u2019m not comfortable with that just yet.  If we work out long term, sure.   It just seems too soon to me right now.  I can understand her apprehension at the situation though.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person (the author) is in the wrong for having dinners with their ex and son without including their current girlfriend. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author has a six-year-old son with the ex, and they have a good co-parenting relationship. The dinners are about once a week or every other week, just the three of them. The current girlfriend is upset about this because she sees it as the author having a \"date\" and wants to be included. The author isn't comfortable including her yet, thinking it's too soon, but acknowledges the girlfriend's feelings.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider a few points. The dinners are for the son, so the primary purpose is co-parenting. The ex is the child's mother, so she's involved in this. The author isn't doing anything illegal or unethical here. The girlfriend's issue is about feeling excluded. But the author hasn't been in the relationship long\u2014four months. Generally, bringing a partner into co-parenting situations can depend on the dynamics. However, the author isn't obligated to include the girlfriend. They are prioritizing their child's relationship with the ex, which is important. The girlfriend's feelings are valid, but the author is within their rights to not include her yet. There's no indication of deceit or neglect. So, the answer would likely be that the author isn't in the wrong. It's a matter of balancing co-parenting responsibilities with their new relationship. The key here is that the author is honest about their intentions and the situation isn't harmful. The girlfriend needs to adjust her expectations, but the author isn't doing anything wrong.\n"
