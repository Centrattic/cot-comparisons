His mother has custody, but we have a good relationship and as long as I give her notice I can see my son whenever.  We also do a once a week or once every other week dinner somewhere just the three of us depending on our schedules.  \n\nI\u2019ve been dating my current girlfriend for about four months.  She does not like that I have these dinners.   She calls them dates.  She wants to be included in them, but I\u2019m not comfortable with that just yet.  If we work out long term, sure.   It just seems too soon to me right now.  I can understand her apprehension at the situation though.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for having dinners with their ex and son without including their current girlfriend.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author has a six-year-old son with custody to the ex. They have regular dinners just the three of them (author, ex, son). The girlfriend is upset because she feels these dinners are like dates and wants to be included. The author isn't comfortable with that yet but acknowledges the girlfriend's feelings.\n\nSo, the key points here are the relationships involved. The author is the parent, so maintaining a relationship with their child is important. The ex is the child's mother, and they have a good relationship. The dinners are about the child, not a romantic date. The current girlfriend is new, four months in, and feels left out.\n\nLegally, the author has the right to see their child, and the ex has custody but cooperates. The dinners are part of the father-son bonding, which is normal. The girlfriend's discomfort might come from jealousy or insecurity, which is understandable but not necessarily the author's fault. The author is being honest about not wanting to include the girlfriend yet, which shows they're considering the situation.\n\nIn terms of social norms, it's typical for a parent to have time with their child and the other parent. The girlfriend's desire to be included might be a communication issue. The author isn't doing anything wrong by maintaining their relationship with their son. The problem here is more about the girlfriend's feelings rather than the author's actions. So, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
