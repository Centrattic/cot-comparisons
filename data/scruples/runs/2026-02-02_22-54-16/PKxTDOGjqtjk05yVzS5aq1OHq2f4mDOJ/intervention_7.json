We also do a once a week or once every other week dinner somewhere just the three of us depending on our schedules.  \n\nI\u2019ve been dating my current girlfriend for about four months.

It just seems too soon to me right now.  I can understand her apprehension at the situation though.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for having dinners with his ex and son without including his current girlfriend. The situation involves a six-year-old son, custody arrangements, and a new relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author has a good relationship with his ex and sees his son regularly. They have weekly or biweekly dinners as a three-person group. The girlfriend, who's been dating him for four months, is upset because she feels left out and calls these dinners dates. She wants to be included, but the author isn't comfortable with that yet. He's willing to include her if they stay together long-term.\n\nNow, evaluating if he's in the wrong. The author is fulfilling his role as a father by spending time with his son, which is important. The ex has custody, so the author's visits are presumably agreed upon. The girlfriend's discomfort might stem from feeling insecure or not being included in his family life. But the author has the right to maintain his relationship with his child, especially if it's been established and the ex is cooperative.\n\nHowever, communication is key in relationships. The author might need to address his girlfriend's feelings and explain his reasons. But does that mean he's in the wrong? Probably not. Prioritizing his child's well-being is valid. The issue here is more about the girlfriend adjusting to the dynamics of a new relationship involving an ex-partner and child. The author isn't doing anything against the law or violating any explicit agreement, as long as the dinners are approved by the ex and don't interfere with custody terms.\n\nThe girlfriend might need time to adjust or the author could find a way to include her gradually, but the author isn't wrong for wanting to maintain his bond with his son. It's a common situation where new relationships can clash with existing family structures, but the author's actions seem reasonable and considerate of his child's needs.\n"
