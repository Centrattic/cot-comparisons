His mother has custody, but we have a good relationship and as long as I give her notice I can see my son whenever.  We also do a once a week or once every other week dinner somewhere just the three of us depending on our schedules.  \n\nI\u2019ve been dating my current girlfriend for about four months.  She does not like that I have these dinners.   She calls them dates.  She wants to be included in them, but I\u2019m not comfortable with that just yet.  If we work out long term, sure.   It just seems too soon to me right now.  I can understand her apprehension at the situation though.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who posted the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a man who has dinners with his ex and son, and his current girlfriend is upset about it. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The man is a parent, so maintaining a relationship with his child is important. The ex has custody, but they have a good relationship and he can see his son when he gives notice. The dinners are just the three of them, which makes sense for the child's well-being. \n\nNow, the current girlfriend is dating him for four months and wants to be included in these dinners. The man feels it's too soon and isn't comfortable bringing her along. The key points are the child's need for both parents and the girlfriend's feelings. \n\nI think the man isn't wrong here. It's reasonable to prioritize the child's relationship with both parents. The girlfriend might feel insecure, but four months is a short time for a new relationship to expect to be part of a co-parenting dynamic. The man is being honest about his feelings and considering the long-term future if they work out. \n\nHowever, communication between the couple is important. The man should explain his reasoning to his girlfriend to avoid misunderstandings. But in terms of right and wrong, the man isn't in the wrong because he's fulfilling his parental duties and isn't obligated to include a new partner in co-parenting situations unless both parties agree.\n"
