His mother has custody, but we have a good relationship and as long as I give her notice I can see my son whenever.  We also do a once a week or once every other week dinner somewhere just the three of us depending on our schedules.  \n\nI\u2019ve been dating my current girlfriend for about four months.  She does not like that I have these dinners.   She calls them dates.  She wants to be included in them, but I\u2019m not comfortable with that just yet.  If we work out long term, sure.   It just seems too soon to me right now.  I can understand her apprehension at the situation though.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author has dinners with their ex and son, and the current girlfriend doesn't like it. She calls them dates and wants to be included. The author is four months into the relationship and isn't comfortable including her yet. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is a parent with custody arrangements. It's common for parents to have regular contact with their children, even after separation. The dinners are just the three of them\u2014author, ex, and son. The girlfriend is upset because she feels excluded and thinks these dinners are like dates. \n\nNow, four months into a relationship is still early. It's reasonable for the author to want to maintain the existing routine with their child and ex. Including a new partner in such a setting might feel too soon. The girlfriend's feelings are valid, but the author isn't obligated to include her in every family activity right away. Communication is key. The author should explain why they're maintaining the dinners and set boundaries, but that doesn't mean they're in the wrong for not including the girlfriend yet.\n\nThe ex's role here is also important. If the ex is the custodial parent and they've agreed on the visitation, it's part of the parenting agreement. The girlfriend's discomfort might stem from insecurity or fear of being compared to the ex. The author should address her concerns without guilt, but the core issue is about maintaining a healthy co-parenting relationship versus new relationship boundaries.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Probably not. The dinners are about the child, not a date. The girlfriend needs to adjust or communicate her needs, but the author isn't at fault for not including her yet. The answer should be B.\n"
