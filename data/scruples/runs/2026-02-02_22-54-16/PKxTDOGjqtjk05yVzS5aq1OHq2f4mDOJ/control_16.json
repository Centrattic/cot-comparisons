It just seems too soon to me right now.  I can understand her apprehension at the situation though.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the query is in the wrong for having dinners with their ex and son without including their current girlfriend.\n\nFirst, the situation: the author has a six-year-old son with custody to the ex, and they have a good relationship. They have regular dinners with the ex and the child. Now, the author is dating a new girlfriend for four months, and she's uncomfortable with these dinners, calling them dates. The author isn't ready to include her yet but acknowledges her feelings.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is wrong. Let's break it down.\n\nThe author's actions: They are fulfilling their role as a parent, maintaining a relationship with their child. That's a fundamental responsibility. The ex is involved because of the child, not for romantic reasons. The girlfriend's issue is that she's not included, which is a valid concern because transparency and inclusion in a new relationship can be important.\n\nBut how long have they been dating? Four months is still early. The author isn't in a rush to include the girlfriend, which is reasonable. The key here is the timing and the nature of the dinners. The dinners are family time, not dates with the ex. The ex is part of the child's life, so it's not the author's fault they have a past relationship.\n\nHowever, the girlfriend's discomfort is valid. Maybe the author should communicate more clearly that these dinners are for the child, not a romantic rendezvous. But is the author wrong? They're maintaining their child's well-being, which is important. The girlfriend needs to understand boundaries, but the author isn't wrong for prioritizing their child's needs.\n\nAlso, the author mentions giving notice to the ex, which shows cooperation. The dinners are scheduled based on everyone's availability. The girlfriend's jealousy might be about being included, but it's not the author's fault they have a child with an ex.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong. They're doing what's right for their child, and the girlfriend needs to adjust her expectations given the circumstances. The answer should be B.\n"
