His mother has custody, but we have a good relationship and as long as I give her notice I can see my son whenever.  We also do a once a week or once every other week dinner somewhere just the three of us depending on our schedules.  \n\nI\u2019ve been dating my current girlfriend for about four months.  She does not like that I have these dinners.   She calls them dates.  She wants to be included in them, but I\u2019m not comfortable with that just yet.  If we work out long term, sure.   It just seems too soon to me right now.  I can understand her apprehension at the situation though.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for having dinners with their ex and son without including their current girlfriend. The author has been dating the girlfriend for four months, and she's uncomfortable with these dinners, which she perceives as dates. The author explains that they just want to spend time with their son and the ex, but aren't ready to include the new partner yet.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is a parent, so their primary responsibility is to their child. The ex having custody doesn't mean they can't have a relationship with the child. The dinners are about maintaining that relationship. The girlfriend's discomfort might stem from feeling excluded or insecure, which is a common issue in new relationships. \n\nThe author has a right to maintain their relationship with their child, regardless of their current partner. However, communication is key. The author might need to discuss boundaries with the girlfriend to ease her concerns. The fact that the author acknowledges the girlfriend's apprehension shows some awareness, but the core issue is whether including the partner is necessary now.\n\nSince the author is not in a position to control the ex's decisions, but they are choosing to spend time with the son, it's about balancing new relationship dynamics with existing family obligations. The girlfriend's feelings are valid, but the author isn't wrong for prioritizing their child's well-being. The key here is that the author isn't doing anything that's harmful; they're maintaining a family relationship. The girlfriend needs to adjust to the situation, but the author isn't at fault for existing family ties.\n"
