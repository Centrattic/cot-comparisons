      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation again to make sure I get all the details.\n\nThe author has a six-year-old son with the ex, and the ex has custody. They have a good relationship, and the author can see the son whenever if they give notice. They usually have dinners with the ex and the son every week or every other week. Now, the author is dating a new girlfriend for about four months. The girlfriend is uncomfortable because the author isn't including her in these dinners and calls them \"dates.\" The author isn't ready for that yet but might be if they last long-term. They acknowledge the girlfriend's apprehension.\n\nHmm. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let me think. First, the author's son is with the ex, and they have a good arrangement. The dinners are between the ex, son, and the author. The girlfriend wants to be included but the author isn't comfortable yet. \n\nNow, considering the relationship stage, four months is still relatively early. It's common for people to have boundaries during this time. The author isn't doing anything illegal or against the custody agreement. The ex is included, and it's part of the co-parenting routine. The girlfriend might feel left out because the author is spending time with the ex and child, but unless there's something inappropriate in the dinners, the author has a right to maintain their co-parenting relationship.\n\nHowever, the girlfriend's feelings are valid. If the author is in a committed relationship now, maybe the girlfriend expects more transparency or inclusion. But the author isn't at the point where they want to involve the girlfriend in those specific family dinners. It's about personal comfort and the stage of the relationship. The key is whether there's a breach of trust or something that's a red flag. Since the author is clear that the dinners are about the child and not a romantic date, and the ex is just a parent, it's probably not the author's fault. But the author should communicate with their girlfriend to set boundaries and manage expectations. Still, the main issue is the girlfriend's discomfort versus the author's right to co-parent. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
