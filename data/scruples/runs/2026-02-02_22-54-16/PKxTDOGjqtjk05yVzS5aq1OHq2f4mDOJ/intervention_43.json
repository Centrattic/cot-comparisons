      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully. The user is asking about whether the author is the asshole for having dinners with their ex and son without including their current girlfriend.\n\nThe author has a six-year-old son with the ex, and they have a good relationship. The ex has custody, but the author can see the son whenever they give notice. They do these dinners once a week or every other week, just the three of them. The current girlfriend, however, is upset about this. She calls the dinners dates and wants to be included. The author isn't comfortable with that yet, thinking it's too soon since they've only been dating four months. They understand the girlfriend's apprehension but don't want to include her in those family meals right now.\n\nHmm. Let's break this down. The key points here are the child's well-being, the author's relationship with the ex, and the current girlfriend's feelings. First, the author is maintaining a relationship with their son, which is generally seen as a positive and responsible thing, especially since the ex has custody. These dinners are for the child, not just the author and ex. The ex isn't the one in the current relationship; the girlfriend is the new partner. \n\nNow, the girlfriend is four months into the relationship and is uncomfortable because the author is spending time with the ex and child without her. The author is in a new relationship and might not feel ready to include the girlfriend in those family activities. But where's the line between normal dating and what's considered respectful to the new partner? \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author has a valid point that it's early in the relationship and they might need time to adjust. However, the girlfriend's feelings matter too. If the author were to have dinner with their ex and son, maybe the girlfriend feels left out or worried about the author's commitment. But the author's intention here is to spend time with their son, which is a parental right and responsibility. \n\nIs it wrong to not include the girlfriend yet? It depends on the context. If the author had started the dinners after the girlfriend came into the picture, that might be different. But since these dinners have been happening as part of the existing custody arrangement, maybe it's not the author's fault. The girlfriend might need to adjust to the existing family dynamics. However, if the author is making a habit of doing this and it's causing the girlfriend distress without any consideration, that could be a different story. \n\nI should also consider if the author is being transparent. They mention that the ex has custody and that they have a good arrangement. The author isn't hiding the dinners; they just aren't including their new partner yet. The girlfriend might feel that the author is prioritizing old relationships over the new one, but the author's actions are focused on their child. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the girlfriend has a right to feel insecure. Four months is a short time, and if the author is spending quality time with their ex and child, the girlfriend might perceive that as a lack of interest in building a new family dynamic. But the author's stance is that they need time, which is reasonable. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because the primary reason for the dinners is the son, and the relationship with the ex is part of a custody agreement. However, the author should communicate with the girlfriend and perhaps consider her feelings. If the girlfriend is really uncomfortable, maybe the author could involve their partner in some way when possible, but it's not a requirement. The author's discomfort with including the girlfriend is valid given the timing, and the ex isn't the girlfriend's issue. The main thing is ensuring that the son's well-being is the priority. So, the answer would likely be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
