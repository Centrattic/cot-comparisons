We also do a once a week or once every other week dinner somewhere just the three of us depending on our schedules.  \n\nI\u2019ve been dating my current girlfriend for about four months.  She does not like that I have these dinners.   She calls them dates.  She wants to be included in them, but I\u2019m not comfortable with that just yet.  If we work out long term, sure.   It just seems too soon to me right now.  I can understand her apprehension at the situation though.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for having dinners with their ex and son without including their current girlfriend.\n\nFirst, the key points from the scenario: The person is a father with a six-year-old son, and they have a good relationship with the ex. They have dinners with the ex and son regularly. The current girlfriend is dating him for four months and is upset because she feels these dinners are like dates and wants to be included. The author isn't comfortable with that yet but acknowledges the girlfriend's feelings.\n\nI need to determine if the author is wrong. Let's consider the context. The dinners are with the ex and son, which are child-related. The mother (ex) has custody, and the father's involvement is part of the child's life. The current girlfriend's issue is that she feels excluded. \n\nIs it wrong to not include her yet? Well, the author has a right to maintain their relationship with their child. The dinners aren't romantic dates, they're family dinners. The girlfriend's discomfort is valid, but the father isn't obligated to include her unless they choose to. Since the relationship is only four months old, it's reasonable for the father to feel it's too soon to involve her in family time. \n\nThe author is being honest about their feelings and considering the girlfriend's perspective. The ex's role is as a parent, not a romantic partner. So, the author isn't wrong for not involving the girlfriend yet. The key is mutual respect and communication. The girlfriend might need to be reassured that these dinners are about the child, not a date. \n\nSo, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
