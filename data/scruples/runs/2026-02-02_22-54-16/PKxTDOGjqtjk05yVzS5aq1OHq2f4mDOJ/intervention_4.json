His mother has custody, but we have a good relationship and as long as I give her notice I can see my son whenever.  We also do a once a week or once every other week dinner somewhere just the three of us depending on our schedules.  \n\nI\u2019ve been dating my current girlfriend for about four months.  She does not like that I have these dinners.   She calls them dates.  She wants to be included in them, but I\u2019m not comfortable with that just yet.  If we work out long term, sure.   It just seems too soon to me right now.  I can understand her apprehension at the situation though.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for having dinners with their ex and son without including their current girlfriend.\n\nFirst, the author is spending time with their son, which is their right. The ex has custody, but the author has a good relationship and follows the custody arrangement by giving notice. The dinners are just the three of them, which is common for co-parenting situations. \n\nThe girlfriend has been dating for four months and doesn't like that the author is having these dinners. She refers to them as dates and wants to be included. The author feels it's too soon to include her in those family dinners. \n\nNow, considering the dynamics: The author is fulfilling their role as a parent by being present for their son. The girlfriend is expressing jealousy, which is understandable in a relationship, but the author isn't obligated to include her in every aspect of their life, especially family time with an ex. \n\nIt's important to note that the author isn't doing anything wrong by maintaining a relationship with their child. The girlfriend's discomfort might stem from insecurity, but the author hasn't broken any rules or disrespected their current partner by continuing to co-parent. \n\nHowever, communication is key here. The author not discussing this with the girlfriend could be a point of contention, but the scenario doesn't indicate that the author is hiding it. They acknowledge the girlfriend's feelings and are willing to consider changing in the future if the relationship lasts. \n\nIn relationships, boundaries are important. The author is setting a boundary by not including the girlfriend yet, which is valid. The girlfriend's reaction might be about feeling left out, but the author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing their child's relationship and respecting the co-parenting agreement. \n\nSo, the answer should be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. They're maintaining a necessary family relationship, and the girlfriend's feelings don't negate that right. The key is that the author isn't doing anything that harms the current relationship, just managing a family dynamic.\n"
