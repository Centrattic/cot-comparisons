His mother has custody, but we have a good relationship and as long as I give her notice I can see my son whenever.  We also do a once a week or once every other week dinner somewhere just the three of us depending on our schedules.  \n\nI\u2019ve been dating my current girlfriend for about four months.  She does not like that I have these dinners.   She calls them dates.  She wants to be included in them, but I\u2019m not comfortable with that just yet.  If we work out long term, sure.   It just seems too soon to me right now.  I can understand her apprehension at the situation though.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for having dinners with their ex and son without including their current girlfriend. The author has a six-year-old son with his ex, who has custody, and they have regular dinners. The girlfriend is upset about it, calls them dates, wants to be included, but the author isn't comfortable yet.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is a parent, so maintaining a relationship with their child is important. The ex is involved in these dinners, but maybe that's just part of the custody arrangement. The girlfriend is new, four months, and she's feeling left out. \n\nThe key points here are communication and boundaries. The author might be right in thinking it's too soon to involve the girlfriend in family dinners, especially since the relationship is still in early stages. On the other hand, the girlfriend might feel her partner is prioritizing the ex and child over their relationship. \n\nBut the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They have a responsibility to their child, and the ex is part of the custody arrangement. However, communication with the girlfriend is crucial. If the author hasn't discussed this situation with her, that could be an issue. The answer hinges on whether the author is respecting the girlfriend's feelings while also maintaining their parental duties.\n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because they're balancing their responsibilities as a parent. The main issue is communication. The answer should be B.\n"
