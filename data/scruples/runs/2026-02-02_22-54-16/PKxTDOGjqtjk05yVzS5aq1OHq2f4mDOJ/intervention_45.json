We also do a once a week or once every other week dinner somewhere just the three of us depending on our schedules.  \n\nI\u2019ve been dating my current girlfriend for about four months.  She does not like that I have these dinners.   She calls them dates.  She wants to be included in them, but I\u2019m not comfortable with that just yet.  If we work out long term, sure.   It just seems too soon to me right now.  I can understand her apprehension at the situation though.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for having dinners with his ex and son without including his current girlfriend.\n\nFirst, the author has a six-year-old son with his ex, who has custody. They have a good relationship and meet for dinners. Now, he's dating a new girlfriend for four months, and she's uncomfortable with these dinners, seeing them as dates. She wants to be included, but the author isn't ready for that yet.\n\nI need to consider family dynamics and relationships. The author is maintaining a relationship with his son, which is important. The ex is involved because she has custody, so it's not like the author is seeing the son without the ex's consent. The girlfriend's issue might stem from jealousy or insecurity. \n\nThe author isn't doing anything unethical by spending time with his son. The fact that the dinners are scheduled with notice and are regular, like once a week or every other week, suggests they're part of the routine. The girlfriend's request to be included might be reasonable from her perspective, but it's also about the boundaries between new relationships and existing family structures.\n\nIn such situations, communication is key. The author is being honest about his feelings, explaining that he's not ready to include the girlfriend yet. The girlfriend's reaction shows she might need validation or reassurance. However, the author isn't at fault here because he's prioritizing his child's relationship and the existing arrangement with his ex. The girlfriend needs to work on her own feelings of insecurity rather than expecting immediate inclusion in family activities that are necessary for the child's well-being.\n\nSo, the answer should be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. He's maintaining a healthy relationship with his son, and the girlfriend's discomfort is a personal issue that doesn't make him responsible for changing the established routine. Proper communication and setting boundaries are important in new relationships, and the author is handling it by being upfront about his stance.\n"
