His mother has custody, but we have a good relationship and as long as I give her notice I can see my son whenever.  We also do a once a week or once every other week dinner somewhere just the three of us depending on our schedules.  \n\nI\u2019ve been dating my current girlfriend for about four months.  She does not like that I have these dinners.   She calls them dates.  She wants to be included in them, but I\u2019m not comfortable with that just yet.  If we work out long term, sure.   It just seems too soon to me right now.  I can understand her apprehension at the situation though.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong.\n\nThe situation is that the person has regular dinners with their ex and son, which their current girlfriend doesn't like. The girlfriend wants to be included, but the author isn't comfortable yet. They've been dating four months, and the author is okay with including the girlfriend in the future if things work out long-term.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author is co-parenting with their ex, and the dinners are for the child's well-being. It's common for divorced or separated parents to have such arrangements. The girlfriend is feeling left out and perceives the dinners as dates, which is understandable from her perspective. But the author is not in a position where they can stop seeing their child, so the issue is more about how to handle the girlfriend's feelings without compromising the child's relationship.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? The key points here are communication and respect. The author is being honest with the girlfriend about their boundaries and the importance of the dinners for their son. If the author is respectful and communicates clearly, they might not be in the wrong. However, the girlfriend's feelings are valid, and the author might need to address those concerns without forcing inclusion. The author isn't doing anything that's against the child's best interest, so maybe they're not in the wrong. The answer might be B (No). But I should also consider if the dinners are causing unnecessary hurt to the girlfriend without a valid reason. Since the dinners are for the child and the author is transparent, it's B.\n"
