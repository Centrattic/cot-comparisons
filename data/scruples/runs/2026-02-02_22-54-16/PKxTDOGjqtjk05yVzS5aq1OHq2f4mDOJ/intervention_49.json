      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole?) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author having dinners with his ex and their son without including his current girlfriend. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author has a six-year-old son with his ex, and they have a good relationship. The ex has custody, but the author gets to see the child whenever he gives notice. They have weekly or biweekly dinners just the three of them. Now, the author is dating his current girlfriend for four months, and she's upset because she feels these dinners are like dates and wants to be included. The author isn't comfortable with that yet but is open to including her if they're long-term.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. I need to decide if the answer is A or B. Let's consider the key points. The author is maintaining a relationship with his child, which is important. The ex is involved in custody, so the author's time with the child is necessary. The girlfriend's issue is about inclusion, but the author hasn't been with her that long. Four months is a relatively short time, so expecting inclusion in family dinners might be premature. The author is being honest about his feelings and not pushing the issue, just not ready. The ex is the child's mother, so her presence is part of the custody arrangement. The girlfriend's discomfort is valid, but the author isn't doing anything wrong by prioritizing his child's relationship. The dinners aren't a secret; the girlfriend knows about them. The author is not being deceptive. So, the author is in the right because he's fulfilling his role as a parent, and it's reasonable to take time before bringing a new partner into family dynamics. The girlfriend might need to adjust to the situation, but the author isn't at fault here. So the answer should be B.\n"
