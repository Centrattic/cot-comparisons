His mother has custody, but we have a good relationship and as long as I give her notice I can see my son whenever.  We also do a once a week or once every other week dinner somewhere just the three of us depending on our schedules.  \n\nI\u2019ve been dating my current girlfriend for about four months.  She does not like that I have these dinners.   She calls them dates.  She wants to be included in them, but I\u2019m not comfortable with that just yet.  If we work out long term, sure.   It just seems too soon to me right now.  I can understand her apprehension at the situation though.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for having dinners with their ex and son without including their current girlfriend. The author has a six-year-old son, and they have a good relationship with the ex, with regular dinners. The girlfriend is upset because she feels excluded and calls these dinners \"dates,\" wanting to be included.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The dinners are between the father, ex, and son, which is a common parental arrangement, especially in co-parenting situations. The girlfriend is four months into the relationship and feels left out. The author isn't ready to involve the girlfriend in those dinners yet, which they acknowledge might be understandable given the girl's feelings.\n\nThe key points here are: the dinners are part of the existing co-parenting agreement, the girlfriend is new to the relationship, and the author hasn't committed to long-term yet. The girlfriend's request to be included is reasonable in her perspective, but the author isn't ready. \n\nIs the author wrong? Well, the dinners are with their child and the child's mother. That's a normal part of co-parenting. The girlfriend isn't a parent, so her inclusion isn't a right. However, the girlfriend might feel excluded, which is a valid emotion. The author isn't doing anything unethical or illegal, but they might need to communicate better with their girlfriend to manage expectations. \n\nSince the author isn't obligated to include the girlfriend in family dinners and the situation is common, I think the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
