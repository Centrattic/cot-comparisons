      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who started a thread on AITA is wrong for having dinners with his ex and son without including his current girlfriend.\n\nThe situation is that the person has a six-year-old son with custody with the ex. They have regular dinners as a three, which is the dad, the ex, and the kid. Now, the current girlfriend, who's been dating for four months, is upset because she wants to be included in those dinners, but the author isn't comfortable with that yet. The author sees the girlfriend's concern but thinks it's too soon.\n\nHmm. So the question is whether the author is wrong here. Let me break this down. First, the father has a custody arrangement where he can see his son whenever with notice. The dinners with the ex and son are established, and the ex is involved. Now, the girlfriend is unhappy because she wants to be included. The father isn't ready for that. \n\nFrom a relationship perspective, when you're in a new relationship, there's a process of integrating each other into different aspects of your life. The girlfriend might feel that these dinners are important and wants to be part of the father-son time, which is understandable. However, the father might have valid reasons for not wanting to include the new partner yet, especially if the relationship is still in an early stage. \n\nBut wait, the dinners are with the ex. Including the girlfriend would mean replacing the ex in those dinners, which could be a sensitive issue. The ex isn't the problem here; the father is maintaining a relationship with his son. The girlfriend wants to be included, but maybe the father isn't ready to involve the new partner in what's traditionally a father-son and ex-dinner setup. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might feel left out, especially if the dinners are regular and significant. If the father is not including her, even though the relationship is new, that could lead to misunderstandings. The key here is communication. The father should explain his reasons to the girlfriend and set boundaries, but also consider her feelings. \n\nThe father isn't doing anything wrong by maintaining his relationship with his son, but he might need to address the girlfriend's concerns. The girlfriend's reaction might be more about wanting to be included rather than the dinners themselves being a problem. \n\nSo, the answer would depend on whether the father is being fair in not addressing the girlfriend's feelings. If he's dismissive, he might be in the wrong. But if he's communicating and just not ready, then it's not his fault. The situation is complex, but the father isn't necessarily wrong for not including the girlfriend yet, especially with a young child involved. The main issue is the girlfriend's discomfort, which needs to be addressed through discussion. \n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
