His mother has custody, but we have a good relationship and as long as I give her notice I can see my son whenever.  We also do a once a week or once every other week dinner somewhere just the three of us depending on our schedules.  \n\nI\u2019ve been dating my current girlfriend for about four months.  She does not like that I have these dinners.   She calls them dates.  She wants to be included in them, but I\u2019m not comfortable with that just yet.  If we work out long term, sure.   It just seems too soon to me right now.  I can understand her apprehension at the situation though.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person (the author) is in the wrong for having dinners with their ex and son without including their current girlfriend. The situation involves a six-year-old son, custody arrangements, and a new relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author has a good relationship with the ex and sees their son regularly. They have weekly or biweekly dinners with the ex and the child. Now, the current girlfriend is upset because she feels these dinners are like dates and wants to be included. The author is uncomfortable including her yet but sees it as a long-term possibility if the relationship works out.\n\nSo, the question is about whether the author is wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nI should consider several angles. Legally, the ex has custody, so the author has the right to see their son. The dinners aren't custody issues here. The girlfriend's concern is about feeling excluded. The author is in a new relationship (four months), and it's not uncommon for people to want to integrate into each other's lives gradually. The author is not doing anything legally or ethically wrong by spending time with their child and ex. \n\nThe girlfriend's feelings are valid, but the author's hesitation isn't necessarily wrong. It's about boundaries and communication. The author isn't being dishonest; they're just not ready to include the girlfriend yet. The problem might be more about communication between the author and their girlfriend rather than the author being in the wrong. \n\nAlso, the dinners are with the ex and child, so they aren't a romantic date. The girlfriend's terming them as dates might be a misunderstanding or insecurity. The author isn't doing anything that violates the relationship's terms unless there's an agreement not to see the ex at all. Since the author is not hiding this or being deceitful, it's more about the girlfriend's adjustment to the situation.\n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong. They're maintaining a relationship with their child, which is important. The girlfriend needs to address her feelings but isn't justified in blaming the author for having legitimate family time.\n"
