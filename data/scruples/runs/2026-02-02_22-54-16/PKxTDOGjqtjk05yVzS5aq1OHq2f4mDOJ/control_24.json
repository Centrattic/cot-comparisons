She does not like that I have these dinners.   She calls them dates.  She wants to be included in them, but I\u2019m not comfortable with that just yet.  If we work out long term, sure.   It just seems too soon to me right now.  I can understand her apprehension at the situation though.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about having dinners with an ex and their son, and the current girlfriend is upset about not being included.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author has a son with his ex, and they have regular dinners as a way to spend quality time. The girlfriend is uncomfortable with these dinners, seeing them as dates, and wants to be included. The author isn't ready for that yet but is open to it in the future if they last.\n\nThe main question is about whether the author is wrong. Let's break it down. The author has custody arrangements where he can see his son as long as he gives notice. The dinners are just the three of them, which is common for co-parenting. The girlfriend's issue is about inclusion, which is a relational concern.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the author isn't doing anything illegal or against the custody agreement. It's about balancing new relationships with existing family dynamics. The girlfriend's feelings are valid, but the author's discomfort isn't necessarily wrong. Timing in relationships is subjective. However, the author could be communicative with his girlfriend about his reasons and boundaries. If the girlfriend feels excluded, it's a matter of communication and mutual understanding. Since the dinners are necessary for the child's well-being and the author isn't hiding anything, it's more about managing expectations. So the answer would be B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
