We also do a once a week or once every other week dinner somewhere just the three of us depending on our schedules.  \n\nI\u2019ve been dating my current girlfriend for about four months.  She does not like that I have these dinners.   She calls them dates.  She wants to be included in them, but I\u2019m not comfortable with that just yet.  If we work out long term, sure.   It just seems too soon to me right now.  I can understand her apprehension at the situation though.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who posted the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves having dinners with an ex and their son without including the current girlfriend.\n\nFirst, the key points: The person has a son with the ex, and they have a good co-parenting relationship. They have regular dinners with the ex and the son, which doesn't include the new girlfriend. The girlfriend is upset about this and wants to be included, but the person feels it's too soon. \n\nNow, considering co-parenting. It's common for non-custodial parents to have regular contact with their child. The post says their relationship with the ex is good and they follow the custody agreement. So the dinners are about the child, not dating. The girlfriend's issue is that she feels left out, but is that valid?\n\nFrom a co-parenting standpoint, the child's well-being is the priority. The parent is maintaining a relationship with their son, which is important. The girlfriend shouldn't be expected to replace the ex in co-parenting roles, especially if the relationship is new. It might be too soon to involve a new partner in those specific family dinners. \n\nThe girlfriend's feelings are valid, but the parent isn't obligated to include their partner in every co-parenting activity. It's about balancing the child's needs and the new relationship. The parent is being honest about their comfort level, which is reasonable. \n\nPotential issues? If the girlfriend is feeling excluded in other areas, but the question is specifically about these dinners. Since the dinners are for the child and the ex, it's not the parent's fault for not including a new partner. \n\nSo the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
