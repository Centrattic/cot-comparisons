His mother has custody, but we have a good relationship and as long as I give her notice I can see my son whenever.  We also do a once a week or once every other week dinner somewhere just the three of us depending on our schedules.  \n\nI\u2019ve been dating my current girlfriend for about four months.  She does not like that I have these dinners.   She calls them dates.  She wants to be included in them, but I\u2019m not comfortable with that just yet.  If we work out long term, sure.   It just seems too soon to me right now.  I can understand her apprehension at the situation though.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for having dinners with their ex and son without including their current girlfriend. The author has a six-year-old son with the ex, who has custody, and they have regular dinners. The girlfriend is upset about this and wants to be included. The author thinks it's too soon.\n\nHmm. First, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is the parent of the child, so maintaining a relationship with their son is important. The ex is involved because of custody arrangements. The girlfriend is new\u2014only four months in. She's not the ex, so including her in those dinners might complicate things, especially if the ex is comfortable with the current setup.\n\nThe key points are: the author is not doing anything illegal or unethical by spending time with their child. The girlfriend's feelings are valid, but the situation is about the parent-child relationship. The author isn't hiding the dinners; they're part of their parenting. The girlfriend might feel insecure or want to show commitment by being involved, but the author has the right to set boundaries, especially given the recent relationship.\n\nAlso, the ex has custody, so the author's time with the child is part of their agreed-upon parenting plan. Including the girlfriend might interfere with that if the ex isn't on board. The author isn't in the wrong for not involving the girlfriend yet. It's about balancing the needs of the child and respecting the relationship's stage. The girlfriend might need to adjust to the existing dynamics, but the author isn't obligated to include her in parent-child time unless both parties agree. So, the answer is probably B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
