      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author is having dinners with their ex and son without including their current girlfriend. The girlfriend is upset about it and wants to be included, but the author feels it's too soon.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author has a son with their ex, and they have regular dinners. The current girlfriend is dating them for four months and is uncomfortable with these dinners, calling them dates. She wants to be included. The author is not comfortable with that yet but is open to it if they stay together long-term.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, the dinners are with the ex and the child. The author is a parent, so spending time with their son is normal. The ex is involved because she's the custodial parent. The girlfriend's issue is about feeling excluded. The author's response is that it's too soon, which is a common sentiment in relationships about including partners in personal family matters.\n\nThe main question here is about boundaries in relationships. Typically, when in a relationship, partners may expect to be included in significant aspects of each other's lives. However, family dynamics can be different. The author is maintaining a relationship with their child, which is a responsibility. The ex's role here is as a parent, not as a romantic partner anymore. So the dinners are more about the child than the ex.\n\nThe girlfriend's discomfort might stem from jealousy or insecurity. The author's stance is that it's too soon, which is a valid perspective. However, not including a partner in family activities could be seen as a boundary issue. But since the dinners are with the child and the ex (as part of custody arrangements), it's not entirely the author's fault. The girlfriend might need to communicate her feelings more clearly and perhaps discuss boundaries. \n\nOn the other hand, the author should consider the girlfriend's feelings and maybe find a middle ground, like introducing her to the routine in a way that's comfortable for both. But the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because they are fulfilling their parental duties. The girlfriend's expectations might be unreasonable given the short duration of the relationship and the nature of the dinners.\n\nSo, the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. They have a right to maintain their relationship with their child, and the girlfriend's discomfort is more about her own feelings rather than the author's actions being wrong. However, communication is key here, and both sides should talk about their expectations.\n"
