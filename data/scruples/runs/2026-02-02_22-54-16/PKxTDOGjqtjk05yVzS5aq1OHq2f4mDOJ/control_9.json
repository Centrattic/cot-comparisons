      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is in the wrong for having dinners with their ex and son without including their current girlfriend.\n\nFirst, the situation: The person has a six-year-old son with his ex, and they have a good co-parenting relationship. They have weekly or biweekly dinners just the three of them. Now, they're dating someone new for four months, and the girlfriend is upset, calling these dinners \"dates\" and wanting to be included. The author is uncomfortable including the girlfriend yet and thinks it's too soon.\n\nHmm. So, the main issue here is the girlfriend's discomfort versus the author's perspective on what's appropriate. Let's break it down.\n\nCo-parenting often requires maintaining relationships with the ex for the child's sake. The author is not doing anything that's harmful; they're just spending time with their son, which they have every right to do. The ex is the custodial parent, so the author is following the schedule they have. The problem arises because the new girlfriend feels excluded and perceives these dinners as a potential threat or a step too far without her being involved.\n\nNow, the author's stance is that it's too soon to include the girlfriend in these dinners. That's a common concern in new relationships, especially when there's a child involved. The girlfriend might feel insecure or worried about her place in the relationship. But the author isn't doing anything wrong by not including her. They're maintaining their co-parenting responsibilities.\n\nI should also consider cultural norms and relationship expectations. In many cases, people in new relationships don't mix with the ex-partner unless it's necessary for co-parenting. The author isn't bringing the ex into the new relationship in a romantic sense. The dinners are strictly for the child, which is appropriate.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction might be valid in that she feels her comfort is important. However, the author isn't obligated to include her in every aspect of their life immediately. It's a balance between respecting the new partner's feelings and maintaining established co-parenting routines.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Probably not. They're acting in the best interest of their son and following a co-parenting agreement. The girlfriend needs to adjust her expectations, understanding that these dinners are for the child and not a romantic date. The author's discomfort in including the girlfriend so soon is reasonable, given the short duration of the relationship.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be B\u2014No, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
