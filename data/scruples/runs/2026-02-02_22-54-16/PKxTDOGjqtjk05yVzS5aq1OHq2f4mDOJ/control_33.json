His mother has custody, but we have a good relationship and as long as I give her notice I can see my son whenever.  We also do a once a week or once every other week dinner somewhere just the three of us depending on our schedules.  \n\nI\u2019ve been dating my current girlfriend for about four months.  She does not like that I have these dinners.   She calls them dates.  She wants to be included in them, but I\u2019m not comfortable with that just yet.  If we work out long term, sure.   It just seems too soon to me right now.  I can understand her apprehension at the situation though.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves having dinners with their ex and son without including their current girlfriend.\n\nFirst, the key points: The author is seeing their son weekly or every other week for dinners with the ex. The girlfriend, dating four months, doesn't like this and feels excluded. The author isn't comfortable including her yet but acknowledges her feelings.\n\nI need to determine if the author is wrong. Let's consider social norms and relationships. Typically, in a new relationship, people have boundaries. The author is maintaining a relationship with their child, which is understandable. However, the girlfriend might feel left out, especially if the dinners are frequent. \n\nThe ex is involved in these dinners, which could be a red flag if the ex is still close. But since the author has custody arrangements, it's part of their parenting. The girlfriend's discomfort is valid, but the author's hesitation to include her might be reasonable given the relationship's length.\n\nCommunication is key here. The author should discuss this with their girlfriend to find a middle ground. But is the author in the wrong? They're not doing anything illegal or necessarily unethical. They're prioritizing their child's well-being, which is important. However, the girlfriend's feelings matter too. \n\nBut the question is about being \"in the wrong.\" It's more about whether the author's actions are considered wrong. Since they're not violating any rules or agreements (assuming mutual understanding), they might not be in the wrong. The issue is more about relationship dynamics and communication rather than right or wrong.\n\nSo, the answer is likely B (No). The author isn't in the wrong, but they should address the girlfriend's concerns to maintain a healthy relationship. The situation requires empathy from both sides but doesn't inherently place fault on the author.\n"
