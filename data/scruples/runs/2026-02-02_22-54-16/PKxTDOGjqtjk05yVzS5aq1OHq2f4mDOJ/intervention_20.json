      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for having dinners with their ex and son without including their current girlfriend.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author has a son with his ex, and they have a good relationship. They have regular dinners just the three of them. The ex has custody, but the author can see the kid whenever with notice. Now, he's dating a new girlfriend for four months, and she's upset about the dinners, calling them dates and wanting to be included. The author isn't comfortable with that yet and thinks it's too soon. \n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is wrong for not including his girlfriend in these dinners. \n\nFrom the author's perspective, it's about maintaining a relationship with his child and ex. The dinners are probably necessary for the child's well-being and maintaining a bond. The ex is involved, which is part of the custody arrangement. The girlfriend is new, and the author feels it's too soon to include her. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might feel left out or insecure. She might see the dinners as the author prioritizing his past relationship over his current one. But the author's argument is that it's about the child's needs and that the ex is part of the custody arrangement. \n\nI need to consider if there's an obligation to include the new girlfriend. The author isn't in a position to control his ex's actions, and the dinners are for the child. The girlfriend's discomfort is valid, but the author isn't at fault for not including her. The key here is that the dinners are for the child, not a date. The author is maintaining a necessary relationship. The girlfriend might need to adjust her expectations, especially since it's only been four months. \n\nSo, the answer would be that the author isn't in the wrong. He's acting in his child's best interest and has a right to maintain that relationship. The girlfriend's feelings are understandable but not a reason to blame the author.\n"
