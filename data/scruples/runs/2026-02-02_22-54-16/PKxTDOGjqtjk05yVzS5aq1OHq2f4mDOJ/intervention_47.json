His mother has custody, but we have a good relationship and as long as I give her notice I can see my son whenever.  We also do a once a week or once every other week dinner somewhere just the three of us depending on our schedules.  \n\nI\u2019ve been dating my current girlfriend for about four months.  She does not like that I have these dinners.   She calls them dates.  She wants to be included in them, but I\u2019m not comfortable with that just yet.  If we work out long term, sure.   It just seems too soon to me right now.  I can understand her apprehension at the situation though.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about having dinners with an ex and their son without including the current girlfriend. The author mentions that they have a good relationship with the ex, and they meet for dinners every week or every other week. The girlfriend is upset because she calls these dinners dates and wants to be included. The author isn't comfortable with that yet but acknowledges her feelings.\n\nSo, I need to figure out whether the answer is A or B. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but they want my opinion. \n\nFirst, the key points here are the author's actions and the girlfriend's reaction. The author is maintaining a relationship with their child, which is important. Custody is with the ex, but they have a good arrangement. The dinners are about the son, not a romantic date. The girlfriend feels excluded because she might see these dinners as the author still being involved with their ex, which could be a red flag for her. \n\nBut the author is not in a new relationship with the ex; it's an ex. The dinners are with the son, so it's a parent-child thing. The girlfriend is being asked to join, but the author isn't ready for that. Is there a wrong here? The author isn't doing anything illegal or against the custody agreement. They're fulfilling their role as a parent. The girlfriend's discomfort is about her own insecurities or the perception of the ex being part of the author's life. \n\nHowever, the author might be in the wrong if these dinners are perceived as undermining the current relationship. The girlfriend could feel that the author is still emotionally attached to the ex or not making an effort to integrate her into his life. But the author is honest about the purpose of the dinners. \n\nThe conflict here is more about the girlfriend's feelings versus the author's actions. If the author is being transparent and the dinners are necessary for the child's well-being, then maybe it's not the author's fault. But if the author is being dismissive of the girlfriend's feelings, that could be an issue. The author says they can understand her apprehension, which shows some empathy. \n\nSo, in terms of right or wrong, it's a relationship issue where both parties need to communicate. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong for spending time with their child, but they might need to address the girlfriend's concerns to navigate the situation smoothly. The answer would be B for No, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
