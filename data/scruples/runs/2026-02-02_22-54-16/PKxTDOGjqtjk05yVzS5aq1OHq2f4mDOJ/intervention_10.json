His mother has custody, but we have a good relationship and as long as I give her notice I can see my son whenever.  We also do a once a week or once every other week dinner somewhere just the three of us depending on our schedules.  \n\nI\u2019ve been dating my current girlfriend for about four months.  She does not like that I have these dinners.   She calls them dates.  She wants to be included in them, but I\u2019m not comfortable with that just yet.  If we work out long term, sure.   It just seems too soon to me right now.  I can understand her apprehension at the situation though.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if the author is in the wrong for having dinners with their ex and son without including the current girlfriend. The author's son is with the ex, but they have a good relationship and visit regularly. The girlfriend is upset about this, seeing it as dates and wanting to be included.\n\nFirst, the author is a parent. So maintaining a relationship with their son is important. The ex is the mother, so the dinners are probably about the kid. The girlfriend is new, dating for four months. She wants to be included, but the author isn't comfortable yet. \n\nI need to consider the balance between current relationship and parental responsibilities. The author isn't doing anything wrong by spending time with their child. The girlfriend might feel insecure, but it's the author's right to maintain a relationship with their child. The problem is the girlfriend's discomfort. The author is being honest about not feeling ready, so that's respectful. Including the girlfriend isn't necessary here because the dinners are about the son. \n\nThe author might need to communicate better to ease the girlfriend's concerns, but they aren't in the wrong for prioritizing their child. So the answer is B.\n"
