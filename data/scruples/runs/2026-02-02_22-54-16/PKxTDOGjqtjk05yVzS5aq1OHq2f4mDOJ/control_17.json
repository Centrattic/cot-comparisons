His mother has custody, but we have a good relationship and as long as I give her notice I can see my son whenever.  We also do a once a week or once every other week dinner somewhere just the three of us depending on our schedules.  \n\nI\u2019ve been dating my current girlfriend for about four months.  She does not like that I have these dinners.   She calls them dates.  She wants to be included in them, but I\u2019m not comfortable with that just yet.  If we work out long term, sure.   It just seems too soon to me right now.  I can understand her apprehension at the situation though.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for having dinners with their ex and son without including their current girlfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The person has a six-year-old son with the ex, who has custody. They have a good relationship and regular dinners with the ex and the child. Now, the current girlfriend is upset about this because she sees these dinners as dates and wants to be included. The author isn't comfortable with that yet, thinking it's too soon in the four-month relationship.\n\nSo, the key points here are: custody arrangement, the child's age, the frequency of the dinners, the girlfriend's feelings, and the author's stance on including the girlfriend.\n\nLegally, custody is with the ex, so the author has visitation rights. The dinners are probably part of their parenting plan. The child is young, so maintaining a relationship with both parents is important. The girlfriend is new, and four months might be early to involve her in family matters. But the girlfriend feels left out, which is a valid feeling.\n\nNow, the question is about whether the author is wrong. The author isn't doing anything illegal or unethical in terms of custody. They have a right to spend time with their child. The girlfriend's discomfort might stem from insecurity or wanting to be included in family activities. The author isn't obligated to include the girlfriend in family time unless they choose to. However, communication is key. The author should be discussing this with the girlfriend to manage expectations and reassure her. If the girlfriend is making valid points about feeling excluded, the author might need to consider finding a balance without sacrificing their relationship with the child. But the author isn't in the wrong if they're not violating any agreements and are being transparent with their partner.\n"
