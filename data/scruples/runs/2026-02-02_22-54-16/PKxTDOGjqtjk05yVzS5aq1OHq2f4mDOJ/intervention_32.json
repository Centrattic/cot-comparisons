It just seems too soon to me right now.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for having dinners with his ex and son without including his current girlfriend.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author has a six-year-old son with custody to the ex, but they have a good relationship. They have regular dinners just the three of them. Now, he's dating a new girlfriend for four months, and she's upset because she thinks these dinners are dates and wants to be included. The author feels it's too soon and doesn't want to include her yet.\n\nSo, is he wrong? Well, the dinners are with the ex and son. The ex has custody, so maybe she's involved in the child's life. The author is maintaining a relationship with his son, which is important. The girlfriend's issue is wanting to be included, but he's not ready. \n\nFrom a social perspective, when you're in a new relationship, how much you integrate your ex into the new relationship can vary. But in this case, it's about co-parenting. The author is not necessarily doing anything wrong by maintaining his parental relationship. The girlfriend's discomfort might stem from insecurity, but the author has a right to his child. Including the new partner in co-parenting situations might be appropriate later, but four months is not a long time. The author's stance that it's too soon could be valid. The ex is part of the child's life, so excluding the girlfriend isn't inherently wrong if it's just about co-parenting. \n\nPotential issues: If the author is spending a lot of time with the ex in a way that's more than co-parenting, but the scenario mentions dinners as a family (parent, ex, child), which is common. The girlfriend's issue is about feeling left out, but the author isn't obligated to include her in co-parenting activities unless the ex agrees. The author's position is that he's not ready, which is his right. \n\nTherefore, the answer is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong because maintaining a relationship with his son is important, and the girlfriend's request is premature given the newness of the relationship.\n"
