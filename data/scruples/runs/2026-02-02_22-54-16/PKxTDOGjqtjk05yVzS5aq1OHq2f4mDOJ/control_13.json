She does not like that I have these dinners.   She calls them dates.  She wants to be included in them, but I\u2019m not comfortable with that just yet.  If we work out long term, sure.   It just seems too soon to me right now.  I can understand her apprehension at the situation though.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The situation involves dinners with an ex and their child, and the current girlfriend is upset about not being included.\n\nFirst, the author has a child with his ex, and they have a good co-parenting relationship. They have dinners together as a way to bond with the child. Now he's in a new relationship, and his girlfriend doesn't like that he's having these dinners without her.\n\nI need to consider boundaries in relationships. Typically, when you're in a new relationship, it's common for both partners to establish what's acceptable. The author is not doing anything illegal or unethical, just maintaining a co-parenting arrangement. However, the girlfriend feels excluded. The key here is communication. The author might not be wrong for not involving his girlfriend yet, as it's his choice, but he should communicate his reasons clearly. On the flip side, the girlfriend's feelings are valid; she might feel insecure or left out. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that it's too soon to include her in those dinners. That's a personal boundary, which is okay if both parties are on the same page. But if the girlfriend expressed her discomfort and he's ignoring it, that could be problematic. However, the post says he's not ignoring her but is just not comfortable yet. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? If he's honest with his girlfriend and maintains the dinners as part of his co-parenting, then no. But if he's being secretive or dismissive, then yes. The description doesn't indicate secrecy, just a difference in timing and comfort. Therefore, the answer is B because he's not wrong as long as he's respectful and communicates clearly.\n"
