His mother has custody, but we have a good relationship and as long as I give her notice I can see my son whenever.  We also do a once a week or once every other week dinner somewhere just the three of us depending on our schedules.  \n\nI\u2019ve been dating my current girlfriend for about four months.  She does not like that I have these dinners.   She calls them dates.  She wants to be included in them, but I\u2019m not comfortable with that just yet.  If we work out long term, sure.   It just seems too soon to me right now.  I can understand her apprehension at the situation though.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person (the author) is in the wrong for having dinners with their ex and son without including their current girlfriend.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author has a six-year-old son with custody to the ex, and they have a good relationship, allowing visits. They have weekly or biweekly dinners with the ex and son. The author is in a four-month relationship, and the girlfriend is upset about not being included in these dinners. The author isn't comfortable including her yet but is open to it if the relationship lasts.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is wrong. Let me break this down. The author is seeing their child, which is a parental right. The ex is involved because of custody arrangements. The girlfriend is upset because she feels excluded. The author's stance is that it's too soon to bring her into those family dinners.\n\nKey points to consider: The author isn't doing anything illegal or against custody agreements. The dinners are with family, so the ex's involvement is part of the child's life. The girlfriend's feelings are valid, but the author is not obligated to include her in family matters. However, communication is important. The author might need to explain the situation more clearly to the girlfriend to manage expectations, especially since the relationship is new. But is the author in the wrong? Well, if the girlfriend isn't part of the child's custody or parental responsibilities, it's not about including her. The author isn't wrong for maintaining a relationship with their child and ex through these dinners. The girlfriend's discomfort is her issue to address, perhaps through open dialogue. The author's responsibility is to their child and the custody arrangement. So, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). They're maintaining a family connection, and the girlfriend's expectations might not align with the current dynamics of the relationship. The author isn't being unfair or neglectful; they're just respecting the existing family structure.\n"
