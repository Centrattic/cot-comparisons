His mother has custody, but we have a good relationship and as long as I give her notice I can see my son whenever.  We also do a once a week or once every other week dinner somewhere just the three of us depending on our schedules.  \n\nI\u2019ve been dating my current girlfriend for about four months.  She does not like that I have these dinners.   She calls them dates.  She wants to be included in them, but I\u2019m not comfortable with that just yet.  If we work out long term, sure.   It just seems too soon to me right now.  I can understand her apprehension at the situation though.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who posted this situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about having dinners with their ex and son without including their current girlfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The person has a six-year-old son, and the ex has custody. They have a good relationship and meet regularly for dinners. The current girlfriend doesn't like this and wants to be included. The author is in a four-month relationship and feels it's too soon to include her in these dinners.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. I should analyze both sides. The author's ex has custody, so they have a right to maintain a relationship with their child. The dinners are about the son, not romantic. The girlfriend's discomfort might stem from jealousy or insecurity. The author is respecting the ex's custody arrangement and prioritizing the child's well-being.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might feel excluded or worried about the future of the relationship. But the author is being honest about not wanting to include the girlfriend yet. They mention that if the relationship works out long-term, they'll include her. The author isn't doing anything to sabotage the current relationship; they're maintaining a parental bond with their child.\n\nCustody arrangements usually allow visitation, so the dinners are appropriate. The girlfriend's issue is more about personal feelings rather than legal or ethical violations. The author is being transparent and respectful of both the ex and the current partner's feelings. There's no evidence of deceit or neglect in the situation.\n\nSo, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong. They are managing their parental responsibilities and are honest about their current relationship boundaries.\n"
