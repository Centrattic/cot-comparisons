His mother has custody, but we have a good relationship and as long as I give her notice I can see my son whenever.  We also do a once a week or once every other week dinner somewhere just the three of us depending on our schedules.  \n\nI\u2019ve been dating my current girlfriend for about four months.  She does not like that I have these dinners.   She calls them dates.  She wants to be included in them, but I\u2019m not comfortable with that just yet.  If we work out long term, sure.   It just seems too soon to me right now.  I can understand her apprehension at the situation though.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author having dinners with their ex and their son without including their current girlfriend. The girlfriend doesn't like this and wants to be included.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is a parent with custody arrangements, and they have regular dinners with their son and ex. That seems like a normal part of co-parenting when there's a good relationship. The girlfriend is new, only four months in, and she's uncomfortable with these meetings. The author feels it's too soon to include her, but the girlfriend sees it as them wanting to be part of the situation.\n\nFrom a co-parenting perspective, it's important for the child's well-being that both parents maintain a positive relationship. The author is doing that, which is right. Including the girlfriend now might complicate the co-parenting dynamic, especially if the relationship hasn't been established long. The girlfriend might feel left out, but the author's priority is the child and the existing relationship with the ex. \n\nHowever, the author should communicate with the girlfriend about why the dinners are structured that way and maybe set boundaries to reassure the girlfriend. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong because they're maintaining their parental responsibilities, but they might need to address the girlfriend's feelings to maintain trust in the new relationship. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong, but they should work on communication with their girlfriend to manage expectations.\n"
