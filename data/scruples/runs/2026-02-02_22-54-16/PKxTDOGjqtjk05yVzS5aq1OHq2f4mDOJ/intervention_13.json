His mother has custody, but we have a good relationship and as long as I give her notice I can see my son whenever.  We also do a once a week or once every other week dinner somewhere just the three of us depending on our schedules.  \n\nI\u2019ve been dating my current girlfriend for about four months.  She does not like that I have these dinners.   She calls them dates.  She wants to be included in them, but I\u2019m not comfortable with that just yet.  If we work out long term, sure.   It just seems too soon to me right now.  I can understand her apprehension at the situation though.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the asshole\" post is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation again.\n\nThe author has a six-year-old son and shares a good relationship with the ex, who has custody. They have dinners with the son a couple of times a week, depending on schedules. The current girlfriend is dating him for four months and is upset about not being included in these dinners. The girlfriend calls them dates and wants to be involved, but the author isn't comfortable with that yet. They're okay with including her if they end up being long-term.\n\nHmm, the key points here are the duration of the relationship, the nature of the dinners, and whether the girlfriend's feelings are being respected. The author's dinners with the ex and son are for the child, which is a legitimate reason. But the girlfriend might feel left out or see it as a potential threat to the relationship's seriousness. \n\nOn one hand, the author is maintaining a relationship with his child, which is important. On the other, the girlfriend might feel her position isn't respected if these dinners happen frequently and he's not open to her joining. Four months is not a long time, so maybe it's too early for her to expect inclusion. But if the dinners are regular, maybe the author should consider how it affects his current partner's feelings. \n\nI think the answer depends on communication. If the author hasn't discussed his reasons with the girlfriend, that could be an issue. The girlfriend's feeling of being excluded is valid, but the author's need to spend time with his son is also important. The fact that the author is not comfortable yet but acknowledges the girlfriend's apprehension shows some awareness. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? If he's not including her without any consideration and there's no communication, maybe. But since he's explaining that it's for the child and he's open to changing in the future, perhaps not. It's a bit of a gray area, but leaning towards B (No) because the dinners are for the child and the author is making that clear, even though communication might be needed here.\n"
