      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the Ask the Adults question is in the wrong. The scenario is about having dinners with his ex and their son without including his current girlfriend. The girlfriend is upset because she wants to be included, but he's not comfortable yet.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author has a six-year-old son with custody arrangements that allow him regular contact. They have weekly or biweekly dinners with the ex and the kid. Now, the new girlfriend is dating him for four months and is unhappy about these dinners, calling them \"dates\" and expecting to be included.\n\nThe main question is whether the author is wrong for not including his girlfriend in these dinners. To answer A or B, I need to consider social norms, relationship expectations, and possibly cultural context.\n\nFrom a social standpoint, it's common for co-parents to maintain relationships with their ex for the child's sake. However, when a new partner enters the scene, there can be tension. The girlfriend might feel left out or insecure if the dinners are seen as a trio that excludes her. The author might argue that these dinners are necessary for his relationship with his child and that it's too early to involve the new girlfriend. \n\nBut here's the thing: if the girlfriend is now part of his life, especially after four months, not involving her in these regular events could be seen as neglecting her feelings. Even if the dinners are about the child, the girlfriend might perceive it as a lack of commitment to integrating into his family life. However, it's also reasonable for the author to want to take things slow, especially since the relationship is still new. \n\nThe ex's role here is important. If the dinners are strictly for the child's benefit and the ex is simply the custodial parent, then the author's presence there is justified. But if the girlfriend feels it's a \"date\" scenario, maybe there's a misunderstanding about the nature of these dinners. The author should communicate clearly with his girlfriend about the purpose of these dinners and discuss boundaries. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's not black and white. The author isn't legally or morally obligated to include his girlfriend in these dinners, but he might be causing unnecessary hurt or insecurity without considering her perspective. On the other hand, the girlfriend's expectation of being included so soon might be unrealistic. \n\nI think the key here is communication. The author might not be in the wrong for not including her yet, but he could be at fault for not explaining the situation better. However, since the question is whether he's in the wrong, the answer depends on whether his actions are objectively wrong or just a matter of differing expectations. Since he's not violating any laws or serious social taboos, the answer might be B (not in the wrong), but with the caveat that communication is needed.\n"
