      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for having dinners with their ex and son without including their current girlfriend. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: the author has a six-year-old son with custody to the ex. They have a good relationship and regular dinners just the three of them. Now, the author has a new girlfriend (four months in) who's uncomfortable with these dinners, calling them dates and wanting to be included. The author isn't ready for that yet.\n\nHmm. The key points here are the child custody arrangement, the existing dinners, and the new relationship. The ex has custody, so the author's time with the child is probably part of their agreed-upon parenting plan. The dinners are likely part of maintaining a relationship with the son, which is important. The girlfriend is upset because she feels left out, but the author isn't comfortable including her yet.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, maintaining a relationship with their son is crucial. The girlfriend might feel insecure or threatened by these dinners, thinking it's a form of dating. But since the ex is the custodial parent, these dinners are necessary for the child's well-being. The author's hesitation to include the girlfriend is understandable, especially given that the relationship is still new.\n\nLegally, the custodial parent has primary responsibility, so the author's visits are appropriate. Emotionally, the girlfriend might need reassurance that these dinners are about the child, not the ex. The author isn't doing anything wrong by continuing these visits as agreed. The girlfriend's feelings are valid, but the author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing their child's needs and maintaining their relationship with them. However, communication between the author and the girlfriend is important to address her concerns without compromising the child's best interests.\n\nSo, the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong. They are fulfilling their parental responsibilities, and the girlfriend's discomfort doesn't negate that. The focus is on the child, and the author isn't obligated to include the girlfriend in those family dinners.\n"
