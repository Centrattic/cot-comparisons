We also do a once a week or once every other week dinner somewhere just the three of us depending on our schedules.  \n\nI\u2019ve been dating my current girlfriend for about four months.  She does not like that I have these dinners.   She calls them dates.  She wants to be included in them, but I\u2019m not comfortable with that just yet.  If we work out long term, sure.   It just seems too soon to me right now.  I can understand her apprehension at the situation though.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who posted the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about having dinners with an ex and their son without including the current girlfriend. The author has been dating the girlfriend for four months, and she's upset about the dinners. The author thinks it's too soon to include her but wants to see if they work out long-term.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author has custody arrangements with the ex, and they have regular dinners. The girlfriend is uncomfortable and feels excluded. The author isn't ready to include the girlfriend yet. \n\nNow, considering relationships, communication is key. The girlfriend is expressing her feelings, which is valid. However, the author is the parent, so maintaining a relationship with their child is important. But maybe the girlfriend feels insecure or threatened by the dinners. \n\nIs the author wrong for not including the girlfriend? Well, the dinners are with the ex and the child, which are part of the custody agreement. The girlfriend isn't a parent, so she doesn't have a right to be included. The author's hesitation to include her might be because it's a new relationship. But the girlfriend's feelings are important too. \n\nHowever, the author isn't doing anything wrong by prioritizing their child. It's up to them how they manage their time with their son. The girlfriend's request to be included could be a matter of personal boundaries. The author isn't in the wrong if they're being honest and respectful. \n\nBut maybe the author should communicate better with the girlfriend to address her concerns. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong, not just if they should improve communication. Since the dinners are part of the custody arrangement and the boyfriend isn't at fault for not involving the girlfriend yet, the answer would be B.\n"
