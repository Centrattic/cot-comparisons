      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person (AITA) is in the wrong for having dinners with their ex and son without including their current girlfriend. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the situation. The person's son is six, and the mother has custody. They have a good relationship and arrange dinners with the ex and son, which is common for co-parenting. The girlfriend is upset because she feels left out, calling the dinners \"dates,\" and wants to be included. The author is hesitant because it's only been four months into the relationship.\n\nI should consider both sides. On one hand, the author has a right to maintain a relationship with their child, which is important for the child's well-being. Co-parenting arrangements like this are normal. The author isn't doing anything wrong by spending time with their son and ex, as long as it's agreed upon and doesn't interfere with the current relationship.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might feel insecure or neglected. Four months isn't a long time, and she might be testing the relationship's commitment. The author's hesitation to include her might seem dismissive, but it's also reasonable to want to keep things simple with the ex and child, especially if the relationship is new. \n\nBut is the author in the wrong? The key points are: the co-parenting is normal and agreed upon, the current relationship is new, and the author isn't trying to hide anything. The girlfriend's feelings are valid, but the author isn't violating any norms by not including her yet. They're being honest about their feelings and the timeline. \n\nSo, the answer is probably B (No). The author isn't in the wrong. They're maintaining a necessary relationship with their child, and the girlfriend's discomfort is part of the new relationship dynamics. Communication between them is important, but the author isn't doing something objectively wrong.\n"
