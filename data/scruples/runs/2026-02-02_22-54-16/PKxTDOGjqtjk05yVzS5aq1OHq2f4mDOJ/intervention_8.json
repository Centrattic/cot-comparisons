We also do a once a week or once every other week dinner somewhere just the three of us depending on our schedules.  \n\nI\u2019ve been dating my current girlfriend for about four months.  She does not like that I have these dinners.   She calls them dates.  She wants to be included in them, but I\u2019m not comfortable with that just yet.  If we work out long term, sure.   It just seems too soon to me right now.  I can understand her apprehension at the situation though.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for having dinners with their ex and son without including their current girlfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The author has a six-year-old son with his ex, and they have a good relationship. They have regular dinners just the three of them. Now, the author is in a four-month relationship with a new girlfriend who's uncomfortable with these dinners, calling them dates and wanting to be included.\n\nThe key points here are the child's well-being and the current relationship dynamics. The dinners are for the child, not a date between the author and ex. The author isn't trying to exclude the girlfriend, but it's a recent relationship, so it's too soon to involve her in those family dinners. The ex has custody, so the author's visits are part of his parenting time.\n\nThe girlfriend's concern might stem from feeling excluded or insecure. But the author has a right to maintain a relationship with his child. It's important to communicate openly with the girlfriend about the dinners being for the child, not a date. However, the author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing his son's relationship and not forcing the girlfriend into it too early. Relationships take time, and it's reasonable to set boundaries, especially when it's about co-parenting.\n\nSo, the answer is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. The dinners are for the child, and it's too soon to involve the new girlfriend in family time with the ex.\n"
