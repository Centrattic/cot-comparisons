      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The person has a 6-year-old son with his ex, and they have regular dinners just the three of them. The ex has custody, but they have a good relationship. Now, the person is dating a new girlfriend for four months, and she's upset because she's not included in these dinners. She calls them dates and wants to be part of them. The author feels it's too soon to include her but is open to it if they stay together long-term.\n\nHmm. The key points here are the dynamics with the ex, the kid, and the current relationship. The author is not doing anything illegal or unethical by seeing his son. However, the girlfriend is feeling left out. The author is in a new relationship, so four months is not that long. It's common for people to feel insecure in new relationships, especially when there's a child involved. The author's stance is that he's not ready to include her yet, which is his right. But maybe the girlfriend's feelings are valid too. \n\nBut wait, the dinners are with the ex and the son. If the girlfriend is considering these dinners as \"dates,\" maybe she's under the impression that they are romantic, which they aren't. The author needs to clarify that these are family time. However, the girlfriend's discomfort might stem from jealousy or insecurity. The author isn't doing anything wrong by prioritizing his child, but he might need to communicate better with his girlfriend. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Probably not. He's maintaining a relationship with his child, which is important. The issue here is more about the girlfriend's expectations versus the current stage of their relationship. The author isn't obligated to include his girlfriend in family matters unless they have a serious commitment. So the answer would be B, No.\n"
