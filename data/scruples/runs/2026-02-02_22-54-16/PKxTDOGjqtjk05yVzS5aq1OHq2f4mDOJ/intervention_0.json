We also do a once a week or once every other week dinner somewhere just the three of us depending on our schedules.  \n\nI\u2019ve been dating my current girlfriend for about four months.  She does not like that I have these dinners.   She calls them dates.  She wants to be included in them, but I\u2019m not comfortable with that just yet.  If we work out long term, sure.   It just seems too soon to me right now.  I can understand her apprehension at the situation though.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for having dinners with his ex and son without including his current girlfriend. The author is in a four-month relationship, and the girlfriend is upset about these dinners, calling them \"dates\" and wanting to be included. The author isn't comfortable with that yet.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The son is six years old, and the author has custody arrangements. The dinners are for the child's well-being. The ex has custody, but they have a good relationship. The key points here are communication, the child's best interest, and the girlfriend's feelings.\n\nThe author isn't doing anything illegal or unethical by spending time with his child. It's his right as a parent. The girlfriend's discomfort might stem from insecurity or feeling excluded, which is common in new relationships. However, the author is respecting his current partner's feelings by acknowledging her apprehension but also setting boundaries about not wanting to bring her into the situation yet. \n\nThe main question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the dinners are necessary for the child and the author is maintaining open communication, it seems justified. The girlfriend's desire to be included might be reasonable in the future, but the author isn't obligated to include her in these family dinners now. The answer hinges on whether the author's actions are infringing on the girlfriend's rights or causing unnecessary harm. Since it's about time with the child and the author is communicating, he's likely not in the wrong.\n"
