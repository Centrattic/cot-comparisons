It just seems too soon to me right now.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person (the author) is in the wrong for having dinners with their ex and son without including their current girlfriend. The author is in a four-month relationship and has weekly dinners with their son and ex. The girlfriend doesn't like it and wants to be included, but the author feels it's too soon.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is a parent, so their primary responsibility is to their child. The ex has custody, but they maintain a good relationship, and the dinners are for the child. That's understandable. But the girlfriend feels left out and perceives these dinners as dates. The author hasn't included her yet, planning to if the relationship is long-term. \n\nIs the author being inconsiderate? The girlfriend's feelings are valid\u2014she might feel insecure or neglected. But the author hasn't excluded her intentionally; the dinners are with the ex and son. However, if the relationship is serious, maybe the author should be more considerate of the girlfriend's feelings and involve her if possible. \n\nBut wait, the author explains that they're not comfortable with it yet. It's only been four months. So maybe there's a cultural or personal boundary here. The key is whether these dinners are affecting the current relationship negatively. The author isn't doing anything wrong by being a parent, but not addressing the girlfriend's concerns might be an issue. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for having the dinners, but perhaps they should communicate better with their girlfriend. However, the question is specifically about being in the wrong. If the girlfriend is feeling this strongly, maybe the author should adjust, but that doesn't mean they were wrong initially. The dinners are for their child, which is important. The girlfriend's reaction is about her own feelings, not the author's actions. Therefore, the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
