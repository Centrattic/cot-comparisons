It just seems too soon to me right now.  I can understand her apprehension at the situation though.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who posted the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about having dinners with their ex and son without including the current girlfriend.\n\nFirst, the author is seeing their son, which is part of their custody arrangement. The ex has custody, but they have a good relationship and can see the son with notice. They have weekly or biweekly dinners with the ex and son. Now, the current girlfriend is dating the author for four months and doesn't like that the author is having these dinners. The girlfriend thinks they're dates and wants to be included. The author isn't comfortable with that yet but understands her feelings.\n\nHmm. The key points here are the custody arrangement, the history of the dinners, and the current relationship dynamics. The author has a legal right to see their child, so that's not the issue. The question is whether not including the girlfriend is wrong. The girlfriend is jealous or feels excluded, but the author is in a new relationship and isn't ready to bring her into family time. \n\nIn relationships, communication is important. The author might need to discuss boundaries with the girlfriend. However, the author isn't doing anything wrong by maintaining their existing relationship with their child. The girlfriend's feelings are valid, but the author isn't obligated to include her in family time unless they mutually agree. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They're managing their responsibilities as a parent and their new relationship. The issue might be more about managing expectations and communication rather than right or wrong. So, the answer is probably B (No).\n"
