His mother has custody, but we have a good relationship and as long as I give her notice I can see my son whenever.  We also do a once a week or once every other week dinner somewhere just the three of us depending on our schedules.  \n\nI\u2019ve been dating my current girlfriend for about four months.  She does not like that I have these dinners.   She calls them dates.  She wants to be included in them, but I\u2019m not comfortable with that just yet.  If we work out long term, sure.   It just seems too soon to me right now.  I can understand her apprehension at the situation though.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about having dinners with an ex and their son without including the current girlfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author is a father with a six-year-old son, and the ex has custody. They have dinners together, which is reasonable for a parent to maintain a relationship with their child. The current girlfriend is upset because she feels left out and calls these dinners dates, wanting to be included. The author is not comfortable with that yet, thinking it's too soon.\n\nSo, the main points here are: custody arrangement, the author's right to spend time with his son, and the girlfriend's feelings. The key is whether the author is doing something wrong by not involving his girlfriend in these dinners.\n\nLegally, the father has the right to have visitation or custody as per the agreement, so he's not violating any laws. Emotionally, the girlfriend might feel insecure or neglected, but the author is prioritizing his relationship with his son. It's also reasonable for him to set boundaries in a new relationship. Four months isn't a long time, and it's common for people to need time to integrate partners into different parts of their life.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction might be a communication issue. If she's uncomfortable, she should talk to the author about her feelings instead of labeling the dinners as dates. But the author isn't necessarily wrong for not involving her yet. He's respecting his son's needs and maintaining a relationship with the ex as part of co-parenting.\n\nSo, in terms of right or wrong, the author isn't in the wrong. He's upholding his parental duties, and it's okay to take time in a new relationship to adjust. The girlfriend needs to work on communication, not the author's actions.\n"
