      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for having dinners with his ex and son without including his current girlfriend. The author has a six-year-old son with custody to the ex, and they have regular dinners. The girlfriend is upset and wants to be included, but the author feels it's too soon.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The key points are: the author is co-parenting with his ex, which is common and necessary for the child's well-being. The girlfriend is dating him for four months and feels left out. The author isn't comfortable including her yet, but the girlfriend sees it as a problem.\n\nNow, I should consider the dynamics. The author's time with his son is part of co-parenting, which is separate from his romantic relationship. The girlfriend's request to be included in dinners with the ex and son might be a jealousy or insecurity issue. The author's stance is that it's too soon, which is a valid perspective since four months might not be enough time for the girlfriend to adjust to such a situation.\n\nBut wait, the girlfriend is part of the author's current life, so maybe she has a right to feel included. However, the author has a responsibility to maintain a relationship with his child, and that's not something to be compromised. Including the girlfriend in co-parenting dinners could complicate things, especially if the ex is still involved. The author's comfort level is also important here. He's not in the wrong for needing time to adjust the relationship.\n\nAnother angle: communication. The author should talk to his girlfriend about his perspective, explaining that these dinners are co-parenting and not a date. But the girlfriend's feelings are also valid. However, the author isn't doing anything wrong by maintaining his existing co-parenting arrangement. The girlfriend might need to understand that her partner's relationship with his child isn't something he can exclude for her benefit.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, it's generally accepted that co-parenting is necessary, and new partners should respect that. The author isn't doing anything unethical. The girlfriend's discomfort might stem from personal insecurities rather than the author's actions being wrong. So, the answer is likely B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
