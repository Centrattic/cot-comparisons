His mother has custody, but we have a good relationship and as long as I give her notice I can see my son whenever.  We also do a once a week or once every other week dinner somewhere just the three of us depending on our schedules.  \n\nI\u2019ve been dating my current girlfriend for about four months.  She does not like that I have these dinners.   She calls them dates.  She wants to be included in them, but I\u2019m not comfortable with that just yet.  If we work out long term, sure.   It just seems too soon to me right now.  I can understand her apprehension at the situation though.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person (the author) is in the wrong for having dinners with his ex and son without including his current girlfriend.\n\nFirst, the key points: The author has a six-year-old son with his ex, who has custody. They have regular dinners just the three of them. The author is dating a new girlfriend for four months, and she's uncomfortable with these dinners, thinking they're dates and wants to be included. The author isn't ready to include her yet but is open to it in the future.\n\nI need to consider the dynamics here. The author is co-parenting, which is common and necessary when there's a child involved. The dinners are with his ex and son, which is part of his parenting responsibilities. The girlfriend's issue is about feeling excluded. However, the author isn't obligated to include his girlfriend in family time with his son. It's a separate relationship dynamic.\n\nThe girlfriend might feel insecure, but the author is prioritizing his child's well-being and maintaining a relationship with the ex for the child's benefit. It's reasonable for him to need time to adjust to a new relationship and not immediately merge all aspects. The author is honest about his feelings and open to future inclusion, which is good communication.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. The girlfriend's feelings are valid, but the author isn't obligated to include her in dinners that are for co-parenting purposes. The answer should be B (No).\n"
