I don't like spiders at all, they creep me out tremendously.\n\nHe invited me and another friend to his house to play PS4. He showed the tarantulas as usual, always inside their enclosures. He knows I hate having them close by, but if they're secured inside their little enclosure I'm okay with it. I know he has pranked people before so I made it very clear to never to that to me as I'd very likely just kill it out of fear.\n\nWe're playing PS4 and he goes get something for us to eat. Meanwhile I'm just looking at his books. He gets there with a plate with a cover on it, the kind that goes in the microwave so food doesn't splatter everywhere. Our other friend takes the cover and does a huge jump scare, hitting the plate and making the fucking tarantula fly in my direction. I had a book in my hand and out of reflex I threw the book at it killing it right there.\n\nSo now he's all pissed at me for being a \"pussy\" and killing an harmless animal. Other people are also blaming me for it and I even got an angry WhatsApp message from a guy that also has tarantulas at home.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for killing their friend's tarantula. The situation is that the friend has tarantulas in enclosures, the writer is afraid of spiders but okay if they're contained. The friend's other friend did a jump scare with a plate, causing the tarantula to fly towards the writer. In a panic, the writer threw a book and killed it. Now the friend is angry, calling them a \"pussy,\" and others are blaming them too.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The writer made it clear they didn't want to be pranked, and the friend knew their fear. The other friend's jump scare was the direct cause of the tarantula being in the wrong place. The writer acted in reflex due to fear. \n\nBut legally, does the writer have responsibility? If the tarantula was in the enclosure, the friend should have ensured it was secure. The accident happened because of someone else's prank. The writer's action was a reflex, not premeditated. However, the writer did kill the animal, even if it was an accident. \n\nMoral standpoint: The writer didn't set out to harm the tarantula but acted out of fear. The friend's prank was the catalyst. The friend is being called an asshole for pranking despite knowing the fear. But the writer's action is being criticized. \n\nPossible arguments for the writer being in the wrong: They admitted to hating spiders and might have acted out of fear, but maybe they could have avoided killing it. However, the situation was sudden and scary. \n\nArguments against: The prank was the root cause. The friend's responsibility was to keep the tarantula secure, and the other person's prank was reckless. The writer's reflex is understandable. The friend is being unreasonable for blaming the victim of the prank. \n\nSo, is the writer the asshole? They might not be entirely at fault because the prank was the main issue. The friend's anger seems misplaced. The writer acted in self-defensive reflex. The key here is whether the person's fear was valid and the prank was the actual problem. The friend knew the writer's fear yet allowed a prank that led to this. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because the prank was the cause, and the writer's reaction was a reflex out of fear, which the friend should have respected. The friend is in the wrong for the prank and not securing the tarantula properly.\n"
