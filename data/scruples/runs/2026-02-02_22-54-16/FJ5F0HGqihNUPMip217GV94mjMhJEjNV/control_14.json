I don't like spiders at all, they creep me out tremendously.\n\nHe invited me and another friend to his house to play PS4. He showed the tarantulas as usual, always inside their enclosures. He knows I hate having them close by, but if they're secured inside their little enclosure I'm okay with it. I know he has pranked people before so I made it very clear to never to that to me as I'd very likely just kill it out of fear.\n\nWe're playing PS4 and he goes get something for us to eat. Meanwhile I'm just looking at his books. He gets there with a plate with a cover on it, the kind that goes in the microwave so food doesn't splatter everywhere. Our other friend takes the cover and does a huge jump scare, hitting the plate and making the fucking tarantula fly in my direction. I had a book in my hand and out of reflex I threw the book at it killing it right there.\n\nSo now he's all pissed at me for being a \"pussy\" and killing an harmless animal. Other people are also blaming me for it and I even got an angry WhatsApp message from a guy that also has tarantulas at home.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author killed their friend's tarantula. The friend showed the spiders in their enclosures, which the author was okay with as long as they were contained. The friend knew the author didn't like spiders and had warned him not to prank them, which he might have done here. Another friend did a jump scare with a plate, causing the tarantula to fly towards the author. In a reflex, the author threw a book and killed the spider.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author had warned the friend about their fear of spiders and the potential reaction. The friend had a history of pranks, which might be relevant here. The other friend's jump scare was the immediate cause. So, the author's action was a reflex in a scary situation. But was it justified?\n\nThe key points here are intent and responsibility. The author didn't set out to kill the tarantula; it was an impulsive reaction to a scary moment. However, the tarantula was in its enclosure, which was supposed to keep it safe. The friend's prank, through the other person, might have created an unsafe situation. The author's action was a direct response to fear, but the question is whether they should have handled it differently. \n\nOn one hand, the author had made it clear they couldn't handle pranks with spiders, so the friend who set up the prank might be at fault for not respecting that boundary. The other friend's jump scare was the catalyst. The author's reflex action could be seen as understandable given their fear. However, the tarantula was a pet, and killing someone's pet is a serious matter. Even if it was an accident, the author might be expected to take responsibility for the destruction of property, especially if the situation was avoidable. \n\nBut considering that the author had a phobia and had communicated this, and the tarantula was released into their space through a prank, the author's fear-induced reaction might be seen as a defense. The responsibility might actually lie with the person who pranked them, as they didn't respect the author's boundaries. The author didn't have malicious intent, so maybe they aren't the asshole. However, the act of killing the pet, regardless of intent, can lead to others being upset. \n\nIn terms of legal responsibility, it's more about property damage, but the question is about moral responsibility. The community might judge based on intent and circumstances. Since the author acted in fear and it was a reflex, not premeditated, they might not be in the wrong. But if the enclosure was properly secured, maybe the prank was the mistake. The answer hinges on whether the author's action was a justified reaction or if they should have found another way to handle it. Given the fear and the suddenness, I think the author isn't the asshole here. So answer B.\n"
