I don't like spiders at all, they creep me out tremendously.\n\nHe invited me and another friend to his house to play PS4. He showed the tarantulas as usual, always inside their enclosures. He knows I hate having them close by, but if they're secured inside their little enclosure I'm okay with it. I know he has pranked people before so I made it very clear to never to that to me as I'd very likely just kill it out of fear.\n\nWe're playing PS4 and he goes get something for us to eat. Meanwhile I'm just looking at his books. He gets there with a plate with a cover on it, the kind that goes in the microwave so food doesn't splatter everywhere. Our other friend takes the cover and does a huge jump scare, hitting the plate and making the fucking tarantula fly in my direction. I had a book in my hand and out of reflex I threw the book at it killing it right there.\n\nSo now he's all pissed at me for being a \"pussy\" and killing an harmless animal. Other people are also blaming me for it and I even got an angry WhatsApp message from a guy that also has tarantulas at home.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who killed their friend's tarantula is in the wrong. The situation is that the friend has tarantulas, which the narrator is afraid of. The friend knows this and was told not to prank them. However, another friend uses a plate cover to jump scare the narrator, causing the tarantula to fly toward them. The narrator throws a book, killing the spider. The friend is angry, calling the narrator a \"pussy,\" and others are also blaming them.\n\nFirst, the narrator made it clear they don't like spiders and asked not to be pranked. The friend who owns the tarantula is aware of this. The jump scare was initiated by another friend, not the owner. The narrator acted out of fear and reflex. The key points here are consent and provocation. The owner of the tarantula didn't set the prank, but their friend did. The narrator was in their home, and the owner didn't stop the prank despite knowing the narrator's phobia. The action was a reaction to a sudden threat, even if it resulted in the tarantula's death. \n\nLegally, maybe not, but morally, is the narrator at fault? The owner is responsible for keeping the tarantula secure. The prankster's action led to the incident. The narrator's fear was known, so the owner might have a responsibility to prevent such situations. However, the narrator's impulsive action was the direct cause. It's a mix of factors. If the owner had prevented the prank, the incident wouldn't have happened. But since the narrator acted in fear, it's a gray area. \n\nIn terms of social expectations, people might be more lenient if the narrator had a known phobia and the prank was the catalyst. However, killing an animal, even out of fear, could be seen as harsh. But the context matters: it was a defensive reaction to a sudden, terrifying situation. The owner's friend's prank might be more to blame. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer could be that the narrator isn't the sole wrongdoer. However, since they did kill the tarantula, even if in fear, maybe there's some responsibility. But given the circumstances, it's more the prankster's fault and the owner's for not stopping it. The narrator's action was a reflex in a scary situation, so they might not be the asshole. Answer B.\n"
