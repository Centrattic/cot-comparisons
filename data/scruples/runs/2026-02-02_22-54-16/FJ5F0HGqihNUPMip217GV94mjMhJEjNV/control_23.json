I don't like spiders at all, they creep me out tremendously.\n\nHe invited me and another friend to his house to play PS4. He showed the tarantulas as usual, always inside their enclosures. He knows I hate having them close by, but if they're secured inside their little enclosure I'm okay with it. I know he has pranked people before so I made it very clear to never to that to me as I'd very likely just kill it out of fear.\n\nWe're playing PS4 and he goes get something for us to eat. Meanwhile I'm just looking at his books. He gets there with a plate with a cover on it, the kind that goes in the microwave so food doesn't splatter everywhere. Our other friend takes the cover and does a huge jump scare, hitting the plate and making the fucking tarantula fly in my direction. I had a book in my hand and out of reflex I threw the book at it killing it right there.\n\nSo now he's all pissed at me for being a \"pussy\" and killing an harmless animal. Other people are also blaming me for it and I even got an angry WhatsApp message from a guy that also has tarantulas at home.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a tarantula being killed by the author. Let me break down the details.\n\nThe friend has tarantulas and knows the author hates spiders. The friend showed them in their enclosures, which the author could tolerate as long as they were secure. The friend had also pranked others before, so the author warned him not to do that, as it would make them kill the spider out of fear. \n\nThen, the friend goes to get food, and another friend uses a plate cover to jump scare. The plate is hit, and the tarantula flies towards the author. In reflex, the author throws a book, killing the tarantula. The friend is upset, calling the author a \"pussy\" and others are blaming them too. The user is asking if the author is the asshole here.\n\nFirst, the author had a clear fear and communicated their warning. The situation was a prank by another friend, not the tarantula's owner. The author acted in a panic, possibly without intent. The owner is upset, but the author might argue self-defense or accident. However, killing an animal, even in fear, might be seen as wrong by some. But considering the context of a prank leading to an accident, maybe not. The key points are intent, prior communication, and the accidental nature. The owner's reaction seems harsh, but the author's action led to the death. So, is the author at fault? It's tricky. If the author acted in fear and it was an accident, maybe not. But intentionally killing the tarantula could be seen as wrong. However, the author's warning was clear, so perhaps the friend should have avoided pranks. The answer depends on whether the action was justified. If the author had no intent and it was a reflex, maybe not. But others might see it as overreacting. The community often sides with the owner in such cases, but the prank might mitigate the author's blame.\n"
