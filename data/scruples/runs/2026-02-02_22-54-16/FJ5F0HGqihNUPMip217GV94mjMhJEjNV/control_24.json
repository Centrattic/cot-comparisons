I don't like spiders at all, they creep me out tremendously.\n\nHe invited me and another friend to his house to play PS4. He showed the tarantulas as usual, always inside their enclosures. He knows I hate having them close by, but if they're secured inside their little enclosure I'm okay with it. I know he has pranked people before so I made it very clear to never to that to me as I'd very likely just kill it out of fear.\n\nWe're playing PS4 and he goes get something for us to eat. Meanwhile I'm just looking at his books. He gets there with a plate with a cover on it, the kind that goes in the microwave so food doesn't splatter everywhere. Our other friend takes the cover and does a huge jump scare, hitting the plate and making the fucking tarantula fly in my direction. I had a book in my hand and out of reflex I threw the book at it killing it right there.\n\nSo now he's all pissed at me for being a \"pussy\" and killing an harmless animal. Other people are also blaming me for it and I even got an angry WhatsApp message from a guy that also has tarantulas at home.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for killing their friend's tarantula. Let me break down the situation.\n\nSo, the friend has tarantulas and showed them in enclosures. The user doesn't like spiders but is okay if they're secured. They warned the friend not to prank them because they might kill the spider out of fear. The friend went to get food, and another friend did a jump scare by hitting the plate, causing the tarantula to fly toward the user. In reflex, they threw a book and killed it. Now the friend is angry, calling them a \"pussy\" and others are blaming them too.\n\nHmm. The user had made it clear they don't want to be pranked because of their fear. The other friend's prank led to the accident. The user acted in fear reflex, not intentionally. But was the user wrong? The tarantula was in an enclosure, but maybe the prank caused it to escape. The user's action was a reaction to sudden fear. But they had warned not to do pranks. The friend who pranked might be at fault. However, the user did kill the tarantula. The question is whether they're the asshole.\n\nThe key points are: the user had a fear, warned the friend, the prank caused the incident, and the user acted reflexively. The owner of the tarantula might argue that the user should have handled it without killing. But the user wasn't trying to harm it. The prankster's actions led to the situation. So maybe the user isn't the asshole here. They followed through on their warning by reacting in fear. But they did kill the animal. However, it was an accident due to the prank. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) because the prank was the root cause, and the user had a valid fear they communicated.\n"
