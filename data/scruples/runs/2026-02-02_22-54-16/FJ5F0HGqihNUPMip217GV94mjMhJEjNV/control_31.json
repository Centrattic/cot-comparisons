I don't like spiders at all, they creep me out tremendously.\n\nHe invited me and another friend to his house to play PS4. He showed the tarantulas as usual, always inside their enclosures. He knows I hate having them close by, but if they're secured inside their little enclosure I'm okay with it. I know he has pranked people before so I made it very clear to never to that to me as I'd very likely just kill it out of fear.\n\nWe're playing PS4 and he goes get something for us to eat. Meanwhile I'm just looking at his books. He gets there with a plate with a cover on it, the kind that goes in the microwave so food doesn't splatter everywhere. Our other friend takes the cover and does a huge jump scare, hitting the plate and making the fucking tarantula fly in my direction. I had a book in my hand and out of reflex I threw the book at it killing it right there.\n\nSo now he's all pissed at me for being a \"pussy\" and killing an harmless animal. Other people are also blaming me for it and I even got an angry WhatsApp message from a guy that also has tarantulas at home.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a friend's tarantula getting killed during a game night. Let me break down the key points.\n\nFirst, the friend has tarantulas in their enclosures. The author is afraid of spiders but is okay with them in their enclosures. The friend knows this and supposedly agrees not to prank them. Then, the other friend jumps out with a plate, causing the tarantula to fly towards the author. In a panic, the author throws a book and kills the spider.\n\nNow, the author is being blamed by the friend and others. The question is whether the author is at fault. Let me think about the responsibilities here. The friend who owns the tarantula is responsible for their care. They should have ensured the spider's safety, especially knowing the author's fear. The other friend's prank was reckless and contributed to the accident. The author's reaction was a reflex to protect themselves from a sudden, scary situation. \n\nBut did the author act responsibly? They knew the friend's history of pranks and had set boundaries. The sudden jump scare by the other friend was unexpected. The author's action was a split-second reaction. While killing the spider wasn't intentional, it happened due to the prank. The owner's responsibility is to prevent such situations, maybe by not leaving the tarantula in a place where it could be disturbed. \n\nSo, the author might not be entirely at fault. The prankster friend and the owner both share some responsibility. The author's fear was valid, and the situation was a result of others' actions. However, maybe the author could have avoided throwing the book? But given the fear and the immediate threat, it's understandable. \n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong. The main blame lies with the prankster and the owner for not securing the tarantula properly. The author's reaction was a reflex in a stressful situation. So the answer should be B.\n"
