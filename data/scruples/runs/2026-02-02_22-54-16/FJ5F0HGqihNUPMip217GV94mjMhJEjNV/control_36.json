I don't like spiders at all, they creep me out tremendously.\n\nHe invited me and another friend to his house to play PS4. He showed the tarantulas as usual, always inside their enclosures. He knows I hate having them close by, but if they're secured inside their little enclosure I'm okay with it. I know he has pranked people before so I made it very clear to never to that to me as I'd very likely just kill it out of fear.\n\nWe're playing PS4 and he goes get something for us to eat. Meanwhile I'm just looking at his books. He gets there with a plate with a cover on it, the kind that goes in the microwave so food doesn't splatter everywhere. Our other friend takes the cover and does a huge jump scare, hitting the plate and making the fucking tarantula fly in my direction. I had a book in my hand and out of reflex I threw the book at it killing it right there.\n\nSo now he's all pissed at me for being a \"pussy\" and killing an harmless animal. Other people are also blaming me for it and I even got an angry WhatsApp message from a guy that also has tarantulas at home.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for killing their friend's tarantula. The situation is a bit complex, so I need to break it down.\n\nFirst, the friend has tarantulas and knows the author is scared of spiders. The tarantulas are in enclosures, which the author is okay with as long as they're secure. The author told the friend not to prank them because they might kill the spider out of fear. \n\nThen, during a game session, the friend goes to get food. Another friend uses a plate cover to jump-scare the author, causing the tarantula to fly towards them. The author throws a book in reflex and kills the spider. Now the friend is upset, calling the author a \"pussy\" and others are blaming them too.\n\nSo, the key points here: Did the author act wrongfully? The setup was a prank by the other friend, not the owner of the tarantula. The author made their fear clear and had a valid reason to act in self-defense, even if it was a reflex. The responsibility might be on the person who set up the prank, creating a dangerous situation. The owner of the tarantula should have prevented the prank, especially knowing the author's fear. However, the author did kill the animal, which could be seen as a consequence of their own fear. But given the circumstances, it's a reflex action. The friend's anger seems misplaced, as the prank was the root cause. So, the author isn't in the wrong here. Answer B.\n"
