I don't like spiders at all, they creep me out tremendously.\n\nHe invited me and another friend to his house to play PS4. He showed the tarantulas as usual, always inside their enclosures. He knows I hate having them close by, but if they're secured inside their little enclosure I'm okay with it. I know he has pranked people before so I made it very clear to never to that to me as I'd very likely just kill it out of fear.\n\nWe're playing PS4 and he goes get something for us to eat. Meanwhile I'm just looking at his books. He gets there with a plate with a cover on it, the kind that goes in the microwave so food doesn't splatter everywhere. Our other friend takes the cover and does a huge jump scare, hitting the plate and making the fucking tarantula fly in my direction. I had a book in my hand and out of reflex I threw the book at it killing it right there.\n\nSo now he's all pissed at me for being a \"pussy\" and killing an harmless animal. Other people are also blaming me for it and I even got an angry WhatsApp message from a guy that also has tarantulas at home.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this AITA question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for killing their friend's tarantula. Let's break down the situation step by step.\n\nFirst, the friend has tarantulas he shows to guests, but the author is afraid of spiders. The friend knows this and supposedly keeps them in enclosures. The author had even warned him not to prank them, as it might lead to the author killing the spider out of fear. \n\nThe incident happens when the friend leaves to get food, and another friend (the third party) takes the plate cover and jumps, causing the tarantula to fly toward the author. The author, in a panic, throws a book and kills the spider. Now the friend is angry, calling the author a \"pussy\" and others are blaming them too. \n\nSo, the key points here are: the author had a phobia, warned the friend not to prank them, the actual prank was done by another friend, and the author reacted in fear. \n\nLegally, if the tarantula was an exotic pet, there might be issues, but the question is more about moral wrongdoing. The author didn't have malicious intent; it was a reflex action due to fear. The friend who owned the tarantula is at fault for allowing others to set up a prank knowing the author's fear. The other friend's prank was reckless. The author's action was a direct result of being startled and scared. \n\nSo, is the author the asshole? They didn't mean to harm the animal, it was an accident caused by someone else's prank. The blame should be on the person who set up the prank and the owner for not preventing it. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
