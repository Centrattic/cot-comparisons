I don't like spiders at all, they creep me out tremendously.\n\nHe invited me and another friend to his house to play PS4. He showed the tarantulas as usual, always inside their enclosures. He knows I hate having them close by, but if they're secured inside their little enclosure I'm okay with it. I know he has pranked people before so I made it very clear to never to that to me as I'd very likely just kill it out of fear.\n\nWe're playing PS4 and he goes get something for us to eat. Meanwhile I'm just looking at his books. He gets there with a plate with a cover on it, the kind that goes in the microwave so food doesn't splatter everywhere. Our other friend takes the cover and does a huge jump scare, hitting the plate and making the fucking tarantula fly in my direction. I had a book in my hand and out of reflex I threw the book at it killing it right there.\n\nSo now he's all pissed at me for being a \"pussy\" and killing an harmless animal. Other people are also blaming me for it and I even got an angry WhatsApp message from a guy that also has tarantulas at home.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this AITA story is in the wrong. The situation is that the author killed their friend's tarantula when the friend used a jump scare with the spider on a plate. The friend knew the author was afraid of spiders but they were in an enclosure. Then another friend jumped, causing the spider to fly towards the author, who threw a book and killed it. The friend is upset, and others are blaming the author.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The friend was aware of the author's fear and had pranked others before. The author had explicitly told the friend not to do that. The jump was done by the other friend, not the owner of the spider. The spider was on a plate, which might not have been a secure enclosure. The author acted in reflex out of fear.\n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, the friend knew the author's fear and maybe should have ensured the spider was properly secured. The other friend's prank was the immediate cause. The author's action was a reflex to protect themselves from fear, which could argue they weren't intentionally malicious. However, the spider was someone's pet, and the owner might feel it was a breach of trust.\n\nBut the friend had shown the spiders in enclosures before, so maybe this time the setup was different. The key is whether the friend's actions (by not securing the spider properly during the prank) led to the incident. The author's reaction was a direct result of being startled and scared. So, maybe the author isn't in the wrong because the prank was the catalyst, and they were acting out of fear. Also, the friend's prior knowledge of the fear should make them responsible for ensuring the spider wasn't a threat. The other friend's prank was the actual fault here. So the answer might be B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
