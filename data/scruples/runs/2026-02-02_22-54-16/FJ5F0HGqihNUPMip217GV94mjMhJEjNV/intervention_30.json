I don't like spiders at all, they creep me out tremendously.\n\nHe invited me and another friend to his house to play PS4. He showed the tarantulas as usual, always inside their enclosures. He knows I hate having them close by, but if they're secured inside their little enclosure I'm okay with it. I know he has pranked people before so I made it very clear to never to that to me as I'd very likely just kill it out of fear.\n\nWe're playing PS4 and he goes get something for us to eat. Meanwhile I'm just looking at his books. He gets there with a plate with a cover on it, the kind that goes in the microwave so food doesn't splatter everywhere. Our other friend takes the cover and does a huge jump scare, hitting the plate and making the fucking tarantula fly in my direction. I had a book in my hand and out of reflex I threw the book at it killing it right there.\n\nSo now he's all pissed at me for being a \"pussy\" and killing an harmless animal. Other people are also blaming me for it and I even got an angry WhatsApp message from a guy that also has tarantulas at home.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for killing their friend's tarantula. \n\nFirst, the setup: the friend has tarantulas in enclosures. The author hates spiders but is okay if they're secured. The friend knows this and was warned not to prank them. The friend goes to get food, and another friend (the other friend) takes a plate with a cover, jumps and hits the plate, causing the tarantula to fly towards the author. The author, in fear, throws a book and kills the spider.\n\nThe friend is upset, calling the author a \"pussy\" and others blame them too. The question is if the author is in the wrong.\n\nSo, the key factors here are the intent and the circumstances. The author was under a genuine fear response. The tarantula was supposed to be secure, but the prank caused an unexpected situation. The other friend's action (the jump scare) directly led to the incident. The author wasn't intentionally trying to harm the spider; it was a reflex.\n\nBut the friend who owns the tarantula might feel betrayed because they trusted the author to handle their pets being around, even if they hate spiders. However, the author had explicitly warned not to prank them, which the other friend did, leading to the accident. The responsibility also might lie with the other friend for setting up the situation that caused the spider to be loose.\n\nIn terms of accountability, the author isn't the one who set up the prank. They were reacting to a sudden threat. The friend's anger might be misplaced because the real culprit is the other friend's prank. The author's action was a defensive reflex, not premeditated. \n\nHowever, some might argue that the author should have found another way to handle it, but in a moment of panic, throwing a book is a natural reaction. The tarantula was in the author's personal space, causing fear. \n\nConsidering all this, the author isn't at fault. The blame should be on the other friend who caused the situation. The answer is B.\n"
