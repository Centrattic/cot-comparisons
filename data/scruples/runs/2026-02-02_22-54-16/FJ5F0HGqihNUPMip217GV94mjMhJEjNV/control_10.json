I don't like spiders at all, they creep me out tremendously.\n\nHe invited me and another friend to his house to play PS4. He showed the tarantulas as usual, always inside their enclosures. He knows I hate having them close by, but if they're secured inside their little enclosure I'm okay with it. I know he has pranked people before so I made it very clear to never to that to me as I'd very likely just kill it out of fear.\n\nWe're playing PS4 and he goes get something for us to eat. Meanwhile I'm just looking at his books. He gets there with a plate with a cover on it, the kind that goes in the microwave so food doesn't splatter everywhere. Our other friend takes the cover and does a huge jump scare, hitting the plate and making the fucking tarantula fly in my direction. I had a book in my hand and out of reflex I threw the book at it killing it right there.\n\nSo now he's all pissed at me for being a \"pussy\" and killing an harmless animal. Other people are also blaming me for it and I even got an angry WhatsApp message from a guy that also has tarantulas at home.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the friend has tarantulas, which the author really doesn't like. The friend showed them in their enclosures, which the author is okay with if they're secure. The friend also knows the author doesn't like spiders and the author told him not to prank him with them.\n\nThen, when the friend leaves to get food, another friend (maybe the same one who pranks a lot?) uses a plate cover to jump scare the author. The plate is hit, causing the tarantula to fly towards the author. In a panic, the author throws a book and kills the spider. Now the friend is upset, calling the author a \"pussy\" and others are blaming the author, even someone else who has tarantulas sent an angry message.\n\nSo, the key points here: the author didn't touch the spider on purpose. The tarantula was released because of a prank by the other friend. The author made it clear they would kill it if it was near them because of fear. The friend who owns the spider is upset, but the spider was accidentally released, not by the author's intention. The author acted in reflex to a jump scare, which is a common human reaction.\n\nNow, the owner of the tarantula is responsible for keeping it in an enclosure. Even if the other friend caused the accident, the owner might be at fault for not securing it properly. But the author's action was in response to a prank that led to the spider being thrown. The author was given a warning about not pranking, but the prank still happened. The author acted in self-defense, so to speak, out of fear.\n\nBut, from the owner's perspective, the spider was a pet, and the author killed it. Even if it was an accident, some people might feel that the owner should have taken more precautions. However, the author made it clear that they would kill it if it was near them because of their fear. So the owner might have been warned, but still allowed the tarantula to be in a situation where someone else could prank with it.\n\nThe other people blaming the author might not understand the context of the prank. The guy with tarantulas at home might be biased, seeing it as a pet taken from someone else. But legally, unless there was intent, the author isn't at fault. Morally, it's a bit tricky. The author's fear led to an accident, but the prank was the catalyst. The owner's responsibility in securing the animal is also a factor.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's action was a reflex due to fear, caused by a prank. The owner's responsibility includes ensuring the spider's enclosure is secure. So the author isn't necessarily wrong. Answer B.\n"
