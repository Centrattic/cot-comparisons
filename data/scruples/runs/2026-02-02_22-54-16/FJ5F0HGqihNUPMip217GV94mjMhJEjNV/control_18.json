I don't like spiders at all, they creep me out tremendously.\n\nHe invited me and another friend to his house to play PS4. He showed the tarantulas as usual, always inside their enclosures. He knows I hate having them close by, but if they're secured inside their little enclosure I'm okay with it. I know he has pranked people before so I made it very clear to never to that to me as I'd very likely just kill it out of fear.\n\nWe're playing PS4 and he goes get something for us to eat. Meanwhile I'm just looking at his books. He gets there with a plate with a cover on it, the kind that goes in the microwave so food doesn't splatter everywhere. Our other friend takes the cover and does a huge jump scare, hitting the plate and making the fucking tarantula fly in my direction. I had a book in my hand and out of reflex I threw the book at it killing it right there.\n\nSo now he's all pissed at me for being a \"pussy\" and killing an harmless animal. Other people are also blaming me for it and I even got an angry WhatsApp message from a guy that also has tarantulas at home.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author killed their friend's tarantula. The friend showed the tarantula in its enclosure, which the author is okay with as long as it's secure. The author explicitly told the friend not to prank them with the spider because they'd probably kill it out of fear. Then, the friend's other friend jumps out and scares them, causing a plate to hit and send the tarantula flying towards the author. In a panic, the author throws a book and kills it.\n\nFirst, let's look at the key points. The author made it clear they don't want to be pranked with the tarantula. The friend knew this but might have allowed the prank anyway. The other friend did the jump scare, which led to the accident. The author reacted in fear and killed the tarantula. The friend is now upset, and others are blaming the author.\n\nNow, considering responsibility. The author was in a stressful situation. They had warned the friend not to prank them, so maybe the friend should have prevented the prank. The other friend's jump scare was the direct cause. However, the author's reaction led to the death. Was it a reasonable reaction? They threw a book to hit the spider, which killed it. That seems like an impulsive action due to fear. But since they had a phobia, maybe that's excusable. \n\nOn the other hand, the tarantula was a pet, and killing someone's pet is a big deal. The friend had a right to be upset. But the author's actions were a result of being scared, not malicious intent. The question is whether the author is at fault for not preventing the situation or for overreacting. \n\nAlso, the friend who owns the tarantula might be partly responsible for allowing a prank they knew could lead to harm. The other friend's prank was reckless. The author might not be entirely at fault because they acted in fear and had previously stated their discomfort. \n\nBut maybe the author could have taken another action, like moving away or calling for help instead of throwing a book. However, in the heat of the moment, it's hard to say. So, considering all factors, the author isn't necessarily the one to blame, especially since they had warned against pranks and the other person was the one who initiated the jump scare. The answer might be B (author not in the wrong), but there's a nuance here. However, since the author admitted they would likely kill the spider if pranked, and they did, but it was due to someone else's prank, the responsibility might not be entirely theirs.\n"
