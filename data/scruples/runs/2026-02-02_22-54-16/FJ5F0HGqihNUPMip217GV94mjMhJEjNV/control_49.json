I don't like spiders at all, they creep me out tremendously.\n\nHe invited me and another friend to his house to play PS4. He showed the tarantulas as usual, always inside their enclosures. He knows I hate having them close by, but if they're secured inside their little enclosure I'm okay with it. I know he has pranked people before so I made it very clear to never to that to me as I'd very likely just kill it out of fear.\n\nWe're playing PS4 and he goes get something for us to eat. Meanwhile I'm just looking at his books. He gets there with a plate with a cover on it, the kind that goes in the microwave so food doesn't splatter everywhere. Our other friend takes the cover and does a huge jump scare, hitting the plate and making the fucking tarantula fly in my direction. I had a book in my hand and out of reflex I threw the book at it killing it right there.\n\nSo now he's all pissed at me for being a \"pussy\" and killing an harmless animal. Other people are also blaming me for it and I even got an angry WhatsApp message from a guy that also has tarantulas at home.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who killed their friend's tarantula is in the wrong. Let me break down the situation.\n\nSo, the friend has tarantulas, and the person doesn't like spiders. They were at the friend's house playing PS4. The friend showed the tarantulas in their enclosures, which the person was okay with as long as they were secure. The friend had a history of pranks, so the person made it clear not to prank them because they might kill the spider out of fear. \n\nThen, the friend went to get food, and another friend did a jump scare with a plate that had a tarantula on it. The plate was covered, but when the cover was hit, the tarantula flew towards the person. In reflex, they threw a book and killed it. Now the friend is upset, calling them a \"pussy\" and others are blaming them. The question is, is the author the asshole?\n\nFirst, the person had a legitimate fear of spiders. They communicated their boundaries about not wanting to be pranked. The friend who owns the tarantula knew about this fear but still allowed another friend to do the jump scare with the spider. The person acted in self-defense, using a book, which seems like a reasonable reaction to a sudden, terrifying situation. \n\nHowever, the tarantula was in an enclosure initially, but during the prank, it was placed on a plate that wasn't secure. The person didn't intentionally set out to kill the spider; it was a reflex action due to fear. The friend who owns the spider is partially at fault for not respecting the person's boundaries and setting up a situation that led to this. \n\nBut the person did kill the tarantula. The question is whether their actions were justified. Since they had communicated their fear and the prank led to the spider being thrown at them, their reaction, while resulting in the spider's death, was a reflex. However, the owner might still feel wronged because they invested in the tarantula. But the person wasn't trying to harm it on purpose. \n\nOthers are blaming them, but if the prank was the catalyst, maybe the blame isn't entirely on the person. However, they should have tried to avoid the situation instead of reacting with a book. But given the fear and the suddenness, maybe it's understandable. \n\nSo, considering the context, the person might not be entirely in the wrong. They had communicated their boundaries, the prank was the cause, and the action was a reflex. But there's a responsibility to not kill someone's pet, even in fear. Hmm. Maybe the owner is also at fault for the prank, but the person might share some blame for not finding a way to avoid the spider instead of killing it. \n\nBut the book was a reflex action. It's a split-second reaction. In such cases, people might act without thinking. So maybe the person isn't the asshole here. Answer B.\n"
