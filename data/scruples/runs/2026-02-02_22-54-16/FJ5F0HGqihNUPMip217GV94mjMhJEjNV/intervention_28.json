I don't like spiders at all, they creep me out tremendously.\n\nHe invited me and another friend to his house to play PS4. He showed the tarantulas as usual, always inside their enclosures. He knows I hate having them close by, but if they're secured inside their little enclosure I'm okay with it. I know he has pranked people before so I made it very clear to never to that to me as I'd very likely just kill it out of fear.\n\nWe're playing PS4 and he goes get something for us to eat. Meanwhile I'm just looking at his books. He gets there with a plate with a cover on it, the kind that goes in the microwave so food doesn't splatter everywhere. Our other friend takes the cover and does a huge jump scare, hitting the plate and making the fucking tarantula fly in my direction. I had a book in my hand and out of reflex I threw the book at it killing it right there.\n\nSo now he's all pissed at me for being a \"pussy\" and killing an harmless animal. Other people are also blaming me for it and I even got an angry WhatsApp message from a guy that also has tarantulas at home.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who killed their friend's tarantula is in the wrong. The situation is that the friend has tarantulas in enclosures, and the author hates spiders. The friend knows this and the author warned them not to prank them with the spiders. However, during a game night, the friend brings in a plate with a tarantula on it (probably as a prank), and the author, out of fear, throws a book and kills the spider.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The friend had been warned not to prank the author with the tarantulas. The prank involved a plate that could potentially release the spider. The author's reaction was a reflex due to fear. The author didn't intend to harm the spider but acted on instinct. The friend and others are blaming the author now, but the prank might have been the initial provocation. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the author made it clear they didn't want to be pranked. The friend ignored that warning, leading to the situation. The author's fear is valid, and reacting by throwing a book in self-defense (if they thought the spider was coming towards them) might be understandable. However, the tarantula was in an enclosure, so maybe the prank involved removing it from the enclosure? Wait, the user says the friend showed the tarantulas inside their enclosures. Then, the plate with a cover that was hit\u2014maybe the tarantula was on the plate? So, the prank was using the plate to scare the author, which caused the spider to fly towards them. The author's reflex action killed it.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the friend who set up the prank might be at fault for disregarding the author's warning. The author's action was a reaction to the unexpected situation. But did the author have a duty to avoid harming the spider even if it was a prank? Maybe, but given the fear and the sudden action, it's hard to see how they could have avoided it. The author might not be in the wrong because the prank was the root cause. Others are blaming the author, but the friend should have respected the warning. So, the answer is probably B (No).\n"
