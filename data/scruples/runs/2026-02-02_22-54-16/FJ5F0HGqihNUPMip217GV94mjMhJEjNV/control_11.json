I don't like spiders at all, they creep me out tremendously.\n\nHe invited me and another friend to his house to play PS4. He showed the tarantulas as usual, always inside their enclosures. He knows I hate having them close by, but if they're secured inside their little enclosure I'm okay with it. I know he has pranked people before so I made it very clear to never to that to me as I'd very likely just kill it out of fear.\n\nWe're playing PS4 and he goes get something for us to eat. Meanwhile I'm just looking at his books. He gets there with a plate with a cover on it, the kind that goes in the microwave so food doesn't splatter everywhere. Our other friend takes the cover and does a huge jump scare, hitting the plate and making the fucking tarantula fly in my direction. I had a book in my hand and out of reflex I threw the book at it killing it right there.\n\nSo now he's all pissed at me for being a \"pussy\" and killing an harmless animal. Other people are also blaming me for it and I even got an angry WhatsApp message from a guy that also has tarantulas at home.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who killed their friend's tarantula is in the wrong. The situation involves a friend showing off his tarantulas, which the narrator is afraid of. The friend knows this and was told not to prank them. However, another friend jumps out and causes the tarantula to fly towards the narrator, who then kills it with a book out of fear.\n\nFirst, the narrator made it clear they hate spiders and would kill them if pranked. The friend who had the tarantula knew this but still allowed the jump scare. The other friend's jump scare was the catalyst for the incident. The narrator acted on reflex, not intentionally.\n\nThe key points here are intent and responsibility. The narrator didn't plan to kill the spider; it was a reaction to a sudden threat. However, the friend who owned the tarantula should have respected the narrator's boundaries and not allowed the prank, knowing the narrator's fear. The other friend's jump scare was reckless and contributed to the situation. \n\nBut the question is about the narrator's responsibility. Even though the action was a reflex, the narrator did kill the tarantula. However, considering the context\u2014extreme fear, a friend who had pranked before, and being warned not to\u2014might mitigate the blame. The friend's repeated disregard for the narrator's comfort level is a significant factor here. The narrator's action was a direct result of the prank, which the tarantula owner should have prevented. \n\nSo, while the narrator might feel justified due to fear, the actual act of killing the spider could still be seen as a mistake since they had the option to step back or call for help instead of reacting with a book. But given the circumstances, maybe the blame isn't entirely on the narrator. The main fault lies with the friends who set up the prank. However, the question is whether the narrator is the asshole. The community often considers intent and provocation. The narrator didn't intend to harm, but acted on fear. The friend's prior pranks and not respecting boundaries are more at fault. So the answer might lean towards the narrator not being in the wrong, but there's nuance. The user is more likely to get a 'No' because the friends were at fault for the prank, leading to the reaction.\n"
