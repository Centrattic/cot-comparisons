I don't like spiders at all, they creep me out tremendously.\n\nHe invited me and another friend to his house to play PS4. He showed the tarantulas as usual, always inside their enclosures. He knows I hate having them close by, but if they're secured inside their little enclosure I'm okay with it. I know he has pranked people before so I made it very clear to never to that to me as I'd very likely just kill it out of fear.\n\nWe're playing PS4 and he goes get something for us to eat. Meanwhile I'm just looking at his books. He gets there with a plate with a cover on it, the kind that goes in the microwave so food doesn't splatter everywhere. Our other friend takes the cover and does a huge jump scare, hitting the plate and making the fucking tarantula fly in my direction. I had a book in my hand and out of reflex I threw the book at it killing it right there.\n\nSo now he's all pissed at me for being a \"pussy\" and killing an harmless animal. Other people are also blaming me for it and I even got an angry WhatsApp message from a guy that also has tarantulas at home.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is the asshole here. So, the situation is that they were over a friend's house playing PS4, and the friend has some tarantulas. The author really hates spiders, even though they were in enclosures. They made it clear not to prank them with the spiders because they might kill it out of fear. Then, the friend brings a plate with a cover, probably to get some food. Another friend takes the cover off and does a jump scare, causing the plate to hit and the tarantula to fly towards the author. In a reflex, the author throws a book and kills the tarantula.\n\nFirst, the friend knows the author's dislike for spiders and that they might kill it if pranked. The friend still does the jump scare with the cover, which led to the accident. The author's action was a reflex to protect themselves from a spider they find terrifying. But the tarantula was in an enclosure, right? Wait, the story says that the friend showed the tarantulas as usual inside their enclosures. But during the incident, the tarantula was on a plate with a cover. Maybe the friend took it out of the enclosure to put on the plate? So, the author's friend was handling the tarantula, and the other friend's prank caused it to escape from the enclosure. \n\nThe author made it clear they wouldn't want to be pranked, so the friend should have respected that. The jump scare was initiated by another friend, but maybe the friend who owns the tarantula is responsible for keeping it contained. The author acting in reflex to kill the spider that was suddenly thrown at them might be understandable, given their phobia. However, the key points are whether the tarantula was properly contained and if the author had a right to kill it. If the friend was supposed to keep the spider in its enclosure and instead put it on a plate that was mishandled, then maybe the fault lies more with the friends for not being careful. The author's fear was communicated, so using that as an excuse might not be entirely unreasonable.\n\nBut on the other hand, killing an animal, even if it was an accident, can be seen as cruel. The author's action was a direct cause of the tarantula's death, so they might be blamed for not handling the situation better. However, if the tarantula was in a situation where it could escape due to the prank, the responsibility could be shared. The friend who owns the tarantula might have been negligent in handling it, and the other friend's prank was reckless. The author's reflex action was in self-defense due to their fear. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author might not be in the wrong entirely. The friends contributed to the situation by pranking and mishandling the tarantula. The author's clear communication about their fear and the direct action by others to provoke them could mean the blame isn't solely on the author. But some people might argue that the author should have found another way to deal with the spider without killing it. However, given the phobia and the sudden situation, maybe it's a reflex beyond their control. \n\nI think the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong. The friends didn't respect the author's boundaries by pranking, and the author's reaction was a reflex to their fear. The responsibility is more on those who caused the spider to come flying towards them.\n"
