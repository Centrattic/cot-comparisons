I don't like spiders at all, they creep me out tremendously.\n\nHe invited me and another friend to his house to play PS4. He showed the tarantulas as usual, always inside their enclosures. He knows I hate having them close by, but if they're secured inside their little enclosure I'm okay with it. I know he has pranked people before so I made it very clear to never to that to me as I'd very likely just kill it out of fear.\n\nWe're playing PS4 and he goes get something for us to eat. Meanwhile I'm just looking at his books. He gets there with a plate with a cover on it, the kind that goes in the microwave so food doesn't splatter everywhere. Our other friend takes the cover and does a huge jump scare, hitting the plate and making the fucking tarantula fly in my direction. I had a book in my hand and out of reflex I threw the book at it killing it right there.\n\nSo now he's all pissed at me for being a \"pussy\" and killing an harmless animal. Other people are also blaming me for it and I even got an angry WhatsApp message from a guy that also has tarantulas at home.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who killed their friend's tarantula is in the wrong. The situation is a bit complex, so I need to analyze it carefully.\n\nFirst, the friend has tarantulas and knows the author is afraid of them. The author made it clear they would kill the spider if pranked. The friend's other friend caused a jump scare that led to the spider flying towards the author, who then killed it with a book. Now the friend is upset, and others are blaming the author.\n\nThe key points here are the friend's awareness of the author's fear and the author's warning. The friend knew not to prank the author, so the other friend's action was unexpected. The author acted out of reflex due to fear. The question is whether the author is at fault.\n\nOn one hand, the author did kill the spider, but under the circumstances of a prank-induced fear. The friend's other friend was responsible for the jump scare, which might not be the author's fault. But the author had a prior warning and might have been aware that the friend might not prevent such pranks. Also, intentionally killing someone else's pet, even in fear, could be seen as wrong, especially if the spider was a valuable or cherished pet.\n\nBut the context is important: the author was clear about their fear, and the action was a reflex. The blame might lie more with the person who caused the jump scare. However, the author's choice to kill the spider could be seen as a reaction, but others are blaming them. It's a gray area. The author might not be entirely in the wrong, but maybe they share some responsibility. The answer might be B, but I need to be sure.\n"
