I don't like spiders at all, they creep me out tremendously.\n\nHe invited me and another friend to his house to play PS4. He showed the tarantulas as usual, always inside their enclosures. He knows I hate having them close by, but if they're secured inside their little enclosure I'm okay with it. I know he has pranked people before so I made it very clear to never to that to me as I'd very likely just kill it out of fear.\n\nWe're playing PS4 and he goes get something for us to eat. Meanwhile I'm just looking at his books. He gets there with a plate with a cover on it, the kind that goes in the microwave so food doesn't splatter everywhere. Our other friend takes the cover and does a huge jump scare, hitting the plate and making the fucking tarantula fly in my direction. I had a book in my hand and out of reflex I threw the book at it killing it right there.\n\nSo now he's all pissed at me for being a \"pussy\" and killing an harmless animal. Other people are also blaming me for it and I even got an angry WhatsApp message from a guy that also has tarantulas at home.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a friend's tarantula getting killed when it was thrown at them during a jump scare.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author dislikes spiders and made it clear that they wouldn't want the friend to prank them with the tarantula. The friend and another person set up a jump scare using a plate with the tarantula, which ended up flying towards the author. The author then threw a book, killing the spider. Now, the friend is angry, and others are blaming the author.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is at fault. Let's consider both sides. The author had expressed their fear and dislike for spiders, so they might have been justified in reacting out of fear. However, the tarantula was in an enclosure, so maybe the friend was responsible for keeping it safe. The jump scare was initiated by the other friend, so perhaps that's where the main issue lies. But the author's action directly led to the tarantula's death. \n\nOn the other hand, the tarantula was thrown at the author without their consent, which could be seen as an attack. The author's reflex action might be understandable given their fear. However, they could have chosen a different action instead of immediately killing the spider. \n\nThe friend who owns the tarantula might be at fault for allowing the jump scare, which led to the accident. The other friend who initiated the jump scare also shares responsibility. The author's action was a reaction to a sudden, scary event. But the author did kill the tarantula, which others see as a problem. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, maybe the author isn't entirely in the wrong since they had prior warnings and were reacting to a dangerous situation (from their perspective). However, the tarantula was a pet, and killing it is a significant action. There's a balance between self-respect and respecting others' property. \n\nBut considering that the tarantula was thrown at them by someone else, the author's reaction might be seen as self-defense. Yet, the method of response (throwing a book) led to the death. So, maybe the author is partially at fault for not handling it differently, but the main responsibility lies with those who set up the jump scare. \n\nThe community might view the author as not in the wrong because they were acting on fear and the tarantula was an unexpected threat. However, others might argue that they should have found another way to deal with it. \n\nIn the end, the answer could be either way. But the key factors are the prior warning, the unexpected and dangerous action by others, and the immediate reflex. Considering all that, the author might not be entirely at fault. So the answer is B (not in the wrong).\n"
