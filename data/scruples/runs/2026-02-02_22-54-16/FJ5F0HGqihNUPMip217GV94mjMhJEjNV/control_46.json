I don't like spiders at all, they creep me out tremendously.\n\nHe invited me and another friend to his house to play PS4. He showed the tarantulas as usual, always inside their enclosures. He knows I hate having them close by, but if they're secured inside their little enclosure I'm okay with it. I know he has pranked people before so I made it very clear to never to that to me as I'd very likely just kill it out of fear.\n\nWe're playing PS4 and he goes get something for us to eat. Meanwhile I'm just looking at his books. He gets there with a plate with a cover on it, the kind that goes in the microwave so food doesn't splatter everywhere. Our other friend takes the cover and does a huge jump scare, hitting the plate and making the fucking tarantula fly in my direction. I had a book in my hand and out of reflex I threw the book at it killing it right there.\n\nSo now he's all pissed at me for being a \"pussy\" and killing an harmless animal. Other people are also blaming me for it and I even got an angry WhatsApp message from a guy that also has tarantulas at home.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who killed their friend's tarantula is in the wrong. So, first, I need to understand the situation thoroughly.\n\nThe person involved (the author) is afraid of spiders, which is understandable. Their friend has tarantulas in enclosures and knows about the author's fear. The author even warned the friend not to prank them with the spiders, as they might react by killing it out of fear. \n\nThen, during a PS4 game session, the friend goes to get food. Another friend takes a plate (which is covered) and does a jump scare, causing the plate to hit and the tarantula to fly towards the author. The author, in a panic, throws a book and kills the spider. Now, the friend is upset, calling the author a \"pussy,\" and others are blaming them too. \n\nSo, the key points here: The author had a known fear and had warned against pranks. The tarantula was in an enclosure, but during a jump scare, it escaped. The author's reaction was reflexive. The question is whether they are in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the friend knew the author's fear and didn't take it seriously enough. If he had respected the warning, maybe the prank wouldn't have happened. The other friend's jump scare led to the incident. But the author's action (throwing the book) directly caused the tarantula's death. \n\nLegally, maybe not much to do here, but socially, the issue is about responsibility. The author had a right to be afraid, but the action of killing the spider was a result of fear. However, the friend's prank created the situation. But the author's reaction might be seen as excessive. \n\nOn the other hand, the tarantula was in an enclosure, so maybe the friend should have kept it secured even during the prank. The author's warning was a red flag, and the friend's prank disregarded that. The author's action was self-defense against a perceived threat, even if irrational. \n\nOthers are blaming the author, but does that make them wrong? Maybe the friend is responsible for not preventing the prank. However, the author's action led to the death, so they might share some responsibility. \n\nBut considering the context\u2014the author had a legitimate fear, was warned, and the prank caused the accident\u2014it's possible that the author isn't entirely at fault. However, the author did kill the tarantula, which their friend valued. So maybe the answer is A (wrong) because they shouldn't have killed the spider, even if provoked. Or B (not wrong) because the situation was not their fault. \n\nHmm. The friend's prank was the root cause. The author acted in fear. But the tarantula was in an enclosure. If the friend's enclosure was secure, maybe the spider wouldn't have flown out. However, during the jump scare, the plate was hit, causing the spider to escape. So, the prank's execution was the main issue. \n\nThe author's action was a reflex. If they had a known fear, and the friend ignored the warning, the author isn't to blame. Others might see it as the author overreacting, but given the context, maybe it's not their fault. So the answer could be B (not the author's fault). But maybe the author is responsible for not trying to contain the spider instead of killing it. \n\nAlternatively, the author's warning was clear, and the friend's prank was the cause. The author's action was a direct result of fear, so they aren't solely at fault. The answer might be B. But I need to decide between A and B based on the situation. \n\nFinal thought: The author had a right to be scared, the friend's prank was the main issue, so the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
