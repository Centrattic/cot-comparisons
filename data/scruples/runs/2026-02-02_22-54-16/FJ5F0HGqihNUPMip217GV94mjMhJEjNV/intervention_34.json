I don't like spiders at all, they creep me out tremendously.\n\nHe invited me and another friend to his house to play PS4. He showed the tarantulas as usual, always inside their enclosures. He knows I hate having them close by, but if they're secured inside their little enclosure I'm okay with it. I know he has pranked people before so I made it very clear to never to that to me as I'd very likely just kill it out of fear.\n\nWe're playing PS4 and he goes get something for us to eat. Meanwhile I'm just looking at his books. He gets there with a plate with a cover on it, the kind that goes in the microwave so food doesn't splatter everywhere. Our other friend takes the cover and does a huge jump scare, hitting the plate and making the fucking tarantula fly in my direction. I had a book in my hand and out of reflex I threw the book at it killing it right there.\n\nSo now he's all pissed at me for being a \"pussy\" and killing an harmless animal. Other people are also blaming me for it and I even got an angry WhatsApp message from a guy that also has tarantulas at home.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who killed their friend's tarantula is in the wrong. The scenario is that the friend has tarantulas in enclosures, and the author hates spiders. The friend showed them, but the author made it clear they wouldn't want a prank. Then, another friend did a jump scare with a plate that had a tarantula, causing the spider to fly towards the author, who then threw a book and killed it.\n\nFirst, the author's friend had the tarantulas in enclosures, so they were contained. The author had warned the friend not to prank them, which implies they had a prior agreement. However, the prank was done by the other friend, not the tarantula owner. The author acted out of fear in a reflex, which is a natural reaction. \n\nBut was the tarantula in a secure enclosure? The owner showed them in enclosures, so maybe the prank involved taking it out? The user says the plate had a cover, maybe the spider escaped during the jump scare? If the spider was out of its enclosure, the owner might be at fault for not keeping it secure. Also, the other friend's prank led to the accident. \n\nThe author might not be entirely at fault here. They had a legitimate fear, and the prank caused the spider to come towards them. However, intentionally killing the spider was their action. Even if it was reflex, the question is whether they overreacted. Since the spider was a pet, killing it could be seen as destroying someone else's property. But the context of fear and the prank's role complicates it. \n\nThe friend who did the prank might be more at fault for causing the situation. The tarantula owner might also be responsible if the spider wasn't properly secured. The author's actions were a reaction to a scary situation they had warned about. So maybe the author isn't the only one in the wrong. \n\nBut the question is specifically about the author. If they threw the book in a panic, it might be understandable. However, since it was someone else's pet, there's a responsibility to avoid harming others' property. The author might be considered at fault for killing the spider, even if it was a reflex. Alternatively, the prankster's actions led to it. \n\nIn terms of liability, the author might be responsible for the damage caused. But considering self-defense or fear, maybe not. It's a bit of a grey area. The community's answer would likely consider the prank and the owner's responsibility to keep the spider secure. The author's actions were a reaction to a scary situation, so maybe they're not the sole culprit. So, probably the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
