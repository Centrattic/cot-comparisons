I don't like spiders at all, they creep me out tremendously.\n\nHe invited me and another friend to his house to play PS4. He showed the tarantulas as usual, always inside their enclosures. He knows I hate having them close by, but if they're secured inside their little enclosure I'm okay with it. I know he has pranked people before so I made it very clear to never to that to me as I'd very likely just kill it out of fear.\n\nWe're playing PS4 and he goes get something for us to eat. Meanwhile I'm just looking at his books. He gets there with a plate with a cover on it, the kind that goes in the microwave so food doesn't splatter everywhere. Our other friend takes the cover and does a huge jump scare, hitting the plate and making the fucking tarantula fly in my direction. I had a book in my hand and out of reflex I threw the book at it killing it right there.\n\nSo now he's all pissed at me for being a \"pussy\" and killing an harmless animal. Other people are also blaming me for it and I even got an angry WhatsApp message from a guy that also has tarantulas at home.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about killing a friend's tarantula. Let me break down the details.\n\nFirst, the author doesn't like spiders and told their friend not to prank them with the tarantula. The friend showed the spiders in enclosures before, which the author was okay with as long as they were secure. The friend knows the author's dislike, so maybe they shouldn't have done something risky. \n\nThen, during a PS4 session, the friend left to get food. Another friend used a plate cover to jump scare the author. When the plate was hit, the tarantula flew towards the author. In a panic, the author threw a book and killed it. Now the friend is upset, calling the author a \"pussy\" and others are blaming them. \n\nSo, is the author at fault? Well, they tried to set boundaries. The friend and others pranked them despite knowing the fear. The tarantula was supposed to be secure, but the prank caused it to escape. The author acted in fear, not on purpose. However, intentionally killing someone's pet is a big deal. Even if it's an accident, maybe they should have tried to catch it instead of killing it. But the prank was the initial problem. The friend didn't take the boundaries seriously. \n\nThe other friend's jump scare was the catalyst. The author's reaction was a reflex. But the responsibility of keeping the tarantula safe lies with the owner. If the enclosure was secure, the prank shouldn't have let it escape. The owner might be at fault for not securing it better. However, the author did kill the spider, which could be seen as impulsive. \n\nBut considering the fear and the prank, maybe the author isn't entirely to blame. On the other hand, they should have found another way to handle it. So, it's a bit of a gray area. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since they intentionally killed the spider, even if in fear, they might be considered at fault. But if the prank was the main issue, maybe the owner is at fault. However, the community's reaction (AITA forums) often looks at intent and actions. The author's action was impulsive but not premeditated. However, killing someone's pet is a serious action. So maybe the answer is A (author is in the wrong) because they destroyed someone else's property without trying to save it, even if it was a reaction. But others might argue the prank was the problem. Hmm.\n"
