I don't like spiders at all, they creep me out tremendously.\n\nHe invited me and another friend to his house to play PS4. He showed the tarantulas as usual, always inside their enclosures. He knows I hate having them close by, but if they're secured inside their little enclosure I'm okay with it. I know he has pranked people before so I made it very clear to never to that to me as I'd very likely just kill it out of fear.\n\nWe're playing PS4 and he goes get something for us to eat. Meanwhile I'm just looking at his books. He gets there with a plate with a cover on it, the kind that goes in the microwave so food doesn't splatter everywhere. Our other friend takes the cover and does a huge jump scare, hitting the plate and making the fucking tarantula fly in my direction. I had a book in my hand and out of reflex I threw the book at it killing it right there.\n\nSo now he's all pissed at me for being a \"pussy\" and killing an harmless animal. Other people are also blaming me for it and I even got an angry WhatsApp message from a guy that also has tarantulas at home.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who killed their friend's tarantula is in the wrong. The story says that the friend has tarantulas and showed them during a PS4 gaming session. The author made it clear they wouldn't handle the spiders because they're creeped out, but if they're in enclosures, they're okay with it. The friend has a history of pranks, so the author told him not to prank them.\n\nThen, when the friend is away getting food, the other friend does a jump scare with a plate that has a tarantula on it. The author, in a panic, throws a book and kills the spider. The friend is upset, calling the author a \"pussy\" and blaming them for killing an animal. Others are also upset, and even another person with tarantulas sent an angry message. The author is questioning if they're the asshole.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author had a known fear and communicated it, the tarantula was not in an enclosure, the other friend's prank caused the incident, and the author acted reflexively out of fear. \n\nThe friend who owns the tarantula knows the author's fear and might be responsible for not securing the spider properly. The prank by the other friend was reckless, leading to the tarantula being loose. The author's reaction is a reflex due to fear, which is understandable, but the question is whether that makes them the asshole. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, intentionally killing someone else's pet is wrong, even if done in fear. However, the context matters. The author didn't mean to harm it, but the friend's pranks and lack of enclosure responsibility might shift some blame. Still, the author should consider the pet's value and find a non-lethal way to handle the situation, like grabbing it and putting it back. \n\nBut since the action was reflexive and due to fear, and the tarantula was already out of its enclosure because of the prank, maybe the author isn't entirely at fault. The friend who pranked is probably more to blame. However, the question is about the author's actions. If the person who owns the tarantula is upset, the author might still be partially at fault for not handling the situation better. \n\nAlternatively, if the tarantula was in a temporary situation due to the prank, and the author couldn't safely handle it, maybe it's more of a shared responsibility. But the author did kill the spider, which is a direct action. So, depending on the community's view, the author might be seen as the asshole for not reacting appropriately, even if it was a reflex. But others might argue that the prank was the real issue. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the person who caused the problem (the prankster) is often the focus, but the question is about the author. If the author had the chance to avoid killing the tarantula but didn't, they could be considered at fault. But if the prank was so unexpected that there was no time to react safely, then the author's fear response is legitimate. \n\nI think the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because the author communicated their fear, the tarantula was out of its enclosure due to a prank, and the reaction was reflexive. But I need to check if there's any nuance I'm missing. Maybe the author should have tried to catch it instead, but given the fear and the sudden scare, that might be unreasonable. The friend's actions in not securing the tarantula and pranking might be the main issues. So the author isn't the asshole.\n"
