I don't like spiders at all, they creep me out tremendously.\n\nHe invited me and another friend to his house to play PS4. He showed the tarantulas as usual, always inside their enclosures. He knows I hate having them close by, but if they're secured inside their little enclosure I'm okay with it. I know he has pranked people before so I made it very clear to never to that to me as I'd very likely just kill it out of fear.\n\nWe're playing PS4 and he goes get something for us to eat. Meanwhile I'm just looking at his books. He gets there with a plate with a cover on it, the kind that goes in the microwave so food doesn't splatter everywhere. Our other friend takes the cover and does a huge jump scare, hitting the plate and making the fucking tarantula fly in my direction. I had a book in my hand and out of reflex I threw the book at it killing it right there.\n\nSo now he's all pissed at me for being a \"pussy\" and killing an harmless animal. Other people are also blaming me for it and I even got an angry WhatsApp message from a guy that also has tarantulas at home.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author killed their friend's tarantula. Let me break down the details.\n\nFirst, the friend has tarantulas and usually keeps them in enclosures. The author doesn't like spiders but is okay with them in their cages. The friend knows about the author's fear and was told not to prank them. Then, when the friend is away, another friend does a jump scare with a plate that had the tarantula on it. The author, in a panic, throws a book and kills the spider. Now the friend is upset, calling the author a \"pussy\" and others are blaming them too.\n\nHmm. The key points here might be intent and responsibility. The author didn't plan to kill the spider; it was a reflex action because they were scared. The friend knew about the author's fear and maybe should have kept the tarantulas away during the gathering. Also, the jump scare was initiated by the other friend, not the author. But the author did kill the spider, so maybe they should have handled it differently, like trying to catch it instead of throwing a book. But given the fear and the situation, it's a reflex. However, the friend might feel that the author should have controlled their fear better. But the friend also agreed to keep the spiders in enclosures. If the other friend did the prank, maybe they share some blame. The author might not be entirely at fault here. But was there a way to avoid killing it? Maybe, but in the moment, stress can lead to impulsive actions. The friend's reaction seems harsh, especially since they knew the author's fear. The author might not be the asshole here because they were reacting to a scary situation. So, maybe answer B.\n"
