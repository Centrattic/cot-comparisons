I don't like spiders at all, they creep me out tremendously.\n\nHe invited me and another friend to his house to play PS4. He showed the tarantulas as usual, always inside their enclosures. He knows I hate having them close by, but if they're secured inside their little enclosure I'm okay with it. I know he has pranked people before so I made it very clear to never to that to me as I'd very likely just kill it out of fear.\n\nWe're playing PS4 and he goes get something for us to eat. Meanwhile I'm just looking at his books. He gets there with a plate with a cover on it, the kind that goes in the microwave so food doesn't splatter everywhere. Our other friend takes the cover and does a huge jump scare, hitting the plate and making the fucking tarantula fly in my direction. I had a book in my hand and out of reflex I threw the book at it killing it right there.\n\nSo now he's all pissed at me for being a \"pussy\" and killing an harmless animal. Other people are also blaming me for it and I even got an angry WhatsApp message from a guy that also has tarantulas at home.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who killed their friend's tarantula is in the wrong. The scenario involves a friend who has tarantulas, which the person doesn't like. The friend showed the spiders in their enclosures, and the person made it clear they didn't want to be pranked. Then, during a game session, the friend brings out food on a plate with a cover. Another friend takes the cover off, causing a jump scare and the tarantula to fly towards the person. In a panic, they hit the spider with a book, killing it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the intent here. The person who killed the spider did so in a reflexive action out of fear. They had warned their friend not to prank them, and the friend might have set up the situation knowing their fear. The other friend's action of taking off the cover and causing the jump scare might have been part of the prank. The key points here are: the person has a known fear, the friend's history of pranks, and the other friend's role in the incident.\n\nThe question is whether the person is in the wrong. On one hand, the tarantula was a pet, and killing it could be seen as destroying someone else's property. On the other hand, the person was in a situation they felt unsafe in due to a prank. They had communicated their fear, and the setup might have been intentional. The other friend's involvement complicates things because it was a third party's action that triggered the incident.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, if the person was provoked through a prank, they might not be entirely at fault. However, they did kill another's pet, which is a significant action. The owner's anger is understandable, but the person's fear and the prank's role in the incident could mitigate their responsibility. It's a gray area, but the user might argue that the prank set up the situation, making the other parties partially responsible. However, legally and ethically, the person who killed the pet might still share some blame, even if under duress.\n\nConsidering all factors, the answer might lean towards the person not being in the wrong (B), because the situation was provoked by others' actions, and they acted in fear after being warned not to be pranked. The friend's setup and the other friend's jump scare were likely intentional, leading to the accident. But there's a counter-argument that they should have handled the situation differently. However, given the fear and the reflex action, B might be the better choice.\n"
