I don't like spiders at all, they creep me out tremendously.\n\nHe invited me and another friend to his house to play PS4. He showed the tarantulas as usual, always inside their enclosures. He knows I hate having them close by, but if they're secured inside their little enclosure I'm okay with it. I know he has pranked people before so I made it very clear to never to that to me as I'd very likely just kill it out of fear.\n\nWe're playing PS4 and he goes get something for us to eat. Meanwhile I'm just looking at his books. He gets there with a plate with a cover on it, the kind that goes in the microwave so food doesn't splatter everywhere. Our other friend takes the cover and does a huge jump scare, hitting the plate and making the fucking tarantula fly in my direction. I had a book in my hand and out of reflex I threw the book at it killing it right there.\n\nSo now he's all pissed at me for being a \"pussy\" and killing an harmless animal. Other people are also blaming me for it and I even got an angry WhatsApp message from a guy that also has tarantulas at home.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The person is asking if they're the asshole for killing their friend's tarantula. The situation is a bit complex.\n\nFirst, the friend has tarantulas in enclosures and showed them to the group. The author mentioned they hate spiders but are okay if they're enclosed. The friend knows this and supposedly promised not to prank them. Then another friend jumps them with a plate that drops the spider into the author's space. The author, in fear, threw a book and killed the spider.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, the spider was in an enclosure, but someone else caused it to fly out. The author's action was a reflex out of fear. The friend who owns the spider is upset, and others are blaming the author. But did the author do something wrong?\n\nWell, the owner of the spider had control over the enclosures. The other friend's prank led to the spider being released. The author's reaction was a reflex. However, intentionally killing someone else's pet, even in fear, could be seen as a problem. But if the spider was a threat, maybe it's understandable. But since it was a tarantula, which isn't dangerous, maybe the owner has a right to be upset. The author had warned about not being pranked, but the prank still happened. So the other friend's action might be more at fault. But legally and morally, the author might be held responsible because they killed the spider. However, if the spider was a threat in the moment, maybe not. It's a bit of a grey area. Some might say the prank was the main issue, others might say the author overreacted. But since the spider was in an enclosure and the prank caused it to be thrown, maybe the owner is also at fault for letting it happen. Hmm. Maybe the answer is that the author isn't the asshole because they acted in fear, but the prank was the real issue. Or maybe they are responsible for killing someone else's pet. I'm a bit torn. The key points are: the author had a known fear, the prank was the trigger, and the owner's responsibility for keeping the spider secure. Since the owner's other friend did the prank, maybe the author isn't entirely wrong. But killing the spider was a direct action. I think there's a case for both sides. However, in the context of the question, the community might lean towards the author being in the wrong because they killed someone else's pet, even if provoked. Or maybe not, because it was a reflex. I'm leaning towards B, not the asshole, because the prank was the real issue and the author had a valid fear.\n"
