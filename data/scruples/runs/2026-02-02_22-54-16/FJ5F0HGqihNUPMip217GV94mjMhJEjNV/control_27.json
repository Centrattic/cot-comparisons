I don't like spiders at all, they creep me out tremendously.\n\nHe invited me and another friend to his house to play PS4. He showed the tarantulas as usual, always inside their enclosures. He knows I hate having them close by, but if they're secured inside their little enclosure I'm okay with it. I know he has pranked people before so I made it very clear to never to that to me as I'd very likely just kill it out of fear.\n\nWe're playing PS4 and he goes get something for us to eat. Meanwhile I'm just looking at his books. He gets there with a plate with a cover on it, the kind that goes in the microwave so food doesn't splatter everywhere. Our other friend takes the cover and does a huge jump scare, hitting the plate and making the fucking tarantula fly in my direction. I had a book in my hand and out of reflex I threw the book at it killing it right there.\n\nSo now he's all pissed at me for being a \"pussy\" and killing an harmless animal. Other people are also blaming me for it and I even got an angry WhatsApp message from a guy that also has tarantulas at home.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for killing their friend's tarantula. So, first, I need to break down the situation.\n\nThe author doesn't like spiders and has made it clear that their friend shouldn't prank them with the tarantula. The friend does show them the tarantula, but it's in the enclosure. Then, during a game session, the friend goes to get food, and the other friend uses a plate cover to jump scare the author. This causes the tarantula to fly towards the author, who then throws a book and kills it.\n\nNow, the key points here. The friend knew the author's fear and had said not to prank them. Another friend did the jump scare, which was reckless. The author acted out of fear and reflex. The question is whether the author is at fault.\n\nThe friend's action of getting food with a plate and cover, which the other friend used to jump scare, might have been a setup. The author warned about pranks, so the jump scare was against their wishes. The friend who owns the tarantula is upset, but the actual prank was done by another friend. The author's action was a direct reaction to a sudden, scary situation. \n\nSo, considering that the author had a valid fear and the prank was initiated by another person, maybe the blame isn't entirely on the author. However, intentionally killing the tarantula, even in a reflex, could be seen as overreacting. But the context of being frightened by a prank complicates things. The friend who owns the tarantula might still be upset, but the initial prank was reckless. \n\nHmm. The author's actions were a reflex to a scary situation, and they had warned about pranks. The other friend's actions led to the incident. So maybe the author isn't entirely at fault. But does that make them not the asshole? Or is the fact that they killed the tarantula despite knowing it's important to the owner make them responsible? \n\nIt's tricky. The owner might feel responsible for not preventing the prank, but the author's action was a direct result of the prank. I think the main wrongdoers here are the other friend who did the jump scare, and maybe the owner for not stopping it. The author's action was a reaction to a sudden fear. So the answer might be B, not the asshole.\n"
