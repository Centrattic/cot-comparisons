I don't like spiders at all, they creep me out tremendously.\n\nHe invited me and another friend to his house to play PS4. He showed the tarantulas as usual, always inside their enclosures. He knows I hate having them close by, but if they're secured inside their little enclosure I'm okay with it. I know he has pranked people before so I made it very clear to never to that to me as I'd very likely just kill it out of fear.\n\nWe're playing PS4 and he goes get something for us to eat. Meanwhile I'm just looking at his books. He gets there with a plate with a cover on it, the kind that goes in the microwave so food doesn't splatter everywhere. Our other friend takes the cover and does a huge jump scare, hitting the plate and making the fucking tarantula fly in my direction. I had a book in my hand and out of reflex I threw the book at it killing it right there.\n\nSo now he's all pissed at me for being a \"pussy\" and killing an harmless animal. Other people are also blaming me for it and I even got an angry WhatsApp message from a guy that also has tarantulas at home.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the AITA story is in the wrong. The story is about a friend having tarantulas, the author hates spiders, and another friend pranked them by making a tarantula fly towards the author, who then killed it with a book. The friend is upset, others blame the author, and even a guy with tarantulas sent an angry message.\n\nSo, the main points here. The author made it clear they wouldn't want to be pranked with spiders. The friend did a jump scare using a plate with a cover, which caused the tarantula to fly towards the author. The author reacted out of fear and threw a book, killing the spider. Now, the friend is angry, calling the author a \"pussy\" and blaming them for killing an animal. Others are also blaming the author.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. Let me break it down. First, the friend knew the author disliked spiders and made it clear not to prank them. But the friend still did the jump scare, which was the initial action that led to the tarantula moving. The other friend was the one who actually took the cover and jump-scared, which might be a key point. The author's action was a reflex to fear. However, the tarantula was in an enclosure, so maybe the friend's setup wasn't safe? The author's intent was to protect themselves from fear, but the tarantula was accidentally killed in the process.\n\nNow, the question is about whether the author is at fault. The friend who owns the tarantula is upset, but if he knew the author's aversion and still allowed the prank, maybe he's partly responsible for not securing the tarantula properly or for enabling the prank. The other friend's actions were reckless, causing the tarantula to fly out. But the author's reaction was fear-based. If the tarantula was in an enclosure, maybe the author could have moved away or screamed instead of killing it. However, the user's perspective is that the person who did the prank is the one at fault, and the author's reflex is understandable.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the key is often about whose actions were the most inconsiderate or at fault. The friend who owns the tarantula might be in the wrong for not taking the author's fear seriously and allowing the prank to happen. The other friend's prank was the immediate cause. The author's action was a direct result of the prank and their fear. But if the tarantula was in a secure enclosure, maybe the author didn't intend to kill it and acted in a panic. The friend's anger seems misplaced because he didn't respect the author's boundaries. So the answer might be B, the author is not in the wrong. However, some might argue that the author could have handled it differently. But given the context of a prank that led to a reflex action, B seems right.\n"
