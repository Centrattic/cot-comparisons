I don't like spiders at all, they creep me out tremendously.\n\nHe invited me and another friend to his house to play PS4. He showed the tarantulas as usual, always inside their enclosures. He knows I hate having them close by, but if they're secured inside their little enclosure I'm okay with it. I know he has pranked people before so I made it very clear to never to that to me as I'd very likely just kill it out of fear.\n\nWe're playing PS4 and he goes get something for us to eat. Meanwhile I'm just looking at his books. He gets there with a plate with a cover on it, the kind that goes in the microwave so food doesn't splatter everywhere. Our other friend takes the cover and does a huge jump scare, hitting the plate and making the fucking tarantula fly in my direction. I had a book in my hand and out of reflex I threw the book at it killing it right there.\n\nSo now he's all pissed at me for being a \"pussy\" and killing an harmless animal. Other people are also blaming me for it and I even got an angry WhatsApp message from a guy that also has tarantulas at home.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who killed their friend's tarantula is in the wrong. The situation involves a friend showing off his tarantulas, which the narrator dislikes. The friend knows this and the narrator made it clear not to prank them. The other friend did a jump scare with a plate that had a tarantula on it, which flew towards the narrator. In reflex, the narrator threw a book and killed the spider.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the intentions. The narrator had made their dislike of spiders clear and had specified not to prank them. The friend who did the jump scare is at fault here for ignoring that request and causing the incident. However, the narrator, out of fear, reacted by killing the tarantula. The friend who owns the tarantula is upset, calling the narrator a \"pussy\" and others are blaming him.\n\nBut considering the context, the narrator was in a stressful situation. The tarantula was thrown towards him unexpectedly. The friend who pranked him is responsible for the initial action. The narrator's action was a reflex to protect themselves from a sudden, scary event. The owner of the spider should have ensured the safety of the animal and respected the narrator's boundaries. The other people blaming the narrator might not be considering the prankster's role in the incident.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the prankster is the one who caused the tarantula to be thrown. The narrator's action was a direct reaction to self-preservation. The owner's anger might be misplaced here. So, the narrator isn't necessarily in the wrong because they acted out of fear, and the prank was a setup. The fault lies more with the friend who initiated the prank.\n"
