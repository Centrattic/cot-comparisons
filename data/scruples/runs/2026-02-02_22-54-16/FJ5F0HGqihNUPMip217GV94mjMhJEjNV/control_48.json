I don't like spiders at all, they creep me out tremendously.\n\nHe invited me and another friend to his house to play PS4. He showed the tarantulas as usual, always inside their enclosures. He knows I hate having them close by, but if they're secured inside their little enclosure I'm okay with it. I know he has pranked people before so I made it very clear to never to that to me as I'd very likely just kill it out of fear.\n\nWe're playing PS4 and he goes get something for us to eat. Meanwhile I'm just looking at his books. He gets there with a plate with a cover on it, the kind that goes in the microwave so food doesn't splatter everywhere. Our other friend takes the cover and does a huge jump scare, hitting the plate and making the fucking tarantula fly in my direction. I had a book in my hand and out of reflex I threw the book at it killing it right there.\n\nSo now he's all pissed at me for being a \"pussy\" and killing an harmless animal. Other people are also blaming me for it and I even got an angry WhatsApp message from a guy that also has tarantulas at home.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who killed their friend's tarantula is in the wrong. The story says the friend has tarantulas and knows the person is scared of spiders. The friend showed them in enclosures, which the person was okay with as long as they were secured. The friend also pranks people, so the person told him not to do that because they might kill the spider out of fear.\n\nThen, while playing PS4, the friend left to get food. Another friend used a plate cover to jump scare the user, causing the tarantula to fly towards them. The user, in a reflex, threw a book and killed it. Now the friend is angry, calling them a \"pussy\" and others are blaming them too.\n\nSo, the key points here. The user made it clear they don't want to be around spiders and warned the friend not to prank them. The jump scare was done by another friend, not the person who owns the tarantula. The tarantula was in an enclosure, but the jump scare caused it to escape. The user acted in fear, not intending to kill it. However, they did kill it with a book.\n\nWas the user wrong? Well, the owner's responsibility includes securing the tarantula. If the enclosures were secure, maybe the jump scare shouldn't have caused the spider to fly out. Also, the user had warned against being pranked, so the friend might have set up a situation where the tarantula could be in danger. However, the user's action of throwing a book was a reaction to fear. But since the tarantula wasn't directly threatening them (it was just flying towards them), maybe they still had a choice. But given the context, the owner's setup might have been unsafe if the enclosures could be disturbed by such actions. The user might not be entirely at fault here. The friend who jump-scared might be more to blame for causing the incident. However, the user did kill the tarantula. So, maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong) because they were reacting to a fear they communicated, and the incident was caused by others' actions. The owner's enclosures might not have been secure enough if a jump scare could lead to the spider being thrown. But if the enclosures were properly secured, maybe the user is at fault for killing it without ensuring it was safe. Hmm. It's a bit tricky. But considering they had warned against pranks, and the jump scare was initiated by another person, leading to the spider escaping. The user acted in fear, so maybe they aren't the asshole. So answer B.\n"
