I don't like spiders at all, they creep me out tremendously.\n\nHe invited me and another friend to his house to play PS4. He showed the tarantulas as usual, always inside their enclosures. He knows I hate having them close by, but if they're secured inside their little enclosure I'm okay with it. I know he has pranked people before so I made it very clear to never to that to me as I'd very likely just kill it out of fear.\n\nWe're playing PS4 and he goes get something for us to eat. Meanwhile I'm just looking at his books. He gets there with a plate with a cover on it, the kind that goes in the microwave so food doesn't splatter everywhere. Our other friend takes the cover and does a huge jump scare, hitting the plate and making the fucking tarantula fly in my direction. I had a book in my hand and out of reflex I threw the book at it killing it right there.\n\nSo now he's all pissed at me for being a \"pussy\" and killing an harmless animal. Other people are also blaming me for it and I even got an angry WhatsApp message from a guy that also has tarantulas at home.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author killed their friend's tarantula. The friend has a couple of tarantulas and often shows them off in their enclosures. The author really hates spiders and made it clear that if the friend ever pranks them, they might kill the spider out of fear.\n\nThe incident happened when the friend left to get food. Another friend took a plate with a cover off, causing a jump scare. The plate hit, and the tarantula flew towards the author. In reflex, the author threw a book and killed the tarantula. Now the friend is angry, calling the author a \"pussy,\" and others are blaming them too.\n\nFirst, the author did warn their friend about their dislike of spiders. They made it clear that a prank like this could lead to them killing the spider. So the friend knew the risk. The other friend's jump scare caused the accident. The author acted out of reflex, not premeditated intent. \n\nBut on the other hand, the tarantula was in an enclosure, so maybe the friend and the other person didn't handle it properly. The author's action was a reaction to a sudden, scary situation. However, tarantulas are delicate, and even if it was an accident, the author's action resulted in the death of a pet. \n\nThe friend's anger might be about the loss of the pet and feeling disrespected. The author's warning was a red flag, but the jump scare was initiated by another person. The author might not be entirely at fault, but maybe they should have handled the situation differently, like moving away or getting help instead of using a book. \n\nConsidering all that, the author's reflex action was in response to a provocation from others. They had already communicated their discomfort. So while they are responsible for the action, the chain of events started with the jump scare. The answer might be B (not the asshole) because they were reacting to others' actions and had already set boundaries."
