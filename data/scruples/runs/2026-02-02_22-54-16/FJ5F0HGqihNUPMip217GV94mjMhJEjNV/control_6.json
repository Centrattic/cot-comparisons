I don't like spiders at all, they creep me out tremendously.\n\nHe invited me and another friend to his house to play PS4. He showed the tarantulas as usual, always inside their enclosures. He knows I hate having them close by, but if they're secured inside their little enclosure I'm okay with it. I know he has pranked people before so I made it very clear to never to that to me as I'd very likely just kill it out of fear.\n\nWe're playing PS4 and he goes get something for us to eat. Meanwhile I'm just looking at his books. He gets there with a plate with a cover on it, the kind that goes in the microwave so food doesn't splatter everywhere. Our other friend takes the cover and does a huge jump scare, hitting the plate and making the fucking tarantula fly in my direction. I had a book in my hand and out of reflex I threw the book at it killing it right there.\n\nSo now he's all pissed at me for being a \"pussy\" and killing an harmless animal. Other people are also blaming me for it and I even got an angry WhatsApp message from a guy that also has tarantulas at home.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a friend who has tarantulas and another friend who's terrified of spiders. The friend shows off the tarantulas in their enclosures, which the author is okay with as long as they're contained. The author made it clear that if the friend pranks them, they might kill the spider out of fear.\n\nThen, during a game session, the friend goes to get food. The other friend uses a plate cover to jump-scare the author, causing a tarantula to fly out and the author throws a book, killing it. Now the friend is upset and others are blaming the author.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author warned the friend not to prank them because they might kill the spider. The friend knew this. The prank was done by the other friend, not the owner of the tarantula. However, the tarantula was in an enclosure. The owner might have been negligent if the enclosure wasn't secure enough to prevent the spider from escaping even when the plate was hit. But the owner is responsible for their pets.\n\nThe author acted out of fear and self-defense, but they were not physically harmed. However, they destroyed someone else's property (the tarantula). Legally, that could be considered damaging property. The author might argue it was an accident, but they did anticipate that a prank might lead to that outcome and still warned the friend. The other friend's prank was the direct cause, but the owner's setup might have been a factor.\n\nEmotionally, the owner is losing an animal they care about, and others are upset. The author's fear is valid, but their action resulted in irreversible damage. The question is whether the author is responsible despite the circumstances. If the owner didn't secure the tarantula properly, maybe they share some blame. However, the author didn't have prior intent, but their warning shows they knew the risk. It's a bit of a gray area, but in terms of responsibility, the author might be considered at fault because they killed someone else's animal, even if it was accidental. So, maybe the answer is A (author is the asshole).\n"
