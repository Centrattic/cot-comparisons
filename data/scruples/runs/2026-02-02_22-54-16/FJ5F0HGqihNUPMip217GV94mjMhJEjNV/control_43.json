I don't like spiders at all, they creep me out tremendously.\n\nHe invited me and another friend to his house to play PS4. He showed the tarantulas as usual, always inside their enclosures. He knows I hate having them close by, but if they're secured inside their little enclosure I'm okay with it. I know he has pranked people before so I made it very clear to never to that to me as I'd very likely just kill it out of fear.\n\nWe're playing PS4 and he goes get something for us to eat. Meanwhile I'm just looking at his books. He gets there with a plate with a cover on it, the kind that goes in the microwave so food doesn't splatter everywhere. Our other friend takes the cover and does a huge jump scare, hitting the plate and making the fucking tarantula fly in my direction. I had a book in my hand and out of reflex I threw the book at it killing it right there.\n\nSo now he's all pissed at me for being a \"pussy\" and killing an harmless animal. Other people are also blaming me for it and I even got an angry WhatsApp message from a guy that also has tarantulas at home.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is at fault. The situation is that the author killed their friend's tarantula when it was accidentally thrown at them during a prank. The friend had enclosures for the spiders, but during a jump scare, the plate with the tarantula was hit, causing it to fly towards the author. The author then threw a book, killing the spider.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the details. The friend knew the author hated spiders and had warned him not to prank them, as the author might kill the spider out of fear. The friend still went along with the prank, which led to the accident. The other friend was responsible for the jump scare by removing the plate cover. The author acted in a reflex to protect themselves from the spider they fear.\n\nNow, legal aspects? In many places, intentionally killing someone's property is a problem, but here it was an accident. The author didn't mean to kill the spider; it was a reflex action due to fear. The friend had a responsibility to respect the author's warning and not engage in behavior that could cause harm to their property. The other friend's prank was careless, leading to the accident.\n\nMoral aspects: The author had a fear-based reaction. While they did kill the spider, it was in self-defense from a prank that put them in a scary situation. The friend might be at fault for not respecting the author's boundaries and pranking them despite the warning. The author's actions were a direct result of the prank, so it's a bit of a grey area. However, since the spider was someone's property, the author might still be held responsible, but given the circumstances, maybe not entirely.\n\nThe friend and the other person pranked them, leading to the accident. So maybe the author isn't the main culprit. The friend's pranking despite knowing the author's fear is a bigger issue. The author's reflex action is understandable. So, the answer might be B, the author is not in the wrong. But I need to be careful. If the author should have handled it differently, maybe not with a book. But given the fear and reflex, it's a split-second reaction. The friend's prank was the root problem. So the author isn't the asshole here. Answer B.\n"
