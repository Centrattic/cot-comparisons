I don't like spiders at all, they creep me out tremendously.\n\nHe invited me and another friend to his house to play PS4. He showed the tarantulas as usual, always inside their enclosures. He knows I hate having them close by, but if they're secured inside their little enclosure I'm okay with it. I know he has pranked people before so I made it very clear to never to that to me as I'd very likely just kill it out of fear.\n\nWe're playing PS4 and he goes get something for us to eat. Meanwhile I'm just looking at his books. He gets there with a plate with a cover on it, the kind that goes in the microwave so food doesn't splatter everywhere. Our other friend takes the cover and does a huge jump scare, hitting the plate and making the fucking tarantula fly in my direction. I had a book in my hand and out of reflex I threw the book at it killing it right there.\n\nSo now he's all pissed at me for being a \"pussy\" and killing an harmless animal. Other people are also blaming me for it and I even got an angry WhatsApp message from a guy that also has tarantulas at home.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe user is asking if they're the asshole for killing their friend's tarantula. The setup is that the friend has tarantulas in enclosures, and the writer is afraid of spiders. The friend knows this and wasn't supposed to prank them. While playing PS4, another friend jumps and hits a plate, causing the tarantula to fly toward the writer. The writer throws a book in reflex and kills the spider. Now the friend is angry, saying they're a \"pussy,\" and others are blaming them too.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The writer made it clear they didn't want to be pranked because of their fear. The friend who has the tarantula knew this. Another friend (not the tarantula owner) did the jump scare, which led to the accident. The writer acted in a panic, thinking the spider was coming toward them. \n\nIs the writer at fault? Well, they were in a stressful situation, and their fear was a factor. The friend who did the jump scare is probably the main culprit here, as they knew the writer's fear and still pranked them. The owner of the tarantula also might share some blame for not preventing the prank. The writer's action was a reflex to protect themselves from a perceived threat. However, intentionally killing an animal, even in fear, could be seen as a problem. But since it was a reflex and not a premeditated act, maybe they're not to blame. Others are blaming them, but maybe the real issue is the prank and the lack of consideration from the other friends. \n\nLegal perspective? Probably not a legal issue, but morally or socially? The writer might feel justified, but others might see it as overreacting. The friend's anger is about the loss of the pet, but the writer's fear is valid. However, they could have tried to capture the spider instead of killing it. But in the heat of the moment, who knows what they might do. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be B, the author is not in the wrong. They were trying to protect themselves from a scary situation caused by others' actions. The prank was the initial problem, leading to the accident. The writer's action, though causing harm, was a reaction to a sudden, frightening event. The other friends' pranking and the lack of responsibility on their part might mean the writer isn't the asshole here.\n"
