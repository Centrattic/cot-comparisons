I don't like spiders at all, they creep me out tremendously.\n\nHe invited me and another friend to his house to play PS4. He showed the tarantulas as usual, always inside their enclosures. He knows I hate having them close by, but if they're secured inside their little enclosure I'm okay with it. I know he has pranked people before so I made it very clear to never to that to me as I'd very likely just kill it out of fear.\n\nWe're playing PS4 and he goes get something for us to eat. Meanwhile I'm just looking at his books. He gets there with a plate with a cover on it, the kind that goes in the microwave so food doesn't splatter everywhere. Our other friend takes the cover and does a huge jump scare, hitting the plate and making the fucking tarantula fly in my direction. I had a book in my hand and out of reflex I threw the book at it killing it right there.\n\nSo now he's all pissed at me for being a \"pussy\" and killing an harmless animal. Other people are also blaming me for it and I even got an angry WhatsApp message from a guy that also has tarantulas at home.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who killed their friend's tarantula is in the wrong. The situation involves a friend who has tarantulas and pranks, another friend who was warned about the pranks, and an incident where a tarantula was thrown at the user, leading to them killing it with a book.\n\nFirst, the user mentioned they're extremely afraid of spiders. They were warned not to prank them because of this fear. The friend did a jump scare with the plate, causing the tarantula to fly towards them. The user, in fear, threw a book, killing the tarantula. The friend is upset, calling them a \"pussy,\" and others are blaming them too. Another tarantula owner even sent an angry message.\n\nSo, considering intent: the user didn't mean to kill the spider, it was a reflex action due to fear. The friend initiated the prank, which led to the accident. The user had made their dislike of pranks clear. However, the user did kill the tarantula, which is a pet. Even if it was an accident, they might be held responsible since they were the one who threw the book. But the context is important\u2014the prank caused the situation. The user had a valid fear and acted in self-defense. The friend's actions directly led to the incident. So, maybe the friend is more at fault. But legally, the user might be responsible for the pet's death. However, in terms of moral blame, given the circumstances, the user's action was a reaction to a prank they were warned about. So, the answer could be B (not in the wrong) because the prank was the cause. But some might argue that the user should have controlled their fear. However, the user clearly stated their fear and the friend still proceeded with the prank, which is the root issue. Therefore, the user is not in the wrong.\n"
