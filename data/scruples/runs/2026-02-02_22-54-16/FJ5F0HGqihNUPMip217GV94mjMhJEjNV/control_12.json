I don't like spiders at all, they creep me out tremendously.\n\nHe invited me and another friend to his house to play PS4. He showed the tarantulas as usual, always inside their enclosures. He knows I hate having them close by, but if they're secured inside their little enclosure I'm okay with it. I know he has pranked people before so I made it very clear to never to that to me as I'd very likely just kill it out of fear.\n\nWe're playing PS4 and he goes get something for us to eat. Meanwhile I'm just looking at his books. He gets there with a plate with a cover on it, the kind that goes in the microwave so food doesn't splatter everywhere. Our other friend takes the cover and does a huge jump scare, hitting the plate and making the fucking tarantula fly in my direction. I had a book in my hand and out of reflex I threw the book at it killing it right there.\n\nSo now he's all pissed at me for being a \"pussy\" and killing an harmless animal. Other people are also blaming me for it and I even got an angry WhatsApp message from a guy that also has tarantulas at home.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. So the situation is that they killed their friend's tarantula. The friend had shown the tarantulas in their enclosures, and the author made it clear they didn't want to be pranked because they might kill it out of fear. Then, when the friend wasn't there, the other friend did a jump scare with the plate, causing the tarantula to fly towards the author. In a reflex, they threw a book and killed it.\n\nFirst, the author had a valid fear of spiders, which they communicated. They didn't want to be pranked, and the prank was done by the other friend, not the tarantula owner. The owner wasn't there when the incident happened. The author's reaction was a reflex to protect themselves from a sudden, scary situation. The tarantula was in an enclosure, but the prank caused it to escape. The owner is now upset, but the author's action was a self-defense reaction. Others are blaming them, but maybe they should consider the context of the prank and the author's fear.\n\nThe key points are: the author communicated their fear, the prank was initiated by someone else, and the reaction was reflexive. The owner is upset but might be holding the author responsible unfairly. However, the author did kill the tarantula, which is someone else's pet. But given the circumstances, maybe they aren't entirely at fault. Legally, maybe, but morally, considering the prank, it's a gray area. The other friend's prank probably contributed significantly. So the answer might be that the author isn't the asshole because they were reacting to a prank they warned against. So answer B.\n"
