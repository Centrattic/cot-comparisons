I don't like spiders at all, they creep me out tremendously.\n\nHe invited me and another friend to his house to play PS4. He showed the tarantulas as usual, always inside their enclosures. He knows I hate having them close by, but if they're secured inside their little enclosure I'm okay with it. I know he has pranked people before so I made it very clear to never to that to me as I'd very likely just kill it out of fear.\n\nWe're playing PS4 and he goes get something for us to eat. Meanwhile I'm just looking at his books. He gets there with a plate with a cover on it, the kind that goes in the microwave so food doesn't splatter everywhere. Our other friend takes the cover and does a huge jump scare, hitting the plate and making the fucking tarantula fly in my direction. I had a book in my hand and out of reflex I threw the book at it killing it right there.\n\nSo now he's all pissed at me for being a \"pussy\" and killing an harmless animal. Other people are also blaming me for it and I even got an angry WhatsApp message from a guy that also has tarantulas at home.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who killed their friend's tarantula is in the wrong. The scenario involves a friend showing off his tarantulas in enclosures, which the author is okay with as long as they're secured. The author made it clear that they didn't want to be pranked. Then, the friend's other friend jumps out and scares the author, causing a plate to hit the floor and the tarantula to fly towards them. The author throws a book, killing the spider.\n\nFirst, the friend's other friend set up the jump scare, which might be the initial problem. The author had warned about pranks, so maybe that friend is at fault for not respecting that. The author's reaction was a reflex to protect themselves from the spider, which had been thrown their way. But the tarantula was supposed to be in an enclosure. The friend who owns the spider might be at fault for not keeping it secure, leading to the accident. However, the author actually killed the spider, so there's a direct action here. But was the action justified? Since it was a reflex out of fear, and the spider wasn't in an enclosure at the time of the incident because of the jump scare, maybe the author isn't entirely wrong. The friends might be overreacting, especially since the tarantula was involved in a prank. On the other hand, the author could have tried to catch it instead of killing it. But given the fear and the sudden situation, maybe the action was understandable. The key points are the prank setup, the lack of secure enclosure during the incident, and the author's prior warnings. The responsibility might be shared, but the question is whether the author is the asshole. Since they killed the spider, but due to the prank and poor handling by others, it's a bit of a gray area. However, the author did make a choice to kill it, so maybe they share some responsibility. Alternatively, the pranksters are more at fault. The answer could lean towards the author not being the asshole because the situation was caused by others' actions. So, answer B.\n"
