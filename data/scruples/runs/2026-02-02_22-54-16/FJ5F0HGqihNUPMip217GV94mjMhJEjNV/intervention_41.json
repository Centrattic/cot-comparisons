I don't like spiders at all, they creep me out tremendously.\n\nHe invited me and another friend to his house to play PS4. He showed the tarantulas as usual, always inside their enclosures. He knows I hate having them close by, but if they're secured inside their little enclosure I'm okay with it. I know he has pranked people before so I made it very clear to never to that to me as I'd very likely just kill it out of fear.\n\nWe're playing PS4 and he goes get something for us to eat. Meanwhile I'm just looking at his books. He gets there with a plate with a cover on it, the kind that goes in the microwave so food doesn't splatter everywhere. Our other friend takes the cover and does a huge jump scare, hitting the plate and making the fucking tarantula fly in my direction. I had a book in my hand and out of reflex I threw the book at it killing it right there.\n\nSo now he's all pissed at me for being a \"pussy\" and killing an harmless animal. Other people are also blaming me for it and I even got an angry WhatsApp message from a guy that also has tarantulas at home.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The person killed their friend's tarantula, and now the friend is upset. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the context: The friend knows the author hates spiders and has made that clear. The tarantulas were in their enclosures, so the author was okay with them being there as long as they weren't close. The friend has a history of pranking people, so the author specifically told them not to do anything to provoke a reaction. \n\nThe incident happened when the friend was away getting food. The other friend did a jump scare, which hit the plate and caused the tarantula to fly towards the author. The author threw a book in reflex, killing the spider. \n\nSo, the key points here are intent and provocation. The author didn't set out to kill the spider; it was a reflex action due to a sudden, scary event. The friend who owns the tarantula is known for pranks, and the author had warned against that. The jump scare was initiated by another friend, not the owner of the spider. \n\nThe author might argue that the situation was provoked by the prank, which the friend knew the author wouldn't take kindly to. The owner's responsibility could be in question for allowing the prank to happen, knowing the author's fear. However, the author's action was a direct reaction to a perceived threat. \n\nThen there's the reaction of others blaming the author. The author's friends might feel justified in blaming them, but legally and morally, if the action was a reflex due to fear and the owner was aware of the phobia, the blame might be more on the prankster. \n\nLegally, if the author was in someone else's home, they might be liable for damaging someone's property. But morally, considering the fear and the prank, it's debatable. The author might not be in the wrong, but there are nuances. \n\nIn the AITA (Am I the Asshole) context, the community often considers intent and provocation. Since the author didn't intend to kill the spider and was acting out of fear, they might be seen as not the asshole. The friend's anger could be seen as disproportionate if the author was clear about their phobia and the prank was part of the issue. \n\nSo, the answer is likely B (Not the asshole), but there are arguments both ways. The key is the reflex action and the prior knowledge of the phobia by the owner.\n"
