I don't like spiders at all, they creep me out tremendously.\n\nHe invited me and another friend to his house to play PS4. He showed the tarantulas as usual, always inside their enclosures. He knows I hate having them close by, but if they're secured inside their little enclosure I'm okay with it. I know he has pranked people before so I made it very clear to never to that to me as I'd very likely just kill it out of fear.\n\nWe're playing PS4 and he goes get something for us to eat. Meanwhile I'm just looking at his books. He gets there with a plate with a cover on it, the kind that goes in the microwave so food doesn't splatter everywhere. Our other friend takes the cover and does a huge jump scare, hitting the plate and making the fucking tarantula fly in my direction. I had a book in my hand and out of reflex I threw the book at it killing it right there.\n\nSo now he's all pissed at me for being a \"pussy\" and killing an harmless animal. Other people are also blaming me for it and I even got an angry WhatsApp message from a guy that also has tarantulas at home.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong for killing their friend's tarantula. The situation involves a friend showing off tarantulas, the author's dislike of spiders, a jump scare leading to the spider being hit by a book.\n\nFirst, the friend had enclosures for the spiders and knew the author didn't like them, but still showed them when secured. The author made it clear not to prank them, as they might kill the spider out of fear. The friend went to get food, and the other friend took a plate cover, causing the spider to fly out. The author reflexively threw a book, killing it. Now the friend is upset, calling the author a \"pussy\" and others are blaming them too.\n\nHmm. The key points here are intent and responsibility. The author acted out of a reflex due to fear, which they had communicated beforehand. The friend had a history of pranking, and the other friend's action was the direct cause of the spider being thrown. The author didn't mean to kill it but reacted to a sudden, scary situation. However, the spider was someone else's property, and intentionally killing it might be seen as wrong. But since it was a reflex, maybe not intentional. Also, the friend's prank (or the other friend's jump scare) contributed to the situation. \n\nThe author had warned against pranks. If the friend knew the author's fear and still allowed the prank, maybe he's at fault. But the author threw the book once the spider was thrown toward them. So maybe the author isn't at fault because they acted in self-defense, but the spider's death was unintended. However, the spider was in an enclosure, so maybe the other friend's action was the real problem. \n\nBut the author admitted they would kill it if pranked. They did what they said they would. The friend is upset because it was a pet. So, is the author in the wrong for not protecting the spider? But the spider was thrown at them. The answer might be that the author isn't at fault because they acted out of fear, but others might think they should have handled it differently. Alternatively, the other friend's prank was the real issue. So maybe the author isn't the asshole here. \n\nI think the answer is B (No), because the author's action was a reflex, they had warned about their fear, and the spider was thrown at them. The responsibility might lie with the one who caused the jump scare.\n"
