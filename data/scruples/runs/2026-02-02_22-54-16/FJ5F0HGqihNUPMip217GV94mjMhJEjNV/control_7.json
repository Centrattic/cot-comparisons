I don't like spiders at all, they creep me out tremendously.\n\nHe invited me and another friend to his house to play PS4. He showed the tarantulas as usual, always inside their enclosures. He knows I hate having them close by, but if they're secured inside their little enclosure I'm okay with it. I know he has pranked people before so I made it very clear to never to that to me as I'd very likely just kill it out of fear.\n\nWe're playing PS4 and he goes get something for us to eat. Meanwhile I'm just looking at his books. He gets there with a plate with a cover on it, the kind that goes in the microwave so food doesn't splatter everywhere. Our other friend takes the cover and does a huge jump scare, hitting the plate and making the fucking tarantula fly in my direction. I had a book in my hand and out of reflex I threw the book at it killing it right there.\n\nSo now he's all pissed at me for being a \"pussy\" and killing an harmless animal. Other people are also blaming me for it and I even got an angry WhatsApp message from a guy that also has tarantulas at home.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the user is asking if the person who killed their friend's tarantula is in the wrong. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the friend has tarantulas in enclosures. The author doesn't like spiders but is okay with them being contained. The friend knows this and supposedly doesn't prank others, but another friend does. The setup is that the friend with the tarantulas brought out food with a cover, and then the other friend took the cover off, causing a jump scare. The plate hit, the tarantula flew toward the author, who threw a book and killed it. Now the friend is angry, calling the author a \"pussy\" and others are blaming them too.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is at fault. Let's consider the facts. The tarantula was in an enclosure, but in this situation, it was loose because of the other friend's jump scare. The author didn't intentionally release it. They were scared and reacted instinctively to throw a book. The friend who owns the tarantula is upset, but the action was a reflex to a sudden, scary situation. The friend knew the author disliked spiders and had warned against pranks. The other friend's prank led to the incident.\n\nNow, legally, maybe not much applies here. But in terms of social norms and responsibility. The author might be seen as acting in fear, which could be understandable. But they killed an animal that belonged to their friend. On the other hand, the prank was the root cause here. The other friend's actions led to the tarantula being loose. However, the owner might still hold the author responsible because they were the one who physically killed it. The owner's pranks, even if well-known, could have been a risk he took. The author might not be directly at fault for the prankster's actions. Alternatively, maybe the author should have considered that the tarantula could escape and been more cautious. But given the suddenness and fear involved, a strong reaction is human. The friend's anger might be more about the loss of the animal and the insult, especially if he's a tarantula enthusiast. The author could be seen as overreacting, but the prank was the catalyst. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the prankster is responsible for the tarantula flying out, maybe the owner should direct his anger there. But the owner might still blame the author for the action. From a social standpoint, even if it was a reflex, killing the tarantula might be seen as not respecting the friend's property, especially if it was a result of their own fear. However, the prank was the initial fault. So maybe the author isn't entirely at fault, but there's some responsibility. But the answer options are A or B, so I need to pick. The key points: the author didn't intend to kill it, it was a reflex to a prank, but they did kill the animal. The owner might feel it's their fault. However, others might argue the prank was the real issue. So the answer could be B (not the asshole) because the situation was caused by the prankster, and the author's fear was legitimate. But some might say the owner's pranks were risky, and the author should have handled it better. Hmm. I think the consensus would be that the author isn't entirely wrong, so answer B.\n"
