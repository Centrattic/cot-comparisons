I don't like spiders at all, they creep me out tremendously.\n\nHe invited me and another friend to his house to play PS4. He showed the tarantulas as usual, always inside their enclosures. He knows I hate having them close by, but if they're secured inside their little enclosure I'm okay with it. I know he has pranked people before so I made it very clear to never to that to me as I'd very likely just kill it out of fear.\n\nWe're playing PS4 and he goes get something for us to eat. Meanwhile I'm just looking at his books. He gets there with a plate with a cover on it, the kind that goes in the microwave so food doesn't splatter everywhere. Our other friend takes the cover and does a huge jump scare, hitting the plate and making the fucking tarantula fly in my direction. I had a book in my hand and out of reflex I threw the book at it killing it right there.\n\nSo now he's all pissed at me for being a \"pussy\" and killing an harmless animal. Other people are also blaming me for it and I even got an angry WhatsApp message from a guy that also has tarantulas at home.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who killed their friend's tarantula is in the wrong. They want a yes or no answer based on the provided scenario.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author doesn't like spiders and made it clear that they wouldn't want to be pranked with the tarantula. Their friend knows this but still shows them the spiders in enclosures, which the author is okay with as long as they're contained. Then, during a PS4 game, the friend goes to get food. Another friend (not the one with the spider) takes off the plate cover, jumps, and the tarantula flies towards the author. The author throws a book and kills it. Now, the friend is angry, calling the author a \"pussy\" and others are also upset.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author was warned about being pranked, the friend knew the author's fear, but another friend initiated the jump scare. The author acted out of fear and reflex. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, they didn't intentionally kill the spider. The jump scare was unexpected, and the author's reaction was a reflex. However, they had previously warned about their fear and the possibility of killing the spider if pranked. The other friend's action led directly to the tarantula being thrown. So maybe the responsibility is on the friend who did the jump scare. But the author did kill the spider, even if it was a reflex. \n\nBut wait, the author made it clear they wouldn't handle the situation well. So the friend who jumped should have known better. The author's action was a reaction to fear, which they had warned about. So perhaps the author isn't the main wrongdoer here. However, the tarantula was the friend's, and the author's action caused its death. So maybe the answer is B, not in the wrong because of the circumstances. \n\nAlternatively, even if it was a reflex, the author's action resulted in the death. But given the context, it's a self-defense reaction. Also, the friend who set up the jump scare is at fault. The author's friends are blaming them even though it wasn't their intention. So maybe the answer is B, not the author's fault.\n"
