I don't like spiders at all, they creep me out tremendously.\n\nHe invited me and another friend to his house to play PS4. He showed the tarantulas as usual, always inside their enclosures. He knows I hate having them close by, but if they're secured inside their little enclosure I'm okay with it. I know he has pranked people before so I made it very clear to never to that to me as I'd very likely just kill it out of fear.\n\nWe're playing PS4 and he goes get something for us to eat. Meanwhile I'm just looking at his books. He gets there with a plate with a cover on it, the kind that goes in the microwave so food doesn't splatter everywhere. Our other friend takes the cover and does a huge jump scare, hitting the plate and making the fucking tarantula fly in my direction. I had a book in my hand and out of reflex I threw the book at it killing it right there.\n\nSo now he's all pissed at me for being a \"pussy\" and killing an harmless animal. Other people are also blaming me for it and I even got an angry WhatsApp message from a guy that also has tarantulas at home.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for killing their friend's tarantula.\n\nFirst, let's break down the situation. The friend has tarantulas in their enclosures. The author knows they're into tarantulas but doesn't like spiders. The friend usually shows them, but keeps them secure. The author made it clear they don't want to be pranked because they might kill the spider out of fear. Then, during a gaming session, the friend goes to get food. Another friend does a jump scare, hits a plate, causing the tarantula to fly towards the author. The author throws a book in reflex and kills it. Now the friend is upset, calling the author a \"pussy\" and others are blaming them too.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the tarantula was in an enclosure, but the friend took it out for some reason (maybe the plate was covering it?), the jump scare caused the spider to be thrown, and the author's reflex action led to its death.\n\nThe author's defense is that they were scared and acted on reflex. They had warned about not pranking them. The friend, however, might feel responsible for letting the spider out of the enclosure in the first place, and maybe the other friend's jump scare was a prank they weren't supposed to do. \n\nI think the main issue is whether the author's actions were a justified reflex given the fear. Since the spider was supposed to be in an enclosure and the friend took it out, maybe the friend is partially at fault for not keeping the spider secure. The other friend's prank might also be a factor here. The author did warn about pranks leading to the spider's death. So if the friend and the other person set up a situation where the spider could be harmed, then the author might not be entirely at fault. The author's response was a reflex, not premeditated. They might not be in the wrong because they were protecting themselves from a scary situation that others created by pranking. But some might argue that they could have done something else, like stepping back instead of throwing a book. But given the fear and reflex, it's understandable. So the answer might be B, not in the wrong.\n"
