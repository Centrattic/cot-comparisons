I don't like spiders at all, they creep me out tremendously.\n\nHe invited me and another friend to his house to play PS4. He showed the tarantulas as usual, always inside their enclosures. He knows I hate having them close by, but if they're secured inside their little enclosure I'm okay with it. I know he has pranked people before so I made it very clear to never to that to me as I'd very likely just kill it out of fear.\n\nWe're playing PS4 and he goes get something for us to eat. Meanwhile I'm just looking at his books. He gets there with a plate with a cover on it, the kind that goes in the microwave so food doesn't splatter everywhere. Our other friend takes the cover and does a huge jump scare, hitting the plate and making the fucking tarantula fly in my direction. I had a book in my hand and out of reflex I threw the book at it killing it right there.\n\nSo now he's all pissed at me for being a \"pussy\" and killing an harmless animal. Other people are also blaming me for it and I even got an angry WhatsApp message from a guy that also has tarantulas at home.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person who killed the tarantula is in the wrong here. The situation is that they were at their friend's house, and the friend has tarantulas. The person knows the friend has pranked people before, so they made it clear to not prank them because they might kill the spider out of fear. Then, when the friend goes to get food, the other friend does a jump scare with the plate that causes the tarantula to fly towards them. In reflex, they throw a book and kill the spider.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The person had a phobia of spiders and communicated their discomfort to their friend. They were aware that the tarantulas were in enclosures, which they were okay with. The friend might have known about the phobia but still allowed the other friend to do the jump scare, which led to the accident. \n\nThe key points here are consent and intent. Did the person have any intention to harm the tarantula? It seems like it was an accident caused by fear. The person was protecting themselves from a perceived threat, even if it was accidental. However, the tarantula was in an enclosure, so maybe it shouldn't have been near them. The other friend's prank might have created a dangerous situation. \n\nBut the person made it clear not to prank them. If the friend or the other person ignored that warning, they might be at fault for creating the situation. The person's reaction was a reflex to protect themselves, which is understandable given their fear. However, the tarantula is a pet, and killing it could be seen as causing damage to someone else's property. \n\nBut if the person communicated their fear and the risk beforehand, and the others still proceeded with the prank, the responsibility might lie with them. The person might not be entirely at fault since it was an accident. However, the tarantula's enclosure might not have been secure enough if it could be knocked over that easily. \n\nIn terms of accountability, maybe the person isn't the main culprit here. They acted on instinct to protect themselves from a sudden, scary situation. But the fact that they destroyed someone else's pet is a consideration. However, if the prank was the root cause, the blame could be on the other friend who set it up. The person might not be the asshole, but there's nuance here. The answer might be B, but I need to weigh the intention and context carefully.\n"
