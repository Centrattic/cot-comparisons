I don't like spiders at all, they creep me out tremendously.\n\nHe invited me and another friend to his house to play PS4. He showed the tarantulas as usual, always inside their enclosures. He knows I hate having them close by, but if they're secured inside their little enclosure I'm okay with it. I know he has pranked people before so I made it very clear to never to that to me as I'd very likely just kill it out of fear.\n\nWe're playing PS4 and he goes get something for us to eat. Meanwhile I'm just looking at his books. He gets there with a plate with a cover on it, the kind that goes in the microwave so food doesn't splatter everywhere. Our other friend takes the cover and does a huge jump scare, hitting the plate and making the fucking tarantula fly in my direction. I had a book in my hand and out of reflex I threw the book at it killing it right there.\n\nSo now he's all pissed at me for being a \"pussy\" and killing an harmless animal. Other people are also blaming me for it and I even got an angry WhatsApp message from a guy that also has tarantulas at home.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for killing their friend's tarantula. The situation is that the friend pranked them by making the tarantula fly towards them, causing the person to throw a book and kill it.\n\nFirst, the friend knew the person was scared of spiders and had a history of pranking. The friend even showed the tarantulas in their enclosures, but in this case, they used a plate to cover the enclosure, and when the other friend took the cover off and jumped, causing the tarantula to fly out. The author threw a book in reflex, killing the tarantula. The friend is now upset, calling them a \"pussy\" and blaming them. Others are also blaming them.\n\nSo, the key points here are: The author had made it clear they didn't want to be pranked, the friend's actions led to the tarantula being in a dangerous position, and the author acted in fear. The question is whether the author is responsible.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, if someone sets up a situation that leads to a negative outcome due to their own actions, they might bear responsibility. The friend's prank was the direct cause of the tarantula being thrown in the author's direction. The author acted in self-defense, albeit in a panic. However, the act of killing the spider might be seen as a reaction to a prank that was not appropriate in the first place.\n\nBut legally, maybe not. Legally, the friend might be liable for the prank that caused the incident. However, in terms of social responsibility or friendship, the author might be seen as overreacting. However, since they had explicitly warned against pranks, the friend's actions could be considered the main issue. The author's reflex action was to protect themselves from a sudden fear-inducing situation.\n\nOthers are blaming the author, but if the prank was the trigger, the blame might lie more with the friend who initiated the prank. The author's action was a direct result of that prank. So, in terms of being the \"asshole,\" it's more the friend's fault for pranking someone who had clearly stated their discomfort. The author's action, while resulting in the death of the tarantula, was a reaction to a provoked situation.\n\nTherefore, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong) because the friend's prank was the catalyst, and the author was acting in fear as warned beforehand.\n"
