I don't like spiders at all, they creep me out tremendously.\n\nHe invited me and another friend to his house to play PS4. He showed the tarantulas as usual, always inside their enclosures. He knows I hate having them close by, but if they're secured inside their little enclosure I'm okay with it. I know he has pranked people before so I made it very clear to never to that to me as I'd very likely just kill it out of fear.\n\nWe're playing PS4 and he goes get something for us to eat. Meanwhile I'm just looking at his books. He gets there with a plate with a cover on it, the kind that goes in the microwave so food doesn't splatter everywhere. Our other friend takes the cover and does a huge jump scare, hitting the plate and making the fucking tarantula fly in my direction. I had a book in my hand and out of reflex I threw the book at it killing it right there.\n\nSo now he's all pissed at me for being a \"pussy\" and killing an harmless animal. Other people are also blaming me for it and I even got an angry WhatsApp message from a guy that also has tarantulas at home.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for killing their friend's tarantula. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the context: The friend has tarantulas and knows the author is scared of spiders. The author made it clear not to prank them because they might kill the spider out of fear. The friend brings food with a plate cover, the other friend jumps, hits the plate, and the tarantula flies towards the author. The author throws a book and kills it. Now the friend is angry, calling them a \"pussy\" and others are blaming them too.\n\nSo, the key points here. The author warned the friend about pranks. The friend's action led to the tarantula being thrown. The author acted out of reflex. The friend's prank caused the situation. The author's action was a direct result of the prank, which they had warned against.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, did the author do something wrong? Well, the pranking friend was the one who caused the tarantula to fly. The author was scared, as they mentioned, and had a clear fear. They had warned about this possibility. So the pranking friend is partly responsible. However, the author did kill the tarantula, which was someone else's property. But given the circumstances of self-defense (though it's a spider), reflex action, and the prank leading to it, maybe they're not entirely at fault.\n\nBut legally, if it's someone's property, damaging it could be an issue. But since it was an accident, maybe not. The friend's prank played a role here. The author had a justified fear and reacted instinctively. The other friend's prank was the catalyst. So the author might not be the sole person at fault. However, they did kill the tarantula, which their friend valued. But considering the context, maybe they aren't the asshole. So answer B, they are not in the wrong.\n"
