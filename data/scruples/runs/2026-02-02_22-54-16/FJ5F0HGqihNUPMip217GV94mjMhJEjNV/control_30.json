I don't like spiders at all, they creep me out tremendously.\n\nHe invited me and another friend to his house to play PS4. He showed the tarantulas as usual, always inside their enclosures. He knows I hate having them close by, but if they're secured inside their little enclosure I'm okay with it. I know he has pranked people before so I made it very clear to never to that to me as I'd very likely just kill it out of fear.\n\nWe're playing PS4 and he goes get something for us to eat. Meanwhile I'm just looking at his books. He gets there with a plate with a cover on it, the kind that goes in the microwave so food doesn't splatter everywhere. Our other friend takes the cover and does a huge jump scare, hitting the plate and making the fucking tarantula fly in my direction. I had a book in my hand and out of reflex I threw the book at it killing it right there.\n\nSo now he's all pissed at me for being a \"pussy\" and killing an harmless animal. Other people are also blaming me for it and I even got an angry WhatsApp message from a guy that also has tarantulas at home.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is that the author killed their friend's tarantula during a jump scare. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the friend has tarantulas and showed them in their enclosures. The author doesn't like spiders but is okay if they're secured. The friend knows this and the author made it clear not to prank them because they might kill the spider out of fear. Then, when the friend brings food, the other friend takes the plate cover, causing a jump scare. The tarantula flies towards the author, who throws a book and kills it. Now the friend is angry, calling the author a \"pussy\" and others are blaming them too.\n\nSo, the key points: Did the author have a right to kill the tarantula? The friend had the spiders secured, but the other friend's action caused the spider to come out. The author warned about pranks leading to them killing the spider. The friend knew the author's fear. The action was a reflex. The question is whether the author is at fault here.\n\nLegally, maybe not, but socially, people might see it as the author overreacting. The friend's pranks led to the situation. The author had given a warning, so maybe the friend is also at fault for pranking despite knowing the author's fear. The other friend's jump scare was the catalyst. So, the author acted in fear, as warned. The friend might be responsible for the prank. However, the tarantula is a pet, so killing it could be seen as destroying someone else's property. But the friend's actions contributed. The author might not be the sole wrongdoer. But the question is if the author is in the wrong. Considering that they acted in fear and had warned before, maybe they are not at fault. So answer B, No.\n"
