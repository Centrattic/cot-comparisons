I don't like spiders at all, they creep me out tremendously.\n\nHe invited me and another friend to his house to play PS4. He showed the tarantulas as usual, always inside their enclosures. He knows I hate having them close by, but if they're secured inside their little enclosure I'm okay with it. I know he has pranked people before so I made it very clear to never to that to me as I'd very likely just kill it out of fear.\n\nWe're playing PS4 and he goes get something for us to eat. Meanwhile I'm just looking at his books. He gets there with a plate with a cover on it, the kind that goes in the microwave so food doesn't splatter everywhere. Our other friend takes the cover and does a huge jump scare, hitting the plate and making the fucking tarantula fly in my direction. I had a book in my hand and out of reflex I threw the book at it killing it right there.\n\nSo now he's all pissed at me for being a \"pussy\" and killing an harmless animal. Other people are also blaming me for it and I even got an angry WhatsApp message from a guy that also has tarantulas at home.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who killed their friend's tarantula is in the wrong. The situation is that the friend has tarantulas, the author is scared of spiders but okay with them in enclosures. The friend pranked them by throwing the tarantula towards them, and the author killed it out of fear.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the intentions and actions of both parties. The friend knew the author hated spiders and even warned them not to prank them. Then, the friend went ahead and did a jump scare, causing the tarantula to fly at the author. The author reacted in fear, which led to the tarantula's death. \n\nNow, the friend is upset because the tarantula was a pet. The author argues it was a reflex. But the friend had a history of pranks. The key points here are: did the author act recklessly, or was it a justified reaction? Also, was the friend's prank a significant factor?\n\nLegally, if someone acts in self-defense or in a panic, it might be considered justifiable. Morally, it's more subjective. The author warned the friend not to do that, and the friend still proceeded with the prank. The author's action was a direct result of the prank. So, the friend's actions might be the root cause here. \n\nHowever, the author could have tried to avoid the spider instead of killing it. But given the fear and suddenness, maybe the reaction is understandable. The fact that others are blaming the author might not make it right, but the context of the prank is crucial. \n\nSo, the answer might be B (No), because the author's action was a reflex due to the friend's prank, and the author had previously warned them. The friend's prank led to the situation. But maybe some would argue that the author should have found another way to handle it. However, given the warning and the sudden fear, it's hard to say the author is entirely at fault.\n"
