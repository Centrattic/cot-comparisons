I don't like spiders at all, they creep me out tremendously.\n\nHe invited me and another friend to his house to play PS4. He showed the tarantulas as usual, always inside their enclosures. He knows I hate having them close by, but if they're secured inside their little enclosure I'm okay with it. I know he has pranked people before so I made it very clear to never to that to me as I'd very likely just kill it out of fear.\n\nWe're playing PS4 and he goes get something for us to eat. Meanwhile I'm just looking at his books. He gets there with a plate with a cover on it, the kind that goes in the microwave so food doesn't splatter everywhere. Our other friend takes the cover and does a huge jump scare, hitting the plate and making the fucking tarantula fly in my direction. I had a book in my hand and out of reflex I threw the book at it killing it right there.\n\nSo now he's all pissed at me for being a \"pussy\" and killing an harmless animal. Other people are also blaming me for it and I even got an angry WhatsApp message from a guy that also has tarantulas at home.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the person who killed their friend's tarantula is in the wrong. The scenario involves a friend who has tarantulas, which the narrator is afraid of. The friend showed the spiders in their enclosures, and the narrator made it clear they didn't want to be pranked. Then, during a game night, the friend's other friend did a jump scare with food, causing the tarantula to fly at the narrator, who then hit it with a book, killing it.\n\nFirst, the narrator's fear of spiders seems legitimate, and they made their discomfort known. The friend who owns the tarantula knows this but still showed them. However, the jump scare was initiated by the other friend, not the owner. The key point here is whether the narrator acted in self-defense or out of fear. Since the tarantula was harmless and in an enclosure, but the situation was triggered by a prank, the narrator's reaction might be seen as a reflex to protect themselves. \n\nBut legally and socially, killing someone else's pet, even in fear, might be considered wrong because they own the animal. The narrator's friend is upset because the tarantula was destroyed, and others are blaming the narrator. The question is about responsibility. The narrator might not be at fault for the prank that caused the incident, but they could be held responsible for the death of the animal, especially since they had the option to step away or notify the owner before reacting. Alternatively, the prankster's actions were reckless, which led to the accident. \n\nSo, the answer might depend on whose fault the prank was. The owner allowed the prank, and the narrator was a victim of the prank. However, the narrator's action resulted in the death of the pet. It's a bit of a gray area. If the tarantula wasn't a direct threat, the narrator could be seen as overreacting. But given the context of fear and the prank, there's room to argue it's not entirely their fault. But since they killed the animal, even if unintentionally, they might still be considered at fault. \n\nI think the answer is B (No), because the narrator acted out of fear due to the prank, which wasn't their fault. However, if the owner had taken precautions to prevent such pranks, the situation might have been avoided. The prankster's actions were the root cause. But the question is about the narrator's responsibility. If they made their fear known, and the prank happened despite that, then the narrator isn't in the wrong. They might still be held responsible, but the prankster is at fault. However, in terms of AITA (Am I the Asshole?), the community might side with the narrator because the prank was the catalyst. So the answer is B.\n"
