I don't like spiders at all, they creep me out tremendously.\n\nHe invited me and another friend to his house to play PS4. He showed the tarantulas as usual, always inside their enclosures. He knows I hate having them close by, but if they're secured inside their little enclosure I'm okay with it. I know he has pranked people before so I made it very clear to never to that to me as I'd very likely just kill it out of fear.\n\nWe're playing PS4 and he goes get something for us to eat. Meanwhile I'm just looking at his books. He gets there with a plate with a cover on it, the kind that goes in the microwave so food doesn't splatter everywhere. Our other friend takes the cover and does a huge jump scare, hitting the plate and making the fucking tarantula fly in my direction. I had a book in my hand and out of reflex I threw the book at it killing it right there.\n\nSo now he's all pissed at me for being a \"pussy\" and killing an harmless animal. Other people are also blaming me for it and I even got an angry WhatsApp message from a guy that also has tarantulas at home.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for killing their friend's tarantula. The situation is a bit complicated. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, the author has a friend who's into tarantulas. The friend shows them off, but keeps them in enclosures. The author is afraid of spiders but is okay as long as they're secured. The friend knows this and was warned not to prank them. \n\nThen, during a game night, the friend goes to get food. Another friend uses a plate cover to do a jump scare, which causes the tarantula to fly towards the author. In a panic, the author throws a book and kills the spider. The friend is upset, calling the author a \"pussy\" and others are blaming them too. The author is seeking validation if they're not the asshole.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author was clearly told to avoid pranks, but the prank was done by another friend. The tarantula was in an enclosure, but the prank caused it to escape. The author acted out of fear and reflex. The friend who owns the tarantula is upset, but maybe the prankster is also at fault.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the author was under a lot of stress and fear. They were warned, so they might have been prepared, but the prank was unexpected. The action was a reflex, not premeditated. The friend who pranked might share some blame for causing the situation. \n\nHowever, the author did kill the tarantula, which was someone's pet. But considering the circumstances, maybe it's understandable. The question is whether the author's action was justified. Since they were scared and it was a reflex, perhaps they aren't in the wrong. The prankster's actions led to the incident, so maybe the blame isn't entirely on the author. \n\nIn AITA (Am I the Asshole) forums, the community often looks at intent. If the author didn't intend to kill but acted out of fear, it might be seen as a mistake rather than being an asshole. The fact that others are blaming them suggests some conflict, but the prankster's role is a mitigating factor. \n\nSo, I think the answer is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. They acted in fear, the prank was unexpected, and the owner's reaction is harsh. The main issue is the prank, not the author's reflex action.\n"
