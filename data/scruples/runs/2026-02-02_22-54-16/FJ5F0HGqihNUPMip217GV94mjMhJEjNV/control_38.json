I don't like spiders at all, they creep me out tremendously.\n\nHe invited me and another friend to his house to play PS4. He showed the tarantulas as usual, always inside their enclosures. He knows I hate having them close by, but if they're secured inside their little enclosure I'm okay with it. I know he has pranked people before so I made it very clear to never to that to me as I'd very likely just kill it out of fear.\n\nWe're playing PS4 and he goes get something for us to eat. Meanwhile I'm just looking at his books. He gets there with a plate with a cover on it, the kind that goes in the microwave so food doesn't splatter everywhere. Our other friend takes the cover and does a huge jump scare, hitting the plate and making the fucking tarantula fly in my direction. I had a book in my hand and out of reflex I threw the book at it killing it right there.\n\nSo now he's all pissed at me for being a \"pussy\" and killing an harmless animal. Other people are also blaming me for it and I even got an angry WhatsApp message from a guy that also has tarantulas at home.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the person who killed their friend's tarantula is in the wrong. The situation is that the friend has tarantulas in enclosures, the author is afraid of spiders, made clear they don't want to be pranked, and during a game session, another friend jumped and caused the tarantula to fly towards the author. The author threw a book and killed it. Now the friend is angry, calling the author a \"pussy\" and others are blaming them too.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the key points. The author made their fear known and explicitly told the friend not to prank them with the spiders. The friend (and another person) still did the jump scare, which directly led to the tarantula being thrown towards the author. The author's reaction was a reflex, using a book to hit it. The friend's argument is that the tarantula was harmless and the author overreacted.\n\nFrom a responsibility angle, the person who set up the jump scare (the friend with the plate and cover) is at fault for initiating the action that caused the tarantula to be thrown. The author made their boundaries clear, but the prank was executed anyway. The author's actions were a direct result of the prank, so their responsibility is mitigated. However, some might argue that the author should have found another way to deal with the spider instead of killing it. But given the fear and the immediate threat (even if the spider was harmless), the author's reaction might be seen as a defensive response.\n\nAnother angle is consent and respect for others' fears. The friend knew the author's phobia and still chose to prank them. The others involved in the prank didn't consider the author's feelings. The author's right to their fear is valid, and the prank was the root cause. So the blame lies more with the friend who initiated the prank than with the author.\n\nIn terms of legal or moral responsibility, intentionally causing a situation where someone is forced to harm an animal due to a prank might shift the blame to the prankster. The author's action was a result of self-defense against a fear-inducing situation. However, others might say that the author should have considered the animal's life more, but the initial prank was the catalyst.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author is not in the wrong because the prank was the main issue. The answer would be B (No).\n"
