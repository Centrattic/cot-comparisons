I don't like spiders at all, they creep me out tremendously.\n\nHe invited me and another friend to his house to play PS4. He showed the tarantulas as usual, always inside their enclosures. He knows I hate having them close by, but if they're secured inside their little enclosure I'm okay with it. I know he has pranked people before so I made it very clear to never to that to me as I'd very likely just kill it out of fear.\n\nWe're playing PS4 and he goes get something for us to eat. Meanwhile I'm just looking at his books. He gets there with a plate with a cover on it, the kind that goes in the microwave so food doesn't splatter everywhere. Our other friend takes the cover and does a huge jump scare, hitting the plate and making the fucking tarantula fly in my direction. I had a book in my hand and out of reflex I threw the book at it killing it right there.\n\nSo now he's all pissed at me for being a \"pussy\" and killing an harmless animal. Other people are also blaming me for it and I even got an angry WhatsApp message from a guy that also has tarantulas at home.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the user killed their friend's tarantula. The friend has a couple of tarantulas, which are kept in enclosures. The user hates spiders but is okay with them being in their cages. The friend knows this and was supposed to avoid pranking them. Then, during a game night, the friend goes to get food, and another friend does a jump scare with a plate that had a tarantula on it. The user, in a panic, throws a book and kills the spider.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the intentions and actions of everyone involved. The user made it clear they don't like spiders and would kill one if pranked. The friend who owns the tarantula knows this but still allowed another friend to do the jump scare. The other friend's action led directly to the tarantula being thrown at the user. The user acted reflexively out of fear.\n\nThe friend is upset because the tarantula was killed, and others are blaming the user. But was the user at fault? Well, the user's action was a reflex due to fear, which they had warned about. The friend who owned the tarantula might be at fault for not preventing the prank, considering they knew the user's phobia. However, the user did kill the tarantula, which is someone else's property. Even if it was an accident, the user might still be responsible. But the root cause was the prank, which the owner allowed. \n\nSo, is the user in the wrong? If the owner knew the user's fear and allowed a prank that led to the spider's death, maybe the owner is more at fault. But the user's action was the direct cause. However, given the context of a prank leading to a fear-induced reaction, maybe the user isn't entirely in the wrong. But since they did kill someone's pet, even if it was an accident, they might still share some responsibility. It's a bit of a gray area. The key points are: the user's phobia was known, the prank was the catalyst, and the user acted out of fear. So maybe the user isn't the asshole. But on the other hand, the tarantula was a pet, and they did kill it. So maybe AITA is on the user. Hmm.\n"
