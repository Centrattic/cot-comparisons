I don't like spiders at all, they creep me out tremendously.\n\nHe invited me and another friend to his house to play PS4. He showed the tarantulas as usual, always inside their enclosures. He knows I hate having them close by, but if they're secured inside their little enclosure I'm okay with it. I know he has pranked people before so I made it very clear to never to that to me as I'd very likely just kill it out of fear.\n\nWe're playing PS4 and he goes get something for us to eat. Meanwhile I'm just looking at his books. He gets there with a plate with a cover on it, the kind that goes in the microwave so food doesn't splatter everywhere. Our other friend takes the cover and does a huge jump scare, hitting the plate and making the fucking tarantula fly in my direction. I had a book in my hand and out of reflex I threw the book at it killing it right there.\n\nSo now he's all pissed at me for being a \"pussy\" and killing an harmless animal. Other people are also blaming me for it and I even got an angry WhatsApp message from a guy that also has tarantulas at home.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for killing their friend's tarantula. The situation is that the friend has tarantulas, the author is afraid of spiders but okay with them in enclosures. The friend's other friend did a jump scare, causing the tarantula to fly towards the author, who then threw a book and killed it. Now the friend is upset, calling the author a \"pussy\" and others are blaming them. The question is whether the author is at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author was clear they don't like spiders and would kill it if pranked. The friend knew this. The other friend did a prank, leading to the accident. The author acted out of fear in a reflex. \n\nThe key points here are intent and provocation. The author didn't mean to kill the tarantula but reacted to a surprise attack. However, they were aware of their fear and had warned others. The prank was initiated by the third person, so maybe the blame is on them. But the author's action resulted in the death, so is that their fault? \n\nMoral responsibility: If the author had a phobia and couldn't control their reaction, maybe they aren't at fault. But the tarantula was in an enclosure, so was it supposed to be safe? The other friend's action was the main cause. However, the author's decision to throw the book was their choice. \n\nAlso, the friend's reaction of calling them a \"pussy\" is unhelpful, but does that absolve the author? The author might have been in a panic. The key is whether the author acted recklessly or was provoked. Since the tarantula was supposed to be in an enclosure, the other friend's prank was the real issue. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, maybe the author isn't the main wrongdoer. They were provoked by the prank, but the action of killing was their own. However, considering the context, the prank was the catalyst. The answer might be B (author not in the wrong) because of the fear and the prank. But some might argue that regardless of the incident, killing someone else's pet is wrong. \n\nI think the community would consider the prank as the main issue here. The author's action was a reaction to a terrifying situation they had already warned about. So the author isn't entirely at fault. They might be seen as a victim of the prank. Therefore, answer B.\n"
