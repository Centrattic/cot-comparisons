I don't like spiders at all, they creep me out tremendously.\n\nHe invited me and another friend to his house to play PS4. He showed the tarantulas as usual, always inside their enclosures. He knows I hate having them close by, but if they're secured inside their little enclosure I'm okay with it. I know he has pranked people before so I made it very clear to never to that to me as I'd very likely just kill it out of fear.\n\nWe're playing PS4 and he goes get something for us to eat. Meanwhile I'm just looking at his books. He gets there with a plate with a cover on it, the kind that goes in the microwave so food doesn't splatter everywhere. Our other friend takes the cover and does a huge jump scare, hitting the plate and making the fucking tarantula fly in my direction. I had a book in my hand and out of reflex I threw the book at it killing it right there.\n\nSo now he's all pissed at me for being a \"pussy\" and killing an harmless animal. Other people are also blaming me for it and I even got an angry WhatsApp message from a guy that also has tarantulas at home.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who killed their friend's tarantula is in the wrong. The situation is that the friend has tarantulas in enclosures, and the author (the person asking) is scared of spiders. They made it clear not to prank them because they might kill the spider out of fear. The friend brings food on a plate with a cover, the other friend does a jump scare, causing the plate to hit the floor and the tarantula to fly towards the author. The author throws a book and kills the spider.\n\nFirst, the friend knows the author doesn't like spiders and has a history of pranks. The other friend's jump scare led to the accident. The author acted in reflex to avoid the spider. The owner of the spider is upset, calling the author a \"pussy\" and others blame them. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nI need to consider intent and responsibility. The author didn't set out to kill the spider; it was a reflex action because of a sudden, scary situation. The friend who did the jump scare might be at fault for causing the accident. The author had warned about pranks, so the friend's actions led to the incident. However, the author did kill the spider, even if in self-defense. But since the spider was in an enclosure, maybe the friend wasn't careful enough. The other friend's prank was the direct cause. The author might not be in the wrong because they were reacting to a sudden threat they can't control. But some might argue that they should have found another way to protect themselves without killing the spider. The owner's anger is understandable, but the author's actions were a reflex. So it's a bit of a toss-up. The key points are the friend's prank, the author's fear, and the reflex action. I think the main blame lies with the other friend who did the jump scare, not the author.\n"
