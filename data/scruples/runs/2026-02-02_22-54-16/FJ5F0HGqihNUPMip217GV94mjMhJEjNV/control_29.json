I don't like spiders at all, they creep me out tremendously.\n\nHe invited me and another friend to his house to play PS4. He showed the tarantulas as usual, always inside their enclosures. He knows I hate having them close by, but if they're secured inside their little enclosure I'm okay with it. I know he has pranked people before so I made it very clear to never to that to me as I'd very likely just kill it out of fear.\n\nWe're playing PS4 and he goes get something for us to eat. Meanwhile I'm just looking at his books. He gets there with a plate with a cover on it, the kind that goes in the microwave so food doesn't splatter everywhere. Our other friend takes the cover and does a huge jump scare, hitting the plate and making the fucking tarantula fly in my direction. I had a book in my hand and out of reflex I threw the book at it killing it right there.\n\nSo now he's all pissed at me for being a \"pussy\" and killing an harmless animal. Other people are also blaming me for it and I even got an angry WhatsApp message from a guy that also has tarantulas at home.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe user is asking if they're an asshole (AITA) for killing their friend's tarantula. The setup is that the friend has tarantulas in enclosures, and the user is terrified of spiders. They made it clear they didn't want to be pranked with the spiders. The friend's other buddy used a plate cover to jump scare the user, causing the tarantula to fly out and the user to throw a book, killing it. Now the friend is mad, calling them a \"pussy,\" and others are blaming them too.\n\nFirst, let's break down the key points. The user had a fear of spiders and communicated that they wouldn't tolerate pranks. The friend's action, through the other person, led to the spider being launched. The user's reaction was a reflex to throw a book, resulting in the spider's death.\n\nI need to consider if the user's actions were justified given their fear. Since they had a legitimate phobia and had warned others not to prank them, the jump scare might be seen as the catalyst. The user acted in a panic, which could be a self-defense reaction. However, the spider was in an enclosure, and the user might have had the option to move away or seek help instead of killing it. On the other hand, the prank itself was reckless and potentially dangerous, knowing the user's fear. The responsibility could be shared between the prankster and the user. But legally, the user might not be at fault since they were protecting themselves from fear. However, ethically, maybe they could have handled it differently. The friend's anger is understandable from a loss of a pet, but the prank might be the root cause. So, is the user in the wrong? It's a tricky balance between self-preservation and respecting another's property. I think the user isn't entirely at fault because the prank was the initial problem, but maybe partially responsible for the action. However, given the context, the answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong) because the prank led to the incident, and the user's fear was a factor.\n"
