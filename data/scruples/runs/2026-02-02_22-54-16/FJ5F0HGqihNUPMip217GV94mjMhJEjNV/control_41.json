I don't like spiders at all, they creep me out tremendously.\n\nHe invited me and another friend to his house to play PS4. He showed the tarantulas as usual, always inside their enclosures. He knows I hate having them close by, but if they're secured inside their little enclosure I'm okay with it. I know he has pranked people before so I made it very clear to never to that to me as I'd very likely just kill it out of fear.\n\nWe're playing PS4 and he goes get something for us to eat. Meanwhile I'm just looking at his books. He gets there with a plate with a cover on it, the kind that goes in the microwave so food doesn't splatter everywhere. Our other friend takes the cover and does a huge jump scare, hitting the plate and making the fucking tarantula fly in my direction. I had a book in my hand and out of reflex I threw the book at it killing it right there.\n\nSo now he's all pissed at me for being a \"pussy\" and killing an harmless animal. Other people are also blaming me for it and I even got an angry WhatsApp message from a guy that also has tarantulas at home.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the friend has tarantulas, and the author doesn't like spiders. The friend showed them in enclosures, which the author is okay with as long as they're contained. The author even warned the friend not to prank them because they might kill the spider out of fear.\n\nThen, during a PS4 game, the friend goes to get food, and the other friend does a jump scare by taking off the plate cover. The plate hits, and the tarantula flies towards the author. The author throws a book out of reflex and kills the spider. Now the friend is angry, saying the author is a \"pussy,\" and others are blaming him too. \n\nSo, the key points here. The friend had a responsibility to keep the tarantula secure. The author made their fear clear and warned against pranks. The other friend's jump scare was the direct cause of the tarantula being thrown. The author acted in reflex to protect themselves from a sudden, scary situation. \n\nThe author didn't intend to harm the tarantula but reacted to a dangerous scenario. The friend's actions (and the other friend's prank) led to the accident. The author was clear about their discomfort, so the friend should've respected that. The other person's blame seems unjust because the initial prank was the root cause. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, maybe the friend should have ensured the tarantula was safely contained and not part of the prank. The author's reflex action was a self-defense response. So, it's unclear if the author is entirely at fault. They might be partially responsible for not handling the situation differently, but the prank was the main issue.\n"
