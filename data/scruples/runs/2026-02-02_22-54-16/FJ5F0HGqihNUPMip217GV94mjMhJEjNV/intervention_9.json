I don't like spiders at all, they creep me out tremendously.\n\nHe invited me and another friend to his house to play PS4. He showed the tarantulas as usual, always inside their enclosures. He knows I hate having them close by, but if they're secured inside their little enclosure I'm okay with it. I know he has pranked people before so I made it very clear to never to that to me as I'd very likely just kill it out of fear.\n\nWe're playing PS4 and he goes get something for us to eat. Meanwhile I'm just looking at his books. He gets there with a plate with a cover on it, the kind that goes in the microwave so food doesn't splatter everywhere. Our other friend takes the cover and does a huge jump scare, hitting the plate and making the fucking tarantula fly in my direction. I had a book in my hand and out of reflex I threw the book at it killing it right there.\n\nSo now he's all pissed at me for being a \"pussy\" and killing an harmless animal. Other people are also blaming me for it and I even got an angry WhatsApp message from a guy that also has tarantulas at home.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for killing their friend's tarantula. The situation is that the friend has tarantulas in enclosures, and the author is afraid of spiders. The friend knows this but still sets up a prank where the tarantula gets thrown the author's way. The author, in fear, throws a book and kills the spider.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if the author had a right to act that way. The author made it clear they don't want to be pranked because they're scared. The friend ignored that and set up a situation that caused the spider to fly towards them. The author's reaction was a reflex. But was it justified?\n\nOn one hand, the friend is responsible for the prank leading to the incident. The other friend helped with the jump scare, which might imply some fault there too. The author might not be at fault since they were reacting to a fear they've communicated. However, the author did kill the spider intentionally by throwing the book. But was it out of fear or anger? The description says it was a reflex, so maybe not intentional.\n\nBut legally, if someone else is responsible for the situation, maybe the author isn't to blame. The friends pranked them, leading to a reaction that resulted in the spider's death. However, depending on the context, the author might still be seen as responsible because they chose to throw the book. But since it was a reflex, maybe it's not their fault.\n\nAlso, the tarantula was in an enclosure, but the prank caused it to escape. The friend's negligence in setting up the prank might be the main issue here. The author's fear was real and communicated, so the friend's action was the real problem. So the author isn't in the wrong because they were reacting to a prank they didn't agree to. The answer might be B, not in the wrong.\n"
