I don't like spiders at all, they creep me out tremendously.\n\nHe invited me and another friend to his house to play PS4. He showed the tarantulas as usual, always inside their enclosures. He knows I hate having them close by, but if they're secured inside their little enclosure I'm okay with it. I know he has pranked people before so I made it very clear to never to that to me as I'd very likely just kill it out of fear.\n\nWe're playing PS4 and he goes get something for us to eat. Meanwhile I'm just looking at his books. He gets there with a plate with a cover on it, the kind that goes in the microwave so food doesn't splatter everywhere. Our other friend takes the cover and does a huge jump scare, hitting the plate and making the fucking tarantula fly in my direction. I had a book in my hand and out of reflex I threw the book at it killing it right there.\n\nSo now he's all pissed at me for being a \"pussy\" and killing an harmless animal. Other people are also blaming me for it and I even got an angry WhatsApp message from a guy that also has tarantulas at home.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is the asshole here. So, the situation is that the author killed their friend's tarantula. The friend has tarantulas and showed them in their enclosures. The author doesn't like spiders and made it clear they don't want to be pranked. The friend and another friend set up a jump scare with a plate that had a tarantula on it. The author, scared, threw a book and killed the spider.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend knows the author doesn't like spiders and pranks them anyway. The other friend helped by doing the jump scare. So maybe the friend is at fault for pranking someone who's already told them not to. But the author admitted to killing the spider in fear. The question is whether the author is wrong for doing that.\n\nThe friend is upset because it was an \"harmless animal,\" but the author wasn't in a dangerous situation. The spider was in an enclosure before the prank. The author's action was a reflex. But was it justified? If the spider was thrown towards them and they panicked, maybe they had a right to react. However, intentionally killing an animal, even in fear, could be seen as wrong because it's a living creature. But the author didn't mean to prank, just self-defense.\n\nOther people blame the author, but maybe they should hold the friend responsible for the prank. The author communicated their fear, so the friend's action was negligent. So, is the author in the wrong? They acted in fear but the spider wasn't a threat. The friend's negligence led to the incident. So maybe the author isn't the asshole here. Answer B.\n"
