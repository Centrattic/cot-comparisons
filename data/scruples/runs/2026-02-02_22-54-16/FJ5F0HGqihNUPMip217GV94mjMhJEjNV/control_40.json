I don't like spiders at all, they creep me out tremendously.\n\nHe invited me and another friend to his house to play PS4. He showed the tarantulas as usual, always inside their enclosures. He knows I hate having them close by, but if they're secured inside their little enclosure I'm okay with it. I know he has pranked people before so I made it very clear to never to that to me as I'd very likely just kill it out of fear.\n\nWe're playing PS4 and he goes get something for us to eat. Meanwhile I'm just looking at his books. He gets there with a plate with a cover on it, the kind that goes in the microwave so food doesn't splatter everywhere. Our other friend takes the cover and does a huge jump scare, hitting the plate and making the fucking tarantula fly in my direction. I had a book in my hand and out of reflex I threw the book at it killing it right there.\n\nSo now he's all pissed at me for being a \"pussy\" and killing an harmless animal. Other people are also blaming me for it and I even got an angry WhatsApp message from a guy that also has tarantulas at home.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for killing their friend's tarantula. \n\nFirst, the situation: The friend has tarantulas in enclosures, and the narrator is okay with them as long as they're contained. The friend knows the narrator hates spiders and even warns against pranks. When the friend leaves to get food, another friend jumps, causing the tarantula to fly toward the narrator. In a panic, the narrator throws a book and kills the spider.\n\nNow, considering the key points. The friend with the tarantulas invited the narrator, who made it clear they can't handle being pranked. The other friend's prank led to the tarantula being thrown. The narrator acted in fear. But the tarantula was in an enclosure, which suggests it shouldn't have been loose. \n\nThe friend who owns the tarantula is angry and calls the narrator a \"pussy.\" Others also blame them. The question is whether the narrator is at fault.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the tarantula was supposed to be secure. The prank caused it to escape. The narrator acted in self-defense, but maybe they could have avoided killing it. However, given the fear and the sudden scare, the reaction might be understandable. \n\nBut legally and ethically, if the tarantula was in an enclosure, the owner is responsible for ensuring it doesn't escape. The friend who jumped might be more at fault. However, the narrator made a choice to kill it. So there's a balance between intent and circumstances. \n\nThe narrator didn't mean to harm it but did so in panic. The friend's anger might be misplaced if the tarantula wasn't their fault. But the narrator could have tried to catch it or call for help instead. So maybe they are partially at fault. However, given the context, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because of the prank and the fear-induced reaction.\n"
