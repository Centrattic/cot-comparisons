I don't like spiders at all, they creep me out tremendously.\n\nHe invited me and another friend to his house to play PS4. He showed the tarantulas as usual, always inside their enclosures. He knows I hate having them close by, but if they're secured inside their little enclosure I'm okay with it. I know he has pranked people before so I made it very clear to never to that to me as I'd very likely just kill it out of fear.\n\nWe're playing PS4 and he goes get something for us to eat. Meanwhile I'm just looking at his books. He gets there with a plate with a cover on it, the kind that goes in the microwave so food doesn't splatter everywhere. Our other friend takes the cover and does a huge jump scare, hitting the plate and making the fucking tarantula fly in my direction. I had a book in my hand and out of reflex I threw the book at it killing it right there.\n\nSo now he's all pissed at me for being a \"pussy\" and killing an harmless animal. Other people are also blaming me for it and I even got an angry WhatsApp message from a guy that also has tarantulas at home.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who killed their friend's tarantula is in the wrong. The situation is that the friend has tarantulas in enclosures, the author is afraid of spiders, and made it clear they wouldn't want a prank. The friend's other friend did a jump scare, causing the tarantula to fly towards the author, who then threw a book and killed it. The friend is upset, and others are blaming the author.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author made their fear known and warned against pranks. The jump scare was done by another friend, not the tarantula owner. The tarantula was in a plate, which was covered. The other friend's actions led to the incident. The author acted in reflex to kill the spider.\n\nFrom a responsibility standpoint, the person who did the jump scare might be the direct cause. However, the friend who owns the tarantula might be at least partially responsible for not preventing the prank. The author's intention was to protect themselves from fear, but the action resulted in destruction of someone else's pet. Even if it was a reflex, it's a pet, which some people value highly. \n\nBut the author had a clear fear and communicated it. The prank was unexpected and caused the accident. The friend who owns the tarantula might have known the other's tendency to prank. So maybe the blame isn't entirely on the author. The author did kill the spider, but under duress. However, the owner might expect that even with precautions, pranks could lead to accidents. \n\nIn terms of ownership and responsibility, the owner is responsible for the safety of their pets. If the tarantula was in a secure enclosure, this wouldn't have happened. The fact that it was on a plate that could be knocked over might indicate a lapse in safety. The owner might be partly at fault for not keeping it in a more secure place when moving it. \n\nSo the author might not be entirely in the wrong, but it's a gray area. The owner's friend's prank was the catalyst. The author's reaction was reflexive, but the action was irreversible. However, the owner's responsibility to secure the pet and the other friend's prank are factors. \n\nI think the answer is B (Not the Asshole) because the author clearly communicated their fear, the prank was the fault of another, and the owner might share some responsibility for how the tarantula was handled. The author's action was a reflex to protect themselves, and the tarantula was in a situation where it could escape due to the prank, which the owner might not have anticipated but could have better managed.\n"
