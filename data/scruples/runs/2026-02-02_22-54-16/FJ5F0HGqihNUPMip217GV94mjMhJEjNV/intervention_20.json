I don't like spiders at all, they creep me out tremendously.\n\nHe invited me and another friend to his house to play PS4. He showed the tarantulas as usual, always inside their enclosures. He knows I hate having them close by, but if they're secured inside their little enclosure I'm okay with it. I know he has pranked people before so I made it very clear to never to that to me as I'd very likely just kill it out of fear.\n\nWe're playing PS4 and he goes get something for us to eat. Meanwhile I'm just looking at his books. He gets there with a plate with a cover on it, the kind that goes in the microwave so food doesn't splatter everywhere. Our other friend takes the cover and does a huge jump scare, hitting the plate and making the fucking tarantula fly in my direction. I had a book in my hand and out of reflex I threw the book at it killing it right there.\n\nSo now he's all pissed at me for being a \"pussy\" and killing an harmless animal. Other people are also blaming me for it and I even got an angry WhatsApp message from a guy that also has tarantulas at home.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author killed a friend's tarantula, and now people are blaming them. Let me break down the details.\n\nFirst, the friend has tarantulas and shows them off. The author is very scared of spiders but is okay if they're in their enclosures. The friend is known to prank people, so the author made it clear not to do that to them because they might kill the spider out of fear. Then, during a game night, the friend gets food and brings a covered plate with the tarantula on it. Another friend takes the cover, jumps, hits the plate, and the tarantula flies towards the author. The author throws a book in reflex and kills it. The friend is angry now, calling them a \"pussy\" and others are blaming them too. The author is asking if they're the asshole.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author has a phobia of spiders, made their fear clear, and the tarantula was placed in a way that triggered that fear via a prank. The friend knew about the fear but still did the prank, leading to the spider being thrown. The author acted in reflex. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The friend's side is that the spider was a pet, and the author killed it. The author's defense is that they were scared and the prank was done despite warnings. \n\nI need to consider if the author has a valid reason for their reaction. Since they made their fear clear, and the friend went ahead with a prank that would trigger that fear, the friend might be at fault here. The author acted in self-defense, so to speak, even if it was a spider. The friend's responsibility to respect the author's fear and not play the prank could be a factor. Also, the spider was out of its enclosure, which the author is okay with only if it's secured. The friend's action of using a prank with the spider on a plate might have violated that agreement. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the author should have controlled their fear better, but given that they explicitly stated not to do pranks involving spiders, it's the friend's fault for not respecting that. The other friend who did the jump scare might also share responsibility. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author might not be in the wrong because they were clear about their fear, the friend pranked them despite that, and the situation led to the spider being thrown. The author's reflex action was in response to a deliberate provocation. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
