I don't like spiders at all, they creep me out tremendously.\n\nHe invited me and another friend to his house to play PS4. He showed the tarantulas as usual, always inside their enclosures. He knows I hate having them close by, but if they're secured inside their little enclosure I'm okay with it. I know he has pranked people before so I made it very clear to never to that to me as I'd very likely just kill it out of fear.\n\nWe're playing PS4 and he goes get something for us to eat. Meanwhile I'm just looking at his books. He gets there with a plate with a cover on it, the kind that goes in the microwave so food doesn't splatter everywhere. Our other friend takes the cover and does a huge jump scare, hitting the plate and making the fucking tarantula fly in my direction. I had a book in my hand and out of reflex I threw the book at it killing it right there.\n\nSo now he's all pissed at me for being a \"pussy\" and killing an harmless animal. Other people are also blaming me for it and I even got an angry WhatsApp message from a guy that also has tarantulas at home.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves killing a friend's tarantula. Let me break down the details.\n\nFirst, the friend has tarantulas and shows them off. The writer hates spiders but is okay with them in enclosures. The friend knows this and was warned not to prank them. Then, during a game, the friend goes to get food, and the other friend uses a plate cover as a jump scare. The plate hits the writer, and a tarantula flies towards them. The writer throws a book and kills the spider. Now the friend is mad, calling them a \"pussy,\" and others are blaming them too.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the writer is at fault. Let's consider the facts. The friend had a history of pranks and was warned not to do that to the writer. The other friend initiated the jump scare with the plate, which caused the tarantula to come flying. The writer acted reflexively to hit it with a book. The friend is upset, but did the writer do something wrong?\n\nThe writer didn't have malicious intent. The action was a reflex to protect themselves from a tarantula that was suddenly thrown at them. The friend who did the jump scare is probably more at fault for initiating the prank, which led to the accident. The writer had already expressed fear and asked not to be pranked. The friend's anger seems misplaced because they knew the writer's fear but still allowed the prank to happen.\n\nBut the writer did kill the tarantula, which was someone else's pet. However, the circumstances were accidental. The writer didn't plan it; it was a reflex. The other person's actions caused the tarantula to be in a dangerous position. So, while the writer might feel guilty, legally or morally, they might not be at fault. The responsibility could lie more with the friend who did the jump scare. The answer would likely be B (not in the wrong) because it was an accident caused by someone else's prank, and the writer acted in self-defense based on their fear.\n"
