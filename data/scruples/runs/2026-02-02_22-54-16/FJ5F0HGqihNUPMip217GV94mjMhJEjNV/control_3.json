I don't like spiders at all, they creep me out tremendously.\n\nHe invited me and another friend to his house to play PS4. He showed the tarantulas as usual, always inside their enclosures. He knows I hate having them close by, but if they're secured inside their little enclosure I'm okay with it. I know he has pranked people before so I made it very clear to never to that to me as I'd very likely just kill it out of fear.\n\nWe're playing PS4 and he goes get something for us to eat. Meanwhile I'm just looking at his books. He gets there with a plate with a cover on it, the kind that goes in the microwave so food doesn't splatter everywhere. Our other friend takes the cover and does a huge jump scare, hitting the plate and making the fucking tarantula fly in my direction. I had a book in my hand and out of reflex I threw the book at it killing it right there.\n\nSo now he's all pissed at me for being a \"pussy\" and killing an harmless animal. Other people are also blaming me for it and I even got an angry WhatsApp message from a guy that also has tarantulas at home.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who killed their friend's tarantula is in the wrong. The situation is that the friend has tarantulas in enclosures, the author hates spiders, made it clear they don't want to be pranked. The friend's other friend did a jump scare, causing the tarantula to fly towards the author, who then threw a book and killed it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author had a legitimate fear of spiders and communicated that they wouldn't like a prank. The friend knew about this fear but still showed the spiders. Then another friend did the jump scare, leading to the accident. The author acted out of fear and reflex. \n\nThe friend who owns the tarantula is upset, calling the author a \"pussy\" and others are blaming them. But was the author at fault? Well, the jump scare was initiated by another friend, not the owner. The author had a right to be scared, especially since they had warned about their fear. The owner knew the author's phobia but still showed the spiders, maybe not considering the prankster friend's actions. The accident was a result of the prank, which the owner might have been aware of but allowed. \n\nSo, the author's action was a reflex in a scary situation. The responsibility might lie more with the friend who pranked them, and the owner for not preventing the prank. The author didn't intend to harm the tarantula, just reacted to protect themselves. Therefore, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. So the answer would be B.\n"
