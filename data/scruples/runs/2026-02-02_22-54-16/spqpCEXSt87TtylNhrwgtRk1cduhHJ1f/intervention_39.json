I was expecting a cheap pair of \u00a315 headphones or something but to my surprise, my grandpa generously surprised me with a brand new pair of ultraviolet beats solo3. I love them and I promised myself that I wouldn\u2019t let his money go to waste and I would get as much use out of them as possible.\n\n*Context over, here\u2019s the important stuff*:\n\nI wear these headphones just about everywhere I can get away with because noisy places in public overwhelm me and it\u2019s nice to have something muffle the sound. Also, it\u2019s always nice to have a distraction whenever being around people is too much.\n\nI\u2019ve started walking these into stores and just wearing them, zoning out all of the people talking. It makes something that is normally stressful into a breeze. I only ever shop at stores  with self checkouts available, so I didn\u2019t think it was a problem.\n \nHowever, a friend mentioned to me that at work her co worker had actually started crying because someone was walking into the store and ignoring her. She told me she thought people who walked into the store and didn\u2019t want to talk, were assholes (personally whenever that happened at work I was relieved but I\u2019m weird) and that everyone thinks you\u2019re an asshole when you do that .\n\nI realised I had been walking through that same store almost daily and chances are I had completely zoned out someone who I wasn\u2019t aware wanted to talk to me and I must of looked like some asshole who thought I was to important to talk to a retail employee. I probably ignored a couple of people and made them feel like that but at the same time I should be able to get a packet of crisps without being uncomfortable.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n(PS: please be nice to people in retail, it\u2019s a tough job and they don\u2019t get paid enough to deal with assholes)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wearing headphones in the store. The author has a history of social anxiety and autism, which makes public interactions stressful. She uses the headphones as a coping mechanism to manage sensory overload and avoid the stress of social interactions. Her intention is to feel more comfortable, not to be rude.\n\nThe friend's coworker was upset when ignored, and the friend's opinion is that people who do this are considered rude. However, the author didn't intend to ignore anyone; she just wasn't aware because she was using the headphones for self-regulation. The key point here is intent versus perception. The author's actions were not malicious, but they might have been perceived as dismissive by others.\n\nIn social contexts, there's an expectation to be polite and engage if someone approaches you. Wearing headphones can be seen as a signal not to be disturbed, but some people might still approach. If the author was in a place where interactions are expected (like a store), maybe she should be more mindful of others. However, given her mental health challenges, she's using a necessary tool to manage her well-being. There's a balance between personal comfort and social expectations.\n\nThe store in question has self-checkout, which might reduce the need for interaction. Still, employees might approach her for help or to make conversation. The author's actions could inadvertently hurt someone's feelings, but she's not doing it on purpose. The question is whether intent matters more than the impact here.\n\nConsidering her mental health, it's reasonable that she needs accommodations. Society is becoming more aware of neurodiversity and mental health issues. However, there's also a responsibility to be considerate. Maybe there's a middle ground, like using a smaller pair of headphones or being slightly more aware of surroundings. But outright calling her an asshole seems harsh. The answer likely leans towards B (not in the wrong) because her actions are a coping mechanism, not intentional rudeness.\n"
