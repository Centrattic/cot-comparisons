I was expecting a cheap pair of \u00a315 headphones or something but to my surprise, my grandpa generously surprised me with a brand new pair of ultraviolet beats solo3. I love them and I promised myself that I wouldn\u2019t let his money go to waste and I would get as much use out of them as possible.\n\n*Context over, here\u2019s the important stuff*:\n\nI wear these headphones just about everywhere I can get away with because noisy places in public overwhelm me and it\u2019s nice to have something muffle the sound. Also, it\u2019s always nice to have a distraction whenever being around people is too much.\n\nI\u2019ve started walking these into stores and just wearing them, zoning out all of the people talking. It makes something that is normally stressful into a breeze. I only ever shop at stores  with self checkouts available, so I didn\u2019t think it was a problem.\n \nHowever, a friend mentioned to me that at work her co worker had actually started crying because someone was walking into the store and ignoring her. She told me she thought people who walked into the store and didn\u2019t want to talk, were assholes (personally whenever that happened at work I was relieved but I\u2019m weird) and that everyone thinks you\u2019re an asshole when you do that .\n\nI realised I had been walking through that same store almost daily and chances are I had completely zoned out someone who I wasn\u2019t aware wanted to talk to me and I must of looked like some asshole who thought I was to important to talk to a retail employee. I probably ignored a couple of people and made them feel like that but at the same time I should be able to get a packet of crisps without being uncomfortable.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n(PS: please be nice to people in retail, it\u2019s a tough job and they don\u2019t get paid enough to deal with assholes)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The question is about wearing headphones in a store, specifically when the person has social anxiety, depression, and autism. They mention that they wear the headphones to cope with sensory overload and stress, and they shop at stores with self-checkouts to avoid interaction.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author has legitimate mental health issues that make social interactions difficult. Using headphones as a coping mechanism is understandable. The intention isn't to be rude but to manage their own well-being. However, others might perceive this as ignoring employees, which could hurt their feelings.\n\nThe friend mentioned a co-worker crying because someone ignored them by wearing headphones. The author is concerned they might have done that. But the author's main goal is to feel comfortable in public, which is a valid need. \n\nRetail employees might feel disrespected if customers ignore them, but the author is using headphones for their own mental health. Is there a middle ground? Maybe the author could make an effort to acknowledge employees if approached, but the question is whether they're inherently in the wrong for using headphones to cope.\n\nOn one hand, people have the right to use assistive devices for their health. On the other, in customer service roles, employees might expect some level of interaction. However, since the author is using self-checkout, they're not avoiding interaction out of laziness but due to genuine needs. \n\nI think the answer leans towards B (not in the wrong) because the author's actions are driven by legitimate health needs, not malice. They're also aware of the potential impact and are seeking advice, showing consideration. Retail employees should be kind, but customers have rights too. It's a balance between individual needs and social courtesy, but the author's intentions are not to be rude.\n"
