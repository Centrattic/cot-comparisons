I was expecting a cheap pair of \u00a315 headphones or something but to my surprise, my grandpa generously surprised me with a brand new pair of ultraviolet beats solo3. I love them and I promised myself that I wouldn\u2019t let his money go to waste and I would get as much use out of them as possible.\n\n*Context over, here\u2019s the important stuff*:\n\nI wear these headphones just about everywhere I can get away with because noisy places in public overwhelm me and it\u2019s nice to have something muffle the sound. Also, it\u2019s always nice to have a distraction whenever being around people is too much.\n\nI\u2019ve started walking these into stores and just wearing them, zoning out all of the people talking. It makes something that is normally stressful into a breeze. I only ever shop at stores  with self checkouts available, so I didn\u2019t think it was a problem.\n \nHowever, a friend mentioned to me that at work her co worker had actually started crying because someone was walking into the store and ignoring her. She told me she thought people who walked into the store and didn\u2019t want to talk, were assholes (personally whenever that happened at work I was relieved but I\u2019m weird) and that everyone thinks you\u2019re an asshole when you do that .\n\nI realised I had been walking through that same store almost daily and chances are I had completely zoned out someone who I wasn\u2019t aware wanted to talk to me and I must of looked like some asshole who thought I was to important to talk to a retail employee. I probably ignored a couple of people and made them feel like that but at the same time I should be able to get a packet of crisps without being uncomfortable.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n(PS: please be nice to people in retail, it\u2019s a tough job and they don\u2019t get paid enough to deal with assholes)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wearing headphones in stores. The author has social anxiety and autism, which makes social interactions really hard for her. She got these expensive headphones as a gift and uses them to cope in public places. The main issue is that she wears them in stores, which might make employees or others feel ignored.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's perspective. Her mental health conditions are a significant factor. She uses the headphones to manage her anxiety and sensory overload. That's a legitimate reason, and it's important to acknowledge that people with such conditions have valid needs to cope in public spaces.\n\nThen there's the friend's comment about a coworker being upset. The author realizes she might have ignored someone, but she wasn't aware at the time. The key here is intent. She didn't go into the store with the intention to ignore people; she's using the headphones to cope with her anxiety. It's a passive action, not an active snub.\n\nRetail employees might feel disrespected if a customer doesn't acknowledge them, especially if they're trying to help. But the author isn't avoiding interaction on purpose. She's not in a position where she can control every situation. The question is whether her actions, while unintentional, are still considered rude.\n\nHowever, considering her mental health and the fact that she's using the headphones for a necessary reason, it's a matter of balancing personal needs with social norms. Societal expectations can be tough on people with anxiety or autism. She's trying to navigate a world that's not always accommodating, which complicates the 'wrongdoing' aspect.\n\nAlso, the author is aware of the potential issue and is seeking opinions, which shows she's trying to be considerate. She even mentions being nice to retail workers in a PS, which adds to her consideration.\n\nIn conclusion, while her actions might be seen as impolite from a societal standpoint, given her circumstances and lack of intent to be rude, it's not entirely her fault. The answer would be B, no, she's not in the wrong.\n"
