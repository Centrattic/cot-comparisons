I was expecting a cheap pair of \u00a315 headphones or something but to my surprise, my grandpa generously surprised me with a brand new pair of ultraviolet beats solo3. I love them and I promised myself that I wouldn\u2019t let his money go to waste and I would get as much use out of them as possible.\n\n*Context over, here\u2019s the important stuff*:\n\nI wear these headphones just about everywhere I can get away with because noisy places in public overwhelm me and it\u2019s nice to have something muffle the sound. Also, it\u2019s always nice to have a distraction whenever being around people is too much.\n\nI\u2019ve started walking these into stores and just wearing them, zoning out all of the people talking. It makes something that is normally stressful into a breeze. I only ever shop at stores  with self checkouts available, so I didn\u2019t think it was a problem.\n \nHowever, a friend mentioned to me that at work her co worker had actually started crying because someone was walking into the store and ignoring her. She told me she thought people who walked into the store and didn\u2019t want to talk, were assholes (personally whenever that happened at work I was relieved but I\u2019m weird) and that everyone thinks you\u2019re an asshole when you do that .\n\nI realised I had been walking through that same store almost daily and chances are I had completely zoned out someone who I wasn\u2019t aware wanted to talk to me and I must of looked like some asshole who thought I was to important to talk to a retail employee. I probably ignored a couple of people and made them feel like that but at the same time I should be able to get a packet of crisps without being uncomfortable.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n(PS: please be nice to people in retail, it\u2019s a tough job and they don\u2019t get paid enough to deal with assholes)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong for wearing headphones in stores. The author has severe social anxiety and autism, which makes public interactions overwhelming. She uses headphones to manage this stress, especially in noisy environments. Her grandfather gave her the headphones, and she feels she's using them appropriately by wearing them in stores where self-checkout is available. However, a friend mentioned that someone at her workplace felt ignored because she was wearing headphones and not engaging, leading her to question if she's being an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context of her mental health. People with social anxiety and autism might find it challenging to engage in spontaneous social interactions, and using headphones can be a necessary coping mechanism. It's important to recognize that her actions are not out of disregard but out of a need to manage her anxiety.\n\nOn the other hand, there's the social expectation that when entering a store, especially one where you might interact with employees, there's an unspoken rule to be available for help. By wearing headphones, she's signaling that she's not interested in conversation, which could make employees feel ignored or disrespected. The friend's coworker crying over being ignored is a valid concern, as employees might feel undervalued or think customers are dismissive.\n\nHowever, the author isn't in a store that requires interaction; she uses self-checkout, so direct employee interaction is minimal. The problem arises if she's in the same store daily and might have accidentally ignored someone who wanted to assist her. But given her mental health challenges, she's trying to create a comfortable environment for herself. It's a balance between her needs and the potential impact on others.\n\nThe key point is whether intent matters. If she's not intentionally ignoring people but using headphones to cope with her anxiety, she isn't being an asshole. However, she might need to be mindful of her surroundings and perhaps check in if someone is trying to help. The answer likely leans towards B (not in the wrong) because her actions are a necessary accommodation for her mental health, and the situation is more about differing social expectations rather than malicious intent.\n"
