I was expecting a cheap pair of \u00a315 headphones or something but to my surprise, my grandpa generously surprised me with a brand new pair of ultraviolet beats solo3. I love them and I promised myself that I wouldn\u2019t let his money go to waste and I would get as much use out of them as possible.\n\n*Context over, here\u2019s the important stuff*:\n\nI wear these headphones just about everywhere I can get away with because noisy places in public overwhelm me and it\u2019s nice to have something muffle the sound. Also, it\u2019s always nice to have a distraction whenever being around people is too much.\n\nI\u2019ve started walking these into stores and just wearing them, zoning out all of the people talking. It makes something that is normally stressful into a breeze. I only ever shop at stores  with self checkouts available, so I didn\u2019t think it was a problem.\n \nHowever, a friend mentioned to me that at work her co worker had actually started crying because someone was walking into the store and ignoring her. She told me she thought people who walked into the store and didn\u2019t want to talk, were assholes (personally whenever that happened at work I was relieved but I\u2019m weird) and that everyone thinks you\u2019re an asshole when you do that .\n\nI realised I had been walking through that same store almost daily and chances are I had completely zoned out someone who I wasn\u2019t aware wanted to talk to me and I must of looked like some asshole who thought I was to important to talk to a retail employee. I probably ignored a couple of people and made them feel like that but at the same time I should be able to get a packet of crisps without being uncomfortable.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n(PS: please be nice to people in retail, it\u2019s a tough job and they don\u2019t get paid enough to deal with assholes)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the person in the AITA post is in the wrong for wearing headphones in the store. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author has a history of social anxiety, depression, and high-functioning autism. These are valid conditions that can make social interactions really challenging. She got the headphones as a gift from her grandpa, and she uses them to cope with the stress of being in public places. She shops at stores with self-checkouts, which suggests she's trying to minimize interactions where possible.\n\nHer friend mentioned that a coworker cried because someone ignored them in the store. The author realizes she might have done this too. The core issue here is whether it's acceptable to wear headphones in a store where employees might expect interaction, even if it's unintentional.\n\nOn one hand, the author has a legitimate need for the headphones due to her mental health. She's not trying to be rude; she's managing her own comfort. On the other hand, employees might feel disrespected or ignored if a customer doesn't acknowledge them, even if it's not intentional. \n\nBut wait, the stores she visits have self-checkouts. That means interactions with employees are probably not necessary. If she's using self-checkout, she's not avoiding employees who need to help her. However, maybe she still encounters employees while browsing, and not acknowledging them could be an issue. \n\nThe key here is intent. The author isn't trying to be an asshole; she's using the headphones to cope. But others might interpret her behavior as dismissive. However, the fact that she's aware of this and is concerned about it shows she's not inconsiderate. \n\nRetail jobs are tough, and employees might feel like customers are ignoring them. However, the author isn't avoiding necessary interactions. She's using self-checkout and is just trying to manage her anxiety. The problem is a misunderstanding, not malice.\n\nSo, considering her mental health, the use of self-checkout, and her lack of intent to be rude, I think the answer is B. She's not in the wrong. Her actions are a coping mechanism, and she's taking steps to be considerate (using self-checkout). The employees might feel ignored, but it's not her intention. The friend's coworker's reaction is a human issue, but the author isn't the asshole here.\n"
