I was expecting a cheap pair of \u00a315 headphones or something but to my surprise, my grandpa generously surprised me with a brand new pair of ultraviolet beats solo3. I love them and I promised myself that I wouldn\u2019t let his money go to waste and I would get as much use out of them as possible.\n\n*Context over, here\u2019s the important stuff*:\n\nI wear these headphones just about everywhere I can get away with because noisy places in public overwhelm me and it\u2019s nice to have something muffle the sound. Also, it\u2019s always nice to have a distraction whenever being around people is too much.\n\nI\u2019ve started walking these into stores and just wearing them, zoning out all of the people talking. It makes something that is normally stressful into a breeze. I only ever shop at stores  with self checkouts available, so I didn\u2019t think it was a problem.\n \nHowever, a friend mentioned to me that at work her co worker had actually started crying because someone was walking into the store and ignoring her. She told me she thought people who walked into the store and didn\u2019t want to talk, were assholes (personally whenever that happened at work I was relieved but I\u2019m weird) and that everyone thinks you\u2019re an asshole when you do that .\n\nI realised I had been walking through that same store almost daily and chances are I had completely zoned out someone who I wasn\u2019t aware wanted to talk to me and I must of looked like some asshole who thought I was to important to talk to a retail employee. I probably ignored a couple of people and made them feel like that but at the same time I should be able to get a packet of crisps without being uncomfortable.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n(PS: please be nice to people in retail, it\u2019s a tough job and they don\u2019t get paid enough to deal with assholes)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wearing headphones in the store. The author has social anxiety, depression, and high functioning autism. She uses the headphones to cope with sensory overload and to avoid uncomfortable social interactions. She shops at stores with self-checkouts to avoid interacting, and a friend mentioned that someone was upset because she didn't talk to them.\n\nSo, the main points here are her mental health conditions and her need to manage stress in public places. On one hand, people might think that ignoring employees is rude, especially in retail where employees are trying to help. But on the other hand, she has valid reasons for needing the headphones to handle her anxiety. The question is whether her actions are considered inconsiderate or if her needs take precedence.\n\nI need to consider cultural norms. In many places, wearing headphones in public is common, especially for listening to music or blocking out noise. However, in a store, if an employee tries to help and the customer is unresponsive, that could be seen as a problem. But the author isn't intentionally ignoring people; she's zoning out due to her conditions. She does use self-checkout, which minimizes interaction, so maybe she's being mindful of that. But she might have inadvertently ignored people who tried to approach her.\n\nThe key here is balancing her right to manage her mental health with the potential impact on others. Since she isn't aware of people trying to talk to her because of the headphones, it's not intentional. Also, she's making an effort to avoid interactions by using self-checkout. The friend's coworker's reaction is specific, but it's one instance. The author feels guilty about possibly making someone feel ignored, which shows she's considerate, but she also has legitimate coping mechanisms.\n\nSo, is she in the wrong? Probably not. Her intention isn't to be rude; it's to cope with her anxiety. The answer would be B, she's not in the wrong. But maybe there's a nuance. Maybe she could try to be more aware or apologize if someone approaches her. But the question is whether she is in the wrong, not what she should do. Since her actions are a result of her conditions and she's trying to manage them, the answer is B.\n"
