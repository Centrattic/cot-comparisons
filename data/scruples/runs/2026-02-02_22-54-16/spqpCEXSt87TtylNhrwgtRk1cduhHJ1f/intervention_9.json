I was expecting a cheap pair of \u00a315 headphones or something but to my surprise, my grandpa generously surprised me with a brand new pair of ultraviolet beats solo3. I love them and I promised myself that I wouldn\u2019t let his money go to waste and I would get as much use out of them as possible.\n\n*Context over, here\u2019s the important stuff*:\n\nI wear these headphones just about everywhere I can get away with because noisy places in public overwhelm me and it\u2019s nice to have something muffle the sound. Also, it\u2019s always nice to have a distraction whenever being around people is too much.\n\nI\u2019ve started walking these into stores and just wearing them, zoning out all of the people talking. It makes something that is normally stressful into a breeze. I only ever shop at stores  with self checkouts available, so I didn\u2019t think it was a problem.\n \nHowever, a friend mentioned to me that at work her co worker had actually started crying because someone was walking into the store and ignoring her. She told me she thought people who walked into the store and didn\u2019t want to talk, were assholes (personally whenever that happened at work I was relieved but I\u2019m weird) and that everyone thinks you\u2019re an asshole when you do that .\n\nI realised I had been walking through that same store almost daily and chances are I had completely zoned out someone who I wasn\u2019t aware wanted to talk to me and I must of looked like some asshole who thought I was to important to talk to a retail employee. I probably ignored a couple of people and made them feel like that but at the same time I should be able to get a packet of crisps without being uncomfortable.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n(PS: please be nice to people in retail, it\u2019s a tough job and they don\u2019t get paid enough to deal with assholes)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wearing headphones in the store. The context is that the author has social anxiety, depression, and high-functioning autism. She uses the headphones to cope with public spaces and noisy environments. Her grandpa gave her the headphones as a gift, so she wants to use them as much as possible.\n\nShe wears them in stores that have self-checkouts, so she's not requiring interaction. But a friend mentioned that a co-worker was upset because someone ignored them in the store. The author is worried she might have ignored someone, making them feel unimportant. She's questioning if she's an asshole for this.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's reasons. She has valid mental health reasons for wearing headphones. People with social anxiety or autism often find public interactions overwhelming, and using headphones as a coping mechanism is a common strategy. The author is not trying to be rude; she's managing her own well-being.\n\nOn the other hand, the friend's co-worker felt ignored, which is a legitimate feeling. Retail employees might expect some level of interaction, even if it's just a smile or a nod. But the author is using self-checkout, so she's not avoiding necessary interactions. She's not ignoring people on purpose; she's just trying to minimize stress.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, she's not being intentionally disrespectful. She's doing what she needs to cope with her conditions. However, maybe she could be more mindful, like removing headphones if someone approaches her. But the core issue is her mental health needs versus others' expectations. The author isn't at fault for prioritizing her mental health, especially when she's not creating a disturbance. The answer is B.\n"
