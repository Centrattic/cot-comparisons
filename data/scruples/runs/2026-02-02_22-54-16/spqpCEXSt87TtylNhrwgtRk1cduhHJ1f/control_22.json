I was expecting a cheap pair of \u00a315 headphones or something but to my surprise, my grandpa generously surprised me with a brand new pair of ultraviolet beats solo3. I love them and I promised myself that I wouldn\u2019t let his money go to waste and I would get as much use out of them as possible.\n\n*Context over, here\u2019s the important stuff*:\n\nI wear these headphones just about everywhere I can get away with because noisy places in public overwhelm me and it\u2019s nice to have something muffle the sound. Also, it\u2019s always nice to have a distraction whenever being around people is too much.\n\nI\u2019ve started walking these into stores and just wearing them, zoning out all of the people talking. It makes something that is normally stressful into a breeze. I only ever shop at stores  with self checkouts available, so I didn\u2019t think it was a problem.\n \nHowever, a friend mentioned to me that at work her co worker had actually started crying because someone was walking into the store and ignoring her. She told me she thought people who walked into the store and didn\u2019t want to talk, were assholes (personally whenever that happened at work I was relieved but I\u2019m weird) and that everyone thinks you\u2019re an asshole when you do that .\n\nI realised I had been walking through that same store almost daily and chances are I had completely zoned out someone who I wasn\u2019t aware wanted to talk to me and I must of looked like some asshole who thought I was to important to talk to a retail employee. I probably ignored a couple of people and made them feel like that but at the same time I should be able to get a packet of crisps without being uncomfortable.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n(PS: please be nice to people in retail, it\u2019s a tough job and they don\u2019t get paid enough to deal with assholes)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person in the scenario is in the wrong for wearing headphones in a store. The person has severe social anxiety, depression, and high-functioning autism. They use headphones to cope with public spaces, especially during walks to work and in stores. The main issue is whether wearing headphones in a store is considered inconsiderate or rude.\n\nFirst, the person has valid reasons for using headphones. Mental health conditions can make social interactions extremely stressful. Using headphones to manage anxiety isn't uncommon; many people do this to reduce sensory overload. The store in question has self-checkout, so the person isn't interacting with employees in a necessary way. They\u2019re not avoiding a conversation but trying to manage their own comfort.\n\nHowever, the friend mentioned a co-worker crying because someone ignored them. The person realizes they might have zoned out people who wanted to engage, but they didn't intend to ignore anyone. The question is about whether this unintentional behavior is inconsiderate. \n\nOn one hand, it's reasonable to protect one's mental health needs. On the other, in a retail setting, employees might expect some level of interaction, even if it's just a brief exchange. But the key here is that the person is using self-checkout, so the interaction isn't required. They're not avoiding a customer service interaction but managing their own stress. \n\nAdditionally, the person is aware of their behavior and is concerned about others' feelings, which shows consideration. The fact that they're reflecting on their actions and seeking advice indicates they care about being respectful. \n\nRetail employees often deal with difficult customers, and while it's unfortunate if someone felt ignored, the person in question didn't intend harm. Their actions are a coping mechanism for a legitimate mental health condition. \n\nSo, balancing the individual's need for comfort against the potential impact on others, the answer leans towards the person not being in the wrong. They have a valid reason for their actions, and the stores they shop at accommodate self-checkout, reducing the need for interaction. The unintentional effect on others isn't malicious, and they\u2019re making an effort to be mindful.\n"
