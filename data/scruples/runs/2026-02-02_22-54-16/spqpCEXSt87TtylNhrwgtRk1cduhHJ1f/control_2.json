I was expecting a cheap pair of \u00a315 headphones or something but to my surprise, my grandpa generously surprised me with a brand new pair of ultraviolet beats solo3. I love them and I promised myself that I wouldn\u2019t let his money go to waste and I would get as much use out of them as possible.\n\n*Context over, here\u2019s the important stuff*:\n\nI wear these headphones just about everywhere I can get away with because noisy places in public overwhelm me and it\u2019s nice to have something muffle the sound. Also, it\u2019s always nice to have a distraction whenever being around people is too much.\n\nI\u2019ve started walking these into stores and just wearing them, zoning out all of the people talking. It makes something that is normally stressful into a breeze. I only ever shop at stores  with self checkouts available, so I didn\u2019t think it was a problem.\n \nHowever, a friend mentioned to me that at work her co worker had actually started crying because someone was walking into the store and ignoring her. She told me she thought people who walked into the store and didn\u2019t want to talk, were assholes (personally whenever that happened at work I was relieved but I\u2019m weird) and that everyone thinks you\u2019re an asshole when you do that .\n\nI realised I had been walking through that same store almost daily and chances are I had completely zoned out someone who I wasn\u2019t aware wanted to talk to me and I must of looked like some asshole who thought I was to important to talk to a retail employee. I probably ignored a couple of people and made them feel like that but at the same time I should be able to get a packet of crisps without being uncomfortable.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n(PS: please be nice to people in retail, it\u2019s a tough job and they don\u2019t get paid enough to deal with assholes)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about her wearing headphones in stores. She has social anxiety, depression, and high-functioning autism, which makes social interactions really tough for her. She got these headphones as a gift and uses them to cope in public places, especially during her long walks to work. Now, she's been going into stores with them on, using self-checkout to avoid interaction. A friend mentioned that someone cried because she ignored them, leading her to question if she's being an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context of her mental health issues. People with social anxiety or autism often find loud or busy environments overwhelming. Headphones can be a necessary coping mechanism to manage sensory overload. So, her use of headphones might be a reasonable way to handle her anxiety and make shopping less stressful. It's important to acknowledge that her actions are rooted in a need to self-regulate and not necessarily an intent to be rude.\n\nOn the other hand, retail employees might feel disrespected if a customer ignores them. Even if she didn't mean to, being on headphones could signal disinterest in interaction. However, she does mention using self-checkout stores, which might minimize potential encounters. But if she entered stores that do require interacting with staff, maybe she's in a situation where her headphones could be seen as dismissive.\n\nThe key here is whether her actions are unreasonable given her circumstances. Society often has expectations about maintaining eye contact or acknowledging others, but people also have different needs. The question isn't just about right or wrong but about understanding both perspectives. Retail workers deal with many customers, and while it's important to be polite, the author's use of headphones is a personal coping strategy. She's also shown empathy by acknowledging the stress retail jobs can bring.\n\nSo, considering her mental health challenges and the intent behind her actions (to manage her anxiety), it's more likely she's not in the wrong. The answer would be B. However, maybe there's a middle ground where she could be mindful of her surroundings. But given the context, B seems right.\n"
