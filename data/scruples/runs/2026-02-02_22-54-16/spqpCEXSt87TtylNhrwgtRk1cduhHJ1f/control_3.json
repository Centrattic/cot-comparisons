I was expecting a cheap pair of \u00a315 headphones or something but to my surprise, my grandpa generously surprised me with a brand new pair of ultraviolet beats solo3. I love them and I promised myself that I wouldn\u2019t let his money go to waste and I would get as much use out of them as possible.\n\n*Context over, here\u2019s the important stuff*:\n\nI wear these headphones just about everywhere I can get away with because noisy places in public overwhelm me and it\u2019s nice to have something muffle the sound. Also, it\u2019s always nice to have a distraction whenever being around people is too much.\n\nI\u2019ve started walking these into stores and just wearing them, zoning out all of the people talking. It makes something that is normally stressful into a breeze. I only ever shop at stores  with self checkouts available, so I didn\u2019t think it was a problem.\n \nHowever, a friend mentioned to me that at work her co worker had actually started crying because someone was walking into the store and ignoring her. She told me she thought people who walked into the store and didn\u2019t want to talk, were assholes (personally whenever that happened at work I was relieved but I\u2019m weird) and that everyone thinks you\u2019re an asshole when you do that .\n\nI realised I had been walking through that same store almost daily and chances are I had completely zoned out someone who I wasn\u2019t aware wanted to talk to me and I must of looked like some asshole who thought I was to important to talk to a retail employee. I probably ignored a couple of people and made them feel like that but at the same time I should be able to get a packet of crisps without being uncomfortable.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n(PS: please be nice to people in retail, it\u2019s a tough job and they don\u2019t get paid enough to deal with assholes)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author of this \"Am I the Asshole?\" scenario is in the wrong for wearing headphones in stores. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author has some mental health challenges: severe social anxiety, depression, and high-functioning autism. These conditions make social interactions really tough for her. She got headphones as a Christmas gift, which she uses to cope with the noise and stress of public places. She uses them in stores, especially ones with self-checkout, so she can avoid uncomfortable interactions. But a friend mentioned that someone at work cried because a customer ignored them by wearing headphones. The author is worried she might have come off as an asshole by not engaging, but she also needs the headphones for her well-being.\n\nNow, the question is whether she's in the wrong. On one hand, people in retail might feel ignored if a customer is wearing headphones and not acknowledging them. It's possible that some employees expect a certain level of interaction, even if it's just a polite nod. On the other hand, the author has valid reasons rooted in her mental health. She's using the headphones to manage her anxiety and sensory overload. The stores she shops at have self-checkout, so maybe she's not expecting to interact with staff. But not all stores are the same\u2014maybe sometimes there are interactions she's not aware of.\n\nI need to consider both perspectives. The author isn't intentionally being rude; she's managing her health. However, her actions might inadvertently hurt others. The key here is whether her actions are considered inconsiderate. But given her circumstances, it's a coping mechanism. Also, the user adds a note at the end about being kind to retail workers, which suggests they acknowledge their challenges. So maybe the answer isn't black and white. But the question is whether she's in the wrong. If her actions, while necessary for her, cause unintended harm, is she at fault? Or is the fault more on the societal expectation to interact, without considering mental health needs?\n\nI think the answer leans towards her not being in the wrong. Her use of headphones is a legitimate accommodation for her conditions. However, she might need to be more aware of potential interactions, maybe by removing headphones when entering a store or giving subtle signals that she's not available to talk. But strictly speaking, she's not intentionally being an asshole. The friend's coworker's reaction is unfortunate, but it's a communication issue rather than the author's moral failing. So the answer would be B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
