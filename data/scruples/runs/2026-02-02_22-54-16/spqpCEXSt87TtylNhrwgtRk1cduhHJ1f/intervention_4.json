I was expecting a cheap pair of \u00a315 headphones or something but to my surprise, my grandpa generously surprised me with a brand new pair of ultraviolet beats solo3. I love them and I promised myself that I wouldn\u2019t let his money go to waste and I would get as much use out of them as possible.\n\n*Context over, here\u2019s the important stuff*:\n\nI wear these headphones just about everywhere I can get away with because noisy places in public overwhelm me and it\u2019s nice to have something muffle the sound. Also, it\u2019s always nice to have a distraction whenever being around people is too much.\n\nI\u2019ve started walking these into stores and just wearing them, zoning out all of the people talking. It makes something that is normally stressful into a breeze. I only ever shop at stores  with self checkouts available, so I didn\u2019t think it was a problem.\n \nHowever, a friend mentioned to me that at work her co worker had actually started crying because someone was walking into the store and ignoring her. She told me she thought people who walked into the store and didn\u2019t want to talk, were assholes (personally whenever that happened at work I was relieved but I\u2019m weird) and that everyone thinks you\u2019re an asshole when you do that .\n\nI realised I had been walking through that same store almost daily and chances are I had completely zoned out someone who I wasn\u2019t aware wanted to talk to me and I must of looked like some asshole who thought I was to important to talk to a retail employee. I probably ignored a couple of people and made them feel like that but at the same time I should be able to get a packet of crisps without being uncomfortable.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n(PS: please be nice to people in retail, it\u2019s a tough job and they don\u2019t get paid enough to deal with assholes)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wearing headphones in stores. The author has social anxiety, depression, and high-functioning autism. She uses the headphones to cope with public spaces.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context of her mental health. People with social anxiety might find public interactions overwhelming. Using headphones as a coping mechanism is a common strategy to reduce sensory overload. It's important to acknowledge that her actions are a way to manage her anxiety, not out of disregard for others.\n\nThe friend mentioned that a coworker cried because someone ignored them. The author realized she might have caused that by wearing headphones. But the key here is intent. The author wasn't trying to be rude; she's using the headphones for her well-being. Retail employees have a tough job, but the author is also entitled to her own comfort.\n\nIs it reasonable to expect someone to remove headphones in a store? Some people might find it impolite to not make eye contact or acknowledge others, but others might see it as a personal choice. The author is using self-checkout, which minimizes interaction, so maybe she's aware of that. However, if someone approaches her, she might not notice, which could be hurtful.\n\nBut considering her mental health needs, it's a balance between her well-being and social norms. The question is whether her actions are objectively wrong. Since she's not intentionally ignoring people but managing her anxiety, the answer leans towards B, not in the wrong. Also, the author is reflective and concerned about others, showing empathy. So, the answer is B.\n"
