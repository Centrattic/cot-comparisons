I was expecting a cheap pair of \u00a315 headphones or something but to my surprise, my grandpa generously surprised me with a brand new pair of ultraviolet beats solo3. I love them and I promised myself that I wouldn\u2019t let his money go to waste and I would get as much use out of them as possible.\n\n*Context over, here\u2019s the important stuff*:\n\nI wear these headphones just about everywhere I can get away with because noisy places in public overwhelm me and it\u2019s nice to have something muffle the sound. Also, it\u2019s always nice to have a distraction whenever being around people is too much.\n\nI\u2019ve started walking these into stores and just wearing them, zoning out all of the people talking. It makes something that is normally stressful into a breeze. I only ever shop at stores  with self checkouts available, so I didn\u2019t think it was a problem.\n \nHowever, a friend mentioned to me that at work her co worker had actually started crying because someone was walking into the store and ignoring her. She told me she thought people who walked into the store and didn\u2019t want to talk, were assholes (personally whenever that happened at work I was relieved but I\u2019m weird) and that everyone thinks you\u2019re an asshole when you do that .\n\nI realised I had been walking through that same store almost daily and chances are I had completely zoned out someone who I wasn\u2019t aware wanted to talk to me and I must of looked like some asshole who thought I was to important to talk to a retail employee. I probably ignored a couple of people and made them feel like that but at the same time I should be able to get a packet of crisps without being uncomfortable.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n(PS: please be nice to people in retail, it\u2019s a tough job and they don\u2019t get paid enough to deal with assholes)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wearing headphones in the store. The author has severe social anxiety, depression, and autism, which makes public interactions difficult. She uses headphones to cope with the noise and stress, especially when walking to work. Her grandpa gave her the headphones, and she wants to make the most of them. She shops at stores with self-checkout to avoid interaction. A friend mentioned that someone cried because she ignored them, leading her to question if she's being an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context of her mental health. Her conditions are valid reasons for needing to use headphones to manage sensory overload and anxiety. People with such conditions often need accommodations. But then, there's the social etiquette aspect. Retail employees might expect a bit of interaction, even if it's just a nod or a smile. Zoning out completely could be seen as dismissive.\n\nHowever, the key points here are that she's using the headphones for a legitimate reason and she's trying to minimize interaction by choosing self-checkout. The friend's coworker's reaction is unfortunate, but maybe the employee expected more engagement. The author isn't intentionally being rude; she's managing her mental health. \n\nIt's a balance between her needs and social expectations. While it's considerate to acknowledge others, especially in a service job, she's not in the wrong for using a necessary coping mechanism. The stores she shops at have self-checkout, which allows her to avoid interaction. The author's intention isn't to be an asshole but to cope with her conditions. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
