I was expecting a cheap pair of \u00a315 headphones or something but to my surprise, my grandpa generously surprised me with a brand new pair of ultraviolet beats solo3. I love them and I promised myself that I wouldn\u2019t let his money go to waste and I would get as much use out of them as possible.\n\n*Context over, here\u2019s the important stuff*:\n\nI wear these headphones just about everywhere I can get away with because noisy places in public overwhelm me and it\u2019s nice to have something muffle the sound. Also, it\u2019s always nice to have a distraction whenever being around people is too much.\n\nI\u2019ve started walking these into stores and just wearing them, zoning out all of the people talking. It makes something that is normally stressful into a breeze. I only ever shop at stores  with self checkouts available, so I didn\u2019t think it was a problem.\n \nHowever, a friend mentioned to me that at work her co worker had actually started crying because someone was walking into the store and ignoring her. She told me she thought people who walked into the store and didn\u2019t want to talk, were assholes (personally whenever that happened at work I was relieved but I\u2019m weird) and that everyone thinks you\u2019re an asshole when you do that .\n\nI realised I had been walking through that same store almost daily and chances are I had completely zoned out someone who I wasn\u2019t aware wanted to talk to me and I must of looked like some asshole who thought I was to important to talk to a retail employee. I probably ignored a couple of people and made them feel like that but at the same time I should be able to get a packet of crisps without being uncomfortable.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n(PS: please be nice to people in retail, it\u2019s a tough job and they don\u2019t get paid enough to deal with assholes)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wearing headphones in public, especially in stores. The author has severe social anxiety, depression, and autism. They wear headphones to cope with sensory overload and stress in public places. They use self-checkout stores to avoid interacting, and a friend mentioned that someone was upset because they were ignored.\n\nFirst, the key points: The author has valid mental health reasons for wearing headphones. They\u2019re not trying to be rude; they need it for their well-being. The friend\u2019s coworker\u2019s reaction is understandable, but the author didn\u2019t intend to hurt anyone. Retail employees are in a tough job, but the author is managing their own stress, which is important too.\n\nThe question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. \n\nConsidering that the author is using a coping mechanism for their mental health, and they\u2019re in a self-checkout store where interaction isn\u2019t necessary, it's more about their personal needs. While it's considerate to be aware of others, the author isn\u2019t actively being dismissive but rather managing their anxiety. The friend\u2019s coworker\u2019s feelings are valid, but the author isn\u2019t intentionally ignoring people. So, the answer would likely be B, not in the wrong. They\u2019re prioritizing their mental health, which is important. However, maybe a balance could be struck, but the situation as described doesn\u2019t make them the asshole.\n"
