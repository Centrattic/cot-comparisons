I was expecting a cheap pair of \u00a315 headphones or something but to my surprise, my grandpa generously surprised me with a brand new pair of ultraviolet beats solo3. I love them and I promised myself that I wouldn\u2019t let his money go to waste and I would get as much use out of them as possible.\n\n*Context over, here\u2019s the important stuff*:\n\nI wear these headphones just about everywhere I can get away with because noisy places in public overwhelm me and it\u2019s nice to have something muffle the sound. Also, it\u2019s always nice to have a distraction whenever being around people is too much.\n\nI\u2019ve started walking these into stores and just wearing them, zoning out all of the people talking. It makes something that is normally stressful into a breeze. I only ever shop at stores  with self checkouts available, so I didn\u2019t think it was a problem.\n \nHowever, a friend mentioned to me that at work her co worker had actually started crying because someone was walking into the store and ignoring her. She told me she thought people who walked into the store and didn\u2019t want to talk, were assholes (personally whenever that happened at work I was relieved but I\u2019m weird) and that everyone thinks you\u2019re an asshole when you do that .\n\nI realised I had been walking through that same store almost daily and chances are I had completely zoned out someone who I wasn\u2019t aware wanted to talk to me and I must of looked like some asshole who thought I was to important to talk to a retail employee. I probably ignored a couple of people and made them feel like that but at the same time I should be able to get a packet of crisps without being uncomfortable.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n(PS: please be nice to people in retail, it\u2019s a tough job and they don\u2019t get paid enough to deal with assholes)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The question is about wearing headphones in a store. The author has social anxiety, depression, and autism, which makes public interactions stressful. She got high-end headphones from her grandpa and uses them everywhere to cope, including in stores where she shops at self-checkout to avoid interaction. However, a friend mentioned that someone at work was upset because she ignored them, and the friend thinks people who do that are jerks.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context of her mental health. People with social anxiety or autism might find loud or busy environments overwhelming. Headphones can be a necessary tool for them to manage sensory overload. It's important that she's using them to cope, not just to be antisocial. \n\nThen, the friend's co-worker had a bad experience, which makes the author question if she was inconsiderate. But the author didn't intend to ignore anyone; she's just avoiding interaction due to her anxiety. The key here is intent. If she's not deliberately ignoring people but using the headphones for her own well-being, maybe she's not at fault. However, stores are public spaces where employees expect some level of engagement. If she walked in with headphones on and didn't acknowledge them, even if unintentionally, it might come off as rude. \n\nBut wait, does the store require interaction? Since she uses self-checkout, maybe she's not interacting with employees at all. In that case, not engaging isn't her fault. The problem arises when she's in the store and someone tries to talk to her, but she doesn't respond because she's zoned out. However, if she's not aware of people approaching her, is that her fault? She probably can't control that if she's in her own head with music.\n\nAlso, the author is conscious of not making retail workers deal with her, as she acknowledges their tough job. That shows she's considerate, but maybe she didn't realize the impact. The friend's co-worker's reaction is extreme, but others might feel ignored. However, the author has a valid reason for needing the headphones. Retail stores can be noisy and stressful, so using them there isn't inherently wrong. The issue is more about the perception of others rather than her actual actions being malicious.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong because her use of headphones is a coping mechanism, not an intentional slight. The stores she uses have self-checkout, so she can shop without interacting. The co-worker's reaction is unfortunate, but the author's actions are justified given her mental health needs. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
