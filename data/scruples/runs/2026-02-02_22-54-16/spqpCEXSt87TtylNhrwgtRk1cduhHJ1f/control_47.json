I was expecting a cheap pair of \u00a315 headphones or something but to my surprise, my grandpa generously surprised me with a brand new pair of ultraviolet beats solo3. I love them and I promised myself that I wouldn\u2019t let his money go to waste and I would get as much use out of them as possible.\n\n*Context over, here\u2019s the important stuff*:\n\nI wear these headphones just about everywhere I can get away with because noisy places in public overwhelm me and it\u2019s nice to have something muffle the sound. Also, it\u2019s always nice to have a distraction whenever being around people is too much.\n\nI\u2019ve started walking these into stores and just wearing them, zoning out all of the people talking. It makes something that is normally stressful into a breeze. I only ever shop at stores  with self checkouts available, so I didn\u2019t think it was a problem.\n \nHowever, a friend mentioned to me that at work her co worker had actually started crying because someone was walking into the store and ignoring her. She told me she thought people who walked into the store and didn\u2019t want to talk, were assholes (personally whenever that happened at work I was relieved but I\u2019m weird) and that everyone thinks you\u2019re an asshole when you do that .\n\nI realised I had been walking through that same store almost daily and chances are I had completely zoned out someone who I wasn\u2019t aware wanted to talk to me and I must of looked like some asshole who thought I was to important to talk to a retail employee. I probably ignored a couple of people and made them feel like that but at the same time I should be able to get a packet of crisps without being uncomfortable.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n(PS: please be nice to people in retail, it\u2019s a tough job and they don\u2019t get paid enough to deal with assholes)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wearing headphones in the store. The author has social anxiety, depression, and high functioning autism. She uses the headphones to cope with sensory overload and stress in public places. She shops at stores with self-checkout, so she doesn't need to interact much. Her friend mentioned that a coworker cried because someone didn't talk to them, and the friend thinks people who ignore others in stores are assholes. The author is worried she might have ignored people and made them feel bad, but she needs the headphones for her mental health.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. On one hand, the author has valid reasons related to her mental health. Using headphones to manage anxiety and sensory issues is a common coping mechanism. It's important to accommodate people with disabilities or mental health challenges. On the other hand, there might be retail employees or others who feel ignored if someone is wearing headphones and not engaging. However, the author isn't avoiding interactions that she's responsible for, since she uses self-checkout. The stores she shops at don't require her to interact with employees.\n\nThe key points here are the author's mental health needs versus the potential impact on others. The author isn't being intentionally rude; she's managing her own well-being. The fact that she's aware of her actions and is seeking advice shows she's considerate. Also, she mentions that she shops at stores where she doesn't need to interact, which minimizes the chance of causing offense. The friend's coworker's reaction seems extreme, and the author isn't in a position where she's required to engage with others. \n\nTherefore, while it's possible that someone might feel ignored, the author isn't in the wrong because she's taking necessary steps to cope with her conditions. Society should be more understanding of such accommodations. The answer would be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
