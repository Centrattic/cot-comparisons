I was expecting a cheap pair of \u00a315 headphones or something but to my surprise, my grandpa generously surprised me with a brand new pair of ultraviolet beats solo3. I love them and I promised myself that I wouldn\u2019t let his money go to waste and I would get as much use out of them as possible.\n\n*Context over, here\u2019s the important stuff*:\n\nI wear these headphones just about everywhere I can get away with because noisy places in public overwhelm me and it\u2019s nice to have something muffle the sound. Also, it\u2019s always nice to have a distraction whenever being around people is too much.\n\nI\u2019ve started walking these into stores and just wearing them, zoning out all of the people talking. It makes something that is normally stressful into a breeze. I only ever shop at stores  with self checkouts available, so I didn\u2019t think it was a problem.\n \nHowever, a friend mentioned to me that at work her co worker had actually started crying because someone was walking into the store and ignoring her. She told me she thought people who walked into the store and didn\u2019t want to talk, were assholes (personally whenever that happened at work I was relieved but I\u2019m weird) and that everyone thinks you\u2019re an asshole when you do that .\n\nI realised I had been walking through that same store almost daily and chances are I had completely zoned out someone who I wasn\u2019t aware wanted to talk to me and I must of looked like some asshole who thought I was to important to talk to a retail employee. I probably ignored a couple of people and made them feel like that but at the same time I should be able to get a packet of crisps without being uncomfortable.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n(PS: please be nice to people in retail, it\u2019s a tough job and they don\u2019t get paid enough to deal with assholes)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about wearing headphones in a store. The author has social anxiety, depression, and high functioning autism. She uses the headphones to block out noise and manage her anxiety, especially in public places. The main issue is that her friend mentioned a coworker who got upset because someone (like the author) didn't acknowledge them when walking into the store.\n\nThe author is worried that by wearing headphones and not engaging, she might have made people feel ignored or like she's too important to talk to. But she also needs the headphones to cope with her conditions. The question is whether she's in the wrong for doing this.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context of her mental health. People with social anxiety and autism often find public interactions overwhelming. Using headphones as a coping mechanism is a common strategy to reduce sensory overload. From her perspective, it's necessary for her well-being.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that entering a store and not being socially available could be seen as rude. Employees might feel ignored if they're trying to be helpful. However, the author only goes into stores with self-checkout, which implies she's not expecting to interact with staff. Also, she didn't realize that people might perceive her as dismissive until her friend mentioned it.\n\nThe key points here are her intention versus the potential impact. She's not intentionally being rude; she's using the headphones to manage her anxiety. The stores she visits allow self-checkout, so maybe she's not expecting interaction. But there's a chance that employees might feel disrespected if they try to help and she doesn't respond.\n\nHowever, it's also true that people in retail might have had negative experiences where customers ignored them, leading to feelings of being undervalued. The author didn't mean harm, but her actions might inadvertently hurt others. Still, considering her mental health challenges and the accommodations she's making for her own well-being, it's a bit of a balance.\n\nI think the answer depends on whether the situation is judged more on intent or outcome. Since the author's actions are due to her need to cope, and she's not trying to be dismissive, it's more about her needing to communicate her situation if possible. However, since she's not doing anything illegal or against store policies, maybe she's not in the wrong. The main point is that she's using the headphones for a valid reason related to her mental health. Therefore, the answer might be B (not in the wrong), but with the consideration that she could be more aware of how others might perceive her.\n"
