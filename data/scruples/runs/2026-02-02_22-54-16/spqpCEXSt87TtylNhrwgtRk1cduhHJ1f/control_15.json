I was expecting a cheap pair of \u00a315 headphones or something but to my surprise, my grandpa generously surprised me with a brand new pair of ultraviolet beats solo3. I love them and I promised myself that I wouldn\u2019t let his money go to waste and I would get as much use out of them as possible.\n\n*Context over, here\u2019s the important stuff*:\n\nI wear these headphones just about everywhere I can get away with because noisy places in public overwhelm me and it\u2019s nice to have something muffle the sound. Also, it\u2019s always nice to have a distraction whenever being around people is too much.\n\nI\u2019ve started walking these into stores and just wearing them, zoning out all of the people talking. It makes something that is normally stressful into a breeze. I only ever shop at stores  with self checkouts available, so I didn\u2019t think it was a problem.\n \nHowever, a friend mentioned to me that at work her co worker had actually started crying because someone was walking into the store and ignoring her. She told me she thought people who walked into the store and didn\u2019t want to talk, were assholes (personally whenever that happened at work I was relieved but I\u2019m weird) and that everyone thinks you\u2019re an asshole when you do that .\n\nI realised I had been walking through that same store almost daily and chances are I had completely zoned out someone who I wasn\u2019t aware wanted to talk to me and I must of looked like some asshole who thought I was to important to talk to a retail employee. I probably ignored a couple of people and made them feel like that but at the same time I should be able to get a packet of crisps without being uncomfortable.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n(PS: please be nice to people in retail, it\u2019s a tough job and they don\u2019t get paid enough to deal with assholes)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about wearing headphones in stores. The person has social anxiety, depression, and autism, which makes social interactions really tough for them. They got expensive headphones as a gift and use them to cope in public places, especially during walks to work. Now they're using them in stores too, mainly ones with self-checkout, to avoid the stress of interacting with people.\n\nThe main issue is that a friend told them that someone at a store got upset because the author (or someone like them) ignored them. The author is worried they might have made people feel disrespected or like they were too important to talk to. But they also need the headphones to manage their anxiety.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, first, there's no rule against wearing headphones in stores unless the store specifically prohibits it. The author isn't doing anything illegal or violating store policies. They're using self-checkout, so they aren't requiring interaction with employees. However, the social aspect is tricky. When someone is in a store, especially one where employees might need to help them, wearing headphones could make it harder for employees to assist if needed. But if the author is only using self-checkout and not needing help, maybe it's not a big deal.\n\nThe author's mental health issues are a significant factor here. People with social anxiety or autism might need such coping mechanisms. The key point is that they're not intentionally being rude; they're trying to manage their own well-being. But the friend's story suggests that someone felt hurt, which is valid. However, the author didn't know they were being ignored. It's possible that the employee felt disrespected, but the author's actions were a result of their anxiety, not malice.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, they're not breaking any rules and have a valid reason for their actions. On the other hand, there's the potential for unintentionally making someone feel unimportant. But since the author isn't aware when someone is trying to talk to them, it's not intentional. Retail employees do deal with tough customers, and the author is trying to be considerate by using self-checkout. The main issue is the lack of awareness, but that's part of their condition. \n\nIn similar situations, people often use headphones in public to cope, and it's generally accepted unless it's in a situation where interaction is necessary. Since the author is using self-checkout, they don't need to interact. The employees who were ignored might be upset, but the author isn't at fault for their anxiety. So the answer is probably B, they're not in the wrong. The friend's coworker's reaction is unfortunate, but the author's actions are a result of their health conditions and a need for coping mechanisms.\n"
