I was expecting a cheap pair of \u00a315 headphones or something but to my surprise, my grandpa generously surprised me with a brand new pair of ultraviolet beats solo3. I love them and I promised myself that I wouldn\u2019t let his money go to waste and I would get as much use out of them as possible.\n\n*Context over, here\u2019s the important stuff*:\n\nI wear these headphones just about everywhere I can get away with because noisy places in public overwhelm me and it\u2019s nice to have something muffle the sound. Also, it\u2019s always nice to have a distraction whenever being around people is too much.\n\nI\u2019ve started walking these into stores and just wearing them, zoning out all of the people talking. It makes something that is normally stressful into a breeze. I only ever shop at stores  with self checkouts available, so I didn\u2019t think it was a problem.\n \nHowever, a friend mentioned to me that at work her co worker had actually started crying because someone was walking into the store and ignoring her. She told me she thought people who walked into the store and didn\u2019t want to talk, were assholes (personally whenever that happened at work I was relieved but I\u2019m weird) and that everyone thinks you\u2019re an asshole when you do that .\n\nI realised I had been walking through that same store almost daily and chances are I had completely zoned out someone who I wasn\u2019t aware wanted to talk to me and I must of looked like some asshole who thought I was to important to talk to a retail employee. I probably ignored a couple of people and made them feel like that but at the same time I should be able to get a packet of crisps without being uncomfortable.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n(PS: please be nice to people in retail, it\u2019s a tough job and they don\u2019t get paid enough to deal with assholes)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wearing headphones in stores. The author has social anxiety, depression, and high functioning autism. She uses the headphones to cope with public spaces and stressful interactions. She shops at stores with self-checkouts, so she doesn't need to interact much. Her friend mentioned that someone cried because she ignored them, which made the author realize she might have come off as rude.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context of her mental health conditions. People with social anxiety and autism often find social interactions overwhelming. Using headphones as a coping mechanism is a common strategy to reduce sensory overload. The author isn't avoiding interactions out of arrogance but because of genuine struggles with social situations.\n\nThen, the friend's story about a coworker crying adds another layer. While the author might have unintentionally hurt someone's feelings by not engaging, it's important to note that she wasn't being dismissive on purpose. She's using the headphones to manage her mental health, not to be rude. The fact that she's self-aware enough to realize this and apologize shows responsibility.\n\nRetail employees often deal with difficult customers, and while it's important to be respectful, the author's actions stem from a place of need rather than malice. The key here is that she's not refusing to interact when needed\u2014she's using self-checkout and isn't creating a problem for others. The potential embarrassment others feel is a result of her coping strategies, not an intentional disregard.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author is not in the wrong. She's managing her mental health in a way that's necessary for her well-being, and there's no evidence she intended to be an asshole. The situation is a conflict between her needs and others' expectations, but she's taking steps to be considerate (like using self-checkout). Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
