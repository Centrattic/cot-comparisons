I was expecting a cheap pair of \u00a315 headphones or something but to my surprise, my grandpa generously surprised me with a brand new pair of ultraviolet beats solo3. I love them and I promised myself that I wouldn\u2019t let his money go to waste and I would get as much use out of them as possible.\n\n*Context over, here\u2019s the important stuff*:\n\nI wear these headphones just about everywhere I can get away with because noisy places in public overwhelm me and it\u2019s nice to have something muffle the sound. Also, it\u2019s always nice to have a distraction whenever being around people is too much.\n\nI\u2019ve started walking these into stores and just wearing them, zoning out all of the people talking. It makes something that is normally stressful into a breeze. I only ever shop at stores  with self checkouts available, so I didn\u2019t think it was a problem.\n \nHowever, a friend mentioned to me that at work her co worker had actually started crying because someone was walking into the store and ignoring her. She told me she thought people who walked into the store and didn\u2019t want to talk, were assholes (personally whenever that happened at work I was relieved but I\u2019m weird) and that everyone thinks you\u2019re an asshole when you do that .\n\nI realised I had been walking through that same store almost daily and chances are I had completely zoned out someone who I wasn\u2019t aware wanted to talk to me and I must of looked like some asshole who thought I was to important to talk to a retail employee. I probably ignored a couple of people and made them feel like that but at the same time I should be able to get a packet of crisps without being uncomfortable.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n(PS: please be nice to people in retail, it\u2019s a tough job and they don\u2019t get paid enough to deal with assholes)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong for wearing headphones in the store. Let me break down the context.\n\nThe author is a 20-year-old female with severe social anxiety, depression, and high-functioning autism. She got high-quality headphones as a Christmas gift from her grandpa. She uses them to cope with public noise and social interactions, especially during her 50-minute walk to work. She's been wearing them in stores, using self-checkout, and it helps her not get overwhelmed. However, a friend mentioned a co-worker who was upset because someone ignored them by wearing headphones. The author is worried she might have done this and made people feel like she's an asshole. The question is whether she's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's reasons. She has valid mental health issues that make social interactions stressful. Using headphones is a coping mechanism, which is understandable. The stores she shops at have self-checkout, so maybe she's trying to minimize interaction. On the other hand, people in retail might feel ignored if a customer is using headphones and not engaging. But is it fair to expect her to interact just because she's wearing headphones?\n\nI think the key points here are her mental health needs versus the potential impact on others. She's not trying to be rude, but her actions might be perceived that way. However, she's using a necessary tool to manage her anxiety. Also, she's aware of her actions and is apologizing, which shows consideration. The stores she goes to have self-checkout, so maybe she's not avoiding necessary interactions. It's a balance between her need for comfort and others' feelings. I think the answer is B (not in the wrong) because her actions are a necessary coping strategy for her conditions, and she's not intentionally being rude. However, she could be mindful to maybe make an effort if she needs to interact, but the question is about being in the wrong, not just about improving.\n"
