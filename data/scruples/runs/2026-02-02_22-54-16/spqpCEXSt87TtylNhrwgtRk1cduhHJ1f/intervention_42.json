I was expecting a cheap pair of \u00a315 headphones or something but to my surprise, my grandpa generously surprised me with a brand new pair of ultraviolet beats solo3. I love them and I promised myself that I wouldn\u2019t let his money go to waste and I would get as much use out of them as possible.\n\n*Context over, here\u2019s the important stuff*:\n\nI wear these headphones just about everywhere I can get away with because noisy places in public overwhelm me and it\u2019s nice to have something muffle the sound. Also, it\u2019s always nice to have a distraction whenever being around people is too much.\n\nI\u2019ve started walking these into stores and just wearing them, zoning out all of the people talking. It makes something that is normally stressful into a breeze. I only ever shop at stores  with self checkouts available, so I didn\u2019t think it was a problem.\n \nHowever, a friend mentioned to me that at work her co worker had actually started crying because someone was walking into the store and ignoring her. She told me she thought people who walked into the store and didn\u2019t want to talk, were assholes (personally whenever that happened at work I was relieved but I\u2019m weird) and that everyone thinks you\u2019re an asshole when you do that .\n\nI realised I had been walking through that same store almost daily and chances are I had completely zoned out someone who I wasn\u2019t aware wanted to talk to me and I must of looked like some asshole who thought I was to important to talk to a retail employee. I probably ignored a couple of people and made them feel like that but at the same time I should be able to get a packet of crisps without being uncomfortable.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n(PS: please be nice to people in retail, it\u2019s a tough job and they don\u2019t get paid enough to deal with assholes)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wearing headphones in a store. The author has social anxiety, depression, and autism, which makes public interactions stressful. She uses headphones to cope with noise and avoid social interactions, especially in places like stores with self-checkout. Her friend mentioned that someone cried because she ignored them, and others might perceive her as an asshole for not engaging. \n\nFirst, consider the author's reasons. Her mental health conditions contribute to her need for sensory coping mechanisms. Headphones are a tool to reduce sensory overload and anxiety. This is a valid use for many people with similar conditions.\n\nThen, the social aspect. The friend's coworker felt ignored, which is a valid concern. However, the author didn't intentionally ignore anyone. She might not be aware of others trying to interact, especially if she's using headphones. The stores she visits have self-checkout, suggesting she's trying to minimize interaction where possible, which is a reasonable strategy for her comfort.\n\nIs there a wrong here? On one hand, she's managing her mental health. On the other, others might feel slighted. But the author isn't being rude intentionally. She's taking steps to handle her anxiety, and the stores allow self-checkout, which implies they accommodate those who prefer less interaction. The key is that she didn't actively harm anyone\u2014she's using a personal coping tool. The friend's coworker's reaction is unfortunate, but the author isn't at fault for needing to use headphones to cope. Retail employees have tough jobs, but the author's actions don't make her an asshole; she's trying to navigate a challenging environment with her mental health needs in mind.\n\nSo, the answer is B\u2014she's not in the wrong.\n"
