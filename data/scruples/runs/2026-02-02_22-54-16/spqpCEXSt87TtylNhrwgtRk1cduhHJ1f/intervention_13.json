I was expecting a cheap pair of \u00a315 headphones or something but to my surprise, my grandpa generously surprised me with a brand new pair of ultraviolet beats solo3. I love them and I promised myself that I wouldn\u2019t let his money go to waste and I would get as much use out of them as possible.\n\n*Context over, here\u2019s the important stuff*:\n\nI wear these headphones just about everywhere I can get away with because noisy places in public overwhelm me and it\u2019s nice to have something muffle the sound. Also, it\u2019s always nice to have a distraction whenever being around people is too much.\n\nI\u2019ve started walking these into stores and just wearing them, zoning out all of the people talking. It makes something that is normally stressful into a breeze. I only ever shop at stores  with self checkouts available, so I didn\u2019t think it was a problem.\n \nHowever, a friend mentioned to me that at work her co worker had actually started crying because someone was walking into the store and ignoring her. She told me she thought people who walked into the store and didn\u2019t want to talk, were assholes (personally whenever that happened at work I was relieved but I\u2019m weird) and that everyone thinks you\u2019re an asshole when you do that .\n\nI realised I had been walking through that same store almost daily and chances are I had completely zoned out someone who I wasn\u2019t aware wanted to talk to me and I must of looked like some asshole who thought I was to important to talk to a retail employee. I probably ignored a couple of people and made them feel like that but at the same time I should be able to get a packet of crisps without being uncomfortable.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n(PS: please be nice to people in retail, it\u2019s a tough job and they don\u2019t get paid enough to deal with assholes)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for wearing headphones in the store. The author has social anxiety, depression, and high functioning autism, so she uses headphones to cope with public interactions. Her grandpa gave her expensive headphones, and she uses them everywhere, including stores with self-checkout. A friend mentioned that someone was upset because she ignored a retail worker, making her wonder if she's being an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context of her mental health conditions. People with social anxiety and autism often find public interactions overwhelming. Using headphones to manage that seems like a coping mechanism, which is understandable. It's important to validate her need for comfort, especially given her diagnosed conditions.\n\nHowever, the other side is the perspective of the retail employees. If she's in a store where employees might approach her (like asking if they can help), wearing headphones could be seen as dismissive. Even if she didn't mean to ignore them, it might come off that way. But she only shops at self-checkout stores, so maybe she's not expecting interaction. Still, there might be other staff she encounters.\n\nThe key points are intent vs. perception. She didn't intend to ignore anyone but her actions might have that effect. But given her reasons (mental health), is it fair to call her an asshole? The friend's co-worker's reaction is a valid concern, but the author is also trying to manage her anxiety. There's a balance between her right to feel comfortable and others' feelings. The author is also empathetic to retail workers, as seen in her PS, so she's not intentionally being rude.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the judgment often depends on whether the person's actions were thoughtless despite knowing they might hurt others. Here, she was unaware of the impact until her friend mentioned it. Now, she's reflecting and concerned about it. So maybe she's not in the wrong because she's taking steps to be mindful and she uses the headphones for a valid reason. The answer is likely B (No), as her actions are a result of her mental health needs and she's not deliberately being inconsiderate, though she might need to be more aware.\n"
