I was expecting a cheap pair of \u00a315 headphones or something but to my surprise, my grandpa generously surprised me with a brand new pair of ultraviolet beats solo3. I love them and I promised myself that I wouldn\u2019t let his money go to waste and I would get as much use out of them as possible.\n\n*Context over, here\u2019s the important stuff*:\n\nI wear these headphones just about everywhere I can get away with because noisy places in public overwhelm me and it\u2019s nice to have something muffle the sound. Also, it\u2019s always nice to have a distraction whenever being around people is too much.\n\nI\u2019ve started walking these into stores and just wearing them, zoning out all of the people talking. It makes something that is normally stressful into a breeze. I only ever shop at stores  with self checkouts available, so I didn\u2019t think it was a problem.\n \nHowever, a friend mentioned to me that at work her co worker had actually started crying because someone was walking into the store and ignoring her. She told me she thought people who walked into the store and didn\u2019t want to talk, were assholes (personally whenever that happened at work I was relieved but I\u2019m weird) and that everyone thinks you\u2019re an asshole when you do that .\n\nI realised I had been walking through that same store almost daily and chances are I had completely zoned out someone who I wasn\u2019t aware wanted to talk to me and I must of looked like some asshole who thought I was to important to talk to a retail employee. I probably ignored a couple of people and made them feel like that but at the same time I should be able to get a packet of crisps without being uncomfortable.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n(PS: please be nice to people in retail, it\u2019s a tough job and they don\u2019t get paid enough to deal with assholes)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this \"Am I the Asshole?\" story is in the wrong. The author is a 20-year-old woman with severe social anxiety, depression, and high-functioning autism. She got high-end headphones for Christmas and uses them in public, including in stores, to cope with sensory overload and social interactions. The main issue is that she's been going into the same store daily with headphones on, and a friend mentioned that a coworker cried because someone (possibly the author) ignored them. The friend considers such people as assholes, but the author feels it's necessary for her mental health.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context of her mental health conditions. Social anxiety and autism can make social interactions really challenging. Using headphones to block out noise and avoid engaging with others in stressful environments is a common coping mechanism. The store in question has self-checkouts, so maybe she's not avoiding human interaction at the register, which is a bit of a compromise.\n\nNow, the friend's coworker was hurt by being ignored. That's a valid emotion. But is the author at fault here? She wasn't intentionally ignoring people. She's using the headphones to manage her anxiety, not to be rude. The coworker might have felt ignored because the author was listening to music and not making eye contact, but the author's intention wasn't to be dismissive. \n\nOn the other hand, some people might feel that in a retail environment, especially when dealing with employees, there's an expectation of some level of acknowledgment. If someone approaches her, maybe taking a moment to respond or smile could help. But the key here is the author's lack of awareness. She didn't realize that her presence was making others feel that way. \n\nIt's important to balance the employee's feelings with the author's need to manage her mental health. Retail jobs can be tough, and employees might feel undervalued if customers don't engage. However, the author's actions are a result of her conditions, not malice. \n\nSo, the answer hinges on intent. If she's not intentionally ignoring people but using headphones to cope, then she's not in the wrong. The challenge is finding a middle ground where she can protect her mental health without making others feel dismissed. Maybe she could try removing the headphones when entering the store to signal awareness, but that's a suggestion rather than a judgment. Given the circumstances, the answer is B\u2014she's not in the wrong.\n"
