I was expecting a cheap pair of \u00a315 headphones or something but to my surprise, my grandpa generously surprised me with a brand new pair of ultraviolet beats solo3. I love them and I promised myself that I wouldn\u2019t let his money go to waste and I would get as much use out of them as possible.\n\n*Context over, here\u2019s the important stuff*:\n\nI wear these headphones just about everywhere I can get away with because noisy places in public overwhelm me and it\u2019s nice to have something muffle the sound. Also, it\u2019s always nice to have a distraction whenever being around people is too much.\n\nI\u2019ve started walking these into stores and just wearing them, zoning out all of the people talking. It makes something that is normally stressful into a breeze. I only ever shop at stores  with self checkouts available, so I didn\u2019t think it was a problem.\n \nHowever, a friend mentioned to me that at work her co worker had actually started crying because someone was walking into the store and ignoring her. She told me she thought people who walked into the store and didn\u2019t want to talk, were assholes (personally whenever that happened at work I was relieved but I\u2019m weird) and that everyone thinks you\u2019re an asshole when you do that .\n\nI realised I had been walking through that same store almost daily and chances are I had completely zoned out someone who I wasn\u2019t aware wanted to talk to me and I must of looked like some asshole who thought I was to important to talk to a retail employee. I probably ignored a couple of people and made them feel like that but at the same time I should be able to get a packet of crisps without being uncomfortable.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n(PS: please be nice to people in retail, it\u2019s a tough job and they don\u2019t get paid enough to deal with assholes)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wearing headphones in the store. The author has severe social anxiety, depression, and high functioning autism. She got the headphones as a Christmas gift from her grandpa and uses them to cope with public spaces, especially during her 50-minute walk to work. She wears them in stores with self-checkouts to avoid the stress of interactions.\n\nHer friend mentioned a co-worker crying because someone ignored them, and the author is worried she might have done the same. The question is if she's being an asshole by doing this.\n\nHmm. First, the author has valid reasons related to her mental health. People with social anxiety or autism might find loud or busy environments overwhelming. Using headphones to manage that is a common coping strategy. Retail employees often have tough jobs and might want to engage with customers, but the author isn't interacting on purpose. She's using self-checkout, so maybe she's avoiding the employee interactions by design. \n\nBut there's the other side: if a retail employee tries to help her and she's not responding because she's in her headphones, that could be seen as rude. The key point is whether she's being intentionally dismissive. The author says she didn't think it was a problem because she's using self-checkout, implying she's not expecting to interact with employees. However, in case she needs assistance, she might be ignoring someone who's trying to talk to her. \n\nThe author does acknowledge the possibility of having ignored people, which shows some awareness. She also mentions that she's not trying to be important but is using the headphones to manage her anxiety. The PS even shows she's considerate of retail workers. \n\nSo, while her actions might be unintentional and stemming from genuine needs, there's a potential to be inconsiderate if employees tried to engage her and she didn't respond. But given her circumstances, is she at fault? It's a balance between her well-being and the employees' job requirements. Since she's not actively ignoring, but using headphones to cope, and the stores have self-checkout, maybe she's not in the wrong. However, maybe she should be more mindful of employees approaching her. But the question is if she's in the wrong overall. I think the answer is B, not in the wrong, because her actions are for managing her mental health, and she's not intentionally being rude. The stores have self-checkout, so perhaps the employees aren't expecting her to interact. Also, the friend's co-worker might have been overly sensitive or the author's presence in the store with headphones didn't actually prevent necessary interactions. So, I lean towards B.\n"
