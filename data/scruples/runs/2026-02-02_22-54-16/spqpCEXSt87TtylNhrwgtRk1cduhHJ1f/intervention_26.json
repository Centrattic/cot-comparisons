I was expecting a cheap pair of \u00a315 headphones or something but to my surprise, my grandpa generously surprised me with a brand new pair of ultraviolet beats solo3. I love them and I promised myself that I wouldn\u2019t let his money go to waste and I would get as much use out of them as possible.\n\n*Context over, here\u2019s the important stuff*:\n\nI wear these headphones just about everywhere I can get away with because noisy places in public overwhelm me and it\u2019s nice to have something muffle the sound. Also, it\u2019s always nice to have a distraction whenever being around people is too much.\n\nI\u2019ve started walking these into stores and just wearing them, zoning out all of the people talking. It makes something that is normally stressful into a breeze. I only ever shop at stores  with self checkouts available, so I didn\u2019t think it was a problem.\n \nHowever, a friend mentioned to me that at work her co worker had actually started crying because someone was walking into the store and ignoring her. She told me she thought people who walked into the store and didn\u2019t want to talk, were assholes (personally whenever that happened at work I was relieved but I\u2019m weird) and that everyone thinks you\u2019re an asshole when you do that .\n\nI realised I had been walking through that same store almost daily and chances are I had completely zoned out someone who I wasn\u2019t aware wanted to talk to me and I must of looked like some asshole who thought I was to important to talk to a retail employee. I probably ignored a couple of people and made them feel like that but at the same time I should be able to get a packet of crisps without being uncomfortable.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n(PS: please be nice to people in retail, it\u2019s a tough job and they don\u2019t get paid enough to deal with assholes)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wearing headphones in the store. The author has social anxiety, depression, and autism, which is context important. They wear headphones to cope with public noise and stress, especially in stores with self-checkout. They were surprised by a friend's comment about a coworker being upset because someone ignored them. The author is worried they might have hurt someone's feelings by not engaging, but they need this coping mechanism.\n\nFirst, I should consider the author's mental health. They have valid reasons for needing the headphones. Using them as a coping strategy isn't malicious. The main issue is whether it's inconsiderate. However, stores with self-checkout might be less interaction-heavy. The author isn't avoiding interaction out of arrogance but necessity. The friend's coworker crying seems like an extreme reaction, but maybe the coworker was trying to engage and felt ignored. Still, the author isn't obligated to interact. Retail employees often deal with difficult customers, and maybe the coworker took it personally. The author's PS at the end shows they're considerate of retail workers, so they're not trying to be an asshole. Balancing the need for personal space against others' feelings, but given the author's mental health, it's reasonable. So the answer is B.\n"
