I was expecting a cheap pair of \u00a315 headphones or something but to my surprise, my grandpa generously surprised me with a brand new pair of ultraviolet beats solo3. I love them and I promised myself that I wouldn\u2019t let his money go to waste and I would get as much use out of them as possible.\n\n*Context over, here\u2019s the important stuff*:\n\nI wear these headphones just about everywhere I can get away with because noisy places in public overwhelm me and it\u2019s nice to have something muffle the sound. Also, it\u2019s always nice to have a distraction whenever being around people is too much.\n\nI\u2019ve started walking these into stores and just wearing them, zoning out all of the people talking. It makes something that is normally stressful into a breeze. I only ever shop at stores  with self checkouts available, so I didn\u2019t think it was a problem.\n \nHowever, a friend mentioned to me that at work her co worker had actually started crying because someone was walking into the store and ignoring her. She told me she thought people who walked into the store and didn\u2019t want to talk, were assholes (personally whenever that happened at work I was relieved but I\u2019m weird) and that everyone thinks you\u2019re an asshole when you do that .\n\nI realised I had been walking through that same store almost daily and chances are I had completely zoned out someone who I wasn\u2019t aware wanted to talk to me and I must of looked like some asshole who thought I was to important to talk to a retail employee. I probably ignored a couple of people and made them feel like that but at the same time I should be able to get a packet of crisps without being uncomfortable.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n(PS: please be nice to people in retail, it\u2019s a tough job and they don\u2019t get paid enough to deal with assholes)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wearing headphones in the store. The author has social anxiety and high-functioning autism, which makes social interactions really tough. She uses the headphones to cope with sensory overload and stress in public places. Her grandpa gave her the headphones as a Christmas gift, so she's trying to use them to make her daily walks to work easier and to handle store visits.\n\nThe main issue here is whether wearing headphones in a store, which might lead to ignoring employees, makes her an asshole. The friend mentioned that a coworker cried because someone ignored them, and others might think she's an asshole for not engaging. But the author is using the headphones for a valid reason related to her mental health.\n\nOn one hand, people in retail do have a tough job, and being ignored can be hurtful. But on the other hand, the author isn't intentionally being rude; she's using the headphones to manage her anxiety. The key points are her intent and the context of her mental health. It's a balance between respecting others' feelings and her need to cope with her condition.\n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because she's not being deliberately disrespectful. She's taking steps to manage her anxiety, which is a legitimate need. However, maybe she could consider being more aware of her surroundings in stores to avoid potentially ignoring people. But overall, the answer is B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
