I was expecting a cheap pair of \u00a315 headphones or something but to my surprise, my grandpa generously surprised me with a brand new pair of ultraviolet beats solo3. I love them and I promised myself that I wouldn\u2019t let his money go to waste and I would get as much use out of them as possible.\n\n*Context over, here\u2019s the important stuff*:\n\nI wear these headphones just about everywhere I can get away with because noisy places in public overwhelm me and it\u2019s nice to have something muffle the sound. Also, it\u2019s always nice to have a distraction whenever being around people is too much.\n\nI\u2019ve started walking these into stores and just wearing them, zoning out all of the people talking. It makes something that is normally stressful into a breeze. I only ever shop at stores  with self checkouts available, so I didn\u2019t think it was a problem.\n \nHowever, a friend mentioned to me that at work her co worker had actually started crying because someone was walking into the store and ignoring her. She told me she thought people who walked into the store and didn\u2019t want to talk, were assholes (personally whenever that happened at work I was relieved but I\u2019m weird) and that everyone thinks you\u2019re an asshole when you do that .\n\nI realised I had been walking through that same store almost daily and chances are I had completely zoned out someone who I wasn\u2019t aware wanted to talk to me and I must of looked like some asshole who thought I was to important to talk to a retail employee. I probably ignored a couple of people and made them feel like that but at the same time I should be able to get a packet of crisps without being uncomfortable.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n(PS: please be nice to people in retail, it\u2019s a tough job and they don\u2019t get paid enough to deal with assholes)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for wearing headphones in the store.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author has social anxiety, depression, and high functioning autism. She uses headphones to manage sensory overload and to cope with social interactions. She shops at stores with self-checkout, so she's not avoiding interaction by using that method. Her friend mentioned that a coworker cried because someone ignored them, leading her to worry she might have done the same.\n\nNow, considering her mental health conditions, using headphones is a legitimate coping mechanism. She's not trying to be rude; she's managing her own needs. However, the question is whether it's wrong to do so in public spaces. The key points are her intent and the potential impact on others.\n\nIn public places, people have different expectations. Some might feel ignored if they try to interact and aren't acknowledged. But the author isn't interacting with others, and if there's no attempt to communicate, maybe she isn't at fault. Also, the stores she uses have self-checkout, so she's not avoiding necessary interactions. The friend's comment about the coworker crying is a red flag, but it's not clear if the author was actually approached or if she was just present with headphones on.\n\nThe author is also empathetic, acknowledging that people in retail jobs are underpaid and shouldn't be treated poorly. She's concerned about others' feelings but uses the headphones for her own well-being. Given her circumstances, it's a balance between her needs and others' expectations. However, she's using a valid method to manage her health, which is important. Unless she was directly ignoring someone who tried to engage her, which isn't stated, she's not necessarily in the wrong. It's a matter of personal boundaries and public behavior. So the answer would lean towards B, not in the wrong.\n"
