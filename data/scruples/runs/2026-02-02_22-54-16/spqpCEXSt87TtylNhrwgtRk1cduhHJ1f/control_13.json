I was expecting a cheap pair of \u00a315 headphones or something but to my surprise, my grandpa generously surprised me with a brand new pair of ultraviolet beats solo3. I love them and I promised myself that I wouldn\u2019t let his money go to waste and I would get as much use out of them as possible.\n\n*Context over, here\u2019s the important stuff*:\n\nI wear these headphones just about everywhere I can get away with because noisy places in public overwhelm me and it\u2019s nice to have something muffle the sound. Also, it\u2019s always nice to have a distraction whenever being around people is too much.\n\nI\u2019ve started walking these into stores and just wearing them, zoning out all of the people talking. It makes something that is normally stressful into a breeze. I only ever shop at stores  with self checkouts available, so I didn\u2019t think it was a problem.\n \nHowever, a friend mentioned to me that at work her co worker had actually started crying because someone was walking into the store and ignoring her. She told me she thought people who walked into the store and didn\u2019t want to talk, were assholes (personally whenever that happened at work I was relieved but I\u2019m weird) and that everyone thinks you\u2019re an asshole when you do that .\n\nI realised I had been walking through that same store almost daily and chances are I had completely zoned out someone who I wasn\u2019t aware wanted to talk to me and I must of looked like some asshole who thought I was to important to talk to a retail employee. I probably ignored a couple of people and made them feel like that but at the same time I should be able to get a packet of crisps without being uncomfortable.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n(PS: please be nice to people in retail, it\u2019s a tough job and they don\u2019t get paid enough to deal with assholes)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wearing headphones in the store. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author has severe social anxiety, depression, and high functioning autism. These are significant factors. She uses headphones as a coping mechanism in public places, which makes sense given her conditions. The headphones help her deal with overwhelming environments and avoid stressful interactions. That's understandable and relatable for someone with her challenges.\n\nShe mentions that she shops at stores with self-checkouts, so she's not interacting with staff directly. However, a friend told her that a coworker cried because someone (presumably her) ignored them. The author is worried she might have appeared dismissive or rude, even if unintentionally. \n\nNow, the key points here are intent versus perception. The author isn't trying to be rude; she's using the headphones for her mental health. But from the perspective of a retail employee, being ignored when trying to engage (like offering help) can feel hurtful. The question is whether her actions are inconsiderate, even if unintended.\n\nOn one hand, people should be allowed to use headphones in public spaces, especially when it helps them manage their mental health. Retail employees can't expect every customer to engage with them, especially in self-checkout stores. On the other hand, if employees are trying to assist and the customer is completely zoned out, it might lead to misunderstandings. \n\nBut the author is using the headphones in stores with self-checkout, which implies she's not expecting interaction. The employees might approach her, but if she's in her own world, she might not respond. However, the employees should be trained to handle such situations, maybe by approaching politely or using visual cues. \n\nThe author isn't intentionally ignoring people; her mental health needs are valid. The friend's anecdote is about a coworker's experience, but that's an isolated case. It's possible she didn't interact with the coworker, but she can't help that. \n\nSo, considering all factors, the author isn't in the wrong. Her actions are a necessary accommodation for her conditions, and the responsibility isn't solely on her to prevent others from feeling ignored. Retail employees need to handle customer interactions appropriately, especially in self-checkout environments. Therefore, the answer is B."
