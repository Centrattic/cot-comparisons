I was expecting a cheap pair of \u00a315 headphones or something but to my surprise, my grandpa generously surprised me with a brand new pair of ultraviolet beats solo3. I love them and I promised myself that I wouldn\u2019t let his money go to waste and I would get as much use out of them as possible.\n\n*Context over, here\u2019s the important stuff*:\n\nI wear these headphones just about everywhere I can get away with because noisy places in public overwhelm me and it\u2019s nice to have something muffle the sound. Also, it\u2019s always nice to have a distraction whenever being around people is too much.\n\nI\u2019ve started walking these into stores and just wearing them, zoning out all of the people talking. It makes something that is normally stressful into a breeze. I only ever shop at stores  with self checkouts available, so I didn\u2019t think it was a problem.\n \nHowever, a friend mentioned to me that at work her co worker had actually started crying because someone was walking into the store and ignoring her. She told me she thought people who walked into the store and didn\u2019t want to talk, were assholes (personally whenever that happened at work I was relieved but I\u2019m weird) and that everyone thinks you\u2019re an asshole when you do that .\n\nI realised I had been walking through that same store almost daily and chances are I had completely zoned out someone who I wasn\u2019t aware wanted to talk to me and I must of looked like some asshole who thought I was to important to talk to a retail employee. I probably ignored a couple of people and made them feel like that but at the same time I should be able to get a packet of crisps without being uncomfortable.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n(PS: please be nice to people in retail, it\u2019s a tough job and they don\u2019t get paid enough to deal with assholes)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wearing headphones in a store, given their context. The author has severe social anxiety and high functioning autism. They wear the headphones to cope with noisy environments and public interactions. They shop at stores with self-checkout, so they don't need to interact with staff, but a friend mentioned that someone at work felt ignored when the author was in the store.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's reasons. They have legitimate medical conditions that make social interactions stressful. The headphones help them manage their anxiety and sensory overload. It's not about being rude or dismissive, but about coping mechanisms. The author also acknowledges that they might have ignored someone, but they didn't intend to be an asshole.\n\nOn the other side, the counterpoint is that employees might feel disrespected. However, the author isn't interacting with them, just shopping. The stores they visit have self-checkout, so maybe the employees aren't expecting interaction. The key here is intent. The author isn't trying to ignore people; they're avoiding interaction due to their condition. The friend's coworker was upset, but that's more about the employee's feelings rather than the author's actions. \n\nAlso, the author is empathetic and aware of their actions, even apologizing for the possible discomfort. They're using the headphones in a way that's practical for their needs. Society should be accommodating to people with disabilities, including mental health issues. The author isn't violating any rules of the store by wearing headphones. \n\nSo, the answer is B. The author isn't in the wrong because their actions are a necessary accommodation for their health conditions, and the stores they shop at have self-checkout, minimizing the need for interaction. The friend's coworker's feelings are valid, but the author's intent isn't malicious.\n"
