I was expecting a cheap pair of \u00a315 headphones or something but to my surprise, my grandpa generously surprised me with a brand new pair of ultraviolet beats solo3. I love them and I promised myself that I wouldn\u2019t let his money go to waste and I would get as much use out of them as possible.\n\n*Context over, here\u2019s the important stuff*:\n\nI wear these headphones just about everywhere I can get away with because noisy places in public overwhelm me and it\u2019s nice to have something muffle the sound. Also, it\u2019s always nice to have a distraction whenever being around people is too much.\n\nI\u2019ve started walking these into stores and just wearing them, zoning out all of the people talking. It makes something that is normally stressful into a breeze. I only ever shop at stores  with self checkouts available, so I didn\u2019t think it was a problem.\n \nHowever, a friend mentioned to me that at work her co worker had actually started crying because someone was walking into the store and ignoring her. She told me she thought people who walked into the store and didn\u2019t want to talk, were assholes (personally whenever that happened at work I was relieved but I\u2019m weird) and that everyone thinks you\u2019re an asshole when you do that .\n\nI realised I had been walking through that same store almost daily and chances are I had completely zoned out someone who I wasn\u2019t aware wanted to talk to me and I must of looked like some asshole who thought I was to important to talk to a retail employee. I probably ignored a couple of people and made them feel like that but at the same time I should be able to get a packet of crisps without being uncomfortable.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n(PS: please be nice to people in retail, it\u2019s a tough job and they don\u2019t get paid enough to deal with assholes)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the person in this situation is in the wrong for wearing headphones in a store. Let me read through the scenario again.\n\nThe author is a 20-year-old woman with severe social anxiety, depression, and high-functioning autism. She got high-quality headphones as a Christmas gift from her grandpa and uses them to cope with the stress of public places, especially during her long walk to work. She wears them in stores with self-checkouts to avoid overwhelming social interactions. However, a friend mentioned that a coworker cried when someone ignored them by not engaging in conversation. The author is now worried she might have made others feel that way but wants to know if she's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context of her mental health. People with social anxiety and autism often find social interactions challenging and draining. Using headphones to create a sense of personal space and reduce sensory overload is a common coping mechanism. The stores she visits have self-checkouts, implying she's aware of where to go without needing to interact.\n\nThe friend's comment suggests that some retail employees might feel ignored if customers don't acknowledge them. But the author isn't interacting because she's using headphones, not because she's being intentionally rude. Retail employees might expect some basic interaction, like a greeting or a nod, but if she's just focused on her shopping and using self-checkouts, maybe that's not the case. However, the key issue is whether her actions are unreasonably affecting others.\n\nI should think about societal norms. In many places, wearing headphones in public is acceptable as long as you can still interact if needed. Since she's in stores that have self-checkouts, she's choosing environments where minimal interaction is possible. The employees she might have ignored could have been trying to engage her, but maybe that's not necessary unless she's buying something that requires assistance. If she's just grabbing items and using self-checkout, perhaps she doesn't need to interact.\n\nBut there's a balance. If she's in a store and someone is trying to help her, ignoring them could be seen as impolite. The question is whether she's actually ignoring people who need her attention or just not engaging in small talk. The author mentions she uses them to \"zone out all of the people talking,\" which might mean she's not responding to anyone, even if approached. That could be problematic if someone is trying to assist her. However, if she's just avoiding unnecessary interactions and using self-checkout, then maybe it's reasonable.\n\nAlso, the author's note at the end shows she's considerate of retail workers, so her intention isn't to be an asshole. The problem arises from the employees' perspective, thinking they're being ignored. But the author's mental health condition is a valid reason for needing to avoid interactions. It's a matter of personal necessity vs. social expectations. \n\nIn such cases, people often use headphones to signal they're not in the mood for conversation. However, it's important to remain aware of one's surroundings and be capable of engaging if needed. If she's in a situation where she needs help and can't ask because of the headphones, that's a problem. But if she's just using them to cope with noise and not expecting to interact, then it's her way of managing her anxiety. \n\nThe stores she's visiting have self-checkouts, so she's making a conscious choice to go there to minimize interaction. That seems reasonable. The employees might not have approached her for help if they saw she was using self-checkout, unless there was an issue. However, the friend's coworker's reaction implies that the employee might have felt disrespected or ignored. But the author's actions are driven by her need to manage her mental health, not to be dismissive.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. She's using the headphones for a legitimate reason and choosing stores that accommodate her need for less interaction. The employees' feelings are valid, but the author's mental health condition is a significant factor. The answer would be B, No.\n"
