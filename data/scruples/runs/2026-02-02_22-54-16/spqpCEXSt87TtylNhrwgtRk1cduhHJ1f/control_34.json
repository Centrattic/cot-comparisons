I was expecting a cheap pair of \u00a315 headphones or something but to my surprise, my grandpa generously surprised me with a brand new pair of ultraviolet beats solo3. I love them and I promised myself that I wouldn\u2019t let his money go to waste and I would get as much use out of them as possible.\n\n*Context over, here\u2019s the important stuff*:\n\nI wear these headphones just about everywhere I can get away with because noisy places in public overwhelm me and it\u2019s nice to have something muffle the sound. Also, it\u2019s always nice to have a distraction whenever being around people is too much.\n\nI\u2019ve started walking these into stores and just wearing them, zoning out all of the people talking. It makes something that is normally stressful into a breeze. I only ever shop at stores  with self checkouts available, so I didn\u2019t think it was a problem.\n \nHowever, a friend mentioned to me that at work her co worker had actually started crying because someone was walking into the store and ignoring her. She told me she thought people who walked into the store and didn\u2019t want to talk, were assholes (personally whenever that happened at work I was relieved but I\u2019m weird) and that everyone thinks you\u2019re an asshole when you do that .\n\nI realised I had been walking through that same store almost daily and chances are I had completely zoned out someone who I wasn\u2019t aware wanted to talk to me and I must of looked like some asshole who thought I was to important to talk to a retail employee. I probably ignored a couple of people and made them feel like that but at the same time I should be able to get a packet of crisps without being uncomfortable.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n(PS: please be nice to people in retail, it\u2019s a tough job and they don\u2019t get paid enough to deal with assholes)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wearing headphones in stores. The author has social anxiety, depression, and autism, and she uses the headphones to cope with public spaces. She's worried that by wearing them, she might be ignoring people, especially retail employees, and making them feel disrespected. Her friend mentioned that someone cried because of this.\n\nFirst, I need to consider her reasons. She has valid mental health issues that make social interactions stressful. Using headphones to manage sensory overload is a common coping strategy. But there's a social expectation that when you're in a store, you should be available to help others or at least not appear dismissive. Retail workers might feel that customers ignoring them are being rude, which could affect their job performance and morale.\n\nOn the other hand, the author isn't trying to be an asshole. She's managing her own mental health. The key here is whether she's wrong in prioritizing her well-being, even if it might inconvenience others. The question is about whether she's in the wrong, not if there's a perfect solution.\n\nThe friend's coworker's reaction is a point in favor of considering others' feelings. However, the author isn't refusing help; she's just not engaging. It's a fine line between self-care and considerate behavior. The answer might depend on whether her actions are seen as neglectful or if her mental health needs justify it. Since she's not causing direct harm but might be making others uncomfortable, maybe the answer isn't straightforward. But in the context of the subreddit, the community often emphasizes empathy for mental health struggles. So, perhaps she's not in the wrong.\n"
