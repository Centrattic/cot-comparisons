I was expecting a cheap pair of \u00a315 headphones or something but to my surprise, my grandpa generously surprised me with a brand new pair of ultraviolet beats solo3. I love them and I promised myself that I wouldn\u2019t let his money go to waste and I would get as much use out of them as possible.\n\n*Context over, here\u2019s the important stuff*:\n\nI wear these headphones just about everywhere I can get away with because noisy places in public overwhelm me and it\u2019s nice to have something muffle the sound. Also, it\u2019s always nice to have a distraction whenever being around people is too much.\n\nI\u2019ve started walking these into stores and just wearing them, zoning out all of the people talking. It makes something that is normally stressful into a breeze. I only ever shop at stores  with self checkouts available, so I didn\u2019t think it was a problem.\n \nHowever, a friend mentioned to me that at work her co worker had actually started crying because someone was walking into the store and ignoring her. She told me she thought people who walked into the store and didn\u2019t want to talk, were assholes (personally whenever that happened at work I was relieved but I\u2019m weird) and that everyone thinks you\u2019re an asshole when you do that .\n\nI realised I had been walking through that same store almost daily and chances are I had completely zoned out someone who I wasn\u2019t aware wanted to talk to me and I must of looked like some asshole who thought I was to important to talk to a retail employee. I probably ignored a couple of people and made them feel like that but at the same time I should be able to get a packet of crisps without being uncomfortable.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n(PS: please be nice to people in retail, it\u2019s a tough job and they don\u2019t get paid enough to deal with assholes)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about wearing headphones in stores and possibly ignoring people. The person has social anxiety, depression, and high-functioning autism, which makes social interactions really tough for them. They were given nice headphones and use them to manage stress in public places.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether wearing headphones and not engaging with others in the store is considered rude or inconsiderate. The friend mentioned a coworker crying because someone ignored them, which makes the author worry they might have done the same. But the author explains that they aren't trying to be dismissive, just coping with their own anxiety.\n\nI think the key here is intent versus perception. The author isn't being intentionally rude; they have a legitimate need to manage their mental health. However, others might feel ignored or disrespected if approached while the person is clearly not paying attention. The stores they go to have self-checkout, so maybe interactions are minimal, but there could be instances where employees need to assist them.\n\nThe question is whether the author's actions are considered inconsiderate. On one hand, using headphones is a common way people block out noise. On the other hand, if someone approaches them for help and they don't respond, that could be problematic. The author isn't doing it to be an asshole, but their actions might be misinterpreted.\n\nI think the answer isn't a straightforward yes or no. The author has a valid reason for wearing headphones, but there's a possibility they've inadvertently hurt someone's feelings. However, given their mental health context, they aren't in the wrong. They should be understanding of others' feelings too, maybe by being aware of their presence or offering a quick acknowledgment if someone approaches. But the main wrongdoing here isn't clear. So probably, the answer is B (not in the wrong).\n"
