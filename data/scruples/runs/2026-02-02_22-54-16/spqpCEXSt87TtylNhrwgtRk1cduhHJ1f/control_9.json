I was expecting a cheap pair of \u00a315 headphones or something but to my surprise, my grandpa generously surprised me with a brand new pair of ultraviolet beats solo3. I love them and I promised myself that I wouldn\u2019t let his money go to waste and I would get as much use out of them as possible.\n\n*Context over, here\u2019s the important stuff*:\n\nI wear these headphones just about everywhere I can get away with because noisy places in public overwhelm me and it\u2019s nice to have something muffle the sound. Also, it\u2019s always nice to have a distraction whenever being around people is too much.\n\nI\u2019ve started walking these into stores and just wearing them, zoning out all of the people talking. It makes something that is normally stressful into a breeze. I only ever shop at stores  with self checkouts available, so I didn\u2019t think it was a problem.\n \nHowever, a friend mentioned to me that at work her co worker had actually started crying because someone was walking into the store and ignoring her. She told me she thought people who walked into the store and didn\u2019t want to talk, were assholes (personally whenever that happened at work I was relieved but I\u2019m weird) and that everyone thinks you\u2019re an asshole when you do that .\n\nI realised I had been walking through that same store almost daily and chances are I had completely zoned out someone who I wasn\u2019t aware wanted to talk to me and I must of looked like some asshole who thought I was to important to talk to a retail employee. I probably ignored a couple of people and made them feel like that but at the same time I should be able to get a packet of crisps without being uncomfortable.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n(PS: please be nice to people in retail, it\u2019s a tough job and they don\u2019t get paid enough to deal with assholes)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for wearing headphones in the store. She has severe social anxiety and autism, which makes social interactions difficult. She uses the headphones to manage sensory overload and to cope with being around people. The friend mentioned that people might feel ignored if they try to talk to her, but she's not avoiding conversations intentionally. The key points here are her mental health conditions, the purpose of the headphones (self-care), and the context of the stores she visits (self-checkout, minimal interaction).\n\nFirst, consider social norms. In many places, wearing headphones in public is common, especially in retail. People might expect others to not approach someone with headphones on, similar to having a \"Do Not Disturb\" sign. However, there's a cultural aspect here. In some cultures, it's seen as rude to not acknowledge someone, even if you're wearing headphones. But given her conditions, she's using headphones as a necessary coping mechanism.\n\nHer conditions are legitimate and diagnosed. People with autism and social anxiety often need such accommodations. The key is whether her actions are considered inconsiderate. She's not ignoring employees to be rude but to manage her own well-being. However, there's a potential for others to feel dismissed if they try to engage her. The friend's coworker crying over being ignored is a valid concern, but does that mean she's the asshole?\n\nThe author acknowledges the possibility of making others feel ignored and is concerned about it. She's trying to balance her needs with being considerate. The stores she shops at have self-checkout, so direct interaction is minimal. Still, if an employee approaches her, she might not respond, which could be hurtful. But given her conditions, is she at fault? Or is the expectation unreasonable for someone with her needs?\n\nThe question also asks for a judgment on whether she's in the wrong. The answer options are A (yes) or B (no). Considering her mental health, the purpose of the headphones, and the context of self-checkout stores, it's more about her needing accommodations. The friend's perspective is valid, but the author isn't being intentionally rude. So the answer is B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
