I was expecting a cheap pair of \u00a315 headphones or something but to my surprise, my grandpa generously surprised me with a brand new pair of ultraviolet beats solo3. I love them and I promised myself that I wouldn\u2019t let his money go to waste and I would get as much use out of them as possible.\n\n*Context over, here\u2019s the important stuff*:\n\nI wear these headphones just about everywhere I can get away with because noisy places in public overwhelm me and it\u2019s nice to have something muffle the sound. Also, it\u2019s always nice to have a distraction whenever being around people is too much.\n\nI\u2019ve started walking these into stores and just wearing them, zoning out all of the people talking. It makes something that is normally stressful into a breeze. I only ever shop at stores  with self checkouts available, so I didn\u2019t think it was a problem.\n \nHowever, a friend mentioned to me that at work her co worker had actually started crying because someone was walking into the store and ignoring her. She told me she thought people who walked into the store and didn\u2019t want to talk, were assholes (personally whenever that happened at work I was relieved but I\u2019m weird) and that everyone thinks you\u2019re an asshole when you do that .\n\nI realised I had been walking through that same store almost daily and chances are I had completely zoned out someone who I wasn\u2019t aware wanted to talk to me and I must of looked like some asshole who thought I was to important to talk to a retail employee. I probably ignored a couple of people and made them feel like that but at the same time I should be able to get a packet of crisps without being uncomfortable.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n(PS: please be nice to people in retail, it\u2019s a tough job and they don\u2019t get paid enough to deal with assholes)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wearing headphones in stores. The author has severe social anxiety, depression, and high-functioning autism. She wears the expensive headphones given by her grandpa to cope with public spaces and avoid overwhelming social interactions. She uses self-checkout stores to minimize interaction.\n\nHer friend mentioned that a coworker cried when someone didn't engage, implying that not talking is seen as rude. The author is worried she might have ignored people, making them feel unimportant. However, her intention is to manage her mental health.\n\nSo, is she in the wrong? On one hand, not making eye contact or acknowledging others can be seen as dismissive. On the other hand, her mental health conditions justify her need for coping mechanisms. The key points are her intent vs. the perception of others. The question is whether her actions are socially acceptable given her circumstances.\n\nI think the answer is B because she's using headphones to manage a legitimate mental health issue. People might perceive it as rude, but she isn't intentionally being an asshole. Her actions are a personal coping strategy, not a deliberate slight. The responsibility isn't solely on her to accommodate others' expectations if it harms her well-being. Also, she's taking self-checkout to minimize interaction, showing she's trying to avoid inconvenience. So, she's not in the wrong.\n"
