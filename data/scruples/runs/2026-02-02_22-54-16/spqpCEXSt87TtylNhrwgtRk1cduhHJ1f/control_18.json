I was expecting a cheap pair of \u00a315 headphones or something but to my surprise, my grandpa generously surprised me with a brand new pair of ultraviolet beats solo3. I love them and I promised myself that I wouldn\u2019t let his money go to waste and I would get as much use out of them as possible.\n\n*Context over, here\u2019s the important stuff*:\n\nI wear these headphones just about everywhere I can get away with because noisy places in public overwhelm me and it\u2019s nice to have something muffle the sound. Also, it\u2019s always nice to have a distraction whenever being around people is too much.\n\nI\u2019ve started walking these into stores and just wearing them, zoning out all of the people talking. It makes something that is normally stressful into a breeze. I only ever shop at stores  with self checkouts available, so I didn\u2019t think it was a problem.\n \nHowever, a friend mentioned to me that at work her co worker had actually started crying because someone was walking into the store and ignoring her. She told me she thought people who walked into the store and didn\u2019t want to talk, were assholes (personally whenever that happened at work I was relieved but I\u2019m weird) and that everyone thinks you\u2019re an asshole when you do that .\n\nI realised I had been walking through that same store almost daily and chances are I had completely zoned out someone who I wasn\u2019t aware wanted to talk to me and I must of looked like some asshole who thought I was to important to talk to a retail employee. I probably ignored a couple of people and made them feel like that but at the same time I should be able to get a packet of crisps without being uncomfortable.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n(PS: please be nice to people in retail, it\u2019s a tough job and they don\u2019t get paid enough to deal with assholes)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The person is asking if they're the asshole for wearing headphones in stores. They have social anxiety and autism, which makes social interactions tough. The headphones help them cope with noise and avoid overwhelming situations. They mention that they only go to stores with self-checkout, so maybe they didn't think they'd need to interact with people as much. \n\nTheir friend heard a coworker crying because someone ignored them when entering the store. The author is worried they might have done that, making employees feel disrespected. The key points here are their mental health reasons for wearing headphones and the potential impact on retail workers.\n\nOn one hand, the author has valid reasons for needing the headphones. It's their way of managing mental health. But on the other hand, entering a store with headphones on might make employees feel ignored if they try to interact. The author didn't mean to ignore anyone, but their actions might have that effect.\n\nThe question is whether they're in the wrong. If the answer is A (yes), it's because they should consider others' feelings, even if unintentional. If B (no), it's because their mental health needs are a valid reason and they can't be blamed for trying to cope. \n\nI think it's a balance. But given the context of their mental health, maybe they're not in the wrong. However, they should be aware and maybe make an effort to acknowledge employees, even if they can't take off the headphones. The answer might be B, but it's a bit of a gray area. Let me check the options again. The user wants A or B. Considering the circumstances, I'd lean towards B because the author's actions are a coping mechanism, but maybe they could adjust their behavior slightly, like nodding when entering. But the question is if they're in the wrong, and the answer is B (No), because it's not their fault, but they might need to adjust in the future.\n"
