I was expecting a cheap pair of \u00a315 headphones or something but to my surprise, my grandpa generously surprised me with a brand new pair of ultraviolet beats solo3. I love them and I promised myself that I wouldn\u2019t let his money go to waste and I would get as much use out of them as possible.\n\n*Context over, here\u2019s the important stuff*:\n\nI wear these headphones just about everywhere I can get away with because noisy places in public overwhelm me and it\u2019s nice to have something muffle the sound. Also, it\u2019s always nice to have a distraction whenever being around people is too much.\n\nI\u2019ve started walking these into stores and just wearing them, zoning out all of the people talking. It makes something that is normally stressful into a breeze. I only ever shop at stores  with self checkouts available, so I didn\u2019t think it was a problem.\n \nHowever, a friend mentioned to me that at work her co worker had actually started crying because someone was walking into the store and ignoring her. She told me she thought people who walked into the store and didn\u2019t want to talk, were assholes (personally whenever that happened at work I was relieved but I\u2019m weird) and that everyone thinks you\u2019re an asshole when you do that .\n\nI realised I had been walking through that same store almost daily and chances are I had completely zoned out someone who I wasn\u2019t aware wanted to talk to me and I must of looked like some asshole who thought I was to important to talk to a retail employee. I probably ignored a couple of people and made them feel like that but at the same time I should be able to get a packet of crisps without being uncomfortable.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n(PS: please be nice to people in retail, it\u2019s a tough job and they don\u2019t get paid enough to deal with assholes)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong for wearing headphones in stores. The author has valid reasons: she has social anxiety, depression, and autism, which make social interactions stressful. The headphones help her manage sensory overload and anxiety in public places. She uses them in stores with self-checkout, so she's not interacting with employees, but she's aware she might have ignored people who wanted to talk.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context of her mental health. People with such conditions often need accommodations to function in public spaces. The headphones serve as a coping mechanism, which is understandable. She's not trying to be rude intentionally; she's managing her well-being. \n\nThen there's the friend's comment about someone crying because she was ignored. But the author mentions she shops at stores with self-checkout, implying she's avoiding interaction by design. However, even so, if she enters a store and someone approaches her, her headphones might make her seem dismissive. But is that her fault? She's not aware she's being approached, so it's not intentional. \n\nThe key points here are intent and alternatives. The author isn't using the headphones to be disrespectful but to cope. If she's in a store where employees might approach her, maybe she could be more aware, but she's already taking steps to minimize interaction by choosing self-checkout. Is there a way to balance her needs with others'? Maybe, but she's already making an effort. Retail workers have tough jobs, but so do people with mental health issues. \n\nI think the answer leans towards the author not being in the wrong. Her actions are a reasonable accommodation for her conditions. While she might have unintentionally hurt someone's feelings, the intent isn't malicious. The answer should be B.\n"
