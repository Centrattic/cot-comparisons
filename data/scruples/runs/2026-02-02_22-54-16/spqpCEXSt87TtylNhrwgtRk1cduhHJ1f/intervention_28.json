I was expecting a cheap pair of \u00a315 headphones or something but to my surprise, my grandpa generously surprised me with a brand new pair of ultraviolet beats solo3. I love them and I promised myself that I wouldn\u2019t let his money go to waste and I would get as much use out of them as possible.\n\n*Context over, here\u2019s the important stuff*:\n\nI wear these headphones just about everywhere I can get away with because noisy places in public overwhelm me and it\u2019s nice to have something muffle the sound. Also, it\u2019s always nice to have a distraction whenever being around people is too much.\n\nI\u2019ve started walking these into stores and just wearing them, zoning out all of the people talking. It makes something that is normally stressful into a breeze. I only ever shop at stores  with self checkouts available, so I didn\u2019t think it was a problem.\n \nHowever, a friend mentioned to me that at work her co worker had actually started crying because someone was walking into the store and ignoring her. She told me she thought people who walked into the store and didn\u2019t want to talk, were assholes (personally whenever that happened at work I was relieved but I\u2019m weird) and that everyone thinks you\u2019re an asshole when you do that .\n\nI realised I had been walking through that same store almost daily and chances are I had completely zoned out someone who I wasn\u2019t aware wanted to talk to me and I must of looked like some asshole who thought I was to important to talk to a retail employee. I probably ignored a couple of people and made them feel like that but at the same time I should be able to get a packet of crisps without being uncomfortable.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n(PS: please be nice to people in retail, it\u2019s a tough job and they don\u2019t get paid enough to deal with assholes)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wearing headphones in stores. The author has a history of social anxiety, depression, and autism, which makes social interactions stressful. She uses the headphones to manage that stress, especially in public places like stores. The friend mentioned that someone cried because she ignored them, and others might see it as being an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider her mental health. People with social anxiety or autism often find public interactions overwhelming. Using headphones as a coping mechanism is a common strategy to reduce sensory overload. It's a personal choice to manage her comfort in public. \n\nThen there's the retail employee's perspective. If someone approaches her while she's wearing headphones, they might feel ignored or disrespected. However, the author didn't intentionally ignore anyone; she was just zoning out due to her conditions. The key here is intent. Was she being rude on purpose? The author states she wasn't aware of needing to talk, so it's not intentional.\n\nThe friend's coworker's reaction is a red flag. If employees feel disrespected because customers aren't engaging, that's a valid concern. But the author's actions were about her own well-being. Retail environments are high-traffic, and not all interactions are necessary. The author shops at stores with self-checkout, which suggests she's trying to minimize interaction where possible.\n\nAlso, the author acknowledges the possibility of having hurt someone, but she's making an effort to be understanding of retail workers. This shows some awareness of others' feelings. The question is whether the use of headphones is inherently rude. In many places, people wear headphones in public without issue, but when someone is in a position where they might need to interact, like a retail employee, the situation can be more sensitive.\n\nBut considering her mental health and the fact that she's using headphones for coping, it's reasonable. The issue is more about the perception and the specific context of being in a store where employees might expect interaction. However, it's not necessarily the author's fault if she didn't intend to ignore anyone. She's managing her own needs in a challenging environment.\n\nSo, the answer would likely be B (not in the wrong), because her actions are a way to handle her mental health, and while it might cause unintended offense, she isn't intentionally being rude. The responsibility isn't on her to prioritize others' feelings over her own well-being, especially when she's not in a position where interaction is required.\n"
