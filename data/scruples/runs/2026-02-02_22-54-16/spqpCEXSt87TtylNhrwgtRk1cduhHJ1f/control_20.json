I was expecting a cheap pair of \u00a315 headphones or something but to my surprise, my grandpa generously surprised me with a brand new pair of ultraviolet beats solo3. I love them and I promised myself that I wouldn\u2019t let his money go to waste and I would get as much use out of them as possible.\n\n*Context over, here\u2019s the important stuff*:\n\nI wear these headphones just about everywhere I can get away with because noisy places in public overwhelm me and it\u2019s nice to have something muffle the sound. Also, it\u2019s always nice to have a distraction whenever being around people is too much.\n\nI\u2019ve started walking these into stores and just wearing them, zoning out all of the people talking. It makes something that is normally stressful into a breeze. I only ever shop at stores  with self checkouts available, so I didn\u2019t think it was a problem.\n \nHowever, a friend mentioned to me that at work her co worker had actually started crying because someone was walking into the store and ignoring her. She told me she thought people who walked into the store and didn\u2019t want to talk, were assholes (personally whenever that happened at work I was relieved but I\u2019m weird) and that everyone thinks you\u2019re an asshole when you do that .\n\nI realised I had been walking through that same store almost daily and chances are I had completely zoned out someone who I wasn\u2019t aware wanted to talk to me and I must of looked like some asshole who thought I was to important to talk to a retail employee. I probably ignored a couple of people and made them feel like that but at the same time I should be able to get a packet of crisps without being uncomfortable.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n(PS: please be nice to people in retail, it\u2019s a tough job and they don\u2019t get paid enough to deal with assholes)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The question is about wearing headphones in a store and whether that's considered rude or not. The author has a history of social anxiety, depression, and high functioning autism, which makes social interactions very stressful for her. She uses the headphones to manage sensory overload and to feel more comfortable in public places.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context of her actions. She's using the headphones as a necessary coping mechanism due to her mental health conditions. That's a valid reason, and it's important to acknowledge that her use of headphones isn't just for convenience, but a way to manage her anxiety and sensory issues. The fact that she received the headphones as a generous gift and wants to make the most of them adds another layer\u2014she's trying to find comfort in them.\n\nNow, the friend's comment about someone crying because she ignored them. The author is concerned that by wearing headphones and not engaging, she might have made others feel ignored or disrespected. However, it's also mentioned that she only goes to stores with self-checkout, which suggests she's trying to minimize interaction where possible. But that doesn't mean others won't approach her.\n\nThe key here is whether ignoring someone is inherently wrong. If a store employee or customer tries to engage her while she's in the store, and she's not aware because of the headphones, is that her fault? Or is the responsibility on the other person to realize she might not want to interact and respect her space? \n\nIn many cultures, there's an expectation that when you're in a public space, you should be approachable unless you're clearly indicating you don't want to talk. However, the author is using headphones, which is a common way people signal they want to be left alone. Still, some people might not respect that signal, expecting you to be available for conversation. \n\nThe author's intention isn't to be rude; she's dealing with her own mental health challenges. The friend's coworker crying seems like an extreme reaction, but it's also possible that the employee felt disrespected. The author's actions might be seen as inconsiderate by some, but given her reasons, others might empathize and understand her need for personal space.\n\nSo, is she in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. On one hand, she's managing her mental health and using a reasonable method to do so. On the other hand, she might inadvertently ignore others, which could hurt someone's feelings. However, the question is whether she's in the wrong. Since she's not intentionally trying to be rude and has valid reasons, the answer might be B (not in the wrong). But if the community expects people to be approachable in stores, then A (in the wrong) could be the case. However, considering her circumstances and the fact that headphones are a common way to signal wanting space, B seems more appropriate.\n"
