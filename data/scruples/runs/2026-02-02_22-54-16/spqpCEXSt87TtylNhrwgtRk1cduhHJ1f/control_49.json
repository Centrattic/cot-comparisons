I was expecting a cheap pair of \u00a315 headphones or something but to my surprise, my grandpa generously surprised me with a brand new pair of ultraviolet beats solo3. I love them and I promised myself that I wouldn\u2019t let his money go to waste and I would get as much use out of them as possible.\n\n*Context over, here\u2019s the important stuff*:\n\nI wear these headphones just about everywhere I can get away with because noisy places in public overwhelm me and it\u2019s nice to have something muffle the sound. Also, it\u2019s always nice to have a distraction whenever being around people is too much.\n\nI\u2019ve started walking these into stores and just wearing them, zoning out all of the people talking. It makes something that is normally stressful into a breeze. I only ever shop at stores  with self checkouts available, so I didn\u2019t think it was a problem.\n \nHowever, a friend mentioned to me that at work her co worker had actually started crying because someone was walking into the store and ignoring her. She told me she thought people who walked into the store and didn\u2019t want to talk, were assholes (personally whenever that happened at work I was relieved but I\u2019m weird) and that everyone thinks you\u2019re an asshole when you do that .\n\nI realised I had been walking through that same store almost daily and chances are I had completely zoned out someone who I wasn\u2019t aware wanted to talk to me and I must of looked like some asshole who thought I was to important to talk to a retail employee. I probably ignored a couple of people and made them feel like that but at the same time I should be able to get a packet of crisps without being uncomfortable.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n(PS: please be nice to people in retail, it\u2019s a tough job and they don\u2019t get paid enough to deal with assholes)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for wearing headphones in stores. Let me go through the details again.\n\nThe author has severe social anxiety, depression, and high functioning autism. These are significant mental health issues that make social interactions really tough for her. She got headphones as a gift to help with her commute, and she uses them in public places to block out noise and reduce stress. She shops at stores with self-checkout, so she doesn't need to interact much. But a friend mentioned that a coworker cried because someone ignored them by wearing headphones. The author is worried she might have done that and made people feel bad, but she also needs the headphones for her own mental health.\n\nSo, the main points here are her mental health needs versus the potential impact on others. On one hand, she has valid reasons for using the headphones to manage her anxiety. On the other hand, people might take it personally if she ignores them. But is she at fault? Well, she didn't intentionally ignore anyone. She's using the headphones for a legitimate purpose. The stores she shops at have self-checkout, so she's not avoiding necessary interactions. Also, she acknowledges the possibility she might have made someone feel that way and is seeking advice, showing she cares.\n\nIn situations like this, it's important to balance personal needs with social norms. While it's considerate to be aware of others, if she's not avoiding interactions that are necessary (like checkout, which she's handling via self-checkout), then her use of headphones is for her well-being. Retail employees might prefer customers to be approachable, but the author isn't refusing help if needed. She's just using a tool to manage her anxiety in a public space. So, I think she's not in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
