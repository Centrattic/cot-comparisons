I was expecting a cheap pair of \u00a315 headphones or something but to my surprise, my grandpa generously surprised me with a brand new pair of ultraviolet beats solo3. I love them and I promised myself that I wouldn\u2019t let his money go to waste and I would get as much use out of them as possible.\n\n*Context over, here\u2019s the important stuff*:\n\nI wear these headphones just about everywhere I can get away with because noisy places in public overwhelm me and it\u2019s nice to have something muffle the sound. Also, it\u2019s always nice to have a distraction whenever being around people is too much.\n\nI\u2019ve started walking these into stores and just wearing them, zoning out all of the people talking. It makes something that is normally stressful into a breeze. I only ever shop at stores  with self checkouts available, so I didn\u2019t think it was a problem.\n \nHowever, a friend mentioned to me that at work her co worker had actually started crying because someone was walking into the store and ignoring her. She told me she thought people who walked into the store and didn\u2019t want to talk, were assholes (personally whenever that happened at work I was relieved but I\u2019m weird) and that everyone thinks you\u2019re an asshole when you do that .\n\nI realised I had been walking through that same store almost daily and chances are I had completely zoned out someone who I wasn\u2019t aware wanted to talk to me and I must of looked like some asshole who thought I was to important to talk to a retail employee. I probably ignored a couple of people and made them feel like that but at the same time I should be able to get a packet of crisps without being uncomfortable.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n(PS: please be nice to people in retail, it\u2019s a tough job and they don\u2019t get paid enough to deal with assholes)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wearing headphones in the store. The author has social anxiety, depression, and autism. She uses the headphones to cope with public noise and stress. She shops at places with self-checkout to avoid interaction. Her friend mentioned that someone cried because she ignored them, and others might think she's an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider her mental health. She has valid reasons for needing the headphones. It's her way of managing her conditions. But then, there's the other side: employees might feel ignored or disrespected. The friend's coworker crying shows the impact on others.\n\nIs it a matter of balancing her needs and others' feelings? She didn't mean to be rude, but her actions might make employees feel that way. However, she didn't approach them or ignore them intentionally. She's just using the headphones for her well-being. \n\nThe key points are: her mental health necessitates the headphones, the stores she uses have self-checkout (so she's not avoiding necessary interactions), and she didn't have intent to be rude. On the other hand, employees could feel disrespected if they try to interact and are met with headphones. But maybe that's a misunderstanding.\n\nIs there a way to accommodate both? Maybe she could make eye contact or nod to acknowledge employees, but she might not be aware. Since she's zoning out, maybe she's not ignoring people on purpose. The question is whether her actions are considered inconsiderate despite her good intentions.\n\nIn terms of social norms, some people might find headphones in stores rude, but others understand it's for sensory needs. The answer depends on whether intent matters. Since she's not intentionally ignoring people and is managing her health, the answer might be B (not in the wrong). But the impact on others is real. However, she's using self-checkout, so maybe the main issue is if she's in a store where interaction is unavoidable, but the context says she shops where self-checkout is available, minimizing interaction. So she's not forcing interactions. Therefore, the answer is B. She's not in the wrong because her actions are to cope with her conditions and she's taking steps to avoid interactions where needed.\n"
