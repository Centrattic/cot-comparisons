I was expecting a cheap pair of \u00a315 headphones or something but to my surprise, my grandpa generously surprised me with a brand new pair of ultraviolet beats solo3. I love them and I promised myself that I wouldn\u2019t let his money go to waste and I would get as much use out of them as possible.\n\n*Context over, here\u2019s the important stuff*:\n\nI wear these headphones just about everywhere I can get away with because noisy places in public overwhelm me and it\u2019s nice to have something muffle the sound. Also, it\u2019s always nice to have a distraction whenever being around people is too much.\n\nI\u2019ve started walking these into stores and just wearing them, zoning out all of the people talking. It makes something that is normally stressful into a breeze. I only ever shop at stores  with self checkouts available, so I didn\u2019t think it was a problem.\n \nHowever, a friend mentioned to me that at work her co worker had actually started crying because someone was walking into the store and ignoring her. She told me she thought people who walked into the store and didn\u2019t want to talk, were assholes (personally whenever that happened at work I was relieved but I\u2019m weird) and that everyone thinks you\u2019re an asshole when you do that .\n\nI realised I had been walking through that same store almost daily and chances are I had completely zoned out someone who I wasn\u2019t aware wanted to talk to me and I must of looked like some asshole who thought I was to important to talk to a retail employee. I probably ignored a couple of people and made them feel like that but at the same time I should be able to get a packet of crisps without being uncomfortable.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n(PS: please be nice to people in retail, it\u2019s a tough job and they don\u2019t get paid enough to deal with assholes)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wearing headphones in stores. The author has a history of severe social anxiety, depression, and high functioning autism. She wears the headphones to cope with the stress of public places and to avoid overwhelming interactions. She only shops at stores with self-checkouts, so she probably doesn't interact much with staff. However, a friend mentioned that a coworker cried because someone ignored them by wearing headphones, and the friend thinks people who do that are assholes. The author is worried she might have hurt someone's feelings but also needs the headphones for her mental health.\n\nHmm, so the key points here are the author's mental health conditions and the impact of her actions on others. On one hand, she has valid reasons for needing the headphones. People with social anxiety or autism might find public interactions overwhelming, and using headphones as a coping mechanism can be appropriate. It's important to consider her well-being and the fact that she's taking steps to manage her conditions. \n\nOn the other hand, the staff might expect some level of interaction, even if it's just a greeting or acknowledgment. If someone approaches her for help, not noticing them could be problematic. But the author mentions she only uses self-checkout, so maybe she's not expecting to interact with employees beyond that. Still, there might be instances where employees try to engage her, like a greeting when entering or a question about a product. If she's completely zoned out, they might feel ignored.\n\nThe question is whether her need for comfort overrides the potential for staff to feel disrespected. In some cultures, it's considered rude to not acknowledge people, even if they're employees. However, others might see it as a personal choice, especially when there's no direct interaction. The author's intention is to avoid stress, not to be dismissive. She even mentions that she didn't think it was a problem before, which shows she's not trying to be offensive.\n\nBut the friend's anecdote about a coworker crying is a real impact. The staff person might have felt ignored or disrespected, thinking the customer was too important to talk to them. It's a tough balance between personal space and social norms. The author's mental health is a significant factor here. Retail jobs can be tough, and employees often deal with a lot, but so do customers with anxiety.\n\nI think the answer is more on the side of the author not being in the wrong. Her actions are a reasonable accommodation for her conditions. However, maybe there's a middle ground, like removing headphones if someone approaches or being aware of the environment. But the question is about being in the wrong, not about possible adjustments. Considering her mental health and the fact that she's not intentionally ignoring anyone, the answer is B.\n"
