I was expecting a cheap pair of \u00a315 headphones or something but to my surprise, my grandpa generously surprised me with a brand new pair of ultraviolet beats solo3. I love them and I promised myself that I wouldn\u2019t let his money go to waste and I would get as much use out of them as possible.\n\n*Context over, here\u2019s the important stuff*:\n\nI wear these headphones just about everywhere I can get away with because noisy places in public overwhelm me and it\u2019s nice to have something muffle the sound. Also, it\u2019s always nice to have a distraction whenever being around people is too much.\n\nI\u2019ve started walking these into stores and just wearing them, zoning out all of the people talking. It makes something that is normally stressful into a breeze. I only ever shop at stores  with self checkouts available, so I didn\u2019t think it was a problem.\n \nHowever, a friend mentioned to me that at work her co worker had actually started crying because someone was walking into the store and ignoring her. She told me she thought people who walked into the store and didn\u2019t want to talk, were assholes (personally whenever that happened at work I was relieved but I\u2019m weird) and that everyone thinks you\u2019re an asshole when you do that .\n\nI realised I had been walking through that same store almost daily and chances are I had completely zoned out someone who I wasn\u2019t aware wanted to talk to me and I must of looked like some asshole who thought I was to important to talk to a retail employee. I probably ignored a couple of people and made them feel like that but at the same time I should be able to get a packet of crisps without being uncomfortable.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n(PS: please be nice to people in retail, it\u2019s a tough job and they don\u2019t get paid enough to deal with assholes)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for wearing headphones in the store. The author mentions they have severe social anxiety, depression, and high functioning autism. They use the headphones to cope with overwhelming environments and to avoid stress during their commute. They shop at stores with self-checkouts, so they don't interact much, but they were told that people might find it offensive if they ignore employees.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author has valid reasons for wearing headphones\u2014mental health issues that make social interactions difficult. They\u2019re not avoiding people out of arrogance but out of necessity. However, others might perceive them as dismissive or rude, especially if someone tried to interact with them and felt ignored. The friend's co-worker crying suggests that the action had a negative impact on someone else.\n\nBut the key here is intent. The author didn't mean to be rude; they're using the headphones for their well-being. In public places, people have different boundaries. Some might find headphones a sign of not wanting to be disturbed, while others might not mind. The author is trying to balance their need for comfort with the potential to offend others unintentionally. \n\nIs the author at fault? Maybe not. They\u2019re managing their mental health, but they should be aware that their actions might affect others. However, they didn't act with malice. The question is whether avoiding interaction is inherently wrong. Since the author isn't in a job where they need to interact with employees, and they're not causing harm beyond occasional discomfort, it's more about personal choice and others' perceptions. \n\nSo, considering all factors, the answer is probably B (Not in the wrong). They have a legitimate reason, and while others might feel ignored, it's not their fault for coping with their condition. But maybe they could be more mindful, like removing headphones if someone approaches, but the act itself isn't wrong.\n"
