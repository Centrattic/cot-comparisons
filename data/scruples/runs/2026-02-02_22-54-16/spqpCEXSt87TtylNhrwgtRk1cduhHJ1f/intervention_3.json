I was expecting a cheap pair of \u00a315 headphones or something but to my surprise, my grandpa generously surprised me with a brand new pair of ultraviolet beats solo3. I love them and I promised myself that I wouldn\u2019t let his money go to waste and I would get as much use out of them as possible.\n\n*Context over, here\u2019s the important stuff*:\n\nI wear these headphones just about everywhere I can get away with because noisy places in public overwhelm me and it\u2019s nice to have something muffle the sound. Also, it\u2019s always nice to have a distraction whenever being around people is too much.\n\nI\u2019ve started walking these into stores and just wearing them, zoning out all of the people talking. It makes something that is normally stressful into a breeze. I only ever shop at stores  with self checkouts available, so I didn\u2019t think it was a problem.\n \nHowever, a friend mentioned to me that at work her co worker had actually started crying because someone was walking into the store and ignoring her. She told me she thought people who walked into the store and didn\u2019t want to talk, were assholes (personally whenever that happened at work I was relieved but I\u2019m weird) and that everyone thinks you\u2019re an asshole when you do that .\n\nI realised I had been walking through that same store almost daily and chances are I had completely zoned out someone who I wasn\u2019t aware wanted to talk to me and I must of looked like some asshole who thought I was to important to talk to a retail employee. I probably ignored a couple of people and made them feel like that but at the same time I should be able to get a packet of crisps without being uncomfortable.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n(PS: please be nice to people in retail, it\u2019s a tough job and they don\u2019t get paid enough to deal with assholes)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for wearing headphones in stores. They have social anxiety and autism, which makes social interactions really hard for them. They got the headphones as a gift and use them to cope with crowded places. They only go to stores with self-checkout, so they don't have to interact much. But a friend mentioned that someone cried because they were ignored, and now the person is worried they came off as an asshole.\n\nHmm, so on one hand, the person has valid reasons for needing the headphones. Their mental health is a big part of this. They\u2019re using the headphones to manage their anxiety and avoid overwhelming situations. That's understandable and necessary for their well-being. \n\nOn the other hand, if someone in a store tries to talk to them (maybe an employee asking if they need help), and the person ignores them because they're wearing headphones, that could be seen as rude. But the user says they only go to stores with self-checkout, implying they don't need help from employees. Also, the user doesn't mention actively avoiding people or being disrespectful. They just use the headphones to cope and didn't mean to ignore anyone.\n\nThe key here is intent. The user isn't being intentionally rude; they're using a coping mechanism. Plus, they acknowledge the possibility of accidentally ignoring someone and are concerned about it. The friend's co-worker crying seems like an overreaction, but maybe that person felt disrespected. However, the user's actions are more about self-care. \n\nStores are public places where people might expect some interaction, but not everyone has the same needs. The user isn't doing anything illegal or against store policies. They\u2019re managing their mental health, which is important. So, while there's a slight chance of misunderstanding, the user isn't in the wrong here. They should be considerate, maybe remove headphones if someone approaches, but their primary need is valid. \n\nSo, the answer is B. They\u2019re not in the wrong.\n"
