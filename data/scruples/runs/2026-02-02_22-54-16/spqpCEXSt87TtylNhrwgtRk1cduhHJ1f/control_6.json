I was expecting a cheap pair of \u00a315 headphones or something but to my surprise, my grandpa generously surprised me with a brand new pair of ultraviolet beats solo3. I love them and I promised myself that I wouldn\u2019t let his money go to waste and I would get as much use out of them as possible.\n\n*Context over, here\u2019s the important stuff*:\n\nI wear these headphones just about everywhere I can get away with because noisy places in public overwhelm me and it\u2019s nice to have something muffle the sound. Also, it\u2019s always nice to have a distraction whenever being around people is too much.\n\nI\u2019ve started walking these into stores and just wearing them, zoning out all of the people talking. It makes something that is normally stressful into a breeze. I only ever shop at stores  with self checkouts available, so I didn\u2019t think it was a problem.\n \nHowever, a friend mentioned to me that at work her co worker had actually started crying because someone was walking into the store and ignoring her. She told me she thought people who walked into the store and didn\u2019t want to talk, were assholes (personally whenever that happened at work I was relieved but I\u2019m weird) and that everyone thinks you\u2019re an asshole when you do that .\n\nI realised I had been walking through that same store almost daily and chances are I had completely zoned out someone who I wasn\u2019t aware wanted to talk to me and I must of looked like some asshole who thought I was to important to talk to a retail employee. I probably ignored a couple of people and made them feel like that but at the same time I should be able to get a packet of crisps without being uncomfortable.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n(PS: please be nice to people in retail, it\u2019s a tough job and they don\u2019t get paid enough to deal with assholes)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wearing headphones in stores. The author has social anxiety, depression, and autism, which makes social interactions really tough. She uses the headphones to manage her anxiety and cope in noisy environments. She shops at stores with self-checkout, so maybe she's trying to avoid interactions there.\n\nHer friend mentioned that a coworker cried because someone ignored them when they entered the store. The author is worried she might have done that, but she didn't mean to be rude. She's conflicted because she needs the headphones for her mental health, but she also doesn't want to hurt anyone's feelings. \n\nNow, considering the context of her mental health issues, it's important to recognize that she's using the headphones as a necessary coping mechanism. People with social anxiety often need strategies to navigate public spaces without becoming overwhelmed. On the other hand, there's the social norm of being polite and acknowledging others, which she might be inadvertently violating.\n\nBut is the author actually at fault? The key here is intent versus impact. She didn't mean to ignore people; she just wasn't aware. Retail workers might feel disrespected if customers don't acknowledge them, which is valid. However, her actions are driven by genuine needs related to her mental health. There's a balance between personal comfort and social etiquette. \n\nThe author's situation suggests that she's conscious of her actions and is reflecting on them, which shows empathy. Maybe she could consider situations where acknowledging a retail worker might be necessary, but given her conditions, it's a personal strategy to manage her well-being. The answer likely leans towards her not being in the wrong because her actions are a result of her health needs, though there's room for sensitivity towards others' feelings.\n"
