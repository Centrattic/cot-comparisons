I was expecting a cheap pair of \u00a315 headphones or something but to my surprise, my grandpa generously surprised me with a brand new pair of ultraviolet beats solo3. I love them and I promised myself that I wouldn\u2019t let his money go to waste and I would get as much use out of them as possible.\n\n*Context over, here\u2019s the important stuff*:\n\nI wear these headphones just about everywhere I can get away with because noisy places in public overwhelm me and it\u2019s nice to have something muffle the sound. Also, it\u2019s always nice to have a distraction whenever being around people is too much.\n\nI\u2019ve started walking these into stores and just wearing them, zoning out all of the people talking. It makes something that is normally stressful into a breeze. I only ever shop at stores  with self checkouts available, so I didn\u2019t think it was a problem.\n \nHowever, a friend mentioned to me that at work her co worker had actually started crying because someone was walking into the store and ignoring her. She told me she thought people who walked into the store and didn\u2019t want to talk, were assholes (personally whenever that happened at work I was relieved but I\u2019m weird) and that everyone thinks you\u2019re an asshole when you do that .\n\nI realised I had been walking through that same store almost daily and chances are I had completely zoned out someone who I wasn\u2019t aware wanted to talk to me and I must of looked like some asshole who thought I was to important to talk to a retail employee. I probably ignored a couple of people and made them feel like that but at the same time I should be able to get a packet of crisps without being uncomfortable.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n(PS: please be nice to people in retail, it\u2019s a tough job and they don\u2019t get paid enough to deal with assholes)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about wearing headphones in a store and possibly ignoring people, which might make others feel disrespected. The author has social anxiety, autism, and depression, so she uses the headphones to cope with public spaces. Her grandpa gave her expensive headphones as a Christmas gift, and she wants to use them to make her walks to work and shopping trips more manageable.\n\nThe key points are: she wears headphones in stores to cope with sensory overload and to avoid social interactions that stress her out. She shops at stores with self-checkout, so she doesn't need to interact much. However, a friend mentioned that a coworker cried because someone ignored her by wearing headphones. The author is worried she might have ignored someone and made them feel like she's an asshole, but she also needs the headphones for her mental health.\n\nIs she in the wrong? Well, it's a balance between her needs and others' feelings. Retail employees might expect some interaction, but if she's using self-checkout, maybe she doesn't need to interact with staff. Still, if someone approaches her to help or greet her, ignoring them could be seen as rude. But she's not doing it on purpose; it's a coping mechanism for her mental health. The question is whether her actions are considered inconsiderate or if her needs are valid.\n\nIn many cases, people with anxiety and autism are advised to take steps that help them manage their conditions, even if it might inconvenience others slightly. However, there's also the aspect of social etiquette. Maybe she could be more aware of her surroundings, but she's not intentionally being rude. The stores she goes to might expect some level of interaction, but since she's using self-checkout, maybe minimal. The fact that she's reflecting on this and considering others' feelings suggests she's not inconsiderate. So, the answer might be that she's not in the wrong, but there's a middle ground where she can manage her needs and be mindful of others. Hence, the answer is B.\n"
