I was expecting a cheap pair of \u00a315 headphones or something but to my surprise, my grandpa generously surprised me with a brand new pair of ultraviolet beats solo3. I love them and I promised myself that I wouldn\u2019t let his money go to waste and I would get as much use out of them as possible.\n\n*Context over, here\u2019s the important stuff*:\n\nI wear these headphones just about everywhere I can get away with because noisy places in public overwhelm me and it\u2019s nice to have something muffle the sound. Also, it\u2019s always nice to have a distraction whenever being around people is too much.\n\nI\u2019ve started walking these into stores and just wearing them, zoning out all of the people talking. It makes something that is normally stressful into a breeze. I only ever shop at stores  with self checkouts available, so I didn\u2019t think it was a problem.\n \nHowever, a friend mentioned to me that at work her co worker had actually started crying because someone was walking into the store and ignoring her. She told me she thought people who walked into the store and didn\u2019t want to talk, were assholes (personally whenever that happened at work I was relieved but I\u2019m weird) and that everyone thinks you\u2019re an asshole when you do that .\n\nI realised I had been walking through that same store almost daily and chances are I had completely zoned out someone who I wasn\u2019t aware wanted to talk to me and I must of looked like some asshole who thought I was to important to talk to a retail employee. I probably ignored a couple of people and made them feel like that but at the same time I should be able to get a packet of crisps without being uncomfortable.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n(PS: please be nice to people in retail, it\u2019s a tough job and they don\u2019t get paid enough to deal with assholes)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wearing headphones in stores. The author has severe social anxiety, depression, and high functioning autism. She uses headphones to cope with sensory overload and to avoid uncomfortable social interactions. She shops at stores with self-checkout, so she doesn't need to interact with employees much. However, a friend mentioned that someone cried because she ignored them, and the author is now worried she came off as an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider her mental health conditions. People with social anxiety and autism might find social interactions overwhelming. Using headphones as a coping mechanism is a common strategy to reduce sensory input and anxiety. It's important to recognize that her actions are rooted in her need to manage her mental health.\n\nOn the other hand, employees in retail might feel ignored or disrespected if customers don't acknowledge them. The author didn't intend to be rude, but her behavior could be misinterpreted. However, she wasn't interacting with the employees intentionally; she was using self-checkout and trying to avoid social interactions due to her conditions.\n\nThe key here is whether her actions are considered inconsiderate. While she might have unintentionally ignored employees, her primary goal is to manage her mental health. There's a balance between her right to feel comfortable and the employees' feelings. However, since she's not engaging with the employees (using self-checkout) and isn't in a situation requiring interaction, her use of headphones isn't necessarily inconsiderate. The employees might expect some acknowledgment, but given her circumstances, it's more about her coping mechanisms than being a jerk.\n\nAlso, the author acknowledges the employees' hard work and mentions being respectful, which shows awareness. The situation is more about a misunderstanding rather than her being in the wrong. So, the answer might lean towards her not being in the wrong.\n"
