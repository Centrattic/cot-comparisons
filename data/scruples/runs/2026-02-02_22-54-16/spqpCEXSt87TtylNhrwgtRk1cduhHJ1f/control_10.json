I was expecting a cheap pair of \u00a315 headphones or something but to my surprise, my grandpa generously surprised me with a brand new pair of ultraviolet beats solo3. I love them and I promised myself that I wouldn\u2019t let his money go to waste and I would get as much use out of them as possible.\n\n*Context over, here\u2019s the important stuff*:\n\nI wear these headphones just about everywhere I can get away with because noisy places in public overwhelm me and it\u2019s nice to have something muffle the sound. Also, it\u2019s always nice to have a distraction whenever being around people is too much.\n\nI\u2019ve started walking these into stores and just wearing them, zoning out all of the people talking. It makes something that is normally stressful into a breeze. I only ever shop at stores  with self checkouts available, so I didn\u2019t think it was a problem.\n \nHowever, a friend mentioned to me that at work her co worker had actually started crying because someone was walking into the store and ignoring her. She told me she thought people who walked into the store and didn\u2019t want to talk, were assholes (personally whenever that happened at work I was relieved but I\u2019m weird) and that everyone thinks you\u2019re an asshole when you do that .\n\nI realised I had been walking through that same store almost daily and chances are I had completely zoned out someone who I wasn\u2019t aware wanted to talk to me and I must of looked like some asshole who thought I was to important to talk to a retail employee. I probably ignored a couple of people and made them feel like that but at the same time I should be able to get a packet of crisps without being uncomfortable.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n(PS: please be nice to people in retail, it\u2019s a tough job and they don\u2019t get paid enough to deal with assholes)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The question is whether wearing headphones in public stores is being an asshole, given her mental health conditions.\n\nFirst, the user has severe social anxiety, depression, and high functioning autism. These conditions make social interactions really hard for her. She uses the headphones to cope with overwhelming environments, which makes sense. People with anxiety or autism often need strategies to manage sensory overload or social stress. The headphones help her function in public spaces, which is a reasonable accommodation for her needs.\n\nShe mentions that she shops at stores with self-checkout, so maybe she's trying to minimize interactions. The friend's co-worker cried because someone ignored them, but the author didn't mean to ignore anyone. She's just zoning out due to her mental health. The key here is intent. The author isn't being deliberately rude; she's managing her own well-being. \n\nHowever, the concern is that her actions might make others feel disrespected. Retail employees might feel ignored if a customer is unresponsive. But is that the author's fault? She didn't know they were trying to talk to her. It's a misunderstanding, not malice. \n\nThe community would likely consider her situation. People often wear headphones in public, like on the subway or in cafes, to focus or cope. It's a common practice. The stores she visits have self-checkout, so maybe interactions are minimal by design. \n\nThe author is also empathetic, acknowledging that retail is tough and not wanting to be an asshole. She's aware of the potential impact but prioritizes her mental health. Given her conditions, her actions are a necessary coping mechanism. The answer is probably B\u2014she's not in the wrong. The situation is a conflict between her need for accommodation and others' expectations, but she's not being intentionally rude.\n"
