I was expecting a cheap pair of \u00a315 headphones or something but to my surprise, my grandpa generously surprised me with a brand new pair of ultraviolet beats solo3. I love them and I promised myself that I wouldn\u2019t let his money go to waste and I would get as much use out of them as possible.\n\n*Context over, here\u2019s the important stuff*:\n\nI wear these headphones just about everywhere I can get away with because noisy places in public overwhelm me and it\u2019s nice to have something muffle the sound. Also, it\u2019s always nice to have a distraction whenever being around people is too much.\n\nI\u2019ve started walking these into stores and just wearing them, zoning out all of the people talking. It makes something that is normally stressful into a breeze. I only ever shop at stores  with self checkouts available, so I didn\u2019t think it was a problem.\n \nHowever, a friend mentioned to me that at work her co worker had actually started crying because someone was walking into the store and ignoring her. She told me she thought people who walked into the store and didn\u2019t want to talk, were assholes (personally whenever that happened at work I was relieved but I\u2019m weird) and that everyone thinks you\u2019re an asshole when you do that .\n\nI realised I had been walking through that same store almost daily and chances are I had completely zoned out someone who I wasn\u2019t aware wanted to talk to me and I must of looked like some asshole who thought I was to important to talk to a retail employee. I probably ignored a couple of people and made them feel like that but at the same time I should be able to get a packet of crisps without being uncomfortable.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n(PS: please be nice to people in retail, it\u2019s a tough job and they don\u2019t get paid enough to deal with assholes)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for wearing headphones in the store. The author has social anxiety, depression, and autism, which makes social interactions difficult. She uses the headphones to cope with noisy environments and stress. Her friend mentioned that someone at work was upset because she ignored them, leading her to question if she's being an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context of her mental health. People with social anxiety or autism might find public interactions overwhelming. Using headphones as a coping mechanism could be a valid way for her to manage her anxiety. The friends' co-worker's reaction might be a misunderstanding. The author wasn't intentionally ignoring people; she's using the headphones for self-care.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that entering a store with headphones on could be seen as rude, especially if employees need to assist her. However, she only shops at places with self-checkout, which suggests she's trying to minimize interaction. It's possible that employees might approach her despite the headphones, but she's not aware of their attempts. \n\nThe key here is intent. The author isn't being deliberately inconsiderate. She's managing her mental health needs. While the employees might feel ignored, that's not her intention. The real issue is about balancing personal needs with social expectations. Since the author is making an effort to use self-checkout and isn't causing harm, she's probably not in the wrong. Retail workers deal with many challenges, but this situation is more about her coping strategies rather than being an asshole.\n"
