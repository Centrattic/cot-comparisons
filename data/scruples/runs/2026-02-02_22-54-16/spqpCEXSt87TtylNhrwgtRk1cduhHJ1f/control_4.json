I was expecting a cheap pair of \u00a315 headphones or something but to my surprise, my grandpa generously surprised me with a brand new pair of ultraviolet beats solo3. I love them and I promised myself that I wouldn\u2019t let his money go to waste and I would get as much use out of them as possible.\n\n*Context over, here\u2019s the important stuff*:\n\nI wear these headphones just about everywhere I can get away with because noisy places in public overwhelm me and it\u2019s nice to have something muffle the sound. Also, it\u2019s always nice to have a distraction whenever being around people is too much.\n\nI\u2019ve started walking these into stores and just wearing them, zoning out all of the people talking. It makes something that is normally stressful into a breeze. I only ever shop at stores  with self checkouts available, so I didn\u2019t think it was a problem.\n \nHowever, a friend mentioned to me that at work her co worker had actually started crying because someone was walking into the store and ignoring her. She told me she thought people who walked into the store and didn\u2019t want to talk, were assholes (personally whenever that happened at work I was relieved but I\u2019m weird) and that everyone thinks you\u2019re an asshole when you do that .\n\nI realised I had been walking through that same store almost daily and chances are I had completely zoned out someone who I wasn\u2019t aware wanted to talk to me and I must of looked like some asshole who thought I was to important to talk to a retail employee. I probably ignored a couple of people and made them feel like that but at the same time I should be able to get a packet of crisps without being uncomfortable.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n(PS: please be nice to people in retail, it\u2019s a tough job and they don\u2019t get paid enough to deal with assholes)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA story is in the wrong. The situation is about wearing headphones in stores. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the context given. The author has severe social anxiety and depression, and high-functioning autism. These conditions make social interactions really challenging for her. She uses the headphones to cope with noisy environments and to manage her stress when going to stores. The headphones help her feel more comfortable, especially in self-checkout stores where she can avoid direct interaction.\n\nShe received the headphones as a gift from her grandpa, which she's grateful for and wants to use as much as possible. She's not doing this out of arrogance but because she needs it for her mental health. However, a friend mentioned that a coworker's experience of being ignored when someone walked into the store with headphones made her cry. The author is now worried that by wearing her headphones, she might have unintentionally ignored people, making them feel disrespected or undervalued.\n\nThe key points here are: the author's mental health conditions, her use of headphones as a necessary coping mechanism, and the potential impact on others. The question is whether she's in the wrong for this.\n\nOn one hand, using headphones in public places is common for many people. It's a way to create a personal space and manage sensory overload. Especially given her conditions, it's a necessary accommodation. Retail employees often deal with a variety of customer behaviors, and while it's unfortunate when customers are unresponsive, it's part of the job. The author is not trying to be rude; she's trying to manage her anxiety.\n\nOn the other hand, there's a consideration for the employees. If she's approached and doesn't respond, it might be hurtful. But the author mentions she only goes to self-checkout stores, implying she avoids interactions where possible. Still, there's a chance someone might try to engage her. However, given her mental health needs, it's reasonable for her to take steps to protect her well-being.\n\nThe friend's coworker's reaction is extreme, but it's a valid concern. However, the author isn't acting out of malice. The question is whether it's fair to judge her for something that's a coping mechanism and not intended to harm others. The author is also aware of the potential issue and is reflecting on it, showing empathy.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the author isn't in the wrong. Her actions are a reasonable accommodation for her health, and while it's important to be considerate, her use of headphones isn't malicious. The answer is B.\n"
