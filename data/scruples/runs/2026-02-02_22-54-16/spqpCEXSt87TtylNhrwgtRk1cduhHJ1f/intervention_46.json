I was expecting a cheap pair of \u00a315 headphones or something but to my surprise, my grandpa generously surprised me with a brand new pair of ultraviolet beats solo3. I love them and I promised myself that I wouldn\u2019t let his money go to waste and I would get as much use out of them as possible.\n\n*Context over, here\u2019s the important stuff*:\n\nI wear these headphones just about everywhere I can get away with because noisy places in public overwhelm me and it\u2019s nice to have something muffle the sound. Also, it\u2019s always nice to have a distraction whenever being around people is too much.\n\nI\u2019ve started walking these into stores and just wearing them, zoning out all of the people talking. It makes something that is normally stressful into a breeze. I only ever shop at stores  with self checkouts available, so I didn\u2019t think it was a problem.\n \nHowever, a friend mentioned to me that at work her co worker had actually started crying because someone was walking into the store and ignoring her. She told me she thought people who walked into the store and didn\u2019t want to talk, were assholes (personally whenever that happened at work I was relieved but I\u2019m weird) and that everyone thinks you\u2019re an asshole when you do that .\n\nI realised I had been walking through that same store almost daily and chances are I had completely zoned out someone who I wasn\u2019t aware wanted to talk to me and I must of looked like some asshole who thought I was to important to talk to a retail employee. I probably ignored a couple of people and made them feel like that but at the same time I should be able to get a packet of crisps without being uncomfortable.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n(PS: please be nice to people in retail, it\u2019s a tough job and they don\u2019t get paid enough to deal with assholes)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that she has social anxiety, depression, and autism, and she wears headphones in stores to cope with sensory overload and to avoid stressful interactions. She uses self-checkout to avoid talking to people. Her friend mentioned that a coworker cried because someone ignored them by wearing headphones. Now, the author is worried she might have ignored someone and made them feel bad.\n\nFirst, I need to consider her reasons. She's using the headphones for mental health reasons, which is a valid need. People with social anxiety or sensory issues often need accommodations to manage their conditions. She's not wearing them to be rude, but to cope. However, in retail environments, employees might expect some level of interaction, especially if they need help. If someone is wearing headphones, it might signal to others that they don't want to be approached, but maybe they didn't realize she needed that space.\n\nOn the other hand, there's a social norm that when you enter a store, especially one with employees, you should be open to interacting if needed. If she's walking through the store every day with headphones on, even if she's using self-checkout, employees might expect her to acknowledge them, even if just briefly. Ignoring someone completely could make them feel disrespected, even if unintentionally.\n\nBut the key point is intent. She didn't mean to be an asshole; she was trying to manage her anxiety. The problem is that her actions, while understandable for her, might not consider the other person's perspective. However, given her mental health conditions, it's a reasonable accommodation. The question is whether her need for personal space and sensory management outweighs the potential discomfort of others. \n\nAlso, she's aware now and is concerned about it, which shows she's trying to be considerate. Maybe there's a middle ground, like a glance or a brief acknowledgment when possible. But in terms of being \"in the wrong,\" it's about whether her actions were intentionally harmful. Since they weren't, and she's taking steps to be mindful, maybe she's not the asshole. But there's a balance between her needs and others' feelings.\n\nSo, I think the answer is B for No. She's not in the wrong because her actions stem from mental health needs, and she didn't intend to be rude. However, there's a social consideration here that she might need to be more mindful of, but it's not a clear case of being wrong.\n"
