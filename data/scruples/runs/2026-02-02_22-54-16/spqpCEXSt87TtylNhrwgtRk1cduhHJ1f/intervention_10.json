I was expecting a cheap pair of \u00a315 headphones or something but to my surprise, my grandpa generously surprised me with a brand new pair of ultraviolet beats solo3. I love them and I promised myself that I wouldn\u2019t let his money go to waste and I would get as much use out of them as possible.\n\n*Context over, here\u2019s the important stuff*:\n\nI wear these headphones just about everywhere I can get away with because noisy places in public overwhelm me and it\u2019s nice to have something muffle the sound. Also, it\u2019s always nice to have a distraction whenever being around people is too much.\n\nI\u2019ve started walking these into stores and just wearing them, zoning out all of the people talking. It makes something that is normally stressful into a breeze. I only ever shop at stores  with self checkouts available, so I didn\u2019t think it was a problem.\n \nHowever, a friend mentioned to me that at work her co worker had actually started crying because someone was walking into the store and ignoring her. She told me she thought people who walked into the store and didn\u2019t want to talk, were assholes (personally whenever that happened at work I was relieved but I\u2019m weird) and that everyone thinks you\u2019re an asshole when you do that .\n\nI realised I had been walking through that same store almost daily and chances are I had completely zoned out someone who I wasn\u2019t aware wanted to talk to me and I must of looked like some asshole who thought I was to important to talk to a retail employee. I probably ignored a couple of people and made them feel like that but at the same time I should be able to get a packet of crisps without being uncomfortable.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n(PS: please be nice to people in retail, it\u2019s a tough job and they don\u2019t get paid enough to deal with assholes)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wearing headphones in the store. The context given is that she has severe social anxiety, depression, and autism. She uses the headphones to cope with public places and stressful environments. She's only using self-checkout stores, so she's not interacting with employees in that way. Her friend mentioned that someone at work was upset because someone else ignored them when they wanted to talk. The author is worried she might have done the same, making people feel like she's an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider her intentions. She's not trying to be rude; she's using the headphones for her mental health. People with social anxiety or autism might find it hard to interact in public, so the headphones are a coping mechanism. It's a reasonable way to manage her environment.\n\nOn the other hand, the employees might feel ignored if she doesn't acknowledge them. She mentioned she wasn't aware of wanting to talk to them, so maybe she didn't mean to be dismissive. But from the employees' perspective, a customer coming in with headphones on might seem like they're not approachable or are ignoring them. There's a balance here between her right to manage her mental health and the employees' feelings when not acknowledged.\n\nThe key points are her good intentions and the employees' possible feelings. Since she's not deliberately ignoring people but using the headphones for her well-being, it's not her fault. The employees, on the other hand, might need to approach customers in a way that's respectful, but that's a different aspect. The question is whether she's in the wrong. Considering her mental health needs and that she's not being intentionally rude, she's not in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
