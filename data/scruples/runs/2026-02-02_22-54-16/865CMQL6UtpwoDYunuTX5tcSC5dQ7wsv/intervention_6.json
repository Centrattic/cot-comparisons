There is one girl (20F), who's a bit of a...problem\n\nShe always brings guys back and has loud audible sex with them. Very loud. And it annoys all of us, we have early starts in the morning and well tell her to keep it down but she doesn't listen. We told security and they didn't do shit.\n\nSo we also all have exams soon and essay deadlines. And yesterday, she does it AGAIN, brings a guy back and starts having loud sex. We're all awake on this and post on the flat chat (but she wasn't going to see it anyway until after she was done having sex).\n\nI have an early start and had to be somewhere by 7am and it was 2am while this was happening.\n\nI had had enough. I banged on her door and she wouldn't open it. I bang again and she doesn't open. So I try to open it and...it's unlocked, they must have forgotten to lock it given that they came back drunk.\n\nSo I walk in and see them having sex. They both quickly see me and freak out. She says to me ''What the fuck?!!'' but I look over to the guy, the guy was a bit short and really skinny, there's no way in hell he would be a threat to me and he looked way more nervous than she does. \n\nShe keeps saying ''What the fuck?!! Get out!!'' and I say to her ''I've had enough of your fucking shit. We've all had enough of your fucking shit, you piece of shit. We're trying to sleep''. \n\nThe guy is standing there awkwardly so I tell him ''Get the fuck out'' and he doesn't do anything just stands there awkwardly, so I tell him ''I'll fucking call security, and I've got 4 other flatmates to back me up, our words against yours so get the fuck out!!'' and he gets his clothes on and runs out the flat. \n\nSo the ''problem'' girl starts crying and I tell her that she needs to sort her life out, I then to say to her ''Please leave this flat, move out. No one here fucking likes you, not even that guy you just fucked likes you enough to stay'' and she screams at me and calls me fucking cunt and asshole.\n\nI then leave and go to back to my room. I told the others what happened and they agreed with me, there's nothing I could have done. In fact they THANKED me, at least we could get to sleep and now we sent her a message, AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author, a 20-year-old guy living in a flat with five others, walked into his flatmate's room while she was having sex and refused to leave. The flatmate in question brings guys over and has loud sex, which is disturbing the others. They tried telling her to keep it down and even contacted security, but nothing changed. Eventually, when she did it again, the author went into her room during the act and told the guy to leave.\n\nHmm. Let's break this down. First, the author's actions: entering someone's room without permission and interrupting them during an intimate moment. That seems like a privacy violation, right? Even if the flatmate is being disruptive, walking into someone's room while they're having sex is a big deal. But then there's the context of the noise complaints. The flatmates tried to address the issue through normal channels, like talking to her and security, but it didn't work. So they were in a difficult situation, especially with exams and early starts.\n\nThe author's motivation was to stop the noise so they could sleep and prepare for exams. That's understandable stress. But the method he used was confrontational and invasive. Even if the guy left after being threatened, the act of entering the room without consent is a problem. The author might argue that the door was unlocked, so he wasn't breaking in, but that doesn't necessarily justify walking in uninvited. The fact that the room was unlocked doesn't mean it's okay to barge in during such a private moment.\n\nAlso, the aftermath: the flatmate was upset, called the author names, and this created tension in the flat. The other flatmates supported the author, but that doesn't automatically make it right. The author's actions could be seen as aggressive and disrespectful, even if the intention was to address a legitimate issue. There might have been other ways to handle it, like confronting her calmly, setting boundaries, or maybe even leaving the flat for the night. But storming into her room in the middle of the night is a significant overreaction.\n\nOn the other hand, the flatmate wasn't respecting the others' need for quiet and rest, which is a valid concern. The author might feel that the situation wasn't being taken seriously enough by security, leading to frustration. But does that justify the intrusion? Probably not. The right to privacy is important, even in shared living spaces. The author could have faced legal or ethical consequences for walking in on someone having sex. It's a public vs. private boundary issue.\n\nSo considering all that, the author's action of entering the room was wrong, regardless of the motivation. The method used was inappropriate, even if the problem itself was real. The answer might be A, but I should make sure I didn't miss any nuances. The author did mention that the door was unlocked, but that doesn't negate the privacy aspect. So yeah, I think the answer is A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
