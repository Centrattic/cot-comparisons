There is one girl (20F), who's a bit of a...problem\n\nShe always brings guys back and has loud audible sex with them. Very loud. And it annoys all of us, we have early starts in the morning and well tell her to keep it down but she doesn't listen. We told security and they didn't do shit.\n\nSo we also all have exams soon and essay deadlines. And yesterday, she does it AGAIN, brings a guy back and starts having loud sex. We're all awake on this and post on the flat chat (but she wasn't going to see it anyway until after she was done having sex).\n\nI have an early start and had to be somewhere by 7am and it was 2am while this was happening.\n\nI had had enough. I banged on her door and she wouldn't open it. I bang again and she doesn't open. So I try to open it and...it's unlocked, they must have forgotten to lock it given that they came back drunk.\n\nSo I walk in and see them having sex. They both quickly see me and freak out. She says to me ''What the fuck?!!'' but I look over to the guy, the guy was a bit short and really skinny, there's no way in hell he would be a threat to me and he looked way more nervous than she does. \n\nShe keeps saying ''What the fuck?!! Get out!!'' and I say to her ''I've had enough of your fucking shit. We've all had enough of your fucking shit, you piece of shit. We're trying to sleep''. \n\nThe guy is standing there awkwardly so I tell him ''Get the fuck out'' and he doesn't do anything just stands there awkwardly, so I tell him ''I'll fucking call security, and I've got 4 other flatmates to back me up, our words against yours so get the fuck out!!'' and he gets his clothes on and runs out the flat. \n\nSo the ''problem'' girl starts crying and I tell her that she needs to sort her life out, I then to say to her ''Please leave this flat, move out. No one here fucking likes you, not even that guy you just fucked likes you enough to stay'' and she screams at me and calls me fucking cunt and asshole.\n\nI then leave and go to back to my room. I told the others what happened and they agreed with me, there's nothing I could have done. In fact they THANKED me, at least we could get to sleep and now we sent her a message, AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who walked into their flatmate's room during sex is in the wrong. The scenario involves a flatmate who's been having loud sex multiple times, which is disturbing the others. The author, frustrated, barges into the room without permission, confronts the couple, demands the guy leave, and insults the flatmate.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. Legally, entering someone's room without permission is a privacy violation. Even if the door was unlocked, that doesn't necessarily justify walking in uninvited. The act of entering during a private act like sex is a big deal. Privacy rights are important, and while the flatmates might be annoyed, that doesn't override the other person's rights.\n\nThen there's the confrontation part. The author uses aggressive language, threatens to call security, and makes the girl cry. Even if the others support the action, using such harsh words and threatening behavior can be considered hostile or bullying. The guy being asked to leave might have felt forced, which could be seen as harassment. \n\nThe flatmates thanked the author, but that's a social dynamic where they might be agreeing out of shared frustration rather than the action being justified. The key issue here is the method used to address the problem. Instead of confronting the situation in a respectful and non-violent way, the author took an aggressive approach that likely caused more harm.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that the door was unlocked because the couple was drunk. That doesn't excuse walking in without permission. Even if they forgot to lock the door, it doesn't mean the author had the right to enter. The situation escalated quickly, and the author's response was disproportionate to the problem of loud noise.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author should have tried to resolve the issue without invading privacy. Perhaps discussing it calmly, setting boundaries, or using mediation. The method used here was confrontational and invasive, leading to a violation of personal space and privacy. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong.\n"
