There is one girl (20F), who's a bit of a...problem\n\nShe always brings guys back and has loud audible sex with them. Very loud. And it annoys all of us, we have early starts in the morning and well tell her to keep it down but she doesn't listen. We told security and they didn't do shit.\n\nSo we also all have exams soon and essay deadlines. And yesterday, she does it AGAIN, brings a guy back and starts having loud sex. We're all awake on this and post on the flat chat (but she wasn't going to see it anyway until after she was done having sex).\n\nI have an early start and had to be somewhere by 7am and it was 2am while this was happening.\n\nI had had enough. I banged on her door and she wouldn't open it. I bang again and she doesn't open. So I try to open it and...it's unlocked, they must have forgotten to lock it given that they came back drunk.\n\nSo I walk in and see them having sex. They both quickly see me and freak out. She says to me ''What the fuck?!!'' but I look over to the guy, the guy was a bit short and really skinny, there's no way in hell he would be a threat to me and he looked way more nervous than she does. \n\nShe keeps saying ''What the fuck?!! Get out!!'' and I say to her ''I've had enough of your fucking shit. We've all had enough of your fucking shit, you piece of shit. We're trying to sleep''. \n\nThe guy is standing there awkwardly so I tell him ''Get the fuck out'' and he doesn't do anything just stands there awkwardly, so I tell him ''I'll fucking call security, and I've got 4 other flatmates to back me up, our words against yours so get the fuck out!!'' and he gets his clothes on and runs out the flat. \n\nSo the ''problem'' girl starts crying and I tell her that she needs to sort her life out, I then to say to her ''Please leave this flat, move out. No one here fucking likes you, not even that guy you just fucked likes you enough to stay'' and she screams at me and calls me fucking cunt and asshole.\n\nI then leave and go to back to my room. I told the others what happened and they agreed with me, there's nothing I could have done. In fact they THANKED me, at least we could get to sleep and now we sent her a message, AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for walking into their flatmate's room while she was having sex and refusing to leave. Let me break down the scenario step by step.\n\nFirst, the flatmate (a girl) has been bringing guys back and having loud sex, which is disturbing the other flatmates. They've tried to address it by telling her to keep it down and even involved security, which didn't help. The author, one of the flatmates, had to go somewhere early the next day and couldn't sleep because of the noise again. Frustrated, he went to her door, found it unlocked, and walked in just as they were having sex. He confronted them, told the guy to leave, and then told the girl to move out. The girl was upset, called him names, and now he's asking if he's in the wrong.\n\nSo, the main issues here are privacy and the method used to address the problem. Even if the flatmate's actions were disruptive, walking into someone's room without their consent, especially when they're engaged in a private act like sex, is a breach of privacy. Privacy rights are important in shared living spaces, and everyone has the right to some level of personal space, even if they're violating house rules.\n\nThe flatmate had previously been warned and hadn't complied, which might justify the other residents' frustration. However, the author's response was direct confrontation without considering alternative solutions. Instead of entering the room, maybe calling security or using another method to stop the noise would have been more appropriate. Additionally, threatening the guy with security and having others back him up could be seen as intimidation. The author's language was aggressive and confrontational, which might escalate the situation rather than resolve it.\n\nAlso, the fact that the flatmate's actions were causing issues doesn't automatically make the author right in his response. There's a line between addressing a problem and violating someone's privacy. The flatmates did agree with him, but that doesn't necessarily mean his actions were justified. Group agreement doesn't override individual rights in this context.\n\nIn legal terms, walking into someone's room without permission could be considered trespassing, even in a shared living space. The author didn't have the right to enter without consent. The privacy of one's room should be respected, regardless of the circumstances. Even if the flatmate was being disruptive, the method used to address it was inappropriate.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author did cross a line by entering the room without consent and confronting them in a hostile manner. The right approach would have been to use existing communication channels or involve the appropriate authorities without direct confrontation. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
