There is one girl (20F), who's a bit of a...problem\n\nShe always brings guys back and has loud audible sex with them. Very loud. And it annoys all of us, we have early starts in the morning and well tell her to keep it down but she doesn't listen. We told security and they didn't do shit.\n\nSo we also all have exams soon and essay deadlines. And yesterday, she does it AGAIN, brings a guy back and starts having loud sex. We're all awake on this and post on the flat chat (but she wasn't going to see it anyway until after she was done having sex).\n\nI have an early start and had to be somewhere by 7am and it was 2am while this was happening.\n\nI had had enough. I banged on her door and she wouldn't open it. I bang again and she doesn't open. So I try to open it and...it's unlocked, they must have forgotten to lock it given that they came back drunk.\n\nSo I walk in and see them having sex. They both quickly see me and freak out. She says to me ''What the fuck?!!'' but I look over to the guy, the guy was a bit short and really skinny, there's no way in hell he would be a threat to me and he looked way more nervous than she does. \n\nShe keeps saying ''What the fuck?!! Get out!!'' and I say to her ''I've had enough of your fucking shit. We've all had enough of your fucking shit, you piece of shit. We're trying to sleep''. \n\nThe guy is standing there awkwardly so I tell him ''Get the fuck out'' and he doesn't do anything just stands there awkwardly, so I tell him ''I'll fucking call security, and I've got 4 other flatmates to back me up, our words against yours so get the fuck out!!'' and he gets his clothes on and runs out the flat. \n\nSo the ''problem'' girl starts crying and I tell her that she needs to sort her life out, I then to say to her ''Please leave this flat, move out. No one here fucking likes you, not even that guy you just fucked likes you enough to stay'' and she screams at me and calls me fucking cunt and asshole.\n\nI then leave and go to back to my room. I told the others what happened and they agreed with me, there's nothing I could have done. In fact they THANKED me, at least we could get to sleep and now we sent her a message, AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who walked into their flatmate's room while she was having sex and refused to leave is in the wrong. The answer options are A (Yes) or B (No). \n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The person (20M) is in a shared flat with five others, including a female flatmate who's been having loud sex with guys repeatedly, causing annoyance. They've tried talking to her, even involved security, but nothing worked. The incident in question happened when the flatmate was having sex again, and the person went into her room to confront them.\n\nKey points to consider: \n\n1. **Privacy Violation**: Walking into someone's room while they're having sex is a clear invasion of privacy. Even if the door was unlocked, entering without permission is a breach. The flatmate might have had a right to privacy, and the author's action was a direct intrusion.\n\n2. **Consent and Permission**: The author didn't ask for permission to enter. Even if the door was unlocked, that doesn't necessarily mean permission was given. People might forget to lock doors when they're drunk, but that doesn't justify entering without consent.\n\n3. **Intent and Justification**: The author's intent was to stop the noise and address ongoing issues. However, the method used was confrontational and aggressive. Yelling, calling someone a \"piece of shit,\" and threatening the guy with security could escalate tensions and be seen as overstepping.\n\n4. **Proportionality**: The response might be considered disproportionate. Instead of confronting them in a private moment, other measures like formal complaints, setting boundaries, or maybe even legal actions could be more appropriate. The author's actions led to immediate conflict and emotional distress for the flatmate.\n\n5. **Legal Implications**: In many jurisdictions, walking into someone's private space during intimate activity could be considered illegal, even if the door was unlocked. It might be considered voyeurism or harassment.\n\n6. **Flatmate Agreement**: If the flatmates agreed with the action, does that make it right? Not necessarily. Group consensus doesn't override individual rights to privacy. Even if others were annoyed, the method used was inappropriate.\n\n7. **Consequences**: The flatmate was crying and upset, which indicates that the action had negative effects on her. The author's response was harsh, and the flatmates' gratitude doesn't mitigate the privacy violation.\n\nConsidering all these factors, the author's actions, while stemming from frustration, crossed a line by invading someone's privacy in a very personal situation. The response was aggressive and could be seen as a violation of the flatmate's rights, regardless of the prior issues with noise. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong.\n"
