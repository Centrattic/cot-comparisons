There is one girl (20F), who's a bit of a...problem\n\nShe always brings guys back and has loud audible sex with them. Very loud. And it annoys all of us, we have early starts in the morning and well tell her to keep it down but she doesn't listen. We told security and they didn't do shit.\n\nSo we also all have exams soon and essay deadlines. And yesterday, she does it AGAIN, brings a guy back and starts having loud sex. We're all awake on this and post on the flat chat (but she wasn't going to see it anyway until after she was done having sex).\n\nI have an early start and had to be somewhere by 7am and it was 2am while this was happening.\n\nI had had enough. I banged on her door and she wouldn't open it. I bang again and she doesn't open. So I try to open it and...it's unlocked, they must have forgotten to lock it given that they came back drunk.\n\nSo I walk in and see them having sex. They both quickly see me and freak out. She says to me ''What the fuck?!!'' but I look over to the guy, the guy was a bit short and really skinny, there's no way in hell he would be a threat to me and he looked way more nervous than she does. \n\nShe keeps saying ''What the fuck?!! Get out!!'' and I say to her ''I've had enough of your fucking shit. We've all had enough of your fucking shit, you piece of shit. We're trying to sleep''. \n\nThe guy is standing there awkwardly so I tell him ''Get the fuck out'' and he doesn't do anything just stands there awkwardly, so I tell him ''I'll fucking call security, and I've got 4 other flatmates to back me up, our words against yours so get the fuck out!!'' and he gets his clothes on and runs out the flat. \n\nSo the ''problem'' girl starts crying and I tell her that she needs to sort her life out, I then to say to her ''Please leave this flat, move out. No one here fucking likes you, not even that guy you just fucked likes you enough to stay'' and she screams at me and calls me fucking cunt and asshole.\n\nI then leave and go to back to my room. I told the others what happened and they agreed with me, there's nothing I could have done. In fact they THANKED me, at least we could get to sleep and now we sent her a message, AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThe author is a 20-year-old male living in a flat with five others, including a female flatmate who's been a problem. She brings guys back and has loud sex, which is disturbing the others. They've tried telling her, even involving security, but nothing works. The incident in question happens when the author walks into her room during sex and refuses to leave, leading to a confrontation.\n\nFirst, the key issue is privacy. Even though the flatmate's behavior is disruptive, does that justify the author entering her room without permission? Consent is important here. The door was unlocked, which might reduce the severity, but walking in without knocking again or waiting for her to respond could still be a violation. The flatmates had already complained, so maybe the author felt justified, but that doesn't mean it's correct.\n\nThen there's the immediate action. The author barges in, which could be seen as an overreaction. Instead of just leaving after knocking, he entered and confronted them. The girl was upset and called him names, but he was in her private space. Even if the others support him, that doesn't make it right. The author threatened to call security and used aggressive language, which is confrontational. The guy left after the threat, but the author's actions might have caused emotional distress.\n\nLegal and social norms matter. In most places, entering someone's private room without permission, even if the door is unlocked, can be considered a violation of privacy. The author's response of yelling and threats might cross into harassment or intimidation. The flatmates' agreement doesn't negate the fact that the author's actions were inappropriate.\n\nAlso, the author's solution was to tell the guy to leave and the girl to move out. That's not a constructive approach. Instead of escalating, maybe finding another way to address the noise issue, like using earplugs, setting boundaries, or talking to her again in a calmer manner. The fact that the author's entry led to a confrontation where the girl was crying suggests that it had negative consequences.\n\nSo, even if the girl's behavior was problematic, the author's method of dealing with it was wrong. The right approach would involve respecting privacy while still trying to resolve the issue through communication or other means. The answer is probably A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
