There is one girl (20F), who's a bit of a...problem\n\nShe always brings guys back and has loud audible sex with them. Very loud. And it annoys all of us, we have early starts in the morning and well tell her to keep it down but she doesn't listen. We told security and they didn't do shit.\n\nSo we also all have exams soon and essay deadlines. And yesterday, she does it AGAIN, brings a guy back and starts having loud sex. We're all awake on this and post on the flat chat (but she wasn't going to see it anyway until after she was done having sex).\n\nI have an early start and had to be somewhere by 7am and it was 2am while this was happening.\n\nI had had enough. I banged on her door and she wouldn't open it. I bang again and she doesn't open. So I try to open it and...it's unlocked, they must have forgotten to lock it given that they came back drunk.\n\nSo I walk in and see them having sex. They both quickly see me and freak out. She says to me ''What the fuck?!!'' but I look over to the guy, the guy was a bit short and really skinny, there's no way in hell he would be a threat to me and he looked way more nervous than she does. \n\nShe keeps saying ''What the fuck?!! Get out!!'' and I say to her ''I've had enough of your fucking shit. We've all had enough of your fucking shit, you piece of shit. We're trying to sleep''. \n\nThe guy is standing there awkwardly so I tell him ''Get the fuck out'' and he doesn't do anything just stands there awkwardly, so I tell him ''I'll fucking call security, and I've got 4 other flatmates to back me up, our words against yours so get the fuck out!!'' and he gets his clothes on and runs out the flat. \n\nSo the ''problem'' girl starts crying and I tell her that she needs to sort her life out, I then to say to her ''Please leave this flat, move out. No one here fucking likes you, not even that guy you just fucked likes you enough to stay'' and she screams at me and calls me fucking cunt and asshole.\n\nI then leave and go to back to my room. I told the others what happened and they agreed with me, there's nothing I could have done. In fact they THANKED me, at least we could get to sleep and now we sent her a message, AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the person in the situation is in the wrong. Let me read through the details again to make sure I understand everything.\n\nThe author, a 20-year-old male, lives in a flat with five others at university. One of the flatmates is a girl who often brings guys back and has very loud sex, which the others find annoying because they have early starts. They've tried telling her to keep it down, even alerted security, but nothing changed. On this particular instance, the author had an early start and it was 2am when the noise started again. He went to her door, knocked, but she didn't open. He tried to open it and found it unlocked, then walked in and saw them having sex. The girl was upset, and the author confronted her, telling her to leave the flat. The guy left after being threatened with calling security, and the author got yelled at by the girl.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author isn't in the wrong but is curious about my take. The options are A (Yes, in the wrong) or B (No).\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and social aspects. In many places, walking into someone's room without permission, even if it's a shared living space, can be seen as a violation of privacy. The author had no prior communication with the flatmate about this being an issue, beyond maybe general complaints. Even though the door was unlocked, entering without consent when someone is engaged in private activities (like having sex) is generally not considered acceptable. The author's actions, while intended to address the noise problem, were direct and intrusive.\n\nThen there's the confrontation. The author used aggressive language, called her a \"piece of shit,\" and told her to move out. The verbal abuse here is problematic, regardless of the context. Even if the others supported him, it's not a justification for using such strong language. The guy being in the room was also addressed harshly, which could be seen as overstepping, especially since he wasn't the one who initially complained about the noise.\n\nThe flatmates thanked him, but that might be more about the resolution of the noise issue rather than the manner in which it was handled. However, the method he used was confrontational and potentially illegal. Privacy rights are important, and entering someone's room without their permission, even if it's a shared space, is a serious issue. The author might have been justified in wanting to address the noise, but the approach was extreme. He could have tried other methods, like using a door speaker or a more polite, non-intrusive approach. Threatening to call security and using others as backup adds another layer of conflict and potential escalation.\n\nIn terms of possible consequences, the girl might have a valid claim for invasion of privacy, depending on local laws. Even if the door was unlocked, entering without being invited in is a problem. Plus, the verbal abuse could lead to further tension or even legal issues if she decides to report it.\n\nSo, while the author's intentions were to solve a recurring problem, the method was inappropriate. He crossed a line by entering the room and using aggressive language. Therefore, I think the author is in the wrong. The answer would be A.\n"
