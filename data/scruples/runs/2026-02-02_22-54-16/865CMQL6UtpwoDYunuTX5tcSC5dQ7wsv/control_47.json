There is one girl (20F), who's a bit of a...problem\n\nShe always brings guys back and has loud audible sex with them. Very loud. And it annoys all of us, we have early starts in the morning and well tell her to keep it down but she doesn't listen. We told security and they didn't do shit.\n\nSo we also all have exams soon and essay deadlines. And yesterday, she does it AGAIN, brings a guy back and starts having loud sex. We're all awake on this and post on the flat chat (but she wasn't going to see it anyway until after she was done having sex).\n\nI have an early start and had to be somewhere by 7am and it was 2am while this was happening.\n\nI had had enough. I banged on her door and she wouldn't open it. I bang again and she doesn't open. So I try to open it and...it's unlocked, they must have forgotten to lock it given that they came back drunk.\n\nSo I walk in and see them having sex. They both quickly see me and freak out. She says to me ''What the fuck?!!'' but I look over to the guy, the guy was a bit short and really skinny, there's no way in hell he would be a threat to me and he looked way more nervous than she does. \n\nShe keeps saying ''What the fuck?!! Get out!!'' and I say to her ''I've had enough of your fucking shit. We've all had enough of your fucking shit, you piece of shit. We're trying to sleep''. \n\nThe guy is standing there awkwardly so I tell him ''Get the fuck out'' and he doesn't do anything just stands there awkwardly, so I tell him ''I'll fucking call security, and I've got 4 other flatmates to back me up, our words against yours so get the fuck out!!'' and he gets his clothes on and runs out the flat. \n\nSo the ''problem'' girl starts crying and I tell her that she needs to sort her life out, I then to say to her ''Please leave this flat, move out. No one here fucking likes you, not even that guy you just fucked likes you enough to stay'' and she screams at me and calls me fucking cunt and asshole.\n\nI then leave and go to back to my room. I told the others what happened and they agreed with me, there's nothing I could have done. In fact they THANKED me, at least we could get to sleep and now we sent her a message, AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for walking into their flatmate's room while she was having sex and refusing to leave.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The flatmate has a history of loud sex that's disturbing the others. They've tried talking to her and even contacted security, but she hasn't changed. The author, frustrated, decides to take matters into his own hands. \n\nHe knocks on her door multiple times, then enters when it's unlocked. He confronts both the flatmate and her partner, tells them to leave, and the guy does. The flatmate is upset and angry.\n\nNow, the key points here are privacy and the method used. Even if the flatmate's actions were disruptive, entering someone's room without permission, especially while they're having sex, is a privacy violation. The author didn't call security; he took direct action, which could be seen as aggressive. The flatmate's right to privacy in her own room is important. \n\nEven though the others were annoyed, the author's response was confrontational and potentially illegal. He used threats (\"call security, our words against yours\") to get the guy to leave. That could be seen as harassment or assault depending on local laws. The fact that he was in the room during the act makes it a privacy invasion regardless of noise issues.\n\nThe flatmates agreeing with him doesn't change the legal or ethical stance. The author's actions overstepped, so he's in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
