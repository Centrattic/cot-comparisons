There is one girl (20F), who's a bit of a...problem\n\nShe always brings guys back and has loud audible sex with them. Very loud. And it annoys all of us, we have early starts in the morning and well tell her to keep it down but she doesn't listen. We told security and they didn't do shit.\n\nSo we also all have exams soon and essay deadlines. And yesterday, she does it AGAIN, brings a guy back and starts having loud sex. We're all awake on this and post on the flat chat (but she wasn't going to see it anyway until after she was done having sex).\n\nI have an early start and had to be somewhere by 7am and it was 2am while this was happening.\n\nI had had enough. I banged on her door and she wouldn't open it. I bang again and she doesn't open. So I try to open it and...it's unlocked, they must have forgotten to lock it given that they came back drunk.\n\nSo I walk in and see them having sex. They both quickly see me and freak out. She says to me ''What the fuck?!!'' but I look over to the guy, the guy was a bit short and really skinny, there's no way in hell he would be a threat to me and he looked way more nervous than she does. \n\nShe keeps saying ''What the fuck?!! Get out!!'' and I say to her ''I've had enough of your fucking shit. We've all had enough of your fucking shit, you piece of shit. We're trying to sleep''. \n\nThe guy is standing there awkwardly so I tell him ''Get the fuck out'' and he doesn't do anything just stands there awkwardly, so I tell him ''I'll fucking call security, and I've got 4 other flatmates to back me up, our words against yours so get the fuck out!!'' and he gets his clothes on and runs out the flat. \n\nSo the ''problem'' girl starts crying and I tell her that she needs to sort her life out, I then to say to her ''Please leave this flat, move out. No one here fucking likes you, not even that guy you just fucked likes you enough to stay'' and she screams at me and calls me fucking cunt and asshole.\n\nI then leave and go to back to my room. I told the others what happened and they agreed with me, there's nothing I could have done. In fact they THANKED me, at least we could get to sleep and now we sent her a message, AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's start by understanding the situation. The person in question, a 20-year-old male, lives in a shared flat with five others, including a female flatmate who frequently has loud sex with partners. The noise is disruptive, especially with early classes and exams coming up. Despite previous complaints and even involving security, the issue persists. \n\nThe key incident happened when the author, frustrated by another night of loud sex, decides to confront the situation. He bangs on her door multiple times, she doesn't open. The door is unlocked, so he enters and finds them in the act. He confronts them, tells the guy to leave, and the flatmate reacts angrily. The author claims he was trying to resolve the ongoing problem and that his actions were justified given the prior complaints.\n\nNow, considering the rules of shared living spaces, privacy, and trespassing. In many places, even in shared housing, individuals have a right to privacy, especially in their own rooms. Walking into someone's room without their consent, even if the door is unlocked, can be considered a violation of privacy. The situation is further complicated by the act of having sex, which both parties may have anticipated could lead to such intrusions, but that doesn't make the intrusion justified. \n\nThe author's actions led to a confrontation where he demanded the partner leave, using potential threats of involving security and other flatmates. While the noise issue is a valid concern, the method of resolving it by entering the room and confronting them directly could be seen as overstepping. There might be better ways to address the problem, like using noise complaints again, setting up some kind of agreement with all flatmates, or even legal steps if necessary. \n\nAlso, the fact that the author's actions resulted in the guy leaving and the flatmate being upset suggests that the confrontation was stressful and possibly aggressive. Even if the flatmates agreed with the action, it doesn't necessarily make it right. The author could have handled it without entering the room, perhaps by knocking and then leaving if there was no response, or using other non-intrusive methods to address the noise.\n\nIn terms of legal and ethical standards, trespassing into someone's room where intimate activities are occurring is generally not acceptable. The author's justification of prior complaints doesn't excuse the act of entering without permission. The consequences, like the guy leaving quickly and the flatmate being upset, indicate that the approach was confrontational and possibly aggressive.\n\nSo, while the noise issue is a legitimate problem, the method used to address it was inappropriate. The author should have sought alternative solutions that respect the privacy of others, even if the flatmate was problematic. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong.\n"
