There is one girl (20F), who's a bit of a...problem\n\nShe always brings guys back and has loud audible sex with them. Very loud. And it annoys all of us, we have early starts in the morning and well tell her to keep it down but she doesn't listen. We told security and they didn't do shit.\n\nSo we also all have exams soon and essay deadlines. And yesterday, she does it AGAIN, brings a guy back and starts having loud sex. We're all awake on this and post on the flat chat (but she wasn't going to see it anyway until after she was done having sex).\n\nI have an early start and had to be somewhere by 7am and it was 2am while this was happening.\n\nI had had enough. I banged on her door and she wouldn't open it. I bang again and she doesn't open. So I try to open it and...it's unlocked, they must have forgotten to lock it given that they came back drunk.\n\nSo I walk in and see them having sex. They both quickly see me and freak out. She says to me ''What the fuck?!!'' but I look over to the guy, the guy was a bit short and really skinny, there's no way in hell he would be a threat to me and he looked way more nervous than she does. \n\nShe keeps saying ''What the fuck?!! Get out!!'' and I say to her ''I've had enough of your fucking shit. We've all had enough of your fucking shit, you piece of shit. We're trying to sleep''. \n\nThe guy is standing there awkwardly so I tell him ''Get the fuck out'' and he doesn't do anything just stands there awkwardly, so I tell him ''I'll fucking call security, and I've got 4 other flatmates to back me up, our words against yours so get the fuck out!!'' and he gets his clothes on and runs out the flat. \n\nSo the ''problem'' girl starts crying and I tell her that she needs to sort her life out, I then to say to her ''Please leave this flat, move out. No one here fucking likes you, not even that guy you just fucked likes you enough to stay'' and she screams at me and calls me fucking cunt and asshole.\n\nI then leave and go to back to my room. I told the others what happened and they agreed with me, there's nothing I could have done. In fact they THANKED me, at least we could get to sleep and now we sent her a message, AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for walking into their flatmate's room while she was having sex and refusing to leave.\n\nFirst, the situation: The flatmate is having loud sex repeatedly, others have tried to address it without success. The author, frustrated, storms into her room when she's in the middle of another session. The door was unlocked, so he just walks in. They confront her and the guy, tell them to leave, and the guy complies. The flatmate gets angry, calls him names, and he leaves. The other flatmates agree with him.\n\nNow, the key points here. Entering someone's room without permission is a privacy violation. Even if the door is unlocked, that doesn't give someone the right to barge in uninvited. The act of walking into a private space where people are engaged in intimate activity is a big deal. Legally, depending on the country, this could be considered voyeurism or invasion of privacy. Ethically, it's a clear breach of trust and boundaries. The author's intention was to stop the noise, which is understandable, but the method was extreme. They could have taken other steps, like talking to her directly again, involving higher authorities if needed, or even using earplugs. Instead, they took matters into their own hands, which led to a confrontational and potentially illegal situation. The flatmate's reaction is also a sign that this was a serious overstep. While the author might have had the support of others, that doesn't justify the action. So, the answer is likely that the author is in the wrong.\n"
