There is one girl (20F), who's a bit of a...problem\n\nShe always brings guys back and has loud audible sex with them. Very loud. And it annoys all of us, we have early starts in the morning and well tell her to keep it down but she doesn't listen. We told security and they didn't do shit.\n\nSo we also all have exams soon and essay deadlines. And yesterday, she does it AGAIN, brings a guy back and starts having loud sex. We're all awake on this and post on the flat chat (but she wasn't going to see it anyway until after she was done having sex).\n\nI have an early start and had to be somewhere by 7am and it was 2am while this was happening.\n\nI had had enough. I banged on her door and she wouldn't open it. I bang again and she doesn't open. So I try to open it and...it's unlocked, they must have forgotten to lock it given that they came back drunk.\n\nSo I walk in and see them having sex. They both quickly see me and freak out. She says to me ''What the fuck?!!'' but I look over to the guy, the guy was a bit short and really skinny, there's no way in hell he would be a threat to me and he looked way more nervous than she does. \n\nShe keeps saying ''What the fuck?!! Get out!!'' and I say to her ''I've had enough of your fucking shit. We've all had enough of your fucking shit, you piece of shit. We're trying to sleep''. \n\nThe guy is standing there awkwardly so I tell him ''Get the fuck out'' and he doesn't do anything just stands there awkwardly, so I tell him ''I'll fucking call security, and I've got 4 other flatmates to back me up, our words against yours so get the fuck out!!'' and he gets his clothes on and runs out the flat. \n\nSo the ''problem'' girl starts crying and I tell her that she needs to sort her life out, I then to say to her ''Please leave this flat, move out. No one here fucking likes you, not even that guy you just fucked likes you enough to stay'' and she screams at me and calls me fucking cunt and asshole.\n\nI then leave and go to back to my room. I told the others what happened and they agreed with me, there's nothing I could have done. In fact they THANKED me, at least we could get to sleep and now we sent her a message, AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for walking into his flatmate's room while she was having sex and refusing to leave. The scenario is that the flatmate has been consistently having loud sex, disturbing others, and the author finally confronts her by entering the room. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. In many places, entering someone's private space without permission, especially when they're having sex, is a violation of their privacy. Even if the author had a reason, like noise complaints, forcefully entering the room when the door was unlocked might still be considered an invasion. The flatmate had the right to privacy in her own room, and the author's actions could be seen as trespassing or harassment.\n\nThen there's the social dynamics. The author mentions that others in the flat were also annoyed and supported him, but that doesn't necessarily justify his actions. The situation might have escalated if he hadn't acted, but the method he used\u2014entering without permission and confronting them in such a personal moment\u2014could be problematic. \n\nThe guy's reaction and being scared is a red flag. The author threatened to call security and used others to back him up, which might be seen as bullying. Even if the flatmate was causing disturbances, the way he handled it could lead to legal consequences, like being charged with unlawful entry or assault if there was any physical confrontation.\n\nAlso, communication methods matter. The author should have tried other means first, like formal complaints or legal actions, instead of taking it into his own hands. The flatmates thanking him doesn't absolve him of potential wrongdoing. \n\nIn summary, while the flatmate's behavior was disruptive, the author's response crossed a line into violating privacy and using intimidation. Therefore, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
