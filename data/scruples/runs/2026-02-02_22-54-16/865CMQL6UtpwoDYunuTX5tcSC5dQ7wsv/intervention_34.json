There is one girl (20F), who's a bit of a...problem\n\nShe always brings guys back and has loud audible sex with them. Very loud. And it annoys all of us, we have early starts in the morning and well tell her to keep it down but she doesn't listen. We told security and they didn't do shit.\n\nSo we also all have exams soon and essay deadlines. And yesterday, she does it AGAIN, brings a guy back and starts having loud sex. We're all awake on this and post on the flat chat (but she wasn't going to see it anyway until after she was done having sex).\n\nI have an early start and had to be somewhere by 7am and it was 2am while this was happening.\n\nI had had enough. I banged on her door and she wouldn't open it. I bang again and she doesn't open. So I try to open it and...it's unlocked, they must have forgotten to lock it given that they came back drunk.\n\nSo I walk in and see them having sex. They both quickly see me and freak out. She says to me ''What the fuck?!!'' but I look over to the guy, the guy was a bit short and really skinny, there's no way in hell he would be a threat to me and he looked way more nervous than she does. \n\nShe keeps saying ''What the fuck?!! Get out!!'' and I say to her ''I've had enough of your fucking shit. We've all had enough of your fucking shit, you piece of shit. We're trying to sleep''. \n\nThe guy is standing there awkwardly so I tell him ''Get the fuck out'' and he doesn't do anything just stands there awkwardly, so I tell him ''I'll fucking call security, and I've got 4 other flatmates to back me up, our words against yours so get the fuck out!!'' and he gets his clothes on and runs out the flat. \n\nSo the ''problem'' girl starts crying and I tell her that she needs to sort her life out, I then to say to her ''Please leave this flat, move out. No one here fucking likes you, not even that guy you just fucked likes you enough to stay'' and she screams at me and calls me fucking cunt and asshole.\n\nI then leave and go to back to my room. I told the others what happened and they agreed with me, there's nothing I could have done. In fact they THANKED me, at least we could get to sleep and now we sent her a message, AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for walking into their flatmate's room during an intimate moment and refusing to leave. \n\nFirst, the situation: the flatmate (a girl) brings guys over and has loud sex, which is disturbing others. They've tried talking to her and even involved security, but nothing changes. The author, frustrated, enters her room when she's having sex again. He sees them, confronts them, tells the guy to leave, and the flatmate is upset.\n\nNow, the key points here. The author entered without permission during a private act. Even if the door was unlocked, that doesn't give anyone the right to walk in uninvited. Privacy is a big deal here. The act of entering someone's room when they're having sex is a serious invasion of privacy. \n\nBut then, the context: the noise was disruptive, others were affected, and previous attempts to address it failed. The author's frustration is understandable. However, the way he handled it\u2014storming in, confronting them, threatening the guy with security and others\u2014crosses into problematic territory. \n\nEven if the flatmate was at fault for the noise, the author's actions were a direct violation of her privacy and autonomy. The confrontation could be seen as aggressive and possibly illegal if he didn't have a legitimate reason to be there. The fact that the door was unlocked doesn't absolve him because entering without consent is still a breach.\n\nThe flatmate's anger and the guy leaving quickly suggest that the author's presence and demands were unwelcome. The author's justification is based on collective frustration, but that doesn't make the invasion of privacy right. There are better ways to handle such situations, like mediation or legal means, rather than personal confrontation.\n\nSo, despite the understandable annoyance, the author's actions were a clear violation. Therefore, he's in the wrong.\n"
