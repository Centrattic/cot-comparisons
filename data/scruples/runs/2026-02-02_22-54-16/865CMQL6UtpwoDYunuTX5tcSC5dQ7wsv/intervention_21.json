There is one girl (20F), who's a bit of a...problem\n\nShe always brings guys back and has loud audible sex with them. Very loud. And it annoys all of us, we have early starts in the morning and well tell her to keep it down but she doesn't listen. We told security and they didn't do shit.\n\nSo we also all have exams soon and essay deadlines. And yesterday, she does it AGAIN, brings a guy back and starts having loud sex. We're all awake on this and post on the flat chat (but she wasn't going to see it anyway until after she was done having sex).\n\nI have an early start and had to be somewhere by 7am and it was 2am while this was happening.\n\nI had had enough. I banged on her door and she wouldn't open it. I bang again and she doesn't open. So I try to open it and...it's unlocked, they must have forgotten to lock it given that they came back drunk.\n\nSo I walk in and see them having sex. They both quickly see me and freak out. She says to me ''What the fuck?!!'' but I look over to the guy, the guy was a bit short and really skinny, there's no way in hell he would be a threat to me and he looked way more nervous than she does. \n\nShe keeps saying ''What the fuck?!! Get out!!'' and I say to her ''I've had enough of your fucking shit. We've all had enough of your fucking shit, you piece of shit. We're trying to sleep''. \n\nThe guy is standing there awkwardly so I tell him ''Get the fuck out'' and he doesn't do anything just stands there awkwardly, so I tell him ''I'll fucking call security, and I've got 4 other flatmates to back me up, our words against yours so get the fuck out!!'' and he gets his clothes on and runs out the flat. \n\nSo the ''problem'' girl starts crying and I tell her that she needs to sort her life out, I then to say to her ''Please leave this flat, move out. No one here fucking likes you, not even that guy you just fucked likes you enough to stay'' and she screams at me and calls me fucking cunt and asshole.\n\nI then leave and go to back to my room. I told the others what happened and they agreed with me, there's nothing I could have done. In fact they THANKED me, at least we could get to sleep and now we sent her a message, AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for walking into their flatmate's room while she was having sex and refusing to leave. The situation involves a group of university students living together. The main issue here is the flatmate's loud sex, which the others have repeatedly asked her to keep down, but she hasn't listened. They even involved security, which didn't help.\n\nSo the author, frustrated by the noise and needing to get up early, decides to confront her. He bangs on the door, she doesn't open, he walks in when it's unlocked, sees them having sex, and then tells the guy to leave, leading to a confrontation. The flatmate gets upset, calls him names, and he leaves, later getting support from other flatmates.\n\nHmm. Legally, walking into someone's room without permission could be an invasion of privacy. Even if the door was unlocked, entering without consent might still be problematic. The fact that he saw them having sex is definitely an intrusion. But the context is that there's been a pattern of behavior that's disturbing the others, and they've tried other avenues like telling her and reporting to security.\n\nThe author's intention was to stop the noise, which is understandable. However, the method he used\u2014entering her room and confronting them\u2014might not be the right approach. Even if the door was unlocked, entering without being invited could be considered a breach of privacy. The guy leaving after being told to might be okay, but the initial act of entering and witnessing the act is where the problem lies.\n\nAlso, the flatmate was upset and called him names, which might indicate that she felt her privacy was violated. The author's response was aggressive and confrontational, which might escalate the situation. Even though his roommates agreed with him, legally and ethically, there's a question about respecting personal boundaries.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the situation is complex. While the author had legitimate grievances, the way he handled it might not be the best approach. There might be alternative solutions like setting clearer boundaries, using soundproofing, or involving proper channels again. But since they've already tried those and it didn't work, his frustration is understandable. However, breaking into someone's room, even if unlocked, is a privacy violation. So maybe the answer is that he's in the wrong, but it's a nuanced situation.\n"
