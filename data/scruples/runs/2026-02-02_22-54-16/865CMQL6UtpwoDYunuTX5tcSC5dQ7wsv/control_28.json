There is one girl (20F), who's a bit of a...problem\n\nShe always brings guys back and has loud audible sex with them. Very loud. And it annoys all of us, we have early starts in the morning and well tell her to keep it down but she doesn't listen. We told security and they didn't do shit.\n\nSo we also all have exams soon and essay deadlines. And yesterday, she does it AGAIN, brings a guy back and starts having loud sex. We're all awake on this and post on the flat chat (but she wasn't going to see it anyway until after she was done having sex).\n\nI have an early start and had to be somewhere by 7am and it was 2am while this was happening.\n\nI had had enough. I banged on her door and she wouldn't open it. I bang again and she doesn't open. So I try to open it and...it's unlocked, they must have forgotten to lock it given that they came back drunk.\n\nSo I walk in and see them having sex. They both quickly see me and freak out. She says to me ''What the fuck?!!'' but I look over to the guy, the guy was a bit short and really skinny, there's no way in hell he would be a threat to me and he looked way more nervous than she does. \n\nShe keeps saying ''What the fuck?!! Get out!!'' and I say to her ''I've had enough of your fucking shit. We've all had enough of your fucking shit, you piece of shit. We're trying to sleep''. \n\nThe guy is standing there awkwardly so I tell him ''Get the fuck out'' and he doesn't do anything just stands there awkwardly, so I tell him ''I'll fucking call security, and I've got 4 other flatmates to back me up, our words against yours so get the fuck out!!'' and he gets his clothes on and runs out the flat. \n\nSo the ''problem'' girl starts crying and I tell her that she needs to sort her life out, I then to say to her ''Please leave this flat, move out. No one here fucking likes you, not even that guy you just fucked likes you enough to stay'' and she screams at me and calls me fucking cunt and asshole.\n\nI then leave and go to back to my room. I told the others what happened and they agreed with me, there's nothing I could have done. In fact they THANKED me, at least we could get to sleep and now we sent her a message, AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who walked into their flatmate's room during sex and refused to leave is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The flatmate has a history of having loud sex that's disturbing others, and they've tried talking to her and even contacted security without success. The author was sleep-deprived due to early exams and had to leave by 7 AM, but it was 2 AM when they entered the room.\n\nSo, the key points here are: entering someone's private space without permission, even if the door was unlocked. Legally and socially, walking into someone's room while they're having sex is a privacy violation. The author's actions, while motivated by frustration, crossed a line. Even if the flatmate was being a problem, the right approach would be to address the issue without intruding on her privacy in such a direct and confrontational manner. \n\nThe author's response was aggressive, involving yelling, threatening to call security, and forcing the guy to leave. The flatmate's emotional reaction (crying) is understandable given the violation. While the roommates might have appreciated the immediate result (quiet), the method used was inappropriate. \n\nIn most legal systems, entering someone's private room without consent, especially during an intimate act, is a breach of privacy. The author's actions could lead to legal consequences, even if the door was unlocked. The fact that the door was unlocked doesn't automatically grant permission to enter. \n\nSo, despite the context of prior issues, the act of entering without permission and the confrontational behavior make the author at fault. Therefore, the answer should be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
