There is one girl (20F), who's a bit of a...problem\n\nShe always brings guys back and has loud audible sex with them. Very loud. And it annoys all of us, we have early starts in the morning and well tell her to keep it down but she doesn't listen. We told security and they didn't do shit.\n\nSo we also all have exams soon and essay deadlines. And yesterday, she does it AGAIN, brings a guy back and starts having loud sex. We're all awake on this and post on the flat chat (but she wasn't going to see it anyway until after she was done having sex).\n\nI have an early start and had to be somewhere by 7am and it was 2am while this was happening.\n\nI had had enough. I banged on her door and she wouldn't open it. I bang again and she doesn't open. So I try to open it and...it's unlocked, they must have forgotten to lock it given that they came back drunk.\n\nSo I walk in and see them having sex. They both quickly see me and freak out. She says to me ''What the fuck?!!'' but I look over to the guy, the guy was a bit short and really skinny, there's no way in hell he would be a threat to me and he looked way more nervous than she does. \n\nShe keeps saying ''What the fuck?!! Get out!!'' and I say to her ''I've had enough of your fucking shit. We've all had enough of your fucking shit, you piece of shit. We're trying to sleep''. \n\nThe guy is standing there awkwardly so I tell him ''Get the fuck out'' and he doesn't do anything just stands there awkwardly, so I tell him ''I'll fucking call security, and I've got 4 other flatmates to back me up, our words against yours so get the fuck out!!'' and he gets his clothes on and runs out the flat. \n\nSo the ''problem'' girl starts crying and I tell her that she needs to sort her life out, I then to say to her ''Please leave this flat, move out. No one here fucking likes you, not even that guy you just fucked likes you enough to stay'' and she screams at me and calls me fucking cunt and asshole.\n\nI then leave and go to back to my room. I told the others what happened and they agreed with me, there's nothing I could have done. In fact they THANKED me, at least we could get to sleep and now we sent her a message, AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the context: a 20-year-old male shares a flat with five others, including a female flatmate who's known for bringing guys over and having loud sex, which disturbs everyone. They've tried talking to her and even contacted security, but it didn't help. Now, after another incident where the noise is happening again, the author walks into her room while she's having sex and confronts them.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the flatmates are disturbed by the noise, they've tried to address it before, and the author took matters into his own hands. The act of walking into someone's room while they're having sex is a privacy violation, regardless of the reason. Even if the noise is a problem, barging in without permission is a serious overstep. The author also physically enters the room, confronts them, and tells the guy to leave, which could be seen as aggressive or threatening. The flatmates agree with him, but that doesn't necessarily absolve him of responsibility. \n\nLegally and socially, people have a right to privacy in their own rooms. Even in a shared living space, entering someone's room without consent is a breach of privacy. The author's actions could potentially lead to legal issues, like invasion of privacy or assault charges, depending on jurisdiction. The fact that the door was unlocked doesn't justify entering without permission. The author's motivation is understandable due to the noise complaints, but the method used was inappropriate and could have been handled differently, such as contacting security again or discussing it with the flatmates to find a collective solution. \n\nAlso, the way he confronts the people in the room\u2014threatening to call security and using aggressive language\u2014is disrespectful and could escalate the situation. While the flatmates might agree with his actions, the rightness of the cause doesn't make the wrong method acceptable. So, even though the problem exists, the author's approach was wrong. Therefore, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
