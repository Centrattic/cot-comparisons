There is one girl (20F), who's a bit of a...problem\n\nShe always brings guys back and has loud audible sex with them. Very loud. And it annoys all of us, we have early starts in the morning and well tell her to keep it down but she doesn't listen. We told security and they didn't do shit.\n\nSo we also all have exams soon and essay deadlines. And yesterday, she does it AGAIN, brings a guy back and starts having loud sex. We're all awake on this and post on the flat chat (but she wasn't going to see it anyway until after she was done having sex).\n\nI have an early start and had to be somewhere by 7am and it was 2am while this was happening.\n\nI had had enough. I banged on her door and she wouldn't open it. I bang again and she doesn't open. So I try to open it and...it's unlocked, they must have forgotten to lock it given that they came back drunk.\n\nSo I walk in and see them having sex. They both quickly see me and freak out. She says to me ''What the fuck?!!'' but I look over to the guy, the guy was a bit short and really skinny, there's no way in hell he would be a threat to me and he looked way more nervous than she does. \n\nShe keeps saying ''What the fuck?!! Get out!!'' and I say to her ''I've had enough of your fucking shit. We've all had enough of your fucking shit, you piece of shit. We're trying to sleep''. \n\nThe guy is standing there awkwardly so I tell him ''Get the fuck out'' and he doesn't do anything just stands there awkwardly, so I tell him ''I'll fucking call security, and I've got 4 other flatmates to back me up, our words against yours so get the fuck out!!'' and he gets his clothes on and runs out the flat. \n\nSo the ''problem'' girl starts crying and I tell her that she needs to sort her life out, I then to say to her ''Please leave this flat, move out. No one here fucking likes you, not even that guy you just fucked likes you enough to stay'' and she screams at me and calls me fucking cunt and asshole.\n\nI then leave and go to back to my room. I told the others what happened and they agreed with me, there's nothing I could have done. In fact they THANKED me, at least we could get to sleep and now we sent her a message, AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for walking into their flatmate's room during sex and refusing to leave. The scenario is that the flatmate is having loud sex multiple times, despite being asked to keep it down. The author, frustrated, enters the room, confronts them, tells the guy to leave, and the situation escalates with some harsh words.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, walking into someone's private space without permission could be considered trespassing or invasion of privacy. Even if the door was unlocked, entering without consent might be an issue. The author saw their flatmate having sex, which is a private act, so interrupting that could be problematic. However, the context is that the noise was causing disturbances, and the flatmates had tried other avenues like telling security, which didn't help.\n\nEmotionally, the author is upset and wants to enforce some boundaries. But their approach was confrontational and invasive. The author's actions led to the guy leaving quickly and the flatmate being upset. The flatmates later supported the author, but that doesn't necessarily mean it was the right approach.\n\nFrom a conflict resolution perspective, there are better ways to handle the situation. Confronting someone in the middle of a private act is likely to escalate tensions. The author's use of aggressive language and threatening to call security might be seen as overstepping, even if the underlying issue is valid.\n\nHowever, considering the ongoing problem and the lack of other solutions, the author might feel they had no choice. The question is whether the action was justified given the circumstances. The answer hinges on balancing the right to privacy against the right to peaceful living. The author's actions were disruptive and confrontational, which could be seen as wrong, but their frustration is understandable given the repeated noise issues.\n\nSo, while the author's intentions might be to enforce quiet hours, the method used was inappropriate. Therefore, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong (A) because they invaded privacy and handled the situation aggressively without a better approach.\n"
