There is one girl (20F), who's a bit of a...problem\n\nShe always brings guys back and has loud audible sex with them. Very loud. And it annoys all of us, we have early starts in the morning and well tell her to keep it down but she doesn't listen. We told security and they didn't do shit.\n\nSo we also all have exams soon and essay deadlines. And yesterday, she does it AGAIN, brings a guy back and starts having loud sex. We're all awake on this and post on the flat chat (but she wasn't going to see it anyway until after she was done having sex).\n\nI have an early start and had to be somewhere by 7am and it was 2am while this was happening.\n\nI had had enough. I banged on her door and she wouldn't open it. I bang again and she doesn't open. So I try to open it and...it's unlocked, they must have forgotten to lock it given that they came back drunk.\n\nSo I walk in and see them having sex. They both quickly see me and freak out. She says to me ''What the fuck?!!'' but I look over to the guy, the guy was a bit short and really skinny, there's no way in hell he would be a threat to me and he looked way more nervous than she does. \n\nShe keeps saying ''What the fuck?!! Get out!!'' and I say to her ''I've had enough of your fucking shit. We've all had enough of your fucking shit, you piece of shit. We're trying to sleep''. \n\nThe guy is standing there awkwardly so I tell him ''Get the fuck out'' and he doesn't do anything just stands there awkwardly, so I tell him ''I'll fucking call security, and I've got 4 other flatmates to back me up, our words against yours so get the fuck out!!'' and he gets his clothes on and runs out the flat. \n\nSo the ''problem'' girl starts crying and I tell her that she needs to sort her life out, I then to say to her ''Please leave this flat, move out. No one here fucking likes you, not even that guy you just fucked likes you enough to stay'' and she screams at me and calls me fucking cunt and asshole.\n\nI then leave and go to back to my room. I told the others what happened and they agreed with me, there's nothing I could have done. In fact they THANKED me, at least we could get to sleep and now we sent her a message, AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who walked into their flatmate's room during sex and refused to leave is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no).\n\nFirst, I need to consider privacy laws. In most places, entering someone's private room without permission is a violation of their privacy. Even if the door was unlocked, that doesn't necessarily mean consent to enter. The person might have forgotten to lock it due to being drunk, but that's not a valid reason to walk in without permission.\n\nNext, the situation involves the act of having sex. Walking in on someone during intimate moments is a serious invasion of privacy. Even if the flatmates were annoyed by the noise, confronting the issue in this way could lead to legal or interpersonal consequences. The author's actions could be considered harassment or assault, depending on local laws.\n\nHowever, the flatmates were disturbed by the noise multiple times and had tried other avenues like talking to security, which didn't work. Their frustration is understandable, but the method used was inappropriate. The author did enter the room without consent, which is a key point here. Even if the intention was to stop the noise, the means were not justified.\n\nThe flatmates' response of thanking the author might reflect their immediate relief but doesn't change the fact that the action was a violation. The author's confrontation could have been handled differently, maybe by using a doorstop or speaking to the flatmate later rather than entering the room.\n\nIn terms of legality, entering someone's room without permission during such a private act is likely illegal. Emotionally, the situation is tense, but that doesn't excuse the action. The author's response was aggressive and confrontational, which could escalate the situation. The guy being asked to leave and the flatmate being called names add to the conflict.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author is in the wrong. Their actions violated the flatmate's privacy, regardless of the reason. The correct choice would be A.\n"
