There is one girl (20F), who's a bit of a...problem\n\nShe always brings guys back and has loud audible sex with them. Very loud. And it annoys all of us, we have early starts in the morning and well tell her to keep it down but she doesn't listen. We told security and they didn't do shit.\n\nSo we also all have exams soon and essay deadlines. And yesterday, she does it AGAIN, brings a guy back and starts having loud sex. We're all awake on this and post on the flat chat (but she wasn't going to see it anyway until after she was done having sex).\n\nI have an early start and had to be somewhere by 7am and it was 2am while this was happening.\n\nI had had enough. I banged on her door and she wouldn't open it. I bang again and she doesn't open. So I try to open it and...it's unlocked, they must have forgotten to lock it given that they came back drunk.\n\nSo I walk in and see them having sex. They both quickly see me and freak out. She says to me ''What the fuck?!!'' but I look over to the guy, the guy was a bit short and really skinny, there's no way in hell he would be a threat to me and he looked way more nervous than she does. \n\nShe keeps saying ''What the fuck?!! Get out!!'' and I say to her ''I've had enough of your fucking shit. We've all had enough of your fucking shit, you piece of shit. We're trying to sleep''. \n\nThe guy is standing there awkwardly so I tell him ''Get the fuck out'' and he doesn't do anything just stands there awkwardly, so I tell him ''I'll fucking call security, and I've got 4 other flatmates to back me up, our words against yours so get the fuck out!!'' and he gets his clothes on and runs out the flat. \n\nSo the ''problem'' girl starts crying and I tell her that she needs to sort her life out, I then to say to her ''Please leave this flat, move out. No one here fucking likes you, not even that guy you just fucked likes you enough to stay'' and she screams at me and calls me fucking cunt and asshole.\n\nI then leave and go to back to my room. I told the others what happened and they agreed with me, there's nothing I could have done. In fact they THANKED me, at least we could get to sleep and now we sent her a message, AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for walking into their flatmate's room while she was having sex and refusing to leave.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The flatmate is having loud sex frequently, which is disturbing others, especially with exams and early mornings. The others have tried talking to her and even contacted security without success. The author had enough and went into her room when she was having sex again.\n\nNow, the key points here. Entering someone's room without permission is a violation of privacy. Even if the door was unlocked, walking in without consent is a problem. The author interrupted an intimate act, which is a big deal. Privacy is a fundamental right, and entering someone's room during such a moment is likely to be seen as a serious breach, regardless of the reason.\n\nBut the other flatmates support the author, saying they thanked him. However, their support doesn't necessarily mean it was right. The question is about whether the author was in the wrong, not just about others' opinions. Even if others are annoyed, the method of dealing with it by intruding on privacy might not be acceptable.\n\nAlso, the author used aggressive language and threatened the guy, which could escalate the situation. Telling the guy to leave and threatening to call security might be seen as bullying. The flatmate's reaction (crying and calling the author names) indicates that she felt violated.\n\nLegally, entering someone's room without permission could lead to trespassing issues. Even if the door is unlocked, entering without being invited in is a problem. The author's actions were confrontational and publicized the issue in the flat chat, which might be seen as furthering the harassment.\n\nHowever, the flatmates might argue that the woman was violating their rights by being loud, and the author was just trying to enforce boundaries. But the method of enforcement was extreme and invasive. There are other ways to handle it, like using earplugs, talking to her again, or seeking mediation. Breaking into her room and confronting her in that manner crosses a line.\n\nSo, balancing the two sides: the woman's privacy versus the others' right to quiet. The author's approach was not the right way to handle it. The correct answer would be that the author is in the wrong because they violated the flatmate's privacy, regardless of the motivation. Even if the other flatmates support the action, it's still a breach of personal space and boundaries.\n"
