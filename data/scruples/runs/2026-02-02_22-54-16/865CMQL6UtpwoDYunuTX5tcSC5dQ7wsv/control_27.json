There is one girl (20F), who's a bit of a...problem\n\nShe always brings guys back and has loud audible sex with them. Very loud. And it annoys all of us, we have early starts in the morning and well tell her to keep it down but she doesn't listen. We told security and they didn't do shit.\n\nSo we also all have exams soon and essay deadlines. And yesterday, she does it AGAIN, brings a guy back and starts having loud sex. We're all awake on this and post on the flat chat (but she wasn't going to see it anyway until after she was done having sex).\n\nI have an early start and had to be somewhere by 7am and it was 2am while this was happening.\n\nI had had enough. I banged on her door and she wouldn't open it. I bang again and she doesn't open. So I try to open it and...it's unlocked, they must have forgotten to lock it given that they came back drunk.\n\nSo I walk in and see them having sex. They both quickly see me and freak out. She says to me ''What the fuck?!!'' but I look over to the guy, the guy was a bit short and really skinny, there's no way in hell he would be a threat to me and he looked way more nervous than she does. \n\nShe keeps saying ''What the fuck?!! Get out!!'' and I say to her ''I've had enough of your fucking shit. We've all had enough of your fucking shit, you piece of shit. We're trying to sleep''. \n\nThe guy is standing there awkwardly so I tell him ''Get the fuck out'' and he doesn't do anything just stands there awkwardly, so I tell him ''I'll fucking call security, and I've got 4 other flatmates to back me up, our words against yours so get the fuck out!!'' and he gets his clothes on and runs out the flat. \n\nSo the ''problem'' girl starts crying and I tell her that she needs to sort her life out, I then to say to her ''Please leave this flat, move out. No one here fucking likes you, not even that guy you just fucked likes you enough to stay'' and she screams at me and calls me fucking cunt and asshole.\n\nI then leave and go to back to my room. I told the others what happened and they agreed with me, there's nothing I could have done. In fact they THANKED me, at least we could get to sleep and now we sent her a message, AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for walking into his flatmate's room while she was having sex and refusing to leave. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The flatmate was having loud sex, which was disturbing the others. They had already asked her to keep it down, even contacted security, but she didn't stop. The author, needing to sleep because of an early start, went to her room when it was unlocked and walked in. \n\nBut entering someone's room without permission, especially when they're having private sex, is a big deal. Even if the door was unlocked, that doesn't mean it's okay to enter without being invited. The person's privacy is still being invaded. The author then confronted them, told the guy to leave, and made threats. The flatmate started crying and was upset. \n\nThe key points here are: unauthorized entry into private space, invasion of privacy, and using threats. Even if the others were annoyed, the method used was excessive. The author could have handled it differently, like talking to her calmly or involving a mediator instead of storming in. \n\nAlso, the flatmates thanking him doesn't make it right. Their agreement doesn't override the fact that he violated her privacy. The author's actions could be considered a breach of trust and possibly even harassment, depending on local laws. \n\nSo, even though there's a valid frustration about noise, the way he handled it was wrong. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
