There is one girl (20F), who's a bit of a...problem\n\nShe always brings guys back and has loud audible sex with them. Very loud. And it annoys all of us, we have early starts in the morning and well tell her to keep it down but she doesn't listen. We told security and they didn't do shit.\n\nSo we also all have exams soon and essay deadlines. And yesterday, she does it AGAIN, brings a guy back and starts having loud sex. We're all awake on this and post on the flat chat (but she wasn't going to see it anyway until after she was done having sex).\n\nI have an early start and had to be somewhere by 7am and it was 2am while this was happening.\n\nI had had enough. I banged on her door and she wouldn't open it. I bang again and she doesn't open. So I try to open it and...it's unlocked, they must have forgotten to lock it given that they came back drunk.\n\nSo I walk in and see them having sex. They both quickly see me and freak out. She says to me ''What the fuck?!!'' but I look over to the guy, the guy was a bit short and really skinny, there's no way in hell he would be a threat to me and he looked way more nervous than she does. \n\nShe keeps saying ''What the fuck?!! Get out!!'' and I say to her ''I've had enough of your fucking shit. We've all had enough of your fucking shit, you piece of shit. We're trying to sleep''. \n\nThe guy is standing there awkwardly so I tell him ''Get the fuck out'' and he doesn't do anything just stands there awkwardly, so I tell him ''I'll fucking call security, and I've got 4 other flatmates to back me up, our words against yours so get the fuck out!!'' and he gets his clothes on and runs out the flat. \n\nSo the ''problem'' girl starts crying and I tell her that she needs to sort her life out, I then to say to her ''Please leave this flat, move out. No one here fucking likes you, not even that guy you just fucked likes you enough to stay'' and she screams at me and calls me fucking cunt and asshole.\n\nI then leave and go to back to my room. I told the others what happened and they agreed with me, there's nothing I could have done. In fact they THANKED me, at least we could get to sleep and now we sent her a message, AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the story is in the wrong. The situation involves walking into a flatmate's room during a private sexual encounter and refusing to leave. \n\nFirst, I need to consider privacy laws. In most places, entering someone's private space without permission, especially during an intimate moment, is a violation of their privacy. Even if the door was unlocked, walking in without consent is problematic. The author's actions could be considered an invasion of privacy, which is a serious issue regardless of the circumstances.\n\nNext, the reason for the intrusion: the flatmates were annoyed by loud sex and had tried to address it before. They even involved security, which didn't help. The author's frustration is understandable, but the method of addressing it by entering the room is extreme. The author's response\u2014yelling, threatening to call security, and confronting the person\u2014could escalate the situation. \n\nThe aftermath: the flatmate was upset, and the others thanked the author, but that might be because of shared frustration rather than justifying the actions. The key here is whether the author had the right to enter the room. Legally and ethically, even if the door was unlocked, entering without being invited is a breach. The author's actions could lead to legal consequences, like charges related to invasion of privacy or assault if the person feels threatened. \n\nAlso, the author's approach might have been confrontational and disrespectful. Instead of finding a non-intrusive way to address the noise (like using a white noise machine, soundproofing, or talking to the flatmate calmly), the author took a drastic step that violated the other person's rights. \n\nSo, even though the author's motivations were to stop the noise and get rest, the method used was inappropriate and wrong. The answer should be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
