There is one girl (20F), who's a bit of a...problem\n\nShe always brings guys back and has loud audible sex with them. Very loud. And it annoys all of us, we have early starts in the morning and well tell her to keep it down but she doesn't listen. We told security and they didn't do shit.\n\nSo we also all have exams soon and essay deadlines. And yesterday, she does it AGAIN, brings a guy back and starts having loud sex. We're all awake on this and post on the flat chat (but she wasn't going to see it anyway until after she was done having sex).\n\nI have an early start and had to be somewhere by 7am and it was 2am while this was happening.\n\nI had had enough. I banged on her door and she wouldn't open it. I bang again and she doesn't open. So I try to open it and...it's unlocked, they must have forgotten to lock it given that they came back drunk.\n\nSo I walk in and see them having sex. They both quickly see me and freak out. She says to me ''What the fuck?!!'' but I look over to the guy, the guy was a bit short and really skinny, there's no way in hell he would be a threat to me and he looked way more nervous than she does. \n\nShe keeps saying ''What the fuck?!! Get out!!'' and I say to her ''I've had enough of your fucking shit. We've all had enough of your fucking shit, you piece of shit. We're trying to sleep''. \n\nThe guy is standing there awkwardly so I tell him ''Get the fuck out'' and he doesn't do anything just stands there awkwardly, so I tell him ''I'll fucking call security, and I've got 4 other flatmates to back me up, our words against yours so get the fuck out!!'' and he gets his clothes on and runs out the flat. \n\nSo the ''problem'' girl starts crying and I tell her that she needs to sort her life out, I then to say to her ''Please leave this flat, move out. No one here fucking likes you, not even that guy you just fucked likes you enough to stay'' and she screams at me and calls me fucking cunt and asshole.\n\nI then leave and go to back to my room. I told the others what happened and they agreed with me, there's nothing I could have done. In fact they THANKED me, at least we could get to sleep and now we sent her a message, AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. So, the situation is that they walked into their flatmate's room while she was having sex and refused to leave. The flatmate is known for having loud sex that disturbs others, and this time the writer decided to confront her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the laws and norms. In most places, walking into someone's room without permission, especially when they're having private moments like sex, is a violation of their privacy. Even if the door was unlocked, that doesn't necessarily mean it's okay to enter without being invited. The act of entering someone's private space without consent is a key point here.\n\nThen there's the context of the noise complaints. The flatmates had previously told security, but nothing was done. The writer might feel frustrated, but their reaction was to confront the situation themselves. However, using force to enter, even if the door is unlocked, could be seen as trespassing or invasion of privacy. \n\nThe writer also threatened to call security and mentioned having other flatmates back them up. That might be a form of intimidation. The guy who was there fled, which could be because he was scared or felt cornered. The writer's aggressive language and actions might escalate the situation and could be considered hostile.\n\nOn the other hand, the flatmate was indeed being disruptive with loud sex, which is affecting others' well-being, especially with exams and early starts. The writer might feel that they have a right to peaceful living conditions. But the method of handling it\u2014bursting in and confronting them\u2014might not be the best approach. \n\nThere's also the issue of consent and mutual agreement. Even if the door was unlocked, entering without permission is a breach. The writer's actions could be seen as overstepping, regardless of the initial complaints. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the writer did enter a private space without consent, used aggressive language, and threatened others. While the flatmate was in the wrong for not respecting others' noise levels, the writer's response was not appropriate. Therefore, the writer is in the wrong because they violated privacy and used confrontation instead of a more measured approach like contacting authorities or seeking mediation.\n"
