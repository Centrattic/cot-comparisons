There is one girl (20F), who's a bit of a...problem\n\nShe always brings guys back and has loud audible sex with them. Very loud. And it annoys all of us, we have early starts in the morning and well tell her to keep it down but she doesn't listen. We told security and they didn't do shit.\n\nSo we also all have exams soon and essay deadlines. And yesterday, she does it AGAIN, brings a guy back and starts having loud sex. We're all awake on this and post on the flat chat (but she wasn't going to see it anyway until after she was done having sex).\n\nI have an early start and had to be somewhere by 7am and it was 2am while this was happening.\n\nI had had enough. I banged on her door and she wouldn't open it. I bang again and she doesn't open. So I try to open it and...it's unlocked, they must have forgotten to lock it given that they came back drunk.\n\nSo I walk in and see them having sex. They both quickly see me and freak out. She says to me ''What the fuck?!!'' but I look over to the guy, the guy was a bit short and really skinny, there's no way in hell he would be a threat to me and he looked way more nervous than she does. \n\nShe keeps saying ''What the fuck?!! Get out!!'' and I say to her ''I've had enough of your fucking shit. We've all had enough of your fucking shit, you piece of shit. We're trying to sleep''. \n\nThe guy is standing there awkwardly so I tell him ''Get the fuck out'' and he doesn't do anything just stands there awkwardly, so I tell him ''I'll fucking call security, and I've got 4 other flatmates to back me up, our words against yours so get the fuck out!!'' and he gets his clothes on and runs out the flat. \n\nSo the ''problem'' girl starts crying and I tell her that she needs to sort her life out, I then to say to her ''Please leave this flat, move out. No one here fucking likes you, not even that guy you just fucked likes you enough to stay'' and she screams at me and calls me fucking cunt and asshole.\n\nI then leave and go to back to my room. I told the others what happened and they agreed with me, there's nothing I could have done. In fact they THANKED me, at least we could get to sleep and now we sent her a message, AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong after walking into their flatmate's room during a sexual encounter and refusing to leave. The scenario involves a 20-year-old male in a flat with five others, including a female flatmate who's been bringing guys back and having loud sex despite complaints. The author, frustrated and needing sleep for an early start, bangs on the door, finds it unlocked, enters, and confronts them. The guy leaves after being threatened with calling security, and the girl gets upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author's action of entering the room without permission is a privacy violation. Even if the door was unlocked, that doesn't necessarily give him the right to walk in. The flatmate's behavior is loud, but that doesn't excuse entering her private space. The threat to call security and the others backing him up might be a factor, but it still seems aggressive. The girl's response is understandable given the invasion of privacy. \n\nHowever, the author did try to address the noise disturbance through the flat chat and security without success. The situation is a conflict between respecting privacy and the right to a quiet living environment. The question is whether the author's actions crossed a line. \n\nIn most cases, walking into someone's room during a private act is definitely wrong, regardless of the reason. Even if the door was unlocked, it's their room, and entering without consent is a breach of privacy. The confrontation and threats might be seen as aggressive, and while the other flatmates agreed, that doesn't make it right. The author should have found another way to handle the noise, like using earplugs or talking to the flatmate directly when they were both calm. \n\nSo, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because invading someone's privacy, even in frustration, is inappropriate. Threatening to call security and confronting them in that moment is not a respectful or legal way to handle the situation.\n"
