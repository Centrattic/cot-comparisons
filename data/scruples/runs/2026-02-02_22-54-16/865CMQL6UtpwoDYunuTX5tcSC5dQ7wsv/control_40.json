There is one girl (20F), who's a bit of a...problem\n\nShe always brings guys back and has loud audible sex with them. Very loud. And it annoys all of us, we have early starts in the morning and well tell her to keep it down but she doesn't listen. We told security and they didn't do shit.\n\nSo we also all have exams soon and essay deadlines. And yesterday, she does it AGAIN, brings a guy back and starts having loud sex. We're all awake on this and post on the flat chat (but she wasn't going to see it anyway until after she was done having sex).\n\nI have an early start and had to be somewhere by 7am and it was 2am while this was happening.\n\nI had had enough. I banged on her door and she wouldn't open it. I bang again and she doesn't open. So I try to open it and...it's unlocked, they must have forgotten to lock it given that they came back drunk.\n\nSo I walk in and see them having sex. They both quickly see me and freak out. She says to me ''What the fuck?!!'' but I look over to the guy, the guy was a bit short and really skinny, there's no way in hell he would be a threat to me and he looked way more nervous than she does. \n\nShe keeps saying ''What the fuck?!! Get out!!'' and I say to her ''I've had enough of your fucking shit. We've all had enough of your fucking shit, you piece of shit. We're trying to sleep''. \n\nThe guy is standing there awkwardly so I tell him ''Get the fuck out'' and he doesn't do anything just stands there awkwardly, so I tell him ''I'll fucking call security, and I've got 4 other flatmates to back me up, our words against yours so get the fuck out!!'' and he gets his clothes on and runs out the flat. \n\nSo the ''problem'' girl starts crying and I tell her that she needs to sort her life out, I then to say to her ''Please leave this flat, move out. No one here fucking likes you, not even that guy you just fucked likes you enough to stay'' and she screams at me and calls me fucking cunt and asshole.\n\nI then leave and go to back to my room. I told the others what happened and they agreed with me, there's nothing I could have done. In fact they THANKED me, at least we could get to sleep and now we sent her a message, AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who walked into their flatmate's room during sex and refused to leave is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). I need to figure this out based on the given scenario.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The person (20M) is a flatmate in a shared house with five others, including a female flatmate who brings guys back and has loud sex. The others have tried to address it but it's not working. Finally, the author confronts the situation by entering her room when she's having sex, which leads to a confrontation. The author's actions result in the guy leaving and the flatmate being upset.\n\nSo, the key points here are: entering someone's private space without permission, especially during a private act, and the subsequent verbal confrontation. Legally, entering someone's room without consent could be considered a violation of privacy, even in a shared living space. The fact that the door was unlocked might not excuse it because privacy is still expected in one's own room. The author's actions, while motivated by frustration, were intrusive.\n\nEthically, even if the flatmate was being disruptive, the author's response was extreme. Instead of entering the room, they could have tried another method, like talking to her after the fact or involving authorities in a non-intrusive way. The confrontation led to a hostile situation, which could escalate tensions. The flatmates agreeing with the author might be because they share the frustration, but that doesn't make the action right.\n\nAlso, the author threatened to call security and used others as backup. That's a power move and might be seen as bullying. The guy who was there could have a complaint about being forced out. The flatmate's emotional reaction (crying, calling the author names) suggests that she felt deeply violated.\n\nSo considering both the legal and ethical aspects, the author likely did something wrong by intruding on the flatmate's privacy. Even if the noise was a problem, the method of addressing it was inappropriate. The answer would be A (yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
