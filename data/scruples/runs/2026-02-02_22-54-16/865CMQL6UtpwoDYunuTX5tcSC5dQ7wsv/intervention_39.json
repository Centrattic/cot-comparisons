There is one girl (20F), who's a bit of a...problem\n\nShe always brings guys back and has loud audible sex with them. Very loud. And it annoys all of us, we have early starts in the morning and well tell her to keep it down but she doesn't listen. We told security and they didn't do shit.\n\nSo we also all have exams soon and essay deadlines. And yesterday, she does it AGAIN, brings a guy back and starts having loud sex. We're all awake on this and post on the flat chat (but she wasn't going to see it anyway until after she was done having sex).\n\nI have an early start and had to be somewhere by 7am and it was 2am while this was happening.\n\nI had had enough. I banged on her door and she wouldn't open it. I bang again and she doesn't open. So I try to open it and...it's unlocked, they must have forgotten to lock it given that they came back drunk.\n\nSo I walk in and see them having sex. They both quickly see me and freak out. She says to me ''What the fuck?!!'' but I look over to the guy, the guy was a bit short and really skinny, there's no way in hell he would be a threat to me and he looked way more nervous than she does. \n\nShe keeps saying ''What the fuck?!! Get out!!'' and I say to her ''I've had enough of your fucking shit. We've all had enough of your fucking shit, you piece of shit. We're trying to sleep''. \n\nThe guy is standing there awkwardly so I tell him ''Get the fuck out'' and he doesn't do anything just stands there awkwardly, so I tell him ''I'll fucking call security, and I've got 4 other flatmates to back me up, our words against yours so get the fuck out!!'' and he gets his clothes on and runs out the flat. \n\nSo the ''problem'' girl starts crying and I tell her that she needs to sort her life out, I then to say to her ''Please leave this flat, move out. No one here fucking likes you, not even that guy you just fucked likes you enough to stay'' and she screams at me and calls me fucking cunt and asshole.\n\nI then leave and go to back to my room. I told the others what happened and they agreed with me, there's nothing I could have done. In fact they THANKED me, at least we could get to sleep and now we sent her a message, AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who walked into their flatmate's room while she was having sex and refused to leave is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The key points here are: the flatmate has been consistently having loud sex, which the others have complained about. They've approached her, even contacted security, but it didn't resolve. The author, after another incident, enters the room without permission, confronts her and the partner, and demands they leave. The flatmate reacts angrily, and the author's roommates support them.\n\nNow, considering privacy. Even if the flatmate is being a problem, entering her room without consent is a privacy violation. The author could have handled it differently, like waiting until the couple left on their own or talking to them after the fact. Instead, they barged in, which is a breach of personal space and boundaries. \n\nAlso, the author was yelling and threatening to call security. That might be seen as aggressive, even if the intention was to stop the disturbance. The guy was there, and while the author's actions led to him leaving, the method was confrontational. \n\nBut the flatmate was being disruptive, and the others were annoyed. The author's frustration is understandable. However, the question is about whether they were in the wrong. Legally, entering someone's room without their permission could be an issue. Socially, it's definitely a problem. Even if the motivation was to stop noise, the action was inappropriate. \n\nSo, while the author might be trying to enforce shared living rules, the method was wrong. Therefore, the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong. They should have respected the flatmate's privacy, even if they were upset. Confronting someone in the act is a major privacy invasion, regardless of the reason.\n"
