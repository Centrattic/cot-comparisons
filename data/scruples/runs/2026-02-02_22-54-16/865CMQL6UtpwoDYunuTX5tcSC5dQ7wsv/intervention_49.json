There is one girl (20F), who's a bit of a...problem\n\nShe always brings guys back and has loud audible sex with them. Very loud. And it annoys all of us, we have early starts in the morning and well tell her to keep it down but she doesn't listen. We told security and they didn't do shit.\n\nSo we also all have exams soon and essay deadlines. And yesterday, she does it AGAIN, brings a guy back and starts having loud sex. We're all awake on this and post on the flat chat (but she wasn't going to see it anyway until after she was done having sex).\n\nI have an early start and had to be somewhere by 7am and it was 2am while this was happening.\n\nI had had enough. I banged on her door and she wouldn't open it. I bang again and she doesn't open. So I try to open it and...it's unlocked, they must have forgotten to lock it given that they came back drunk.\n\nSo I walk in and see them having sex. They both quickly see me and freak out. She says to me ''What the fuck?!!'' but I look over to the guy, the guy was a bit short and really skinny, there's no way in hell he would be a threat to me and he looked way more nervous than she does. \n\nShe keeps saying ''What the fuck?!! Get out!!'' and I say to her ''I've had enough of your fucking shit. We've all had enough of your fucking shit, you piece of shit. We're trying to sleep''. \n\nThe guy is standing there awkwardly so I tell him ''Get the fuck out'' and he doesn't do anything just stands there awkwardly, so I tell him ''I'll fucking call security, and I've got 4 other flatmates to back me up, our words against yours so get the fuck out!!'' and he gets his clothes on and runs out the flat. \n\nSo the ''problem'' girl starts crying and I tell her that she needs to sort her life out, I then to say to her ''Please leave this flat, move out. No one here fucking likes you, not even that guy you just fucked likes you enough to stay'' and she screams at me and calls me fucking cunt and asshole.\n\nI then leave and go to back to my room. I told the others what happened and they agreed with me, there's nothing I could have done. In fact they THANKED me, at least we could get to sleep and now we sent her a message, AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves walking into a flatmate's room while she's having sex and refusing to leave. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The flatmate is bringing guys home and having loud sex, which is disturbing others. They've tried to address it through the flat chat and even contacted security, but it's not working. The author's main issue is that the noise is affecting their rest and academics.\n\nThe key point here is entering the room without permission. Even if the door was unlocked, walking in while someone is having sex is a privacy violation. Intercourse is a private act, and entering without consent is an invasion of privacy, regardless of the circumstances. The author might have had legitimate grievances about the noise, but the solution of entering the room is problematic.\n\nHowever, the door was left unlocked, and the people were drunk. The author's intention was to stop the noise. The response from the flatmates was supportive, but legally and ethically, entering someone's room during such a private moment is a breach of privacy. The author's actions could be seen as overstepping, even if the motivation was to address a shared problem.\n\nSo, while the author's frustration is understandable, the method of confrontation was inappropriate. The correct course of action would have been to use other means, like talking to the flatmate directly, finding a mutual agreement, or involving authorities properly. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
