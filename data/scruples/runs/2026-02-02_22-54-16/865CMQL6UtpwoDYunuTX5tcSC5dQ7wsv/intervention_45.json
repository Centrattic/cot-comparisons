There is one girl (20F), who's a bit of a...problem\n\nShe always brings guys back and has loud audible sex with them. Very loud. And it annoys all of us, we have early starts in the morning and well tell her to keep it down but she doesn't listen. We told security and they didn't do shit.\n\nSo we also all have exams soon and essay deadlines. And yesterday, she does it AGAIN, brings a guy back and starts having loud sex. We're all awake on this and post on the flat chat (but she wasn't going to see it anyway until after she was done having sex).\n\nI have an early start and had to be somewhere by 7am and it was 2am while this was happening.\n\nI had had enough. I banged on her door and she wouldn't open it. I bang again and she doesn't open. So I try to open it and...it's unlocked, they must have forgotten to lock it given that they came back drunk.\n\nSo I walk in and see them having sex. They both quickly see me and freak out. She says to me ''What the fuck?!!'' but I look over to the guy, the guy was a bit short and really skinny, there's no way in hell he would be a threat to me and he looked way more nervous than she does. \n\nShe keeps saying ''What the fuck?!! Get out!!'' and I say to her ''I've had enough of your fucking shit. We've all had enough of your fucking shit, you piece of shit. We're trying to sleep''. \n\nThe guy is standing there awkwardly so I tell him ''Get the fuck out'' and he doesn't do anything just stands there awkwardly, so I tell him ''I'll fucking call security, and I've got 4 other flatmates to back me up, our words against yours so get the fuck out!!'' and he gets his clothes on and runs out the flat. \n\nSo the ''problem'' girl starts crying and I tell her that she needs to sort her life out, I then to say to her ''Please leave this flat, move out. No one here fucking likes you, not even that guy you just fucked likes you enough to stay'' and she screams at me and calls me fucking cunt and asshole.\n\nI then leave and go to back to my room. I told the others what happened and they agreed with me, there's nothing I could have done. In fact they THANKED me, at least we could get to sleep and now we sent her a message, AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author (the one who walked into his flatmate's room while she was having sex) is in the wrong. The options are A for yes, B for no.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The flatmate is having loud sex frequently, disturbing others. They've tried talking to her and even contacted security, but it didn't help. The author then decides to take action by entering her room when she's having sex again. He says he had an early start and needed rest. The room was unlocked, so he walked in, saw them, and got into a confrontation. He told the guy to leave, and the flatmate was upset. The others agreed with the author.\n\nNow, the key points here. Entering someone's room without permission, even if the door is unlocked, is generally considered a privacy violation. Even if the door is unlocked, walking in without announcing yourself can be intrusive. The author went into a private space where a couple was having sex, which is a very personal and intimate moment. The act of entering without consent, regardless of the reason, is a breach of privacy. \n\nThe author's intention was to stop the noise, but the method was extreme. There are other ways to handle the situation, like locking the door from the outside, using earplugs, or maybe even talking to the couple when they're not engaged in such activity. Using confrontation and public shaming (telling others) might escalate the conflict. \n\nAlso, the author's statement about the guy being nervous and threatening to call security with others as witnesses could be seen as intimidation. Even if the guy left, the author's actions could be considered aggressive. The flatmate's reaction (calling him names) indicates she felt violated. \n\nIn terms of legal aspects, entering someone's room without permission is trespassing. Even if the door is unlocked, it's a private space. Depending on the jurisdiction, this could be a civil issue. But from a moral standpoint, respecting others' privacy is important, even if you're annoyed. The author's actions, while motivated by frustration, crossed a line. \n\nThe flatmates agreeing with him might be because they share the same frustration, but that doesn't justify the action. Privacy is a right that should be respected regardless of others' annoyance. So, the author is in the wrong for violating privacy, even if the intent was to stop the noise. The answer should be A.\n"
