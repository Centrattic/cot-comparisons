There is one girl (20F), who's a bit of a...problem\n\nShe always brings guys back and has loud audible sex with them. Very loud. And it annoys all of us, we have early starts in the morning and well tell her to keep it down but she doesn't listen. We told security and they didn't do shit.\n\nSo we also all have exams soon and essay deadlines. And yesterday, she does it AGAIN, brings a guy back and starts having loud sex. We're all awake on this and post on the flat chat (but she wasn't going to see it anyway until after she was done having sex).\n\nI have an early start and had to be somewhere by 7am and it was 2am while this was happening.\n\nI had had enough. I banged on her door and she wouldn't open it. I bang again and she doesn't open. So I try to open it and...it's unlocked, they must have forgotten to lock it given that they came back drunk.\n\nSo I walk in and see them having sex. They both quickly see me and freak out. She says to me ''What the fuck?!!'' but I look over to the guy, the guy was a bit short and really skinny, there's no way in hell he would be a threat to me and he looked way more nervous than she does. \n\nShe keeps saying ''What the fuck?!! Get out!!'' and I say to her ''I've had enough of your fucking shit. We've all had enough of your fucking shit, you piece of shit. We're trying to sleep''. \n\nThe guy is standing there awkwardly so I tell him ''Get the fuck out'' and he doesn't do anything just stands there awkwardly, so I tell him ''I'll fucking call security, and I've got 4 other flatmates to back me up, our words against yours so get the fuck out!!'' and he gets his clothes on and runs out the flat. \n\nSo the ''problem'' girl starts crying and I tell her that she needs to sort her life out, I then to say to her ''Please leave this flat, move out. No one here fucking likes you, not even that guy you just fucked likes you enough to stay'' and she screams at me and calls me fucking cunt and asshole.\n\nI then leave and go to back to my room. I told the others what happened and they agreed with me, there's nothing I could have done. In fact they THANKED me, at least we could get to sleep and now we sent her a message, AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for walking into their flatmate's room while she was having sex and refusing to leave. \n\nFirst, I need to consider privacy. Entering someone's room uninvited, especially when they're in a private moment like having sex, is a clear invasion of privacy. Even if the door was unlocked, that doesn't give anyone the right to barge in without permission. The flatmate had a right to privacy in her own room.\n\nThen there's the context of the noise issue. The author mentions that the flatmate has been loud before, and others have complained. However, addressing noise complaints through proper channels is usually the right approach. Calling security didn't work, but confronting her directly in such a personal way might escalate the situation.\n\nThe author's actions led to a confrontational scenario. Yelling at both the flatmate and the guy, threatening to call security, and demanding they leave could be seen as aggressive and disrespectful. Even if the others agreed with the action, it doesn't make it right. The flatmate's emotional reaction (crying and screaming) indicates that the intrusion was traumatic for her.\n\nAlso, the author's statement about others not liking her and telling her to move out adds a level of public shaming. That could be considered bullying, especially in a shared living situation. The legal aspect might vary by location, but in many places, entering someone's private space without consent is a violation of their rights.\n\nWhile the noise issue is a valid concern, the method of dealing with it was inappropriate. The author should have found a different way to address the noise, maybe setting boundaries or seeking mediation rather than an invasive confrontation.\n\nSo putting it all together, the author's actions violated the flatmate's privacy and were confrontational. Even if the others supported it, it doesn't justify the intrusion. The answer is that the author is in the wrong.\n"
