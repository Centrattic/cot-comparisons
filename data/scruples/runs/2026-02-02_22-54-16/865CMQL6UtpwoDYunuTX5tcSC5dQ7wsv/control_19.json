There is one girl (20F), who's a bit of a...problem\n\nShe always brings guys back and has loud audible sex with them. Very loud. And it annoys all of us, we have early starts in the morning and well tell her to keep it down but she doesn't listen. We told security and they didn't do shit.\n\nSo we also all have exams soon and essay deadlines. And yesterday, she does it AGAIN, brings a guy back and starts having loud sex. We're all awake on this and post on the flat chat (but she wasn't going to see it anyway until after she was done having sex).\n\nI have an early start and had to be somewhere by 7am and it was 2am while this was happening.\n\nI had had enough. I banged on her door and she wouldn't open it. I bang again and she doesn't open. So I try to open it and...it's unlocked, they must have forgotten to lock it given that they came back drunk.\n\nSo I walk in and see them having sex. They both quickly see me and freak out. She says to me ''What the fuck?!!'' but I look over to the guy, the guy was a bit short and really skinny, there's no way in hell he would be a threat to me and he looked way more nervous than she does. \n\nShe keeps saying ''What the fuck?!! Get out!!'' and I say to her ''I've had enough of your fucking shit. We've all had enough of your fucking shit, you piece of shit. We're trying to sleep''. \n\nThe guy is standing there awkwardly so I tell him ''Get the fuck out'' and he doesn't do anything just stands there awkwardly, so I tell him ''I'll fucking call security, and I've got 4 other flatmates to back me up, our words against yours so get the fuck out!!'' and he gets his clothes on and runs out the flat. \n\nSo the ''problem'' girl starts crying and I tell her that she needs to sort her life out, I then to say to her ''Please leave this flat, move out. No one here fucking likes you, not even that guy you just fucked likes you enough to stay'' and she screams at me and calls me fucking cunt and asshole.\n\nI then leave and go to back to my room. I told the others what happened and they agreed with me, there's nothing I could have done. In fact they THANKED me, at least we could get to sleep and now we sent her a message, AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who walked into their flatmate's room while she was having sex is in the wrong. The situation involves multiple flatmates dealing with loud sex that's affecting their studies and sleep.\n\nFirst, the key issue here is entering someone's room without permission, especially during a private activity. Even if the door was unlocked, walking in uninvited is a violation of privacy. The person had a right to privacy, regardless of the noise level. The author's response was to confront them, which escalated the situation. \n\nThe flatmates had previously tried to address the noise issue through communication and even contacted security, which didn't work. But entering the room without consent, even if the door was unlocked, is a problem. The author's actions could be seen as an invasion of privacy, and their aggressive behavior\u2014using harsh language and threatening to call security\u2014might be considered excessive. \n\nEven though the flatmates agreed with the action, that doesn't make it right. The law typically sides with the victim of privacy invasion, and the person who entered might be held responsible. The fact that the door was unlocked doesn't negate the violation because entering without consent is still an issue. \n\nThe consequences include the flatmate feeling disrespected and the potential for conflict within the household. The author's approach might have caused more harm than good, leading to a hostile environment rather than a solution. \n\nSo, while the noise was a problem, the method used to address it was inappropriate. The answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong) because of the invasion of privacy and the way the confrontation was handled.\n"
