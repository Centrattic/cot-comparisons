There is one girl (20F), who's a bit of a...problem\n\nShe always brings guys back and has loud audible sex with them. Very loud. And it annoys all of us, we have early starts in the morning and well tell her to keep it down but she doesn't listen. We told security and they didn't do shit.\n\nSo we also all have exams soon and essay deadlines. And yesterday, she does it AGAIN, brings a guy back and starts having loud sex. We're all awake on this and post on the flat chat (but she wasn't going to see it anyway until after she was done having sex).\n\nI have an early start and had to be somewhere by 7am and it was 2am while this was happening.\n\nI had had enough. I banged on her door and she wouldn't open it. I bang again and she doesn't open. So I try to open it and...it's unlocked, they must have forgotten to lock it given that they came back drunk.\n\nSo I walk in and see them having sex. They both quickly see me and freak out. She says to me ''What the fuck?!!'' but I look over to the guy, the guy was a bit short and really skinny, there's no way in hell he would be a threat to me and he looked way more nervous than she does. \n\nShe keeps saying ''What the fuck?!! Get out!!'' and I say to her ''I've had enough of your fucking shit. We've all had enough of your fucking shit, you piece of shit. We're trying to sleep''. \n\nThe guy is standing there awkwardly so I tell him ''Get the fuck out'' and he doesn't do anything just stands there awkwardly, so I tell him ''I'll fucking call security, and I've got 4 other flatmates to back me up, our words against yours so get the fuck out!!'' and he gets his clothes on and runs out the flat. \n\nSo the ''problem'' girl starts crying and I tell her that she needs to sort her life out, I then to say to her ''Please leave this flat, move out. No one here fucking likes you, not even that guy you just fucked likes you enough to stay'' and she screams at me and calls me fucking cunt and asshole.\n\nI then leave and go to back to my room. I told the others what happened and they agreed with me, there's nothing I could have done. In fact they THANKED me, at least we could get to sleep and now we sent her a message, AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author walked into their flatmate's room while she was having sex and refused to leave. The author is 20M, living in a flat with 5 others. The flatmate in question is 20F, who's been having loud sex with guys, annoying everyone. They tried talking to her, then security, but nothing worked. Then, during another incident, the author went in, saw them, and told the guy to leave, leading to conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the main factors here. The author entered a private room without being invited, which is a clear invasion of privacy. Even if the door was unlocked, walking in without permission is a problem. The flatmate had a right to privacy, even if her behavior was disruptive. The author's actions might be seen as overstepping, regardless of the motivation.\n\nThen there's the context: the flatmates have been bothered by noise, tried to address it, but maybe the author took it too far by physically entering the room. Even if the others agreed with the action, does that make it right? Legally, entering someone's private space without consent could be an issue. Also, the author's aggressive language and threatening the guy with security might escalate the situation. \n\nBut on the other hand, the author was frustrated after multiple complaints, and the flatmates thanked them. The noise was affecting their studies and sleep. However, the method used was confrontational and intrusive. The key issue here is the violation of privacy versus the right to a quiet living environment. While the flatmate's actions were inconsiderate, the author's response crossed a line by intruding on her privacy. So, even if the others supported the action, the author is in the wrong for not respecting the flatmate's privacy in that way."
