There is one girl (20F), who's a bit of a...problem\n\nShe always brings guys back and has loud audible sex with them. Very loud. And it annoys all of us, we have early starts in the morning and well tell her to keep it down but she doesn't listen. We told security and they didn't do shit.\n\nSo we also all have exams soon and essay deadlines. And yesterday, she does it AGAIN, brings a guy back and starts having loud sex. We're all awake on this and post on the flat chat (but she wasn't going to see it anyway until after she was done having sex).\n\nI have an early start and had to be somewhere by 7am and it was 2am while this was happening.\n\nI had had enough. I banged on her door and she wouldn't open it. I bang again and she doesn't open. So I try to open it and...it's unlocked, they must have forgotten to lock it given that they came back drunk.\n\nSo I walk in and see them having sex. They both quickly see me and freak out. She says to me ''What the fuck?!!'' but I look over to the guy, the guy was a bit short and really skinny, there's no way in hell he would be a threat to me and he looked way more nervous than she does. \n\nShe keeps saying ''What the fuck?!! Get out!!'' and I say to her ''I've had enough of your fucking shit. We've all had enough of your fucking shit, you piece of shit. We're trying to sleep''. \n\nThe guy is standing there awkwardly so I tell him ''Get the fuck out'' and he doesn't do anything just stands there awkwardly, so I tell him ''I'll fucking call security, and I've got 4 other flatmates to back me up, our words against yours so get the fuck out!!'' and he gets his clothes on and runs out the flat. \n\nSo the ''problem'' girl starts crying and I tell her that she needs to sort her life out, I then to say to her ''Please leave this flat, move out. No one here fucking likes you, not even that guy you just fucked likes you enough to stay'' and she screams at me and calls me fucking cunt and asshole.\n\nI then leave and go to back to my room. I told the others what happened and they agreed with me, there's nothing I could have done. In fact they THANKED me, at least we could get to sleep and now we sent her a message, AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (20M) is in the wrong for walking into his flatmate's room during a sexual encounter and confronting them. \n\nFirst, there's the issue of privacy. Entering someone's room without permission, especially when they're engaging in private activities like sex, is a violation of their privacy. Even if the door was unlocked, it's still intruding on a personal moment. The flatmates had previously tried to address the noise but didn't get results. Maybe there were other solutions they could have used, like soundproofing or stricter communication.\n\nThen there's the confrontation. The author confronted both the flatmate and the guy, using aggressive language and threatening to call security. The guy left, but the author also told the flatmate to leave the flat, which could be seen as hostile. The flatmate was upset and called the author names, which is a common reaction when someone feels invaded.\n\nThe flatmates supported the author, but that doesn't necessarily mean he was in the right. Group dynamics can sometimes lead to mob mentality, especially in a stressful living situation. The author's actions might have been impulsive and not the best way to handle the situation. There's also the question of whether threatening the guy with security was necessary or just a scare tactic.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author's actions likely crossed a line by entering the room without consent. Even if the noise was a problem, the method of resolving it was inappropriate. The correct approach would be to address the issue through proper channels, like talking to the person respectfully or using mediation, rather than confronting them in such a public and aggressive manner.\n\nSo, considering privacy violations and the aggressive confrontation, the answer is A (author is in the wrong).\n"
