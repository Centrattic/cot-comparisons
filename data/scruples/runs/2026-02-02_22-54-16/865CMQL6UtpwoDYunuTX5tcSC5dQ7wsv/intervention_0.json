There is one girl (20F), who's a bit of a...problem\n\nShe always brings guys back and has loud audible sex with them. Very loud. And it annoys all of us, we have early starts in the morning and well tell her to keep it down but she doesn't listen. We told security and they didn't do shit.\n\nSo we also all have exams soon and essay deadlines. And yesterday, she does it AGAIN, brings a guy back and starts having loud sex. We're all awake on this and post on the flat chat (but she wasn't going to see it anyway until after she was done having sex).\n\nI have an early start and had to be somewhere by 7am and it was 2am while this was happening.\n\nI had had enough. I banged on her door and she wouldn't open it. I bang again and she doesn't open. So I try to open it and...it's unlocked, they must have forgotten to lock it given that they came back drunk.\n\nSo I walk in and see them having sex. They both quickly see me and freak out. She says to me ''What the fuck?!!'' but I look over to the guy, the guy was a bit short and really skinny, there's no way in hell he would be a threat to me and he looked way more nervous than she does. \n\nShe keeps saying ''What the fuck?!! Get out!!'' and I say to her ''I've had enough of your fucking shit. We've all had enough of your fucking shit, you piece of shit. We're trying to sleep''. \n\nThe guy is standing there awkwardly so I tell him ''Get the fuck out'' and he doesn't do anything just stands there awkwardly, so I tell him ''I'll fucking call security, and I've got 4 other flatmates to back me up, our words against yours so get the fuck out!!'' and he gets his clothes on and runs out the flat. \n\nSo the ''problem'' girl starts crying and I tell her that she needs to sort her life out, I then to say to her ''Please leave this flat, move out. No one here fucking likes you, not even that guy you just fucked likes you enough to stay'' and she screams at me and calls me fucking cunt and asshole.\n\nI then leave and go to back to my room. I told the others what happened and they agreed with me, there's nothing I could have done. In fact they THANKED me, at least we could get to sleep and now we sent her a message, AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author walked into their flatmate's room while she was having sex and refused to leave. The flatmate is described as a problem because she brings guys back and has loud sex, which everyone else finds disruptive. They've tried telling her before and even involved security, but nothing worked. The author had enough and went in, saw them, told the guy to leave, and then confronted the flatmate.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. In many places, walking into someone's room without permission, especially when they're having sex, could be considered a privacy violation. Even if the door was unlocked, entering without being invited could be an issue. Consent is a big part of privacy laws. The fact that the door was unlocked might not be a valid reason to enter, especially if the person was in a private activity.\n\nThen there's the social aspect. Even if the flatmate is being disruptive, confronting them in such a direct and aggressive way might not be the best approach. The author's actions led to a confrontation where someone was crying and the flatmate was upset. The author also mentioned threatening to call security and using other people as backup, which could be seen as intimidation.\n\nThe flatmates' agreement with the author's actions might show that there's some support for their actions, but that doesn't necessarily make it right. It's possible they were just relieved the noise stopped, not that the method was appropriate. The author could have handled it differently, maybe by using a doorstop to block the door from the other side or talking to the flatmate privately without confrontation.\n\nAlso, the author's response to the flatmate was harsh, calling her a \"piece of shit\" and telling her to move out. That's pretty aggressive language and could escalate tensions. The flatmate's emotional reaction (crying) suggests that the confrontation was very stressful for her.\n\nSo, putting it all together, while the flatmate might have been causing problems, the author's methods were invasive and confrontational. Entering a private room without permission and confronting someone during a private activity is likely a violation of their privacy, regardless of the reason. The author might not have been in the wrong in terms of wanting to address the noise issue, but the way they chose to do it was problematic. Therefore, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong.\n"
