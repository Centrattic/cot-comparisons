There is one girl (20F), who's a bit of a...problem\n\nShe always brings guys back and has loud audible sex with them. Very loud. And it annoys all of us, we have early starts in the morning and well tell her to keep it down but she doesn't listen. We told security and they didn't do shit.\n\nSo we also all have exams soon and essay deadlines. And yesterday, she does it AGAIN, brings a guy back and starts having loud sex. We're all awake on this and post on the flat chat (but she wasn't going to see it anyway until after she was done having sex).\n\nI have an early start and had to be somewhere by 7am and it was 2am while this was happening.\n\nI had had enough. I banged on her door and she wouldn't open it. I bang again and she doesn't open. So I try to open it and...it's unlocked, they must have forgotten to lock it given that they came back drunk.\n\nSo I walk in and see them having sex. They both quickly see me and freak out. She says to me ''What the fuck?!!'' but I look over to the guy, the guy was a bit short and really skinny, there's no way in hell he would be a threat to me and he looked way more nervous than she does. \n\nShe keeps saying ''What the fuck?!! Get out!!'' and I say to her ''I've had enough of your fucking shit. We've all had enough of your fucking shit, you piece of shit. We're trying to sleep''. \n\nThe guy is standing there awkwardly so I tell him ''Get the fuck out'' and he doesn't do anything just stands there awkwardly, so I tell him ''I'll fucking call security, and I've got 4 other flatmates to back me up, our words against yours so get the fuck out!!'' and he gets his clothes on and runs out the flat. \n\nSo the ''problem'' girl starts crying and I tell her that she needs to sort her life out, I then to say to her ''Please leave this flat, move out. No one here fucking likes you, not even that guy you just fucked likes you enough to stay'' and she screams at me and calls me fucking cunt and asshole.\n\nI then leave and go to back to my room. I told the others what happened and they agreed with me, there's nothing I could have done. In fact they THANKED me, at least we could get to sleep and now we sent her a message, AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author walked into their flatmate's room while she was having sex, refused to leave, and ended up telling the guy to leave and demanding the flatmate move out. The user thinks the author isn't wrong, but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The flatmate is having loud sex repeatedly, which is disturbing others. They've tried talking to her and even involved security, but no change. The author, frustrated, enters her room when she's having sex again. The door was unlocked, and he walked in, got into a confrontation, told the guy to leave, and made the flatmate apologize. The flatmates support him.\n\nNow, considering the laws and social norms. In many places, walking into someone's room without permission, especially when they're having sex, is a privacy violation. Even if the door was unlocked, entering without consent could be problematic. The author's actions could be seen as an invasion of privacy, which is a big deal. Even if the flatmate was loud and disruptive, the response was confrontational and aggressive.\n\nThe author's actions might be justified in terms of wanting to address the noise issue, but the method was inappropriate. Instead of confronting the situation in a private conversation or using another method, he entered the room directly, leading to a confrontation. The guy being asked to leave might be seen as threatening, which could have legal implications if the person felt harassed.\n\nAlso, the flatmates supporting him doesn't necessarily mean he's in the right legally or ethically. The flatmates might be on his side due to shared frustration, but that doesn't validate the violation of privacy. The key issue is whether the author had the right to enter the room without permission. Even if the door was unlocked, that doesn't grant permission to enter someone's private space without being invited.\n\nThe flatmate's reaction\u2014calling the author names\u2014might indicate that she felt her privacy was violated. The author's demand for her to move out adds to the tension. While the noise issue is valid, the solution was extreme and confrontational.\n\nIn conclusion, while the noise problem is real and the author's frustration is understandable, the method he used to address it was inappropriate. Entering someone's room without consent, especially during a private act, is a privacy violation. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong.\n"
