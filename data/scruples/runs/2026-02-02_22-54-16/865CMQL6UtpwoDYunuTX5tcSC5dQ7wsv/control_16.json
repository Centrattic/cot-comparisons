There is one girl (20F), who's a bit of a...problem\n\nShe always brings guys back and has loud audible sex with them. Very loud. And it annoys all of us, we have early starts in the morning and well tell her to keep it down but she doesn't listen. We told security and they didn't do shit.\n\nSo we also all have exams soon and essay deadlines. And yesterday, she does it AGAIN, brings a guy back and starts having loud sex. We're all awake on this and post on the flat chat (but she wasn't going to see it anyway until after she was done having sex).\n\nI have an early start and had to be somewhere by 7am and it was 2am while this was happening.\n\nI had had enough. I banged on her door and she wouldn't open it. I bang again and she doesn't open. So I try to open it and...it's unlocked, they must have forgotten to lock it given that they came back drunk.\n\nSo I walk in and see them having sex. They both quickly see me and freak out. She says to me ''What the fuck?!!'' but I look over to the guy, the guy was a bit short and really skinny, there's no way in hell he would be a threat to me and he looked way more nervous than she does. \n\nShe keeps saying ''What the fuck?!! Get out!!'' and I say to her ''I've had enough of your fucking shit. We've all had enough of your fucking shit, you piece of shit. We're trying to sleep''. \n\nThe guy is standing there awkwardly so I tell him ''Get the fuck out'' and he doesn't do anything just stands there awkwardly, so I tell him ''I'll fucking call security, and I've got 4 other flatmates to back me up, our words against yours so get the fuck out!!'' and he gets his clothes on and runs out the flat. \n\nSo the ''problem'' girl starts crying and I tell her that she needs to sort her life out, I then to say to her ''Please leave this flat, move out. No one here fucking likes you, not even that guy you just fucked likes you enough to stay'' and she screams at me and calls me fucking cunt and asshole.\n\nI then leave and go to back to my room. I told the others what happened and they agreed with me, there's nothing I could have done. In fact they THANKED me, at least we could get to sleep and now we sent her a message, AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see here. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for walking into their flatmate's room while she was having sex and refusing to leave. The situation involves a shared flat with multiple people, loud sex that's been a recurring issue, and the author taking matters into their own hands.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and social aspects. Legally, walking into someone's room without permission, especially when they're in a private act like having sex, is a violation of their privacy. Even if the door was unlocked, entering without consent could be considered trespassing or invasion of privacy. The fact that the author saw the act and then confronted them might have legal implications depending on the jurisdiction. In some places, this could be considered voyeurism or sexual misconduct.\n\nSocially, the situation is about respecting boundaries. While the flatmates were annoyed and tried to address the noise, the author's approach was confrontational and invasive. The flatmate had a right to privacy, and the author's actions could be seen as crossing a line, even if the intent was to stop the noise. The fact that the author then told the guy to leave and the flatmate to move out adds to the confrontation. The others agreeing with the author doesn't negate the fact that the action was inappropriate.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that they had to be up early and were frustrated, which is understandable. But the solution involved direct confrontation and invasion of privacy rather than using other means. The flatmates had already told security, but they didn't help. However, that doesn't justify the author's actions. There might be better ways to handle it, like discussing boundaries more carefully or seeking mediation.\n\nIn summary, while the author's frustration is valid, the method of dealing with it was inappropriate. The invasion of privacy and confrontational behavior are likely to place the author in the wrong, regardless of the flatmates' agreement.\n"
