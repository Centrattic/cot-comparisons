There is one girl (20F), who's a bit of a...problem\n\nShe always brings guys back and has loud audible sex with them. Very loud. And it annoys all of us, we have early starts in the morning and well tell her to keep it down but she doesn't listen. We told security and they didn't do shit.\n\nSo we also all have exams soon and essay deadlines. And yesterday, she does it AGAIN, brings a guy back and starts having loud sex. We're all awake on this and post on the flat chat (but she wasn't going to see it anyway until after she was done having sex).\n\nI have an early start and had to be somewhere by 7am and it was 2am while this was happening.\n\nI had had enough. I banged on her door and she wouldn't open it. I bang again and she doesn't open. So I try to open it and...it's unlocked, they must have forgotten to lock it given that they came back drunk.\n\nSo I walk in and see them having sex. They both quickly see me and freak out. She says to me ''What the fuck?!!'' but I look over to the guy, the guy was a bit short and really skinny, there's no way in hell he would be a threat to me and he looked way more nervous than she does. \n\nShe keeps saying ''What the fuck?!! Get out!!'' and I say to her ''I've had enough of your fucking shit. We've all had enough of your fucking shit, you piece of shit. We're trying to sleep''. \n\nThe guy is standing there awkwardly so I tell him ''Get the fuck out'' and he doesn't do anything just stands there awkwardly, so I tell him ''I'll fucking call security, and I've got 4 other flatmates to back me up, our words against yours so get the fuck out!!'' and he gets his clothes on and runs out the flat. \n\nSo the ''problem'' girl starts crying and I tell her that she needs to sort her life out, I then to say to her ''Please leave this flat, move out. No one here fucking likes you, not even that guy you just fucked likes you enough to stay'' and she screams at me and calls me fucking cunt and asshole.\n\nI then leave and go to back to my room. I told the others what happened and they agreed with me, there's nothing I could have done. In fact they THANKED me, at least we could get to sleep and now we sent her a message, AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who walked into their flatmate's room during sex and refused to leave is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no).\n\nFirst, the situation: The author is a 20-year-old male in a university flat with five others, including a female flatmate who brings guys over and has loud sex, which is disturbing everyone. They've tried talking to her and even contacted security without success. On this particular night, the author, needing to wake up early, decides to confront her by entering her room when she's having sex again. The door was unlocked, possibly because they were drunk. The author yells at her, tells the guy to leave, and the guy eventually does. The flatmate is upset, calls the author names, and there's tension afterward.\n\nSo, the key points here are: entering someone's room without permission, especially during a private act like sex, and then confronting them. Even if the door was unlocked, entering someone's private space without consent is a big issue. Privacy is a fundamental right, and interrupting someone during a sexual act is a serious invasion of that privacy. The author's actions, while motivated by frustration, cross a line into respecting others' privacy. Even if the flatmates were annoyed, the solution involved violating personal boundaries. The fact that the door was unlocked doesn't justify entering without permission. The author's response was aggressive and confrontational, which could be seen as escalating the situation rather than addressing it calmly. The other flatmates might support him because they're also frustrated, but that doesn't negate the fact that he intruded on a private moment. So, even if the intentions were to seek peace, the method was inappropriate. Therefore, the answer would likely be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
