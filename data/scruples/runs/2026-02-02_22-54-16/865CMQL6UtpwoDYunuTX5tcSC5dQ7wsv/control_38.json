There is one girl (20F), who's a bit of a...problem\n\nShe always brings guys back and has loud audible sex with them. Very loud. And it annoys all of us, we have early starts in the morning and well tell her to keep it down but she doesn't listen. We told security and they didn't do shit.\n\nSo we also all have exams soon and essay deadlines. And yesterday, she does it AGAIN, brings a guy back and starts having loud sex. We're all awake on this and post on the flat chat (but she wasn't going to see it anyway until after she was done having sex).\n\nI have an early start and had to be somewhere by 7am and it was 2am while this was happening.\n\nI had had enough. I banged on her door and she wouldn't open it. I bang again and she doesn't open. So I try to open it and...it's unlocked, they must have forgotten to lock it given that they came back drunk.\n\nSo I walk in and see them having sex. They both quickly see me and freak out. She says to me ''What the fuck?!!'' but I look over to the guy, the guy was a bit short and really skinny, there's no way in hell he would be a threat to me and he looked way more nervous than she does. \n\nShe keeps saying ''What the fuck?!! Get out!!'' and I say to her ''I've had enough of your fucking shit. We've all had enough of your fucking shit, you piece of shit. We're trying to sleep''. \n\nThe guy is standing there awkwardly so I tell him ''Get the fuck out'' and he doesn't do anything just stands there awkwardly, so I tell him ''I'll fucking call security, and I've got 4 other flatmates to back me up, our words against yours so get the fuck out!!'' and he gets his clothes on and runs out the flat. \n\nSo the ''problem'' girl starts crying and I tell her that she needs to sort her life out, I then to say to her ''Please leave this flat, move out. No one here fucking likes you, not even that guy you just fucked likes you enough to stay'' and she screams at me and calls me fucking cunt and asshole.\n\nI then leave and go to back to my room. I told the others what happened and they agreed with me, there's nothing I could have done. In fact they THANKED me, at least we could get to sleep and now we sent her a message, AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. So, the situation is about walking into a flatmate's room while she's having sex and refusing to leave. Let's break down the key points.\n\nFirst, the author is a 20-year-old male living in a shared flat with five others, including a female flatmate who's brought guys back multiple times and had loud sex, which the others find disruptive. They've tried telling her to keep it down, even reported to security, but no help. Now, the author decided to take matters into his own hands again when this happened again at 2 AM. He went to her door, tried to get her to stop, found the door unlocked, walked in while they were having sex, told the guy to leave, and ended up in an argument with her.\n\nSo, the main issue here is entering someone's private space without permission, especially during a private act. Even if the door was unlocked, that's not an invitation to enter without consent. The author's actions could be seen as a violation of privacy. Even though the others were annoyed by the noise, confronting her in this way was probably not the right approach. The author's response was aggressive and confrontational, leading to escalation. The guy leaving after being threatened with calling security might be understandable for his own safety, but that's another aspect.\n\nLegally, walking into someone's room without their consent could be considered trespassing or invasion of privacy. The author's actions might have crossed a line, even if the flatmate's behavior was also problematic. The flatmates might have felt justified in their annoyance, but the method used here was inappropriate. The author's threat to call security and mention having others back him up could be seen as intimidation. The flatmate's emotional response and the subsequent fallout are also factors. \n\nEven though the other flatmates agreed with the author and thanked him, that doesn't necessarily make his actions right. The key here is the invasion of privacy. So, considering all that, the author is likely in the wrong. The answer would be A.\n"
