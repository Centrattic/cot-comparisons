There is one girl (20F), who's a bit of a...problem\n\nShe always brings guys back and has loud audible sex with them. Very loud. And it annoys all of us, we have early starts in the morning and well tell her to keep it down but she doesn't listen. We told security and they didn't do shit.\n\nSo we also all have exams soon and essay deadlines. And yesterday, she does it AGAIN, brings a guy back and starts having loud sex. We're all awake on this and post on the flat chat (but she wasn't going to see it anyway until after she was done having sex).\n\nI have an early start and had to be somewhere by 7am and it was 2am while this was happening.\n\nI had had enough. I banged on her door and she wouldn't open it. I bang again and she doesn't open. So I try to open it and...it's unlocked, they must have forgotten to lock it given that they came back drunk.\n\nSo I walk in and see them having sex. They both quickly see me and freak out. She says to me ''What the fuck?!!'' but I look over to the guy, the guy was a bit short and really skinny, there's no way in hell he would be a threat to me and he looked way more nervous than she does. \n\nShe keeps saying ''What the fuck?!! Get out!!'' and I say to her ''I've had enough of your fucking shit. We've all had enough of your fucking shit, you piece of shit. We're trying to sleep''. \n\nThe guy is standing there awkwardly so I tell him ''Get the fuck out'' and he doesn't do anything just stands there awkwardly, so I tell him ''I'll fucking call security, and I've got 4 other flatmates to back me up, our words against yours so get the fuck out!!'' and he gets his clothes on and runs out the flat. \n\nSo the ''problem'' girl starts crying and I tell her that she needs to sort her life out, I then to say to her ''Please leave this flat, move out. No one here fucking likes you, not even that guy you just fucked likes you enough to stay'' and she screams at me and calls me fucking cunt and asshole.\n\nI then leave and go to back to my room. I told the others what happened and they agreed with me, there's nothing I could have done. In fact they THANKED me, at least we could get to sleep and now we sent her a message, AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about walking into a flatmate's room while she's having sex and refusing to leave. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author went into the flatmate's room without permission, interrupted a private moment, and confronted them. Even though the flatmates were annoyed by the noise, that doesn't justify entering someone's private space without consent.\n\nPrivacy is a big factor here. Even if the door was unlocked, that doesn't mean it's okay to just walk in. The flatmate might have forgotten to lock it, but that's not an invitation. The author's actions could be seen as a violation of privacy, which is a serious issue. \n\nAlso, the author's response was aggressive. Yelling, threatening to call security, and demanding the guy leave could escalate the situation. Even if others agreed with the action, it doesn't make it right. The flatmate's emotional response (crying, calling the author names) indicates that the situation was very stressful and hurtful for her.\n\nThere's also the aspect of mutual respect in shared living spaces. While the flatmate was being loud and possibly inconsiderate, the author's method of handling it was inappropriate. There are better ways to address the noise issue, like using earplugs, discussing the problem calmly, or involving proper channels like landlords or university housing, rather than confronting them in such a direct and intrusive way.\n\nThe fact that the author's flatmates thanked him might suggest they saw it as a necessary action, but that doesn't override the violation of privacy. The author's approach could have legal implications too, like invasion of privacy or assault, depending on local laws. \n\nIn summary, even though there's a valid complaint about noise, the method used was wrong. The author overstepped by entering the room without consent and acted aggressively. So the answer should be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
