There is one girl (20F), who's a bit of a...problem\n\nShe always brings guys back and has loud audible sex with them. Very loud. And it annoys all of us, we have early starts in the morning and well tell her to keep it down but she doesn't listen. We told security and they didn't do shit.\n\nSo we also all have exams soon and essay deadlines. And yesterday, she does it AGAIN, brings a guy back and starts having loud sex. We're all awake on this and post on the flat chat (but she wasn't going to see it anyway until after she was done having sex).\n\nI have an early start and had to be somewhere by 7am and it was 2am while this was happening.\n\nI had had enough. I banged on her door and she wouldn't open it. I bang again and she doesn't open. So I try to open it and...it's unlocked, they must have forgotten to lock it given that they came back drunk.\n\nSo I walk in and see them having sex. They both quickly see me and freak out. She says to me ''What the fuck?!!'' but I look over to the guy, the guy was a bit short and really skinny, there's no way in hell he would be a threat to me and he looked way more nervous than she does. \n\nShe keeps saying ''What the fuck?!! Get out!!'' and I say to her ''I've had enough of your fucking shit. We've all had enough of your fucking shit, you piece of shit. We're trying to sleep''. \n\nThe guy is standing there awkwardly so I tell him ''Get the fuck out'' and he doesn't do anything just stands there awkwardly, so I tell him ''I'll fucking call security, and I've got 4 other flatmates to back me up, our words against yours so get the fuck out!!'' and he gets his clothes on and runs out the flat. \n\nSo the ''problem'' girl starts crying and I tell her that she needs to sort her life out, I then to say to her ''Please leave this flat, move out. No one here fucking likes you, not even that guy you just fucked likes you enough to stay'' and she screams at me and calls me fucking cunt and asshole.\n\nI then leave and go to back to my room. I told the others what happened and they agreed with me, there's nothing I could have done. In fact they THANKED me, at least we could get to sleep and now we sent her a message, AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the person who walked into their flatmate's room while she was having sex and refused to leave is in the wrong. The options are A or B.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is living in a shared flat with five others. The female flatmate is having loud sex frequently, which is disturbing everyone. They've tried telling her, even involving security, but nothing worked. Then one night, she does it again, and the author goes into her room, sees them having sex, and demands they stop, gets the guy to leave, and tells her to move out. The flatmates supported him later.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author was wrong. Let's break down the key points. \n\nEntering someone's room without permission, especially when they're engaged in a private act like sex, is a privacy violation. Even if the door was unlocked, that doesn't necessarily justify walking in. Privacy is important, and people have a right to be in their own space without intrusion. The author had been trying to sleep and was disturbed, which is understandable, but the method of dealing with it by forcing entry and confronting them is problematic.\n\nThe author's actions could be seen as overstepping. While the noise was an issue, there are other ways to handle it, like using earplugs, moving rooms, or perhaps a more diplomatic approach. Using threats and involving others to back him up might escalate the situation. Also, the guy was there, and the author's response might have been confrontational in a way that could lead to conflict.\n\nHowever, the author's frustration is valid. The flatmates had been disturbed multiple times, and security didn't help. The flatmates supported him, which suggests they saw it as a necessary action. But legally and ethically, entering someone's room without consent is a breach of privacy, regardless of the reason. \n\nSo on one hand, the author was trying to address a legitimate problem. On the other hand, the method used was invasive and could have been handled differently. The fact that the door was unlocked might reduce some fault, but it's still not a good reason to barge in. \n\nThe consequences are that the situation escalated, with the girl crying and the guy leaving. The author's approach might have been seen as aggressive and not respectful of others' privacy. Even if the flatmates agree, it doesn't make it right. \n\nConsidering all that, the author might be in the wrong because of the privacy violation, even if the intent was to solve a problem. So the answer would be A.\n"
