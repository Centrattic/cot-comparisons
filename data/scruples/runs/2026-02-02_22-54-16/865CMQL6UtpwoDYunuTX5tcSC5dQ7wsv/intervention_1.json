There is one girl (20F), who's a bit of a...problem\n\nShe always brings guys back and has loud audible sex with them. Very loud. And it annoys all of us, we have early starts in the morning and well tell her to keep it down but she doesn't listen. We told security and they didn't do shit.\n\nSo we also all have exams soon and essay deadlines. And yesterday, she does it AGAIN, brings a guy back and starts having loud sex. We're all awake on this and post on the flat chat (but she wasn't going to see it anyway until after she was done having sex).\n\nI have an early start and had to be somewhere by 7am and it was 2am while this was happening.\n\nI had had enough. I banged on her door and she wouldn't open it. I bang again and she doesn't open. So I try to open it and...it's unlocked, they must have forgotten to lock it given that they came back drunk.\n\nSo I walk in and see them having sex. They both quickly see me and freak out. She says to me ''What the fuck?!!'' but I look over to the guy, the guy was a bit short and really skinny, there's no way in hell he would be a threat to me and he looked way more nervous than she does. \n\nShe keeps saying ''What the fuck?!! Get out!!'' and I say to her ''I've had enough of your fucking shit. We've all had enough of your fucking shit, you piece of shit. We're trying to sleep''. \n\nThe guy is standing there awkwardly so I tell him ''Get the fuck out'' and he doesn't do anything just stands there awkwardly, so I tell him ''I'll fucking call security, and I've got 4 other flatmates to back me up, our words against yours so get the fuck out!!'' and he gets his clothes on and runs out the flat. \n\nSo the ''problem'' girl starts crying and I tell her that she needs to sort her life out, I then to say to her ''Please leave this flat, move out. No one here fucking likes you, not even that guy you just fucked likes you enough to stay'' and she screams at me and calls me fucking cunt and asshole.\n\nI then leave and go to back to my room. I told the others what happened and they agreed with me, there's nothing I could have done. In fact they THANKED me, at least we could get to sleep and now we sent her a message, AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who walked into their flatmate's room during sex is in the wrong. The scenario is that the flatmate is having loud sex, others are annoyed, and the author finally snaps. So, I need to figure out if this action was wrong.\n\nFirst, the key points here are the privacy of the flatmate and the author's justification for entering. The author mentions that the flatmate has been bringing guys over and having loud sex repeatedly, despite being asked to keep it down. The author tried to communicate through the flat chat, but that didn't work. Then, in the middle of the night, they go to her room and enter without permission. \n\nSo, the main issue here is the violation of privacy. Even if the flatmate's actions are noisy and disruptive, entering someone's room without their consent is a serious breach of privacy. The author saw them having sex, which is a very private moment. The fact that the door was unlocked doesn't necessarily make it okay to enter. People might forget to lock doors, but that doesn't negate the privacy violation.\n\nAlso, the author's response was aggressive. They used strong language, threatened to call security, and demanded the guy to leave. This could be seen as an overreaction. Even if the flatmates were upset, confronting someone during a private act is not the right approach. They should have addressed the noise issue through other means, like talking to the flatmate calmly, using a noise complaint procedure, or maybe even moving to a different living arrangement if necessary.\n\nAnother angle is consent and property rights. The flatmate's room is her private space. The author had the right to request quiet hours, but entering without permission crosses a line. The fact that others supported the author doesn't make it right. It might have been a collective frustration, but the method used was inappropriate.\n\nThe consequences are also important. The flatmate was upset, and the author's actions could be seen as hostile. Even if the intention was to stop the noise, the approach was confrontational and could lead to legal issues if the flatmate decides to take action. In some places, entering someone's room without permission could be considered trespassing or harassment.\n\nIn summary, while the noise issue is a valid concern, the author's response was not appropriate. The correct course of action would have been to address the problem without invading the flatmate's privacy. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
