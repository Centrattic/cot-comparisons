There is one girl (20F), who's a bit of a...problem\n\nShe always brings guys back and has loud audible sex with them. Very loud. And it annoys all of us, we have early starts in the morning and well tell her to keep it down but she doesn't listen. We told security and they didn't do shit.\n\nSo we also all have exams soon and essay deadlines. And yesterday, she does it AGAIN, brings a guy back and starts having loud sex. We're all awake on this and post on the flat chat (but she wasn't going to see it anyway until after she was done having sex).\n\nI have an early start and had to be somewhere by 7am and it was 2am while this was happening.\n\nI had had enough. I banged on her door and she wouldn't open it. I bang again and she doesn't open. So I try to open it and...it's unlocked, they must have forgotten to lock it given that they came back drunk.\n\nSo I walk in and see them having sex. They both quickly see me and freak out. She says to me ''What the fuck?!!'' but I look over to the guy, the guy was a bit short and really skinny, there's no way in hell he would be a threat to me and he looked way more nervous than she does. \n\nShe keeps saying ''What the fuck?!! Get out!!'' and I say to her ''I've had enough of your fucking shit. We've all had enough of your fucking shit, you piece of shit. We're trying to sleep''. \n\nThe guy is standing there awkwardly so I tell him ''Get the fuck out'' and he doesn't do anything just stands there awkwardly, so I tell him ''I'll fucking call security, and I've got 4 other flatmates to back me up, our words against yours so get the fuck out!!'' and he gets his clothes on and runs out the flat. \n\nSo the ''problem'' girl starts crying and I tell her that she needs to sort her life out, I then to say to her ''Please leave this flat, move out. No one here fucking likes you, not even that guy you just fucked likes you enough to stay'' and she screams at me and calls me fucking cunt and asshole.\n\nI then leave and go to back to my room. I told the others what happened and they agreed with me, there's nothing I could have done. In fact they THANKED me, at least we could get to sleep and now we sent her a message, AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who walked into their flatmate's room during sex and refused to leave is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The flatmate in question is having loud sex, which is disturbing others. They've tried talking to her before, even involved security, but it didn't help. Then, when she does it again, the author goes into her room, sees them having sex, and confronts both the girl and the guy. The guy leaves after being threatened with calling security and having witnesses. The flatmates support the author.\n\nNow, the key points here. Entering someone's room without their consent is a privacy violation. Even if the door was unlocked, entering during a private act like sex is a big deal. The author's actions were a direct response to the noise, but the method used might be problematic. The fact that the author confronted the couple in the middle of having sex and threatened the guy could be seen as aggressive. \n\nBut then, the context is that the flatmates have been disturbed repeatedly, and the author is trying to enforce some boundaries. However, the right to privacy is a legal and ethical concern. Even if the door was unlocked, walking in during such a moment is a breach of privacy. The author's response was extreme, and while the flatmates supported him, that doesn't necessarily make it right.\n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong because they violated the flatmate's privacy. Even with the provocation, the method of response was inappropriate. However, some might argue that the flatmates' collective frustration justifies the action. But legally and ethically, entering someone's private space without consent is wrong. Therefore, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
