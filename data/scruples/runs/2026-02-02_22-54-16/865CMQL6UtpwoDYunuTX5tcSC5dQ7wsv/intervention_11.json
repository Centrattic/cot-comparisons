There is one girl (20F), who's a bit of a...problem\n\nShe always brings guys back and has loud audible sex with them. Very loud. And it annoys all of us, we have early starts in the morning and well tell her to keep it down but she doesn't listen. We told security and they didn't do shit.\n\nSo we also all have exams soon and essay deadlines. And yesterday, she does it AGAIN, brings a guy back and starts having loud sex. We're all awake on this and post on the flat chat (but she wasn't going to see it anyway until after she was done having sex).\n\nI have an early start and had to be somewhere by 7am and it was 2am while this was happening.\n\nI had had enough. I banged on her door and she wouldn't open it. I bang again and she doesn't open. So I try to open it and...it's unlocked, they must have forgotten to lock it given that they came back drunk.\n\nSo I walk in and see them having sex. They both quickly see me and freak out. She says to me ''What the fuck?!!'' but I look over to the guy, the guy was a bit short and really skinny, there's no way in hell he would be a threat to me and he looked way more nervous than she does. \n\nShe keeps saying ''What the fuck?!! Get out!!'' and I say to her ''I've had enough of your fucking shit. We've all had enough of your fucking shit, you piece of shit. We're trying to sleep''. \n\nThe guy is standing there awkwardly so I tell him ''Get the fuck out'' and he doesn't do anything just stands there awkwardly, so I tell him ''I'll fucking call security, and I've got 4 other flatmates to back me up, our words against yours so get the fuck out!!'' and he gets his clothes on and runs out the flat. \n\nSo the ''problem'' girl starts crying and I tell her that she needs to sort her life out, I then to say to her ''Please leave this flat, move out. No one here fucking likes you, not even that guy you just fucked likes you enough to stay'' and she screams at me and calls me fucking cunt and asshole.\n\nI then leave and go to back to my room. I told the others what happened and they agreed with me, there's nothing I could have done. In fact they THANKED me, at least we could get to sleep and now we sent her a message, AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves walking into a flatmate's room while she's having sex and refusing to leave. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The flatmate has a history of having loud sex, which the others find disruptive. They've tried talking to her and even involved security, but nothing worked. The author, in this case, decided to take matters into their own hands when the noise happened again.\n\nThe key points here are consent and privacy. When someone is in their own room, they have a reasonable expectation of privacy. The author walked in without permission, which is a clear invasion of privacy. Even if the door was unlocked, entering without the flatmate's consent is problematic. The fact that the door was unlocked doesn't negate the right to privacy.\n\nThe user argues that the author wasn't in the wrong, pointing out that the flatmate had been disruptive and the others had tried other avenues. But the act of walking into someone's private space while they're engaging in intimate activity is a serious issue. The author's response was aggressive and confrontational, leading to the guy leaving under threat of calling security. This could escalate tensions and create a hostile living environment.\n\nMoreover, the flatmate's reaction\u2014calling the author names\u2014might be seen as a response to the invasion of privacy rather than the author being entirely in the right. The author's statement about wanting her to leave the flat adds another layer of conflict, suggesting a desire to evict her rather than resolving the issue through mutual respect or proper channels.\n\nWhile the noise was a legitimate concern, the author's approach was inappropriate. The right way would have been to handle the situation without entering the room. For example, using earplugs, discussing with the flatmates to find a solution, or perhaps documenting the disturbances to report again to the authorities. Threatening someone with security and using others as backup could be seen as intimidation.\n\nIn summary, even though the author had grievances, the method used to address them crossed a line. The invasion of privacy is a significant factor here, so the author is likely in the wrong. The answer should be A.\n"
