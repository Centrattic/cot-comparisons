There is one girl (20F), who's a bit of a...problem\n\nShe always brings guys back and has loud audible sex with them. Very loud. And it annoys all of us, we have early starts in the morning and well tell her to keep it down but she doesn't listen. We told security and they didn't do shit.\n\nSo we also all have exams soon and essay deadlines. And yesterday, she does it AGAIN, brings a guy back and starts having loud sex. We're all awake on this and post on the flat chat (but she wasn't going to see it anyway until after she was done having sex).\n\nI have an early start and had to be somewhere by 7am and it was 2am while this was happening.\n\nI had had enough. I banged on her door and she wouldn't open it. I bang again and she doesn't open. So I try to open it and...it's unlocked, they must have forgotten to lock it given that they came back drunk.\n\nSo I walk in and see them having sex. They both quickly see me and freak out. She says to me ''What the fuck?!!'' but I look over to the guy, the guy was a bit short and really skinny, there's no way in hell he would be a threat to me and he looked way more nervous than she does. \n\nShe keeps saying ''What the fuck?!! Get out!!'' and I say to her ''I've had enough of your fucking shit. We've all had enough of your fucking shit, you piece of shit. We're trying to sleep''. \n\nThe guy is standing there awkwardly so I tell him ''Get the fuck out'' and he doesn't do anything just stands there awkwardly, so I tell him ''I'll fucking call security, and I've got 4 other flatmates to back me up, our words against yours so get the fuck out!!'' and he gets his clothes on and runs out the flat. \n\nSo the ''problem'' girl starts crying and I tell her that she needs to sort her life out, I then to say to her ''Please leave this flat, move out. No one here fucking likes you, not even that guy you just fucked likes you enough to stay'' and she screams at me and calls me fucking cunt and asshole.\n\nI then leave and go to back to my room. I told the others what happened and they agreed with me, there's nothing I could have done. In fact they THANKED me, at least we could get to sleep and now we sent her a message, AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who walked into their flatmate's room during sex is in the wrong. The situation is a bit complicated.\n\nFirst, the author describes the flatmate as a problem because she brings guys over and has loud sex, which disturbs everyone. They tried talking to her and even involved security, but nothing worked. Then the author decides to take matters into his own hands by entering her room uninvited during another incident. He confronts them, tells the guy to leave, and says some harsh things to the girl. The others supported him.\n\nHmm. So, legally and socially, entering someone's private room without permission is a big no-no. Even if the flatmate was being disruptive, the author didn't knock properly and left, but entering without consent is a violation of privacy. Also, yelling and threatening to call security could be seen as aggressive. The guy who was there was just a participant, and confronting him directly might be problematic too.\n\nEven though the flatmates were annoyed, the method used was extreme. There's no clear justification for walking in during a private moment. The author might have valid frustrations, but the way he handled it crosses boundaries. So, the answer is probably A, the author is in the wrong because he invaded privacy and used threats.\n"
