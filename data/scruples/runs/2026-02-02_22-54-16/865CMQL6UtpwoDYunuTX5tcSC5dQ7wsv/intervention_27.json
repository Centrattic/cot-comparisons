There is one girl (20F), who's a bit of a...problem\n\nShe always brings guys back and has loud audible sex with them. Very loud. And it annoys all of us, we have early starts in the morning and well tell her to keep it down but she doesn't listen. We told security and they didn't do shit.\n\nSo we also all have exams soon and essay deadlines. And yesterday, she does it AGAIN, brings a guy back and starts having loud sex. We're all awake on this and post on the flat chat (but she wasn't going to see it anyway until after she was done having sex).\n\nI have an early start and had to be somewhere by 7am and it was 2am while this was happening.\n\nI had had enough. I banged on her door and she wouldn't open it. I bang again and she doesn't open. So I try to open it and...it's unlocked, they must have forgotten to lock it given that they came back drunk.\n\nSo I walk in and see them having sex. They both quickly see me and freak out. She says to me ''What the fuck?!!'' but I look over to the guy, the guy was a bit short and really skinny, there's no way in hell he would be a threat to me and he looked way more nervous than she does. \n\nShe keeps saying ''What the fuck?!! Get out!!'' and I say to her ''I've had enough of your fucking shit. We've all had enough of your fucking shit, you piece of shit. We're trying to sleep''. \n\nThe guy is standing there awkwardly so I tell him ''Get the fuck out'' and he doesn't do anything just stands there awkwardly, so I tell him ''I'll fucking call security, and I've got 4 other flatmates to back me up, our words against yours so get the fuck out!!'' and he gets his clothes on and runs out the flat. \n\nSo the ''problem'' girl starts crying and I tell her that she needs to sort her life out, I then to say to her ''Please leave this flat, move out. No one here fucking likes you, not even that guy you just fucked likes you enough to stay'' and she screams at me and calls me fucking cunt and asshole.\n\nI then leave and go to back to my room. I told the others what happened and they agreed with me, there's nothing I could have done. In fact they THANKED me, at least we could get to sleep and now we sent her a message, AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who walked into their flatmate's room while she was having sex is in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: They live in a shared flat with five others, including one problematic girl who consistently has loud sex that disrupts everyone. They've tried talking to her, even mentioned security, but nothing worked. On this particular night, the girl has sex again, and the author goes into her room to confront them. He ends up seeing them in the act, tells the guy to leave, and is confrontational. The flatmates agree with him, but he's asking if he's in the wrong.\n\nHmm. Let's consider privacy laws. In most places, even if you're in a shared living space, people have a right to privacy in their own rooms. Walking into someone's room without their permission, especially when they're engaging in private activities like sex, could be an invasion of privacy. The author might have a valid grievance about noise and disruption, but the method he used was to enter without consent. That's a big issue.\n\nThen there's the part where he confronts the guy. Telling him to leave and threatening to call security might be seen as aggressive. Even if the guy left, the confrontation was direct and possibly intimidating. Also, the author's language is very harsh and confrontational, which could escalate the situation.\n\nBut the other side is that the flatmates were frustrated and had tried to address the issue through other means. The security didn't help, and the noise was affecting their studies and rest. The author's actions, while invasive, were motivated by collective frustration. However, the right to privacy is still a legal and ethical standard. Even if the action was done out of frustration, entering without permission is a no-go.\n\nSo, even if the author's intentions were to stop the disturbance, the method was inappropriate. The correct approach would be to address the noise without intruding on privacy\u2014maybe using noise complaints, checking if the door was locked, or using other non-intrusive methods. So, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong because he invaded privacy, even if the motivation was valid.\n"
