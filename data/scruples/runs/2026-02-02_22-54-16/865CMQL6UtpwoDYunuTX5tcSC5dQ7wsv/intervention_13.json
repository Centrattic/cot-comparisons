There is one girl (20F), who's a bit of a...problem\n\nShe always brings guys back and has loud audible sex with them. Very loud. And it annoys all of us, we have early starts in the morning and well tell her to keep it down but she doesn't listen. We told security and they didn't do shit.\n\nSo we also all have exams soon and essay deadlines. And yesterday, she does it AGAIN, brings a guy back and starts having loud sex. We're all awake on this and post on the flat chat (but she wasn't going to see it anyway until after she was done having sex).\n\nI have an early start and had to be somewhere by 7am and it was 2am while this was happening.\n\nI had had enough. I banged on her door and she wouldn't open it. I bang again and she doesn't open. So I try to open it and...it's unlocked, they must have forgotten to lock it given that they came back drunk.\n\nSo I walk in and see them having sex. They both quickly see me and freak out. She says to me ''What the fuck?!!'' but I look over to the guy, the guy was a bit short and really skinny, there's no way in hell he would be a threat to me and he looked way more nervous than she does. \n\nShe keeps saying ''What the fuck?!! Get out!!'' and I say to her ''I've had enough of your fucking shit. We've all had enough of your fucking shit, you piece of shit. We're trying to sleep''. \n\nThe guy is standing there awkwardly so I tell him ''Get the fuck out'' and he doesn't do anything just stands there awkwardly, so I tell him ''I'll fucking call security, and I've got 4 other flatmates to back me up, our words against yours so get the fuck out!!'' and he gets his clothes on and runs out the flat. \n\nSo the ''problem'' girl starts crying and I tell her that she needs to sort her life out, I then to say to her ''Please leave this flat, move out. No one here fucking likes you, not even that guy you just fucked likes you enough to stay'' and she screams at me and calls me fucking cunt and asshole.\n\nI then leave and go to back to my room. I told the others what happened and they agreed with me, there's nothing I could have done. In fact they THANKED me, at least we could get to sleep and now we sent her a message, AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author walked into their flatmate's room while she was having sex and refused to leave. The flatmate is known for being loud during sex, which has been a problem for the others. They tried to talk to her, even told security, but nothing worked. Then one night, the author goes into her room when she's having sex again, tells the guy to leave, and confronts her. The question is whether the author is at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, walking into someone's private room without permission, especially when they're having sex, could be a privacy violation. Even if the door was unlocked, entering without being invited in would be a problem. The fact that the author saw them having sex might have legal implications, depending on local laws about invasion of privacy or voyeurism. So from a legal standpoint, the author might be in the wrong for entering without consent.\n\nThen there's the social/ethical angle. The flatmate was disturbing others with loud sex, which is a common house dispute. The author and others tried to resolve it through communication and even contacted security. However, the author's response of entering the room and confronting them directly could be seen as an overreaction. While the noise was an issue, the solution might have been to address the noise more directly, like using earplugs or talking to the flatmate again in a calmer manner. Instead, the author took a confrontational approach that intruded on the flatmate's privacy.\n\nAlso, the author's actions led to the guy leaving in fear of being reported to security. The author used threats, which could be seen as intimidation. Even if the others supported the action, using such methods might not be appropriate. The flatmate's emotional response and the fact that she called the author names might indicate that the confrontation was harsh and possibly traumatic for her.\n\nAnother point is the method of conflict resolution. The author could have tried other non-intrusive measures first, like using white noise machines, setting up a noise policy agreed by all, or perhaps mediating the situation with a neutral party. Entering someone's room in the middle of a private activity seems like a last resort that ignores personal boundaries.\n\nHowever, the author's intention was to stop the noise affecting their studies and sleep. The situation is understandable, but the method used might not be justified. The legal and ethical breaches could outweigh the initial problem, leading to the author being at fault.\n\nIn summary, while the noise issue is valid, the way the author addressed it by entering the room without permission and using threats might make them at fault. So, the answer could be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
