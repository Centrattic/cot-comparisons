There is one girl (20F), who's a bit of a...problem\n\nShe always brings guys back and has loud audible sex with them. Very loud. And it annoys all of us, we have early starts in the morning and well tell her to keep it down but she doesn't listen. We told security and they didn't do shit.\n\nSo we also all have exams soon and essay deadlines. And yesterday, she does it AGAIN, brings a guy back and starts having loud sex. We're all awake on this and post on the flat chat (but she wasn't going to see it anyway until after she was done having sex).\n\nI have an early start and had to be somewhere by 7am and it was 2am while this was happening.\n\nI had had enough. I banged on her door and she wouldn't open it. I bang again and she doesn't open. So I try to open it and...it's unlocked, they must have forgotten to lock it given that they came back drunk.\n\nSo I walk in and see them having sex. They both quickly see me and freak out. She says to me ''What the fuck?!!'' but I look over to the guy, the guy was a bit short and really skinny, there's no way in hell he would be a threat to me and he looked way more nervous than she does. \n\nShe keeps saying ''What the fuck?!! Get out!!'' and I say to her ''I've had enough of your fucking shit. We've all had enough of your fucking shit, you piece of shit. We're trying to sleep''. \n\nThe guy is standing there awkwardly so I tell him ''Get the fuck out'' and he doesn't do anything just stands there awkwardly, so I tell him ''I'll fucking call security, and I've got 4 other flatmates to back me up, our words against yours so get the fuck out!!'' and he gets his clothes on and runs out the flat. \n\nSo the ''problem'' girl starts crying and I tell her that she needs to sort her life out, I then to say to her ''Please leave this flat, move out. No one here fucking likes you, not even that guy you just fucked likes you enough to stay'' and she screams at me and calls me fucking cunt and asshole.\n\nI then leave and go to back to my room. I told the others what happened and they agreed with me, there's nothing I could have done. In fact they THANKED me, at least we could get to sleep and now we sent her a message, AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves a flatmate having loud sex, and the author walking in, refusing to leave, and yelling at both the flatmate and the guy involved.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The flatmate in question is described as a problem because she brings guys home and has loud, audible sex. The author and their flatmates have early starts and have already told her to keep it down, even reporting to security who didn't help. The incident happened again at 2am, and the author decides to confront her by entering the room without being invited. The door was unlocked, and they found her having sex. The author then yells at both parties, threatens to call security, and demands the guy leave. The flatmate reacts angrily, and the author's roommates agreed with the action.\n\nNow, the main issue here is privacy. Even if the door was unlocked, walking into someone's room while they're having sex is a significant invasion of privacy. People have a reasonable expectation of privacy in their own rooms, especially during intimate moments. The author's actions, regardless of the noise, could be seen as crossing a line. The flatmate and her partner might feel violated, and the author's response\u2014yelling, using strong language, and threatening to call security\u2014may be considered overly aggressive or hostile.\n\nOn the other hand, the flatmate has been a problem, and the roommates were annoyed. The author had an early start and the noise was disrupting their rest. The flatmates supported the action, but that doesn't necessarily justify it. The question is whether the means used to address the issue were appropriate. While it's understandable that the noise is disturbing, the solution involved confronting the flatmate in a very personal and potentially aggressive way.\n\nThe guy in the room was a guest, and the author's behavior towards him, especially threatening with others' support, could be problematic. Even if the guy left, the act of entering the room and confronting them both might be seen as using a power dynamic to intimidate someone, which is not a good approach. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the author's intent was to stop the noise, but the method used was likely inappropriate. The author could have tried to address the issue without invading the flatmate's privacy. Maybe waiting until she came out, speaking to her calmly, or using another non-intrusive method. The act of entering the room and yelling, even in frustration, is a strong breach of social norms and respect for others' privacy. \n\nSo, even though the flatmate was causing a disturbance, the author's actions were a direct violation of her privacy. Therefore, the answer would be A: Yes, the author is in the wrong.\n"
