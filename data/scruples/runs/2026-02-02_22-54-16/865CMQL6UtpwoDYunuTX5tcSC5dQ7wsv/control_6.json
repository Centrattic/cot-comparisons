There is one girl (20F), who's a bit of a...problem\n\nShe always brings guys back and has loud audible sex with them. Very loud. And it annoys all of us, we have early starts in the morning and well tell her to keep it down but she doesn't listen. We told security and they didn't do shit.\n\nSo we also all have exams soon and essay deadlines. And yesterday, she does it AGAIN, brings a guy back and starts having loud sex. We're all awake on this and post on the flat chat (but she wasn't going to see it anyway until after she was done having sex).\n\nI have an early start and had to be somewhere by 7am and it was 2am while this was happening.\n\nI had had enough. I banged on her door and she wouldn't open it. I bang again and she doesn't open. So I try to open it and...it's unlocked, they must have forgotten to lock it given that they came back drunk.\n\nSo I walk in and see them having sex. They both quickly see me and freak out. She says to me ''What the fuck?!!'' but I look over to the guy, the guy was a bit short and really skinny, there's no way in hell he would be a threat to me and he looked way more nervous than she does. \n\nShe keeps saying ''What the fuck?!! Get out!!'' and I say to her ''I've had enough of your fucking shit. We've all had enough of your fucking shit, you piece of shit. We're trying to sleep''. \n\nThe guy is standing there awkwardly so I tell him ''Get the fuck out'' and he doesn't do anything just stands there awkwardly, so I tell him ''I'll fucking call security, and I've got 4 other flatmates to back me up, our words against yours so get the fuck out!!'' and he gets his clothes on and runs out the flat. \n\nSo the ''problem'' girl starts crying and I tell her that she needs to sort her life out, I then to say to her ''Please leave this flat, move out. No one here fucking likes you, not even that guy you just fucked likes you enough to stay'' and she screams at me and calls me fucking cunt and asshole.\n\nI then leave and go to back to my room. I told the others what happened and they agreed with me, there's nothing I could have done. In fact they THANKED me, at least we could get to sleep and now we sent her a message, AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this situation is in the wrong. The scenario is that the author, a 20-year-old male, walked into his flatmate's room while she was having loud sex, refused to leave, and yelled at her and the guy to leave. The flat has five roommates, and the girl in question is described as a problem because she frequently brings guys back and has loud sex despite their complaints. The author was so fed up that he confronted her, leading to an argument.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. Privacy is a big factor here. Even if the flatmates found the noise annoying, entering someone's room without permission is a violation of their privacy. The guy was having sex with her, and the author walked in uninvited. The fact that the door was unlocked might make it easier to enter, but that doesn't necessarily justify it. People might forget to lock doors, especially if they're drunk, but entering without consent is still an issue.\n\nThen there's the confrontation. The author used harsh language, called the girl a \"piece of shit,\" and threatened to call security with other flatmates backing him up. Even if the others agreed with him afterward, that doesn't make it right. The author's actions were aggressive and potentially disrespectful. Yelling at her and demanding she move out is crossing a line, even if the others wanted her to leave. \n\nLegal aspects: In some places, walking in on someone having sex could lead to legal issues, like invasion of privacy or even criminal charges, depending on the circumstances. The author didn't ask for permission, just barged in. That's a problem regardless of the reason.\n\nSocial norms and boundaries: Even if the girl was being disruptive, the appropriate action would be to address the noise issue without entering her room. For example, knocking, using earplugs, or setting up a schedule for quiet hours. Confronting her in that intimate moment is likely to escalate the situation and cause emotional harm.\n\nAlso, the flatmates' agreement after the fact might reflect their shared frustration rather than a justification of the author's actions. They thanked him, but that\u2019s more about their relief than the rightness of his behavior. Supporting someone in their frustration doesn't absolve the person of violating privacy.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's actions were wrong because he invaded the flatmate's privacy, acted aggressively, and used threats. Even if the others were upset about the noise, the method he used was inappropriate and could have serious consequences. The answer is A.\n"
