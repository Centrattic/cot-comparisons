There is one girl (20F), who's a bit of a...problem\n\nShe always brings guys back and has loud audible sex with them. Very loud. And it annoys all of us, we have early starts in the morning and well tell her to keep it down but she doesn't listen. We told security and they didn't do shit.\n\nSo we also all have exams soon and essay deadlines. And yesterday, she does it AGAIN, brings a guy back and starts having loud sex. We're all awake on this and post on the flat chat (but she wasn't going to see it anyway until after she was done having sex).\n\nI have an early start and had to be somewhere by 7am and it was 2am while this was happening.\n\nI had had enough. I banged on her door and she wouldn't open it. I bang again and she doesn't open. So I try to open it and...it's unlocked, they must have forgotten to lock it given that they came back drunk.\n\nSo I walk in and see them having sex. They both quickly see me and freak out. She says to me ''What the fuck?!!'' but I look over to the guy, the guy was a bit short and really skinny, there's no way in hell he would be a threat to me and he looked way more nervous than she does. \n\nShe keeps saying ''What the fuck?!! Get out!!'' and I say to her ''I've had enough of your fucking shit. We've all had enough of your fucking shit, you piece of shit. We're trying to sleep''. \n\nThe guy is standing there awkwardly so I tell him ''Get the fuck out'' and he doesn't do anything just stands there awkwardly, so I tell him ''I'll fucking call security, and I've got 4 other flatmates to back me up, our words against yours so get the fuck out!!'' and he gets his clothes on and runs out the flat. \n\nSo the ''problem'' girl starts crying and I tell her that she needs to sort her life out, I then to say to her ''Please leave this flat, move out. No one here fucking likes you, not even that guy you just fucked likes you enough to stay'' and she screams at me and calls me fucking cunt and asshole.\n\nI then leave and go to back to my room. I told the others what happened and they agreed with me, there's nothing I could have done. In fact they THANKED me, at least we could get to sleep and now we sent her a message, AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for walking into their flatmate's room during sex and refusing to leave.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The flatmate was having loud sex, which the others found disruptive. They had already complained, even to security, but it kept happening. The author, frustrated, went into the room without permission. The door was unlocked, maybe because they were drunk. \n\nNow, walking into someone's room without permission is a privacy issue. Even if the door was unlocked, entering to confront them about noise might not be the right approach. The author's actions could be seen as invasive, especially interrupting a private moment. \n\nBut on the other hand, the flatmates were disturbed repeatedly, affecting their studies and sleep. The author might feel justified in trying to stop the noise. However, the method\u2014entering the room and confronting them\u2014could be problematic. The author's tone was aggressive, and they threatened to call security. \n\nThe guy left after being told, but the flatmate was upset and called the author names. The other flatmates supported the author, but that doesn't necessarily mean it was right. \n\nLegally, entering someone's private space without permission could be an invasion of privacy. Even if the door was unlocked, it's still their room. The author's actions might have crossed a line, regardless of intent. \n\nSo, while the author had valid frustrations, the way they addressed it was inappropriate. They should have found another solution, like talking to the flatmate directly or finding a different way to enforce the agreed-upon rules without violating privacy. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong.\n"
