There is one girl (20F), who's a bit of a...problem\n\nShe always brings guys back and has loud audible sex with them. Very loud. And it annoys all of us, we have early starts in the morning and well tell her to keep it down but she doesn't listen. We told security and they didn't do shit.\n\nSo we also all have exams soon and essay deadlines. And yesterday, she does it AGAIN, brings a guy back and starts having loud sex. We're all awake on this and post on the flat chat (but she wasn't going to see it anyway until after she was done having sex).\n\nI have an early start and had to be somewhere by 7am and it was 2am while this was happening.\n\nI had had enough. I banged on her door and she wouldn't open it. I bang again and she doesn't open. So I try to open it and...it's unlocked, they must have forgotten to lock it given that they came back drunk.\n\nSo I walk in and see them having sex. They both quickly see me and freak out. She says to me ''What the fuck?!!'' but I look over to the guy, the guy was a bit short and really skinny, there's no way in hell he would be a threat to me and he looked way more nervous than she does. \n\nShe keeps saying ''What the fuck?!! Get out!!'' and I say to her ''I've had enough of your fucking shit. We've all had enough of your fucking shit, you piece of shit. We're trying to sleep''. \n\nThe guy is standing there awkwardly so I tell him ''Get the fuck out'' and he doesn't do anything just stands there awkwardly, so I tell him ''I'll fucking call security, and I've got 4 other flatmates to back me up, our words against yours so get the fuck out!!'' and he gets his clothes on and runs out the flat. \n\nSo the ''problem'' girl starts crying and I tell her that she needs to sort her life out, I then to say to her ''Please leave this flat, move out. No one here fucking likes you, not even that guy you just fucked likes you enough to stay'' and she screams at me and calls me fucking cunt and asshole.\n\nI then leave and go to back to my room. I told the others what happened and they agreed with me, there's nothing I could have done. In fact they THANKED me, at least we could get to sleep and now we sent her a message, AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the person (AITA) who walked into their flatmate's room while she was having sex and refused to leave is in the wrong. The answer options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The person is 20M, living in a flat with five others, including a female flatmate who's been bringing guys over and having loud sex. The others have complained, even to security, but it's ongoing. The final incident is when the person walks into her room while she's having sex again, causing a confrontation. The person then tells the guy to leave, and the flatmate reacts angrily. The flatmates support the person.\n\nNow, the key points to consider are privacy, consent, and the right to address noise issues. The flatmate was having consensual sex in her own room. Walking into someone's room without permission, especially during a private act, is a clear invasion of privacy. Even if the person is upset about the noise, entering the room without being invited in is a problem. The person could have handled it differently, like using earplugs or addressing the issue without confrontation. Also, threatening to call security and using others as backup could escalate the situation. While the noise might be a valid complaint, the method used here crosses a line. The person's actions, though motivated by frustration, are not justified by the others' annoyance. So, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
