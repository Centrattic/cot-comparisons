There is one girl (20F), who's a bit of a...problem\n\nShe always brings guys back and has loud audible sex with them. Very loud. And it annoys all of us, we have early starts in the morning and well tell her to keep it down but she doesn't listen. We told security and they didn't do shit.\n\nSo we also all have exams soon and essay deadlines. And yesterday, she does it AGAIN, brings a guy back and starts having loud sex. We're all awake on this and post on the flat chat (but she wasn't going to see it anyway until after she was done having sex).\n\nI have an early start and had to be somewhere by 7am and it was 2am while this was happening.\n\nI had had enough. I banged on her door and she wouldn't open it. I bang again and she doesn't open. So I try to open it and...it's unlocked, they must have forgotten to lock it given that they came back drunk.\n\nSo I walk in and see them having sex. They both quickly see me and freak out. She says to me ''What the fuck?!!'' but I look over to the guy, the guy was a bit short and really skinny, there's no way in hell he would be a threat to me and he looked way more nervous than she does. \n\nShe keeps saying ''What the fuck?!! Get out!!'' and I say to her ''I've had enough of your fucking shit. We've all had enough of your fucking shit, you piece of shit. We're trying to sleep''. \n\nThe guy is standing there awkwardly so I tell him ''Get the fuck out'' and he doesn't do anything just stands there awkwardly, so I tell him ''I'll fucking call security, and I've got 4 other flatmates to back me up, our words against yours so get the fuck out!!'' and he gets his clothes on and runs out the flat. \n\nSo the ''problem'' girl starts crying and I tell her that she needs to sort her life out, I then to say to her ''Please leave this flat, move out. No one here fucking likes you, not even that guy you just fucked likes you enough to stay'' and she screams at me and calls me fucking cunt and asshole.\n\nI then leave and go to back to my room. I told the others what happened and they agreed with me, there's nothing I could have done. In fact they THANKED me, at least we could get to sleep and now we sent her a message, AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who walked into their flatmate's room during sex is in the wrong. The scenario is that the flatmate has repeatedly had loud sex, disturbing others, and the author finally had enough and entered the room when it was unlocked, confronting them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider privacy laws. In most places, entering someone's room without permission is a violation of their privacy. Even if the door was unlocked, that doesn't necessarily give someone the right to walk in uninvited. The author saw the flatmate and another person having sex, which is a private activity. The act of entering without consent could be considered an invasion of privacy, regardless of the reason.\n\nThen there's the aspect of consent. The flatmate didn't invite the author in, so even if the door was unlocked, the author's presence wasn't consensual. The immediate reaction of the flatmate and the other person indicates that they didn't want the author there. The author's confrontational behavior, including yelling and threatening to call security, adds to the issue. Using aggressive language and threatening actions, even if other flatmates supported it, might not be the right approach in a legal or ethical sense.\n\nAlso, the author's motivation is understandable\u2014disturbance from loud activities and needing to rest. However, the method used to address the problem was extreme. Instead of confronting the issue in a more respectful manner, like setting boundaries or finding another way to address the ongoing noise, the author chose a direct and intrusive approach. This could lead to legal consequences, such as charges related to invasion of privacy or assault if the flatmate decides to pursue it.\n\nThe flatmates agreeing with the author's actions doesn't make it right from a legal perspective. Group support doesn't mitigate the violation of someone's privacy. The author might face repercussions if the flatmate reports the incident. Additionally, the emotional impact on the flatmate, who was upset and crying, suggests that the approach was hurtful and could escalate tensions in the household.\n\nIn summary, while the author's frustration is valid, the method of handling the situation was inappropriate. The right to privacy is a fundamental aspect, and entering someone's room during a private activity without permission crosses a line, making the author at fault.\n"
