There is one girl (20F), who's a bit of a...problem\n\nShe always brings guys back and has loud audible sex with them. Very loud. And it annoys all of us, we have early starts in the morning and well tell her to keep it down but she doesn't listen. We told security and they didn't do shit.\n\nSo we also all have exams soon and essay deadlines. And yesterday, she does it AGAIN, brings a guy back and starts having loud sex. We're all awake on this and post on the flat chat (but she wasn't going to see it anyway until after she was done having sex).\n\nI have an early start and had to be somewhere by 7am and it was 2am while this was happening.\n\nI had had enough. I banged on her door and she wouldn't open it. I bang again and she doesn't open. So I try to open it and...it's unlocked, they must have forgotten to lock it given that they came back drunk.\n\nSo I walk in and see them having sex. They both quickly see me and freak out. She says to me ''What the fuck?!!'' but I look over to the guy, the guy was a bit short and really skinny, there's no way in hell he would be a threat to me and he looked way more nervous than she does. \n\nShe keeps saying ''What the fuck?!! Get out!!'' and I say to her ''I've had enough of your fucking shit. We've all had enough of your fucking shit, you piece of shit. We're trying to sleep''. \n\nThe guy is standing there awkwardly so I tell him ''Get the fuck out'' and he doesn't do anything just stands there awkwardly, so I tell him ''I'll fucking call security, and I've got 4 other flatmates to back me up, our words against yours so get the fuck out!!'' and he gets his clothes on and runs out the flat. \n\nSo the ''problem'' girl starts crying and I tell her that she needs to sort her life out, I then to say to her ''Please leave this flat, move out. No one here fucking likes you, not even that guy you just fucked likes you enough to stay'' and she screams at me and calls me fucking cunt and asshole.\n\nI then leave and go to back to my room. I told the others what happened and they agreed with me, there's nothing I could have done. In fact they THANKED me, at least we could get to sleep and now we sent her a message, AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who walked into their flatmate's room during sex is in the wrong. The situation is complex, so I need to break it down.\n\nFirst, the roommate was having loud sex, which disturbed others. The flatmates had complained before, even to security, but it didn't help. The author, frustrated, went into the room when the door was unlocked. He saw them, told the guy to leave, and said some harsh things. The roommate got upset, called him names, and now he's asking if he's at fault.\n\nSo, key points: entering someone's room without permission, even if the door was unlocked. Privacy is a big factor here. Even if the door was unlocked, walking in unannounced during an intimate moment could be a violation of privacy. The author argues that the others were annoyed and needed sleep, but does that justify invading someone's privacy? Also, he confronted them and told the guy to leave, which could be seen as aggressive. The guy left after being threatened with calling security, so maybe the author used intimidation. The roommate called him names, but that doesn't necessarily make the author right. \n\nFrom a legal standpoint, if the door was unlocked, maybe there's a difference between entering versus knocking. But in social terms, privacy expectations are high. Even if the door is unlocked, people have a right to privacy in their own rooms, especially during intimate moments. The author's actions, while motivated by frustration, might be considered disrespectful or overstepping, regardless of the complaints about noise. The flatmates might support him, but that doesn't mean the action itself was correct. \n\nAlso, threatening to call security and using others as backup could be seen as using group pressure to intimidate. The author's language was harsh, which adds to the issue. Even if the roommate was being problematic, the method of dealing with it was confrontational and invasive. So, the answer might be that the author is in the wrong because of invading privacy, even if the motivation was understandable. But I need to check if entering an unlocked room is acceptable. Some might argue that if the door is unlocked, it's not a violation, but others would say that doesn't negate the privacy aspect. So it's a bit of a gray area, but generally, entering someone's room without their consent during an intimate act is a breach of privacy. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong.\n"
