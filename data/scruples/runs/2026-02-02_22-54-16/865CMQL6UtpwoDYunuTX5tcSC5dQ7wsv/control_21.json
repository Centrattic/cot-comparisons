There is one girl (20F), who's a bit of a...problem\n\nShe always brings guys back and has loud audible sex with them. Very loud. And it annoys all of us, we have early starts in the morning and well tell her to keep it down but she doesn't listen. We told security and they didn't do shit.\n\nSo we also all have exams soon and essay deadlines. And yesterday, she does it AGAIN, brings a guy back and starts having loud sex. We're all awake on this and post on the flat chat (but she wasn't going to see it anyway until after she was done having sex).\n\nI have an early start and had to be somewhere by 7am and it was 2am while this was happening.\n\nI had had enough. I banged on her door and she wouldn't open it. I bang again and she doesn't open. So I try to open it and...it's unlocked, they must have forgotten to lock it given that they came back drunk.\n\nSo I walk in and see them having sex. They both quickly see me and freak out. She says to me ''What the fuck?!!'' but I look over to the guy, the guy was a bit short and really skinny, there's no way in hell he would be a threat to me and he looked way more nervous than she does. \n\nShe keeps saying ''What the fuck?!! Get out!!'' and I say to her ''I've had enough of your fucking shit. We've all had enough of your fucking shit, you piece of shit. We're trying to sleep''. \n\nThe guy is standing there awkwardly so I tell him ''Get the fuck out'' and he doesn't do anything just stands there awkwardly, so I tell him ''I'll fucking call security, and I've got 4 other flatmates to back me up, our words against yours so get the fuck out!!'' and he gets his clothes on and runs out the flat. \n\nSo the ''problem'' girl starts crying and I tell her that she needs to sort her life out, I then to say to her ''Please leave this flat, move out. No one here fucking likes you, not even that guy you just fucked likes you enough to stay'' and she screams at me and calls me fucking cunt and asshole.\n\nI then leave and go to back to my room. I told the others what happened and they agreed with me, there's nothing I could have done. In fact they THANKED me, at least we could get to sleep and now we sent her a message, AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for walking into his flatmate's room while she was having sex and then refusing to leave. \n\nFirst, I need to consider privacy and respect. Even if the flatmate was having loud sex, entering her room without permission is a clear invasion of privacy. Privacy is a basic right, and regardless of the noise level, she had the right to be in her own room without being disturbed.\n\nNext, the author's actions. He walked in uninvited, which is a problem. Even if others were annoyed, that doesn't justify his intrusion. He could have addressed the noise issue through other means, like talking to her outside the room or using a louder volume on their end. But storming into her room is not an appropriate response.\n\nThen there's the confrontation. He yelled at her, called her names, and demanded that she leave. His language was aggressive and disrespectful. Even if he was frustrated, the way he handled it was confrontational and disrespectful. The guy who was with her was also treated harshly, being threatened with a call to security and told to leave. Those actions could be seen as intimidation.\n\nThe aftermath is important too. The flatmates agreed with him, but their agreement doesn't make the action right. The fact that they thanked him suggests they might have been fed up too, but that doesn't negate the fact that his actions were invasive and disrespectful.\n\nLegal perspective: Depending on the jurisdiction, entering someone's room without permission could be trespassing or invasion of privacy. Even if it's a shared flat, each person has the right to privacy in their own space unless there's a specific agreement otherwise.\n\nPossible consequences: The flatmate could report this incident, leading to conflict with the university or housing authorities. The author's behavior might be seen as aggressive and unprofessional, even if the others agreed with his intent.\n\nAlternatives: There were other ways to handle the noise. Maybe using earplugs, having a conversation with the flatmate before the incident, or involving a mediator. Threatening to call security without actually doing so might be seen as bullying.\n\nIn summary, while the author's frustration is understandable, his actions crossed boundaries, invaded privacy, and were disrespectful. The right answer here is A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
