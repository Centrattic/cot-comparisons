There is one girl (20F), who's a bit of a...problem\n\nShe always brings guys back and has loud audible sex with them. Very loud. And it annoys all of us, we have early starts in the morning and well tell her to keep it down but she doesn't listen. We told security and they didn't do shit.\n\nSo we also all have exams soon and essay deadlines. And yesterday, she does it AGAIN, brings a guy back and starts having loud sex. We're all awake on this and post on the flat chat (but she wasn't going to see it anyway until after she was done having sex).\n\nI have an early start and had to be somewhere by 7am and it was 2am while this was happening.\n\nI had had enough. I banged on her door and she wouldn't open it. I bang again and she doesn't open. So I try to open it and...it's unlocked, they must have forgotten to lock it given that they came back drunk.\n\nSo I walk in and see them having sex. They both quickly see me and freak out. She says to me ''What the fuck?!!'' but I look over to the guy, the guy was a bit short and really skinny, there's no way in hell he would be a threat to me and he looked way more nervous than she does. \n\nShe keeps saying ''What the fuck?!! Get out!!'' and I say to her ''I've had enough of your fucking shit. We've all had enough of your fucking shit, you piece of shit. We're trying to sleep''. \n\nThe guy is standing there awkwardly so I tell him ''Get the fuck out'' and he doesn't do anything just stands there awkwardly, so I tell him ''I'll fucking call security, and I've got 4 other flatmates to back me up, our words against yours so get the fuck out!!'' and he gets his clothes on and runs out the flat. \n\nSo the ''problem'' girl starts crying and I tell her that she needs to sort her life out, I then to say to her ''Please leave this flat, move out. No one here fucking likes you, not even that guy you just fucked likes you enough to stay'' and she screams at me and calls me fucking cunt and asshole.\n\nI then leave and go to back to my room. I told the others what happened and they agreed with me, there's nothing I could have done. In fact they THANKED me, at least we could get to sleep and now we sent her a message, AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who walked into their flatmate's room during sex and refused to leave is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The flatmate was having loud sex, which the others found disturbing, and they had previously asked her to keep it down without success. The author went into the room, saw them, told the guy to leave, and then confronted the girl. The others agreed with the author, but the question is about whether the author was wrong.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, entering someone's room without permission, especially when they're in the middle of a private act, could be an invasion of privacy. Even if the door was unlocked, walking in uninvited might be considered trespassing or a violation of their right to privacy. The author's actions could lead to accusations of assault or invasion of privacy, depending on jurisdiction.\n\nEthically, it's a bit tricky. The author was frustrated and wanted to address the noise issue, which is a legitimate concern. However, the method of confronting the situation by entering the room and scolding them is extreme. The author's actions escalated the situation, potentially causing emotional distress to the flatmate. Even though the flatmates agreed with the action, it doesn't necessarily make it right. \n\nAlso, the author threatened to call security and mentioned having other flatmates back them up, which might be a form of intimidation. The guy leaving out of fear of being outnumbered could be seen as the author using group power to force him out, which isn't a respectful resolution.\n\nIn terms of conflict resolution, there are better ways to handle the noise issue, like discussing it calmly, using earplugs, or setting up a formal agreement. The author's approach was confrontational and violated privacy, which is a significant factor. \n\nSo, while the author's frustration is understandable, the method used was inappropriate. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because they invaded someone's privacy and used aggressive tactics instead of seeking a more respectful solution.\n"
