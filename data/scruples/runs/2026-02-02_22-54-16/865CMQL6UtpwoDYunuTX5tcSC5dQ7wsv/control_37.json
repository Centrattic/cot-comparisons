There is one girl (20F), who's a bit of a...problem\n\nShe always brings guys back and has loud audible sex with them. Very loud. And it annoys all of us, we have early starts in the morning and well tell her to keep it down but she doesn't listen. We told security and they didn't do shit.\n\nSo we also all have exams soon and essay deadlines. And yesterday, she does it AGAIN, brings a guy back and starts having loud sex. We're all awake on this and post on the flat chat (but she wasn't going to see it anyway until after she was done having sex).\n\nI have an early start and had to be somewhere by 7am and it was 2am while this was happening.\n\nI had had enough. I banged on her door and she wouldn't open it. I bang again and she doesn't open. So I try to open it and...it's unlocked, they must have forgotten to lock it given that they came back drunk.\n\nSo I walk in and see them having sex. They both quickly see me and freak out. She says to me ''What the fuck?!!'' but I look over to the guy, the guy was a bit short and really skinny, there's no way in hell he would be a threat to me and he looked way more nervous than she does. \n\nShe keeps saying ''What the fuck?!! Get out!!'' and I say to her ''I've had enough of your fucking shit. We've all had enough of your fucking shit, you piece of shit. We're trying to sleep''. \n\nThe guy is standing there awkwardly so I tell him ''Get the fuck out'' and he doesn't do anything just stands there awkwardly, so I tell him ''I'll fucking call security, and I've got 4 other flatmates to back me up, our words against yours so get the fuck out!!'' and he gets his clothes on and runs out the flat. \n\nSo the ''problem'' girl starts crying and I tell her that she needs to sort her life out, I then to say to her ''Please leave this flat, move out. No one here fucking likes you, not even that guy you just fucked likes you enough to stay'' and she screams at me and calls me fucking cunt and asshole.\n\nI then leave and go to back to my room. I told the others what happened and they agreed with me, there's nothing I could have done. In fact they THANKED me, at least we could get to sleep and now we sent her a message, AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see here. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves walking into a flatmate's room during sex and refusing to leave. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author is a 20-year-old male living in a flat with five others, including a female flatmate who frequently brings guys over and has loud sex. The others have tried to address this by talking to her and even security, but it didn't work. On this particular night, the author, needing to wake up early, decides to confront her by entering her room when she's having sex again. He finds them in the act, tells the guy to leave, and confronts the girl, leading to an argument.\n\nNow, the main issue here is the act of entering someone's private room without permission, especially during a private moment. Even if the flatmates were annoyed by the noise, breaking into the room (though the door was unlocked) and confronting them directly could be considered a violation of privacy. The author might have had a valid grievance about the noise, but the method of addressing it was extreme. \n\nIn terms of the law, entering someone's room without their consent, even if the door is unlocked, could be seen as trespassing or invasion of privacy. The emotional impact on the girl and the guy is also significant. The girl was crying and felt violated, and the guy left in fear. The flatmates' support doesn't necessarily justify the action, as their gratitude might be influenced by their shared annoyance rather than the rightness of the action.\n\nMoreover, there's the aspect of confrontation and threats involved. The author threatened to call security and mentioned having others back him up, which could be seen as intimidation. Even if the intention was to stop the noise, the approach was confrontational and potentially aggressive.\n\nHowever, the author's actions could be seen as a last resort after previous attempts to resolve the issue failed. The noise was disturbing their sleep and affecting their studies. But that doesn't excuse breaking into the room and confronting them in such a manner. There might be other ways to address the issue, like using white noise machines or discussing boundaries more effectively, but the author chose a direct and invasive approach.\n\nConsidering all these factors, the act of entering the room without consent, regardless of the reason, is a breach of privacy. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong. But maybe there's a nuance here. The door was unlocked, so maybe that complicates it a bit. However, even if the door was unlocked, entering without permission during a private act is still problematic. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because they violated the privacy of their flatmate and the partner, even if the intent was to address a legitimate issue.\n"
