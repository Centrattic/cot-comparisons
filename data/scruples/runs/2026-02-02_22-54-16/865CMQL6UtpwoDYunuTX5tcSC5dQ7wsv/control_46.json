There is one girl (20F), who's a bit of a...problem\n\nShe always brings guys back and has loud audible sex with them. Very loud. And it annoys all of us, we have early starts in the morning and well tell her to keep it down but she doesn't listen. We told security and they didn't do shit.\n\nSo we also all have exams soon and essay deadlines. And yesterday, she does it AGAIN, brings a guy back and starts having loud sex. We're all awake on this and post on the flat chat (but she wasn't going to see it anyway until after she was done having sex).\n\nI have an early start and had to be somewhere by 7am and it was 2am while this was happening.\n\nI had had enough. I banged on her door and she wouldn't open it. I bang again and she doesn't open. So I try to open it and...it's unlocked, they must have forgotten to lock it given that they came back drunk.\n\nSo I walk in and see them having sex. They both quickly see me and freak out. She says to me ''What the fuck?!!'' but I look over to the guy, the guy was a bit short and really skinny, there's no way in hell he would be a threat to me and he looked way more nervous than she does. \n\nShe keeps saying ''What the fuck?!! Get out!!'' and I say to her ''I've had enough of your fucking shit. We've all had enough of your fucking shit, you piece of shit. We're trying to sleep''. \n\nThe guy is standing there awkwardly so I tell him ''Get the fuck out'' and he doesn't do anything just stands there awkwardly, so I tell him ''I'll fucking call security, and I've got 4 other flatmates to back me up, our words against yours so get the fuck out!!'' and he gets his clothes on and runs out the flat. \n\nSo the ''problem'' girl starts crying and I tell her that she needs to sort her life out, I then to say to her ''Please leave this flat, move out. No one here fucking likes you, not even that guy you just fucked likes you enough to stay'' and she screams at me and calls me fucking cunt and asshole.\n\nI then leave and go to back to my room. I told the others what happened and they agreed with me, there's nothing I could have done. In fact they THANKED me, at least we could get to sleep and now we sent her a message, AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong after walking into his flatmate's room while she was having sex and refusing to leave. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author lives in a shared flat with five others. The female flatmate is having loud sex frequently, which is disturbing everyone. They've tried talking to her, even mentioned it to security, but it didn't help. On this particular night, after another incident, the author decides to confront her by entering her room when it was unlocked. He finds her and a guy having sex, and he tells the guy to leave, which he does. The flatmate is upset and calls him names.\n\nThe main issues here are privacy and the right to enter someone's room without permission. Even if the door was unlocked, walking into someone's private space without their consent is a violation of their privacy. The author's actions, while motivated by frustration and a desire to get some sleep, cross a line. Public health and safety guidelines usually emphasize respecting others' privacy, even in shared living situations. Security or management should be the ones to address such issues, not roommates taking matters into their own hands.\n\nAlso, the author's response was confrontational and aggressive. Telling the guy to leave and threatening to call security could be seen as intimidation. The flatmate's emotional reaction (crying) indicates that the situation escalated. The other flatmates might support him for getting some sleep, but that doesn't justify the violation of privacy. \n\nIn many places, entering someone's private room without permission is a breach of their right to privacy, regardless of the reason. The author's actions could lead to legal or social consequences, even if the door was unlocked. It's possible that the flatmate could report the intrusion, leading to disciplinary action. \n\nSo, considering all these points, the author's actions were inappropriate. Even though the flatmate was causing a disturbance, the method of addressing it was wrong. The correct approach would be to involve the appropriate authorities or management, not to enter the room and confront them directly. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
