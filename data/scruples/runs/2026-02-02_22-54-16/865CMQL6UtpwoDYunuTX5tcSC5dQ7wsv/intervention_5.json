There is one girl (20F), who's a bit of a...problem\n\nShe always brings guys back and has loud audible sex with them. Very loud. And it annoys all of us, we have early starts in the morning and well tell her to keep it down but she doesn't listen. We told security and they didn't do shit.\n\nSo we also all have exams soon and essay deadlines. And yesterday, she does it AGAIN, brings a guy back and starts having loud sex. We're all awake on this and post on the flat chat (but she wasn't going to see it anyway until after she was done having sex).\n\nI have an early start and had to be somewhere by 7am and it was 2am while this was happening.\n\nI had had enough. I banged on her door and she wouldn't open it. I bang again and she doesn't open. So I try to open it and...it's unlocked, they must have forgotten to lock it given that they came back drunk.\n\nSo I walk in and see them having sex. They both quickly see me and freak out. She says to me ''What the fuck?!!'' but I look over to the guy, the guy was a bit short and really skinny, there's no way in hell he would be a threat to me and he looked way more nervous than she does. \n\nShe keeps saying ''What the fuck?!! Get out!!'' and I say to her ''I've had enough of your fucking shit. We've all had enough of your fucking shit, you piece of shit. We're trying to sleep''. \n\nThe guy is standing there awkwardly so I tell him ''Get the fuck out'' and he doesn't do anything just stands there awkwardly, so I tell him ''I'll fucking call security, and I've got 4 other flatmates to back me up, our words against yours so get the fuck out!!'' and he gets his clothes on and runs out the flat. \n\nSo the ''problem'' girl starts crying and I tell her that she needs to sort her life out, I then to say to her ''Please leave this flat, move out. No one here fucking likes you, not even that guy you just fucked likes you enough to stay'' and she screams at me and calls me fucking cunt and asshole.\n\nI then leave and go to back to my room. I told the others what happened and they agreed with me, there's nothing I could have done. In fact they THANKED me, at least we could get to sleep and now we sent her a message, AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for walking into their flatmate's room while she was having sex and refusing to leave.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The author lives in a shared flat with five others, including a female flatmate who frequently has loud sex, which upsets everyone. They tried to address it by messaging her through the flat chat, but she didn't listen. Security didn't help either. The author had an early start and was frustrated. When she did it again, he went to her door, noticed it was unlocked, walked in, saw them having sex, and confronted them. The guy left when threatened with security and the other flatmates' support. The flatmate was upset, called him names, and he left.\n\nNow, the key points here are: entering someone's room without permission, witnessing them having sex, and confronting them. Legally, in many places, walking in on someone having sex in their private space could lead to charges like voyeurism or invasion of privacy. Even if the door was unlocked, entering without consent is problematic. The author's actions were out of frustration but still violated the flatmate's privacy. \n\nEthically, while the flatmate's behavior was disruptive, the author's response was extreme. Telling someone to leave the flat and threatening to involve others might be seen as overstepping. The flatmates thanked him, but that doesn't make it right. The author could have handled it differently, like finding another way to enforce quiet hours or maybe documenting the issue more formally.\n\nSo, considering both legal and ethical aspects, the author's actions were wrong. He entered a private space without consent, which is a breach of privacy, regardless of the reason. Therefore, the answer should be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
