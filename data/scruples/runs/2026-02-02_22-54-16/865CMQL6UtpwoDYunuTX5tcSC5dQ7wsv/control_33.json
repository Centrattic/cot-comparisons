There is one girl (20F), who's a bit of a...problem\n\nShe always brings guys back and has loud audible sex with them. Very loud. And it annoys all of us, we have early starts in the morning and well tell her to keep it down but she doesn't listen. We told security and they didn't do shit.\n\nSo we also all have exams soon and essay deadlines. And yesterday, she does it AGAIN, brings a guy back and starts having loud sex. We're all awake on this and post on the flat chat (but she wasn't going to see it anyway until after she was done having sex).\n\nI have an early start and had to be somewhere by 7am and it was 2am while this was happening.\n\nI had had enough. I banged on her door and she wouldn't open it. I bang again and she doesn't open. So I try to open it and...it's unlocked, they must have forgotten to lock it given that they came back drunk.\n\nSo I walk in and see them having sex. They both quickly see me and freak out. She says to me ''What the fuck?!!'' but I look over to the guy, the guy was a bit short and really skinny, there's no way in hell he would be a threat to me and he looked way more nervous than she does. \n\nShe keeps saying ''What the fuck?!! Get out!!'' and I say to her ''I've had enough of your fucking shit. We've all had enough of your fucking shit, you piece of shit. We're trying to sleep''. \n\nThe guy is standing there awkwardly so I tell him ''Get the fuck out'' and he doesn't do anything just stands there awkwardly, so I tell him ''I'll fucking call security, and I've got 4 other flatmates to back me up, our words against yours so get the fuck out!!'' and he gets his clothes on and runs out the flat. \n\nSo the ''problem'' girl starts crying and I tell her that she needs to sort her life out, I then to say to her ''Please leave this flat, move out. No one here fucking likes you, not even that guy you just fucked likes you enough to stay'' and she screams at me and calls me fucking cunt and asshole.\n\nI then leave and go to back to my room. I told the others what happened and they agreed with me, there's nothing I could have done. In fact they THANKED me, at least we could get to sleep and now we sent her a message, AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong for walking into his flatmate's room while she was having sex and refusing to leave.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the laws and social norms around entering someone's private space. In most places, even if you share a flat, each person has the right to privacy in their own room. The flatmate had invited someone over and was engaging in private activity, which is a personal matter. The author entering without permission, even if the door was unlocked, could be seen as violating her privacy. So there's a legal aspect here about consent and privacy rights.\n\nThen there's the situation's context. The flatmates had previously complained about the noise, but maybe the author didn't find a proper way to address it. Instead of confronting the situation directly by entering the room, perhaps there were other steps they could have taken, like following university protocols or using a doorbell camera to document the noise. However, the author mentions they already told security who didn't act, so maybe they felt they had no choice.\n\nBut physically entering someone's room without their permission and confronting them during an intimate moment is a big deal. Even if the door was unlocked, it's not a justification for walking in. The flatmate might feel that her privacy was invaded, which is a serious issue regardless of the noise problem.\n\nThe author's actions led to the guy leaving, which might have resolved the immediate noise issue, but the method was confrontational and potentially illegal. Depending on the jurisdiction, public indecency might be a concern, but since it was in a private residence, it's more about privacy. The author could face charges for invasion of privacy or disturbing the peace, depending on local laws.\n\nAlso, the flatmate's reaction\u2014crying and calling the author names\u2014suggests that she felt the intrusion was a significant violation. The other flatmates supporting the author might be more concerned about the noise issue than the method used, but that doesn't negate the author's breach of privacy.\n\nIn terms of social norms, even in a shared flat, respecting each other's privacy is important. The author's approach was confrontational and might have escalated the situation unnecessarily. There might be a better way to handle noise complaints without intruding on someone's privacy.\n\nSo, putting this all together, the author likely did something wrong by entering without permission and confronting the flatmate during an intimate moment. Even if the motive was to address noise complaints, the method used was inappropriate and violated privacy rights. Therefore, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong.\n"
