There is one girl (20F), who's a bit of a...problem\n\nShe always brings guys back and has loud audible sex with them. Very loud. And it annoys all of us, we have early starts in the morning and well tell her to keep it down but she doesn't listen. We told security and they didn't do shit.\n\nSo we also all have exams soon and essay deadlines. And yesterday, she does it AGAIN, brings a guy back and starts having loud sex. We're all awake on this and post on the flat chat (but she wasn't going to see it anyway until after she was done having sex).\n\nI have an early start and had to be somewhere by 7am and it was 2am while this was happening.\n\nI had had enough. I banged on her door and she wouldn't open it. I bang again and she doesn't open. So I try to open it and...it's unlocked, they must have forgotten to lock it given that they came back drunk.\n\nSo I walk in and see them having sex. They both quickly see me and freak out. She says to me ''What the fuck?!!'' but I look over to the guy, the guy was a bit short and really skinny, there's no way in hell he would be a threat to me and he looked way more nervous than she does. \n\nShe keeps saying ''What the fuck?!! Get out!!'' and I say to her ''I've had enough of your fucking shit. We've all had enough of your fucking shit, you piece of shit. We're trying to sleep''. \n\nThe guy is standing there awkwardly so I tell him ''Get the fuck out'' and he doesn't do anything just stands there awkwardly, so I tell him ''I'll fucking call security, and I've got 4 other flatmates to back me up, our words against yours so get the fuck out!!'' and he gets his clothes on and runs out the flat. \n\nSo the ''problem'' girl starts crying and I tell her that she needs to sort her life out, I then to say to her ''Please leave this flat, move out. No one here fucking likes you, not even that guy you just fucked likes you enough to stay'' and she screams at me and calls me fucking cunt and asshole.\n\nI then leave and go to back to my room. I told the others what happened and they agreed with me, there's nothing I could have done. In fact they THANKED me, at least we could get to sleep and now we sent her a message, AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who walked into their flatmate's room during sex is in the wrong (ITA). The situation involves a shared flat with multiple people, and the girl in question has a history of loud sex that's been a problem. The author, 20M, went into her room when she was having sex, told the guy to leave, and made some harsh comments to both the girl and the guy.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the basic rules of respecting privacy. Even if the person is annoyed, walking into someone's room without permission is a violation of their privacy. That's a big point against the author. Then, there's the issue of interrupting a private act, which can be seen as intrusive and disrespectful. The author did this despite the person being in the middle of a sexual act, which is a sensitive and private moment.\n\nThe fact that the author told the guy to leave and threatened to call security could be seen as overstepping. Even if the flatmates were annoyed, using threats and confronting someone in that situation might escalate things. The author's actions could be considered an invasion of privacy, harassment, or even a form of public humiliation. \n\nOn the other hand, the flatmates were upset about the noise and had tried other avenues like talking to security without success. The author might argue that they were acting in the interest of the flatmates' well-being, especially with exams and early mornings. However, the method they chose\u2014entering without consent and confronting them\u2014might not be the best approach. There are other ways to address the issue, like setting up a more formal complaint or using mediation.\n\nThe guy who was there might have been a victim too, especially since he left immediately. The author's aggressive response could have been intimidating. Also, the flatmates thanking the author doesn't necessarily mean the action was right; it could reflect frustration with the situation rather than approval of the method used.\n\nLegally, entering someone's room without their consent is a privacy violation. Ethically, it's about respecting boundaries. Even if the person is annoying, the way to address it isn't to intrude on their private moments. The author's actions could lead to legal consequences depending on local laws regarding privacy and harassment. \n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author likely did something wrong. Even though the intent was to stop the noise and help the flatmates, the method was inappropriate and violated the flatmate's privacy. Therefore, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
