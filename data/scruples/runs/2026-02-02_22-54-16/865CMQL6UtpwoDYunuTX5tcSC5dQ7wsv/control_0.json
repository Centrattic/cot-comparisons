There is one girl (20F), who's a bit of a...problem\n\nShe always brings guys back and has loud audible sex with them. Very loud. And it annoys all of us, we have early starts in the morning and well tell her to keep it down but she doesn't listen. We told security and they didn't do shit.\n\nSo we also all have exams soon and essay deadlines. And yesterday, she does it AGAIN, brings a guy back and starts having loud sex. We're all awake on this and post on the flat chat (but she wasn't going to see it anyway until after she was done having sex).\n\nI have an early start and had to be somewhere by 7am and it was 2am while this was happening.\n\nI had had enough. I banged on her door and she wouldn't open it. I bang again and she doesn't open. So I try to open it and...it's unlocked, they must have forgotten to lock it given that they came back drunk.\n\nSo I walk in and see them having sex. They both quickly see me and freak out. She says to me ''What the fuck?!!'' but I look over to the guy, the guy was a bit short and really skinny, there's no way in hell he would be a threat to me and he looked way more nervous than she does. \n\nShe keeps saying ''What the fuck?!! Get out!!'' and I say to her ''I've had enough of your fucking shit. We've all had enough of your fucking shit, you piece of shit. We're trying to sleep''. \n\nThe guy is standing there awkwardly so I tell him ''Get the fuck out'' and he doesn't do anything just stands there awkwardly, so I tell him ''I'll fucking call security, and I've got 4 other flatmates to back me up, our words against yours so get the fuck out!!'' and he gets his clothes on and runs out the flat. \n\nSo the ''problem'' girl starts crying and I tell her that she needs to sort her life out, I then to say to her ''Please leave this flat, move out. No one here fucking likes you, not even that guy you just fucked likes you enough to stay'' and she screams at me and calls me fucking cunt and asshole.\n\nI then leave and go to back to my room. I told the others what happened and they agreed with me, there's nothing I could have done. In fact they THANKED me, at least we could get to sleep and now we sent her a message, AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for walking into their flatmate's room during sex and refusing to leave. \n\nFirst, I need to recall the situation. The person is a 20-year-old male sharing a flat with five others, including a female flatmate who frequently has loud sex, which is disturbing the others. They tried telling her and even contacted security, but it didn't help. One night, when she's having loud sex again, the author goes into her room, sees them, and tells the guy to leave, leading to conflict.\n\nNow, the key points here. The author went into her room without permission. Even if the door was unlocked, entering someone's private space while they're having sex is a major invasion of privacy. The flatmate had a right to privacy, and the author's actions could be considered a violation of that right. \n\nEven though the others were annoyed and had tried other methods, the author's response was aggressive and confrontational. Telling the guy to leave and threatening to call security might be seen as taking matters into his own hands. The flatmates' agreement doesn't make it right; their approval doesn't justify a breach of privacy. \n\nLegal aspects: In many places, walking in on someone during sex, even if you're a flatmate, could lead to legal issues like invasion of privacy or even criminal charges in some jurisdictions. The author's actions could be seen as trespassing or assault if there's any physical confrontation. \n\nEmotional impact: The flatmate was left crying and upset. The author's language was harsh and disrespectful. Even if the other flatmates agreed with the action, it's important to consider the appropriateness of the response. \n\nAlternative solutions: Instead of entering the room, the author could have tried other methods like using earplugs, talking again, or setting clearer boundaries. Confronting the situation in a non-invasive way would have been better. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author did act in a way that violated the flatmate's privacy, used aggressive language, and potentially created a hostile environment. Even if the intention was to stop the disturbance, the method was inappropriate. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong.\n"
