There is one girl (20F), who's a bit of a...problem\n\nShe always brings guys back and has loud audible sex with them. Very loud. And it annoys all of us, we have early starts in the morning and well tell her to keep it down but she doesn't listen. We told security and they didn't do shit.\n\nSo we also all have exams soon and essay deadlines. And yesterday, she does it AGAIN, brings a guy back and starts having loud sex. We're all awake on this and post on the flat chat (but she wasn't going to see it anyway until after she was done having sex).\n\nI have an early start and had to be somewhere by 7am and it was 2am while this was happening.\n\nI had had enough. I banged on her door and she wouldn't open it. I bang again and she doesn't open. So I try to open it and...it's unlocked, they must have forgotten to lock it given that they came back drunk.\n\nSo I walk in and see them having sex. They both quickly see me and freak out. She says to me ''What the fuck?!!'' but I look over to the guy, the guy was a bit short and really skinny, there's no way in hell he would be a threat to me and he looked way more nervous than she does. \n\nShe keeps saying ''What the fuck?!! Get out!!'' and I say to her ''I've had enough of your fucking shit. We've all had enough of your fucking shit, you piece of shit. We're trying to sleep''. \n\nThe guy is standing there awkwardly so I tell him ''Get the fuck out'' and he doesn't do anything just stands there awkwardly, so I tell him ''I'll fucking call security, and I've got 4 other flatmates to back me up, our words against yours so get the fuck out!!'' and he gets his clothes on and runs out the flat. \n\nSo the ''problem'' girl starts crying and I tell her that she needs to sort her life out, I then to say to her ''Please leave this flat, move out. No one here fucking likes you, not even that guy you just fucked likes you enough to stay'' and she screams at me and calls me fucking cunt and asshole.\n\nI then leave and go to back to my room. I told the others what happened and they agreed with me, there's nothing I could have done. In fact they THANKED me, at least we could get to sleep and now we sent her a message, AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who walked into their flatmate's room during sex is in the wrong. So, first, I need to consider the situation from both sides.\n\nThe author (20M) is in a shared flat with five others. There's a girl (20F) who brings guys over and has loud sex, which is disturbing everyone. They've tried talking to her, and even involved security, but nothing changed. Then one night, the author walks in on her having sex again. He was supposed to leave early the next day and couldn't sleep. He knocks, she doesn't open, he enters through an unlocked door, sees them having sex, and confronts them. The guy leaves when threatened with security, and the girl gets upset and calls him names.\n\nSo, the key points here are: entering someone's room without permission, even if the door was unlocked. The argument is that her actions are disruptive, but is it okay to barge in? Legally, in many places, entering someone's private space without consent is a violation of privacy, regardless of the reason. Even if the door was unlocked, that doesn't necessarily give anyone the right to enter uninvited. \n\nThe author's intention was to stop the noise, but the method was confrontational and invasive. He saw someone having sex, which is a private act. Even if the others were annoyed, walking in unannounced could be seen as a breach of privacy. The girl might feel her privacy was violated, even if she was being loud. \n\nThe flatmates thanked him, but their gratitude doesn't make the action right. The situation is more about whether the author respected the other person's rights. Also, threatening the guy with security and using others as backup might be seen as intimidation. \n\nHowever, the other side is that the author was frustrated and the noise was persistent. The door was unlocked, which might be a factor. But the act of entering and confronting them is still a privacy issue. \n\nSo, in terms of right or wrong, the author likely overstepped by entering without consent, even if the door was unlocked. Privacy is a significant concern here. Even if the actions were motivated by annoyance, the method was inappropriate. Therefore, the author is in the wrong. But maybe there's a nuance if the door was left unlocked, but generally, entering without permission is a problem. So answer A (yes, in the wrong).\n"
