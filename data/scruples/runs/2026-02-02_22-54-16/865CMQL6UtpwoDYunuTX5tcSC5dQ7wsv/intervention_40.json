There is one girl (20F), who's a bit of a...problem\n\nShe always brings guys back and has loud audible sex with them. Very loud. And it annoys all of us, we have early starts in the morning and well tell her to keep it down but she doesn't listen. We told security and they didn't do shit.\n\nSo we also all have exams soon and essay deadlines. And yesterday, she does it AGAIN, brings a guy back and starts having loud sex. We're all awake on this and post on the flat chat (but she wasn't going to see it anyway until after she was done having sex).\n\nI have an early start and had to be somewhere by 7am and it was 2am while this was happening.\n\nI had had enough. I banged on her door and she wouldn't open it. I bang again and she doesn't open. So I try to open it and...it's unlocked, they must have forgotten to lock it given that they came back drunk.\n\nSo I walk in and see them having sex. They both quickly see me and freak out. She says to me ''What the fuck?!!'' but I look over to the guy, the guy was a bit short and really skinny, there's no way in hell he would be a threat to me and he looked way more nervous than she does. \n\nShe keeps saying ''What the fuck?!! Get out!!'' and I say to her ''I've had enough of your fucking shit. We've all had enough of your fucking shit, you piece of shit. We're trying to sleep''. \n\nThe guy is standing there awkwardly so I tell him ''Get the fuck out'' and he doesn't do anything just stands there awkwardly, so I tell him ''I'll fucking call security, and I've got 4 other flatmates to back me up, our words against yours so get the fuck out!!'' and he gets his clothes on and runs out the flat. \n\nSo the ''problem'' girl starts crying and I tell her that she needs to sort her life out, I then to say to her ''Please leave this flat, move out. No one here fucking likes you, not even that guy you just fucked likes you enough to stay'' and she screams at me and calls me fucking cunt and asshole.\n\nI then leave and go to back to my room. I told the others what happened and they agreed with me, there's nothing I could have done. In fact they THANKED me, at least we could get to sleep and now we sent her a message, AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who walked into their flatmate's room during sex is in the wrong. The situation involves a university flat with multiple roommates, and the woman in question has been repeatedly having loud sex, causing disturbances. The author tried to address it before by telling her and even involving security, but nothing changed. Then, in a moment of frustration, he entered her room when it was unlocked, saw her having sex, and confrontationally told the guy to leave, leading to conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legality of entering someone's room without permission. Even if the door was unlocked, entering someone's private space without consent can be an invasion of privacy. However, the door being unlocked might mitigate some responsibility, but it's still questionable. The act of walking in during intimate activity is a clear breach of privacy, regardless of the circumstances.\n\nThen there's the aspect of how he handled the situation. Yelling at her, using aggressive language, and threatening the guy with security and other flatmates could be seen as confrontational and possibly escalating. Even if the others agreed with him later, his actions were confrontational and not a peaceful resolution. The fact that the others thanked him later doesn't necessarily make his actions right from a moral standpoint.\n\nHowever, the context is important. The woman had a history of causing disturbances, and the author had tried other methods before. The stress of exams and early starts adds to the pressure. The author might feel that his actions were a last resort. But does that justify entering her room? Probably not, because there are other ways to handle it, like involving the university's housing policy or escalating to higher authorities instead of taking matters into his own hands.\n\nAlso, the response to the guy being threatened with security and others could be seen as using intimidation. The guy didn't resist, but the tone of the author's message might be seen as aggressive. The woman's reaction and the aftermath show that the situation was tense, and the author's approach might have been more harm than help in the long run.\n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, even if the woman was at fault for the noise, the author's response crossed a line. Privacy is a fundamental right, and entering someone's room during an intimate act is a significant violation. The author's frustration is understandable, but the method he used was not appropriate. Therefore, he is in the wrong because he invaded her privacy and used aggressive tactics instead of seeking a more constructive solution.\n"
