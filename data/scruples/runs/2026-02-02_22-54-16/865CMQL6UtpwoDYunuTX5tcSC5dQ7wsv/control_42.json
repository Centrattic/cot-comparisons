There is one girl (20F), who's a bit of a...problem\n\nShe always brings guys back and has loud audible sex with them. Very loud. And it annoys all of us, we have early starts in the morning and well tell her to keep it down but she doesn't listen. We told security and they didn't do shit.\n\nSo we also all have exams soon and essay deadlines. And yesterday, she does it AGAIN, brings a guy back and starts having loud sex. We're all awake on this and post on the flat chat (but she wasn't going to see it anyway until after she was done having sex).\n\nI have an early start and had to be somewhere by 7am and it was 2am while this was happening.\n\nI had had enough. I banged on her door and she wouldn't open it. I bang again and she doesn't open. So I try to open it and...it's unlocked, they must have forgotten to lock it given that they came back drunk.\n\nSo I walk in and see them having sex. They both quickly see me and freak out. She says to me ''What the fuck?!!'' but I look over to the guy, the guy was a bit short and really skinny, there's no way in hell he would be a threat to me and he looked way more nervous than she does. \n\nShe keeps saying ''What the fuck?!! Get out!!'' and I say to her ''I've had enough of your fucking shit. We've all had enough of your fucking shit, you piece of shit. We're trying to sleep''. \n\nThe guy is standing there awkwardly so I tell him ''Get the fuck out'' and he doesn't do anything just stands there awkwardly, so I tell him ''I'll fucking call security, and I've got 4 other flatmates to back me up, our words against yours so get the fuck out!!'' and he gets his clothes on and runs out the flat. \n\nSo the ''problem'' girl starts crying and I tell her that she needs to sort her life out, I then to say to her ''Please leave this flat, move out. No one here fucking likes you, not even that guy you just fucked likes you enough to stay'' and she screams at me and calls me fucking cunt and asshole.\n\nI then leave and go to back to my room. I told the others what happened and they agreed with me, there's nothing I could have done. In fact they THANKED me, at least we could get to sleep and now we sent her a message, AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that he walked into his flatmate's room while she was having sex and refused to leave. He's in a university flat with five others. The flatmate in question has a habit of bringing guys over and having loud sex, which is disturbing everyone because they have early classes and exams. They've tried talking to her, even contacting security, but nothing changed.\n\nSo, the key points here: he went into her room without permission, saw her in the middle of a private act, and then confronts both her and the guy. He even told the guy to leave, and the guy did. The flatmate was upset, called him names, and now he's asking if he's at fault.\n\nFirst, let's consider the legal aspects. In many places, entering someone's room without permission, especially when they're having sex, could be considered a violation of privacy. Even if the door was unlocked, that doesn't necessarily mean it's okay to barge in, especially when they're engaged in a private act. The act of intrusion itself is problematic regardless of the reason. So legally, he might be at fault here.\n\nThen there's the ethical side. While the flatmate's behavior is noisy and disruptive, it's still her room and her right to privacy. The others had tried to address the noise issue through proper channels (talking to her, contacting security) but didn't get results. However, storming into her room and confronting them directly is a drastic step. Even if the others supported him, that doesn't make it right. The method he used was invasive and could be seen as an overreaction. \n\nHe mentions that the guy was scared and left after being threatened with calling security. Threatening someone with confrontation from a group (our words against yours) might be seen as intimidation. The flatmate was crying and upset, which suggests that his actions were traumatic for her.\n\nOn the other hand, the author was motivated by the need to rest, especially with exams coming up. The noise was a legitimate concern, but there are appropriate ways to address that, like using earplugs, talking to the landlord, or perhaps even legal action if noise violations are a thing. His approach was confrontational and violated her privacy, which is a serious issue.\n\nSo considering both legal and ethical angles, the author likely overstepped by entering her room without consent. Even if the situation was frustrating, the method used was not appropriate. Therefore, he's probably in the wrong.\n"
