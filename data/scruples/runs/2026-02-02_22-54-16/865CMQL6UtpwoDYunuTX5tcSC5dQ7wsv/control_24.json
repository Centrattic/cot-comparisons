There is one girl (20F), who's a bit of a...problem\n\nShe always brings guys back and has loud audible sex with them. Very loud. And it annoys all of us, we have early starts in the morning and well tell her to keep it down but she doesn't listen. We told security and they didn't do shit.\n\nSo we also all have exams soon and essay deadlines. And yesterday, she does it AGAIN, brings a guy back and starts having loud sex. We're all awake on this and post on the flat chat (but she wasn't going to see it anyway until after she was done having sex).\n\nI have an early start and had to be somewhere by 7am and it was 2am while this was happening.\n\nI had had enough. I banged on her door and she wouldn't open it. I bang again and she doesn't open. So I try to open it and...it's unlocked, they must have forgotten to lock it given that they came back drunk.\n\nSo I walk in and see them having sex. They both quickly see me and freak out. She says to me ''What the fuck?!!'' but I look over to the guy, the guy was a bit short and really skinny, there's no way in hell he would be a threat to me and he looked way more nervous than she does. \n\nShe keeps saying ''What the fuck?!! Get out!!'' and I say to her ''I've had enough of your fucking shit. We've all had enough of your fucking shit, you piece of shit. We're trying to sleep''. \n\nThe guy is standing there awkwardly so I tell him ''Get the fuck out'' and he doesn't do anything just stands there awkwardly, so I tell him ''I'll fucking call security, and I've got 4 other flatmates to back me up, our words against yours so get the fuck out!!'' and he gets his clothes on and runs out the flat. \n\nSo the ''problem'' girl starts crying and I tell her that she needs to sort her life out, I then to say to her ''Please leave this flat, move out. No one here fucking likes you, not even that guy you just fucked likes you enough to stay'' and she screams at me and calls me fucking cunt and asshole.\n\nI then leave and go to back to my room. I told the others what happened and they agreed with me, there's nothing I could have done. In fact they THANKED me, at least we could get to sleep and now we sent her a message, AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who walked into their flatmate's room during sex and refused to leave is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no).\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The question is about a shared flat with five others. The girl in question has a history of bringing guys over and having loud sex, which has been a recurring issue. The author tried to address it by talking to her and others, even involving security, but it didn't help. Now, the author decided to take matters into their own hands.\n\nThe key points here are: entering someone's room without permission, interrupting a private act, and confronting them physically. Even though the author had valid reasons\u2014like disturbing sleep, exams, and deadlines\u2014the method they used is questionable. \n\nLegally, entering someone's room without permission is a privacy violation. Even if the door was unlocked, walking in without asking is trespassing. The act of interrupting someone during private activity could be considered invasion of privacy. Additionally, demanding that the guy leave by threatening to call security might be seen as harassment or intimidation. \n\nHowever, the context is important. The roommates were disturbed multiple times, and the flatmates supported the action. The author's intention was to stop the noise and get some rest. But regardless of intent, the action itself is legally and socially problematic. \n\nIn terms of ethics, while the author's frustration is understandable, using force or intrusion isn't the right way to handle it. They should have tried other methods first, like talking directly to the flatmate, setting clear boundaries, or perhaps seeking mediation. \n\nThe consequences are also a factor. The girl was upset, and the situation escalated. The author's actions could be seen as aggressive and disrespectful, even if others agreed with the outcome. \n\nSo, considering all these factors, even though the author's motives were to address a legitimate problem, their actions violated privacy and were confrontational. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
