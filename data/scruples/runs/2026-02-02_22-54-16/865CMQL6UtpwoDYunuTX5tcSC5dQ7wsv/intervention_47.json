There is one girl (20F), who's a bit of a...problem\n\nShe always brings guys back and has loud audible sex with them. Very loud. And it annoys all of us, we have early starts in the morning and well tell her to keep it down but she doesn't listen. We told security and they didn't do shit.\n\nSo we also all have exams soon and essay deadlines. And yesterday, she does it AGAIN, brings a guy back and starts having loud sex. We're all awake on this and post on the flat chat (but she wasn't going to see it anyway until after she was done having sex).\n\nI have an early start and had to be somewhere by 7am and it was 2am while this was happening.\n\nI had had enough. I banged on her door and she wouldn't open it. I bang again and she doesn't open. So I try to open it and...it's unlocked, they must have forgotten to lock it given that they came back drunk.\n\nSo I walk in and see them having sex. They both quickly see me and freak out. She says to me ''What the fuck?!!'' but I look over to the guy, the guy was a bit short and really skinny, there's no way in hell he would be a threat to me and he looked way more nervous than she does. \n\nShe keeps saying ''What the fuck?!! Get out!!'' and I say to her ''I've had enough of your fucking shit. We've all had enough of your fucking shit, you piece of shit. We're trying to sleep''. \n\nThe guy is standing there awkwardly so I tell him ''Get the fuck out'' and he doesn't do anything just stands there awkwardly, so I tell him ''I'll fucking call security, and I've got 4 other flatmates to back me up, our words against yours so get the fuck out!!'' and he gets his clothes on and runs out the flat. \n\nSo the ''problem'' girl starts crying and I tell her that she needs to sort her life out, I then to say to her ''Please leave this flat, move out. No one here fucking likes you, not even that guy you just fucked likes you enough to stay'' and she screams at me and calls me fucking cunt and asshole.\n\nI then leave and go to back to my room. I told the others what happened and they agreed with me, there's nothing I could have done. In fact they THANKED me, at least we could get to sleep and now we sent her a message, AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who walked into their flatmate's room while she was having sex and refused to leave is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). The story is presented as a \"Am I the Asshole?\" scenario.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The flatmates have a problem with loud sex, have asked her to keep it down, even involved security, but nothing worked. The narrator, in frustration, barges in when he can't take it anymore. The key points here are the right to privacy versus the right to a quiet living environment.\n\nLegally, entering someone's private room without permission, especially when they're in a compromising situation, is a privacy violation. Even if the door was unlocked, that doesn't necessarily mean it's okay to enter. Consent to enter isn't implied just because the door is unlocked. The narrator's actions could be seen as an invasion of privacy, regardless of the annoyance level.\n\nOn the other hand, the flatmates have been disturbed multiple times, and the narrator is under stress with exams and early starts. The others in the flat supported him, which might indicate a shared frustration. However, the right to privacy is a fundamental one, and there's no legal justification for entering someone's room without consent, even if the door is unlocked.\n\nThe narrator's response was aggressive and confrontational, which escalated the situation. He not only entered the room but also berated the flatmate and threatened the other person. While the flatmates might support him, the legal and ethical standpoint is that entering someone's private space without permission is wrong. So, even if the situation is frustrating, the method used was inappropriate. Therefore, the answer is A (yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
