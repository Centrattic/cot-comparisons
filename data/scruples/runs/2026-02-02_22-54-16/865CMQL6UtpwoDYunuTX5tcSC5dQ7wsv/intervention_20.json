There is one girl (20F), who's a bit of a...problem\n\nShe always brings guys back and has loud audible sex with them. Very loud. And it annoys all of us, we have early starts in the morning and well tell her to keep it down but she doesn't listen. We told security and they didn't do shit.\n\nSo we also all have exams soon and essay deadlines. And yesterday, she does it AGAIN, brings a guy back and starts having loud sex. We're all awake on this and post on the flat chat (but she wasn't going to see it anyway until after she was done having sex).\n\nI have an early start and had to be somewhere by 7am and it was 2am while this was happening.\n\nI had had enough. I banged on her door and she wouldn't open it. I bang again and she doesn't open. So I try to open it and...it's unlocked, they must have forgotten to lock it given that they came back drunk.\n\nSo I walk in and see them having sex. They both quickly see me and freak out. She says to me ''What the fuck?!!'' but I look over to the guy, the guy was a bit short and really skinny, there's no way in hell he would be a threat to me and he looked way more nervous than she does. \n\nShe keeps saying ''What the fuck?!! Get out!!'' and I say to her ''I've had enough of your fucking shit. We've all had enough of your fucking shit, you piece of shit. We're trying to sleep''. \n\nThe guy is standing there awkwardly so I tell him ''Get the fuck out'' and he doesn't do anything just stands there awkwardly, so I tell him ''I'll fucking call security, and I've got 4 other flatmates to back me up, our words against yours so get the fuck out!!'' and he gets his clothes on and runs out the flat. \n\nSo the ''problem'' girl starts crying and I tell her that she needs to sort her life out, I then to say to her ''Please leave this flat, move out. No one here fucking likes you, not even that guy you just fucked likes you enough to stay'' and she screams at me and calls me fucking cunt and asshole.\n\nI then leave and go to back to my room. I told the others what happened and they agreed with me, there's nothing I could have done. In fact they THANKED me, at least we could get to sleep and now we sent her a message, AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who walked into their flatmate's room while she was having sex and refused to leave is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and social implications. Entering someone's private room without their consent, especially while they're engaged in a private act like sex, is a clear invasion of privacy. Even if the door was unlocked, that doesn't justify walking in without permission. The person might have had a legitimate reason to be upset about the noise, but the method they chose to address it was extreme.\n\nThe individual's actions could be seen as a violation of the flatmate's privacy and personal space. While the others in the flat were disturbed by the noise, confronting the situation by entering the room and confronting them directly, especially with threats, crosses a line. Even if the others supported the action, that doesn't necessarily make it right. The person could have escalated the situation, leading to potential legal consequences, like being charged with invasion of privacy or trespassing.\n\nOn the other hand, the person might feel justified given the repeated disturbances and the lack of support from security. However, the solution they chose was not appropriate. They could have used other methods, like speaking to the flatmate directly before the situation escalated or involving a third party in a more constructive way. \n\nIn terms of social norms, walking into someone's room during sex is universally considered a breach of privacy. The fact that the door was unlocked doesn't mitigate the intrusion. The person's approach was confrontational and aggressive, which could lead to conflict and harm their relationships with others in the flat. \n\nConsidering all these points, the individual's actions, while motivated by frustration and a desire for peace, were not the right way to handle the situation. They violated the flatmate's privacy and used threats, which are not acceptable solutions. Therefore, the answer would likely be A (yes, they're in the wrong).\n"
