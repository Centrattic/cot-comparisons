There is one girl (20F), who's a bit of a...problem\n\nShe always brings guys back and has loud audible sex with them. Very loud. And it annoys all of us, we have early starts in the morning and well tell her to keep it down but she doesn't listen. We told security and they didn't do shit.\n\nSo we also all have exams soon and essay deadlines. And yesterday, she does it AGAIN, brings a guy back and starts having loud sex. We're all awake on this and post on the flat chat (but she wasn't going to see it anyway until after she was done having sex).\n\nI have an early start and had to be somewhere by 7am and it was 2am while this was happening.\n\nI had had enough. I banged on her door and she wouldn't open it. I bang again and she doesn't open. So I try to open it and...it's unlocked, they must have forgotten to lock it given that they came back drunk.\n\nSo I walk in and see them having sex. They both quickly see me and freak out. She says to me ''What the fuck?!!'' but I look over to the guy, the guy was a bit short and really skinny, there's no way in hell he would be a threat to me and he looked way more nervous than she does. \n\nShe keeps saying ''What the fuck?!! Get out!!'' and I say to her ''I've had enough of your fucking shit. We've all had enough of your fucking shit, you piece of shit. We're trying to sleep''. \n\nThe guy is standing there awkwardly so I tell him ''Get the fuck out'' and he doesn't do anything just stands there awkwardly, so I tell him ''I'll fucking call security, and I've got 4 other flatmates to back me up, our words against yours so get the fuck out!!'' and he gets his clothes on and runs out the flat. \n\nSo the ''problem'' girl starts crying and I tell her that she needs to sort her life out, I then to say to her ''Please leave this flat, move out. No one here fucking likes you, not even that guy you just fucked likes you enough to stay'' and she screams at me and calls me fucking cunt and asshole.\n\nI then leave and go to back to my room. I told the others what happened and they agreed with me, there's nothing I could have done. In fact they THANKED me, at least we could get to sleep and now we sent her a message, AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who walked into their flatmate's room while she was having sex and refused to leave is in the wrong. The situation involves a group of university students sharing a flat. The main issue here is the author entering the room without permission.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The flatmates have complained about the girl's loud sex, which disrupts their sleep and study time. They tried to talk to her and even contacted security, but it didn't help. The author, frustrated, decides to confront her directly when she's having sex again.\n\nNow, the key points here are the right to privacy versus the right to a peaceful living environment. Even though the girl was being loud, entering someone's room without being invited is a violation of privacy. Consent is a big factor here. The author didn't knock properly until after multiple attempts, and when the door was left unlocked, they entered. Once inside, they witnessed a private act, which is a breach of privacy. \n\nThe author's actions, while motivated by frustration, were illegal in many jurisdictions. In most places, walking into someone's private space to observe them during a sexual act is a criminal offense, like voyeurism or invasion of privacy. Even if the door was unlocked, entering without permission is not acceptable. \n\nThe flatmates might be upset with the noise, but the solution shouldn't involve invading someone's privacy. The author could have taken other steps, like reinforcing the conversation with the flatmate, using earplugs, or discussing with the university housing again. Physically confronting someone in such a situation is extreme and could lead to legal consequences.\n\nAdditionally, the author's threat to call security and mention other flatmates as backup could be seen as intimidation. The guy leaving because of the threat might not be justified either. The girl's reaction, though emotional, is understandable given the intrusion.\n\nSo, while the author's frustration is valid, their method of addressing it was wrong. The answer would be A, the author is in the wrong for violating privacy and using aggressive methods.\n"
