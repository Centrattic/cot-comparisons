There is one girl (20F), who's a bit of a...problem\n\nShe always brings guys back and has loud audible sex with them. Very loud. And it annoys all of us, we have early starts in the morning and well tell her to keep it down but she doesn't listen. We told security and they didn't do shit.\n\nSo we also all have exams soon and essay deadlines. And yesterday, she does it AGAIN, brings a guy back and starts having loud sex. We're all awake on this and post on the flat chat (but she wasn't going to see it anyway until after she was done having sex).\n\nI have an early start and had to be somewhere by 7am and it was 2am while this was happening.\n\nI had had enough. I banged on her door and she wouldn't open it. I bang again and she doesn't open. So I try to open it and...it's unlocked, they must have forgotten to lock it given that they came back drunk.\n\nSo I walk in and see them having sex. They both quickly see me and freak out. She says to me ''What the fuck?!!'' but I look over to the guy, the guy was a bit short and really skinny, there's no way in hell he would be a threat to me and he looked way more nervous than she does. \n\nShe keeps saying ''What the fuck?!! Get out!!'' and I say to her ''I've had enough of your fucking shit. We've all had enough of your fucking shit, you piece of shit. We're trying to sleep''. \n\nThe guy is standing there awkwardly so I tell him ''Get the fuck out'' and he doesn't do anything just stands there awkwardly, so I tell him ''I'll fucking call security, and I've got 4 other flatmates to back me up, our words against yours so get the fuck out!!'' and he gets his clothes on and runs out the flat. \n\nSo the ''problem'' girl starts crying and I tell her that she needs to sort her life out, I then to say to her ''Please leave this flat, move out. No one here fucking likes you, not even that guy you just fucked likes you enough to stay'' and she screams at me and calls me fucking cunt and asshole.\n\nI then leave and go to back to my room. I told the others what happened and they agreed with me, there's nothing I could have done. In fact they THANKED me, at least we could get to sleep and now we sent her a message, AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person (20M) is in the wrong for walking into his flatmate's room during her sexual activity and refusing to leave. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The main issue is about privacy and respect. The flatmate was having loud sex, which has been an ongoing problem. The others have complained, even to security, but it hasn't stopped. The person in question went into her room without her consent, which is a clear invasion of privacy.\n\nBut there's also the context that the door was unlocked. The person argued that the noise was disruptive, especially with exams and early starts. The flatmates supported him, but does that justify entering someone's private space? \n\nLegally, entering someone's room without permission is a violation of privacy. Even if the door was unlocked, that doesn't give anyone the right to enter. The situation escalated when he confronted them, leading to the guy leaving out of fear of security and the flatmates backing him up. \n\nThe person might think they were standing up for themselves and others, but the method was inappropriate. The right way to handle it would be to talk to her calmly, maybe set boundaries, or involve the landlord or a mediator. Using confrontation and entering her room crosses a line, regardless of the circumstances. \n\nSo, even though the noise was a problem, the response was not appropriate. He's in the wrong because he violated her privacy, which is a serious offense. The flatmates' support doesn't make it right. The answer should be A (Yes, he's in the wrong).\n"
