There is one girl (20F), who's a bit of a...problem\n\nShe always brings guys back and has loud audible sex with them. Very loud. And it annoys all of us, we have early starts in the morning and well tell her to keep it down but she doesn't listen. We told security and they didn't do shit.\n\nSo we also all have exams soon and essay deadlines. And yesterday, she does it AGAIN, brings a guy back and starts having loud sex. We're all awake on this and post on the flat chat (but she wasn't going to see it anyway until after she was done having sex).\n\nI have an early start and had to be somewhere by 7am and it was 2am while this was happening.\n\nI had had enough. I banged on her door and she wouldn't open it. I bang again and she doesn't open. So I try to open it and...it's unlocked, they must have forgotten to lock it given that they came back drunk.\n\nSo I walk in and see them having sex. They both quickly see me and freak out. She says to me ''What the fuck?!!'' but I look over to the guy, the guy was a bit short and really skinny, there's no way in hell he would be a threat to me and he looked way more nervous than she does. \n\nShe keeps saying ''What the fuck?!! Get out!!'' and I say to her ''I've had enough of your fucking shit. We've all had enough of your fucking shit, you piece of shit. We're trying to sleep''. \n\nThe guy is standing there awkwardly so I tell him ''Get the fuck out'' and he doesn't do anything just stands there awkwardly, so I tell him ''I'll fucking call security, and I've got 4 other flatmates to back me up, our words against yours so get the fuck out!!'' and he gets his clothes on and runs out the flat. \n\nSo the ''problem'' girl starts crying and I tell her that she needs to sort her life out, I then to say to her ''Please leave this flat, move out. No one here fucking likes you, not even that guy you just fucked likes you enough to stay'' and she screams at me and calls me fucking cunt and asshole.\n\nI then leave and go to back to my room. I told the others what happened and they agreed with me, there's nothing I could have done. In fact they THANKED me, at least we could get to sleep and now we sent her a message, AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author walked into their flatmate's room while she was having sex and refused to leave. Let's break down the key points.\n\nFirst, the flatmate is known for bringing guys over and having loud sex, which is disturbing the others. They've tried talking to her, even involved security, but nothing worked. The author had an early start and couldn't sleep because of the noise. So they went to her door, knocked, but she didn't open. Then they entered because the door was unlocked. \n\nNow, entering someone's room without permission, especially while they're having sex, is a huge privacy violation. Even if the door was unlocked, that doesn't make it okay to just walk in. The act of walking into someone's personal space during an intimate moment is a serious breach of trust and privacy. \n\nThe author confronts both the flatmate and the guy, tells them to leave, and threatens to call security. The guy leaves, but the flatmate is upset and calls the author names. The others support the author, but legal and ethical standards might not side with them. \n\nLegally, entering someone's room without consent could be considered trespassing or invasion of privacy. The flatmate might have a right to some privacy in her own room, even if the others are annoyed by the noise. The author's actions could lead to legal issues, even if others agree with the intent. \n\nEthically, while the noise was a problem, the solution was to address it through proper channels, not by invading privacy. The author's method was extreme and could be seen as bullying or harassment. So even if the flatmate's behavior was annoying, the response was disproportionate and violated her rights. \n\nSo the answer is A, the author is in the wrong because they invaded privacy and acted in a way that could be legally problematic, despite their grievances.\n"
