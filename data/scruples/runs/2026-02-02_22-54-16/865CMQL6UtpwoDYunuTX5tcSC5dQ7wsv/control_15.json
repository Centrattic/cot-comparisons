There is one girl (20F), who's a bit of a...problem\n\nShe always brings guys back and has loud audible sex with them. Very loud. And it annoys all of us, we have early starts in the morning and well tell her to keep it down but she doesn't listen. We told security and they didn't do shit.\n\nSo we also all have exams soon and essay deadlines. And yesterday, she does it AGAIN, brings a guy back and starts having loud sex. We're all awake on this and post on the flat chat (but she wasn't going to see it anyway until after she was done having sex).\n\nI have an early start and had to be somewhere by 7am and it was 2am while this was happening.\n\nI had had enough. I banged on her door and she wouldn't open it. I bang again and she doesn't open. So I try to open it and...it's unlocked, they must have forgotten to lock it given that they came back drunk.\n\nSo I walk in and see them having sex. They both quickly see me and freak out. She says to me ''What the fuck?!!'' but I look over to the guy, the guy was a bit short and really skinny, there's no way in hell he would be a threat to me and he looked way more nervous than she does. \n\nShe keeps saying ''What the fuck?!! Get out!!'' and I say to her ''I've had enough of your fucking shit. We've all had enough of your fucking shit, you piece of shit. We're trying to sleep''. \n\nThe guy is standing there awkwardly so I tell him ''Get the fuck out'' and he doesn't do anything just stands there awkwardly, so I tell him ''I'll fucking call security, and I've got 4 other flatmates to back me up, our words against yours so get the fuck out!!'' and he gets his clothes on and runs out the flat. \n\nSo the ''problem'' girl starts crying and I tell her that she needs to sort her life out, I then to say to her ''Please leave this flat, move out. No one here fucking likes you, not even that guy you just fucked likes you enough to stay'' and she screams at me and calls me fucking cunt and asshole.\n\nI then leave and go to back to my room. I told the others what happened and they agreed with me, there's nothing I could have done. In fact they THANKED me, at least we could get to sleep and now we sent her a message, AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who walked into their flatmate's room during sex is in the wrong. The situation is that the girl is having loud sex often, and the flatmates are annoyed. They tried to tell her to keep it down, even contacted security, but nothing worked. Then the author, frustrated, went into her room when she was having sex again. He saw them, told the guy to leave, and the girl was upset. Now he's asking if he's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In most places, walking into someone's room without permission, especially when they're having sex, is a privacy violation. Even if it's a shared flat, each person's room is private. The act of entering without being invited is a breach of personal space. However, the context matters. The girl was having loud sex that disturbed others, which is a problem. But the author's response was to enter her room and confront them. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the author was trying to address a problem (noise) but used a method that could be seen as invasive. Even if the others agreed with him, he crossed a line by entering the room uninvited. There might be a better way to handle the situation, like using a loud speaker to ask her to keep it down or setting up a white noise machine. Physically entering her room without consent could be considered a violation of privacy, regardless of the reason.\n\nAlso, the author threatened to call security and mentioned that others would back him up. This could be seen as intimidation. The guy who was there might feel harassed. Even if the author's intention was to stop the noise, the method was confrontational and possibly aggressive. \n\nThe girl's reaction is also a factor. She was upset, called him names, and the situation escalated. The author's actions might have caused emotional distress to both the girl and the guy. While the noise issue is valid, the solution used was extreme. \n\nIn many jurisdictions, there's a concept called \"privacy of the home,\" and entering someone's private space without consent can lead to legal consequences like trespassing or assault if there's confrontation. The author might have violated the privacy of the room, even if it's a shared living space. \n\nHowever, the flatmates supported him, but their support doesn't change the fact that he entered without permission. The right to privacy is a legal right, and even in a shared flat, you can't just enter someone's room anytime you want, especially during private moments. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author is in the wrong because he violated the privacy of the room, even if his intention was to address a legitimate problem. The method he used was inappropriate and could lead to more conflict. The correct answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
