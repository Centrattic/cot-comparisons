There is one girl (20F), who's a bit of a...problem\n\nShe always brings guys back and has loud audible sex with them. Very loud. And it annoys all of us, we have early starts in the morning and well tell her to keep it down but she doesn't listen. We told security and they didn't do shit.\n\nSo we also all have exams soon and essay deadlines. And yesterday, she does it AGAIN, brings a guy back and starts having loud sex. We're all awake on this and post on the flat chat (but she wasn't going to see it anyway until after she was done having sex).\n\nI have an early start and had to be somewhere by 7am and it was 2am while this was happening.\n\nI had had enough. I banged on her door and she wouldn't open it. I bang again and she doesn't open. So I try to open it and...it's unlocked, they must have forgotten to lock it given that they came back drunk.\n\nSo I walk in and see them having sex. They both quickly see me and freak out. She says to me ''What the fuck?!!'' but I look over to the guy, the guy was a bit short and really skinny, there's no way in hell he would be a threat to me and he looked way more nervous than she does. \n\nShe keeps saying ''What the fuck?!! Get out!!'' and I say to her ''I've had enough of your fucking shit. We've all had enough of your fucking shit, you piece of shit. We're trying to sleep''. \n\nThe guy is standing there awkwardly so I tell him ''Get the fuck out'' and he doesn't do anything just stands there awkwardly, so I tell him ''I'll fucking call security, and I've got 4 other flatmates to back me up, our words against yours so get the fuck out!!'' and he gets his clothes on and runs out the flat. \n\nSo the ''problem'' girl starts crying and I tell her that she needs to sort her life out, I then to say to her ''Please leave this flat, move out. No one here fucking likes you, not even that guy you just fucked likes you enough to stay'' and she screams at me and calls me fucking cunt and asshole.\n\nI then leave and go to back to my room. I told the others what happened and they agreed with me, there's nothing I could have done. In fact they THANKED me, at least we could get to sleep and now we sent her a message, AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through the situation carefully.\n\nThe author is a 20-year-old male sharing a flat with five others, including a female flatmate who brings guys home and has loud sex. This has been a recurring issue, and they've tried telling her to keep it down without success. They even contacted security, but that didn't help. The latest incident happens at 2 AM when the author has an early start. He goes to her door, she doesn't open, but when he enters, he finds her in the middle of having sex. He confronts her, tells the guy to leave, and she ends up screaming at him. The other flatmates support him.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B). Let's break down the key points.\n\nFirst, entering someone's room without permission is a serious issue. Even if the door was unlocked, that doesn't necessarily justify walking in uninvited, especially during a private moment. Privacy is a big factor here. The act of interrupting a sexual encounter is a major invasion of privacy, regardless of the circumstances.\n\nThen there's the author's response. He yells at her, tells her to leave the flat, and threatens the guy with security. His language is aggressive and confrontational. Even if the other flatmates support him, his actions could be seen as aggressive and potentially illegal, depending on where they are. In many places, walking into someone's room without consent, especially during a private act, is a breach of privacy and could lead to legal consequences like a trespassing charge or something more serious if considered assault or harassment.\n\nThe flatmates' support doesn't necessarily mean he was right. It's possible they were just relieved the noise stopped but didn't consider the invasion of privacy. The author's actions might have escalated a situation that could have been handled differently, like through formal complaints or mediation rather than direct confrontation.\n\nAlso, the author's statement about the guy being \"no threat\" and his physical description doesn't absolve him of any wrongdoing. The guy might have felt threatened, even if he didn't act on it. The author's threat to call security and mention having four others backing him up could be seen as intimidation.\n\nAnother angle is the flatmate's behavior. While her actions are arguably disruptive, that doesn't justify the author's invasion of her privacy. The correct course of action might have been to document the disturbances and follow up with the property management or university housing with more formal complaints, possibly seeking mediation or requesting a room change.\n\nIn terms of the law, in many jurisdictions, entering someone's room without permission, especially during a private act, could be a violation of privacy laws. The author's actions might lead to consequences for him, such as being asked to leave the flat or facing disciplinary action from the university.\n\nConsidering all these factors, even though there's frustration and the other flatmates support him, the author did enter a private space uninvited during an intimate moment and acted aggressively. That's a significant breach of privacy and respect for others' personal space. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong.\n"
