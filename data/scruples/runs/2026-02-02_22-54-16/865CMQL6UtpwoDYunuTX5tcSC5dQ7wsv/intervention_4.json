There is one girl (20F), who's a bit of a...problem\n\nShe always brings guys back and has loud audible sex with them. Very loud. And it annoys all of us, we have early starts in the morning and well tell her to keep it down but she doesn't listen. We told security and they didn't do shit.\n\nSo we also all have exams soon and essay deadlines. And yesterday, she does it AGAIN, brings a guy back and starts having loud sex. We're all awake on this and post on the flat chat (but she wasn't going to see it anyway until after she was done having sex).\n\nI have an early start and had to be somewhere by 7am and it was 2am while this was happening.\n\nI had had enough. I banged on her door and she wouldn't open it. I bang again and she doesn't open. So I try to open it and...it's unlocked, they must have forgotten to lock it given that they came back drunk.\n\nSo I walk in and see them having sex. They both quickly see me and freak out. She says to me ''What the fuck?!!'' but I look over to the guy, the guy was a bit short and really skinny, there's no way in hell he would be a threat to me and he looked way more nervous than she does. \n\nShe keeps saying ''What the fuck?!! Get out!!'' and I say to her ''I've had enough of your fucking shit. We've all had enough of your fucking shit, you piece of shit. We're trying to sleep''. \n\nThe guy is standing there awkwardly so I tell him ''Get the fuck out'' and he doesn't do anything just stands there awkwardly, so I tell him ''I'll fucking call security, and I've got 4 other flatmates to back me up, our words against yours so get the fuck out!!'' and he gets his clothes on and runs out the flat. \n\nSo the ''problem'' girl starts crying and I tell her that she needs to sort her life out, I then to say to her ''Please leave this flat, move out. No one here fucking likes you, not even that guy you just fucked likes you enough to stay'' and she screams at me and calls me fucking cunt and asshole.\n\nI then leave and go to back to my room. I told the others what happened and they agreed with me, there's nothing I could have done. In fact they THANKED me, at least we could get to sleep and now we sent her a message, AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who walked into their flatmate's room while she was having sex and refused to leave is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). The user thinks the author isn't wrong, but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The main issue here is entering someone's private space without permission. The author walked into the flatmate's room while she was having sex. Even if there was prior issues with noise, the act of entering without consent is a problem. Privacy is a big deal, especially in shared living situations. \n\nThe flatmates had already tried to address the noise issue through other means, like telling her and involving security, which didn't work. The author then took matters into his own hands. While the noise was a problem, the method of resolving it by barging in is questionable. \n\nThere's also the aspect of consent. The flatmate might have been violating others' privacy with the loud sex, but the author's response\u2014walking in and confronting them\u2014also invades their privacy. The guy who was there might not have even known the rules about noise, and the author's aggressive behavior could be seen as overreacting.\n\nThe author's actions led to the guy leaving quickly and the flatmate being upset. The other flatmates supported him, but that doesn't necessarily make it right. Legal considerations might come into play here as well. In many places, walking into someone's private room without permission could be considered trespassing, especially if it's a shared space where privacy is expected.\n\nOn the other hand, the author was trying to enforce what he believed were shared living agreements. The flatmates had legitimate complaints about noise affecting their rest and studies. The author's frustration is understandable, but the method of dealing with it was extreme and potentially illegal.\n\nThe key point is whether the author's actions were justified. Even if the flatmate was at fault for the noise, the author shouldn't have entered her room. There are other ways to handle it, like using earplugs, talking to her more firmly, or involving security properly. The author's actions could lead to legal issues, like invasion of privacy or assault if the flatmate pressed charges, even if it was just verbal confrontation.\n\nSo, considering all angles, the author's decision to enter the room without consent is the main issue. Even if the motivation was to stop the noise, the method was inappropriate and crossed a legal and ethical line. Therefore, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong (A).\n"
