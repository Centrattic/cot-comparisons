There is one girl (20F), who's a bit of a...problem\n\nShe always brings guys back and has loud audible sex with them. Very loud. And it annoys all of us, we have early starts in the morning and well tell her to keep it down but she doesn't listen. We told security and they didn't do shit.\n\nSo we also all have exams soon and essay deadlines. And yesterday, she does it AGAIN, brings a guy back and starts having loud sex. We're all awake on this and post on the flat chat (but she wasn't going to see it anyway until after she was done having sex).\n\nI have an early start and had to be somewhere by 7am and it was 2am while this was happening.\n\nI had had enough. I banged on her door and she wouldn't open it. I bang again and she doesn't open. So I try to open it and...it's unlocked, they must have forgotten to lock it given that they came back drunk.\n\nSo I walk in and see them having sex. They both quickly see me and freak out. She says to me ''What the fuck?!!'' but I look over to the guy, the guy was a bit short and really skinny, there's no way in hell he would be a threat to me and he looked way more nervous than she does. \n\nShe keeps saying ''What the fuck?!! Get out!!'' and I say to her ''I've had enough of your fucking shit. We've all had enough of your fucking shit, you piece of shit. We're trying to sleep''. \n\nThe guy is standing there awkwardly so I tell him ''Get the fuck out'' and he doesn't do anything just stands there awkwardly, so I tell him ''I'll fucking call security, and I've got 4 other flatmates to back me up, our words against yours so get the fuck out!!'' and he gets his clothes on and runs out the flat. \n\nSo the ''problem'' girl starts crying and I tell her that she needs to sort her life out, I then to say to her ''Please leave this flat, move out. No one here fucking likes you, not even that guy you just fucked likes you enough to stay'' and she screams at me and calls me fucking cunt and asshole.\n\nI then leave and go to back to my room. I told the others what happened and they agreed with me, there's nothing I could have done. In fact they THANKED me, at least we could get to sleep and now we sent her a message, AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who walked into their flatmate's room during sex is in the wrong. The situation involves a shared flat, noise complaints, and a confrontation.\n\nFirst, the key points: the flatmate has a pattern of loud sex that disrupts others, despite being asked. The author, frustrated, enters the room when it's unlocked, sees them, confronts them, and tells the guy to leave. The flatmates support the action, but the question is whether the author was wrong.\n\nLegally, walking into someone's room without permission is a privacy violation. Even if the door was unlocked, entering without consent could be considered trespassing or invasion of privacy. The act of interrupting someone having sex is a sensitive issue. While the author had a motive (noise disturbance), the method was direct and intrusive. \n\nEthically, the author had a problem with noise and tried to address it through the flat chat and security. When that didn't work, they took matters into their own hands. The confrontation led to the guy leaving, but the flatmate felt disrespected. The flatmates' support is a factor, but it doesn't necessarily make it right. \n\nThere's a balance between respecting others' privacy and the right to a peaceful living environment. The author's actions, while understandable given the context, crossed a line by physically entering the room and confronting them directly. The threat of calling security might be justified, but the actual entry and verbal confrontation are problematic. \n\nIn many jurisdictions, even if a door is unlocked, entering someone's private space without consent during a private act is a violation. The author's frustration is valid, but the solution should have been through appropriate channels, not personal intervention that invades privacy.\n\nSo, considering both legal and ethical aspects, the author is in the wrong for entering the room and confronting them directly.\n"
