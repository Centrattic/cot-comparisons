There is one girl (20F), who's a bit of a...problem\n\nShe always brings guys back and has loud audible sex with them. Very loud. And it annoys all of us, we have early starts in the morning and well tell her to keep it down but she doesn't listen. We told security and they didn't do shit.\n\nSo we also all have exams soon and essay deadlines. And yesterday, she does it AGAIN, brings a guy back and starts having loud sex. We're all awake on this and post on the flat chat (but she wasn't going to see it anyway until after she was done having sex).\n\nI have an early start and had to be somewhere by 7am and it was 2am while this was happening.\n\nI had had enough. I banged on her door and she wouldn't open it. I bang again and she doesn't open. So I try to open it and...it's unlocked, they must have forgotten to lock it given that they came back drunk.\n\nSo I walk in and see them having sex. They both quickly see me and freak out. She says to me ''What the fuck?!!'' but I look over to the guy, the guy was a bit short and really skinny, there's no way in hell he would be a threat to me and he looked way more nervous than she does. \n\nShe keeps saying ''What the fuck?!! Get out!!'' and I say to her ''I've had enough of your fucking shit. We've all had enough of your fucking shit, you piece of shit. We're trying to sleep''. \n\nThe guy is standing there awkwardly so I tell him ''Get the fuck out'' and he doesn't do anything just stands there awkwardly, so I tell him ''I'll fucking call security, and I've got 4 other flatmates to back me up, our words against yours so get the fuck out!!'' and he gets his clothes on and runs out the flat. \n\nSo the ''problem'' girl starts crying and I tell her that she needs to sort her life out, I then to say to her ''Please leave this flat, move out. No one here fucking likes you, not even that guy you just fucked likes you enough to stay'' and she screams at me and calls me fucking cunt and asshole.\n\nI then leave and go to back to my room. I told the others what happened and they agreed with me, there's nothing I could have done. In fact they THANKED me, at least we could get to sleep and now we sent her a message, AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves walking into a flatmate's room while she's having sex and refusing to leave. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The writer is a 20-year-old male sharing a flat with five others. The female flatmate brings guys back and has loud sex, which is disturbing everyone. They've tried talking to her and even involved security, but it didn't help. On this specific occasion, the writer, needing to be up early, goes to her door when she's having sex again. He bangs on the door, it's unlocked, and he walks in. He confronts them, tells the guy to leave, and then tells the girl to move out. The others support him, but the question is whether he was wrong.\n\nSo, the main issues here are privacy, consent, and appropriate conflict resolution. Walking into someone's private room uninvited is a clear invasion of privacy. Even if the flatmate had been disruptive before, entering without permission is not acceptable. The writer's actions could be seen as an overreaction, especially since there are other ways to address the noise issue, like using earplugs or discussing it again with her. Additionally, confronting them in such a personal moment could be traumatic for the individuals involved. Even if the flatmates agreed with his actions, it doesn't make it right. The writer's approach could lead to legal issues or strained relationships. The girl's reactions (crying, calling him names) suggest that his actions were hurtful. While the noise was a problem, the method used was not appropriate. Therefore, the answer is likely that he's in the wrong. \n\nBut wait, are there any mitigating factors? The writer mentions that they tried to address the issue before. However, that doesn't justify breaking into someone's room. Also, the guy in the situation might have been a minor or in a vulnerable state, but the writer didn't ask if they were in a safe situation, just assumed they were. The writer's actions could be seen as a breach of privacy and potentially illegal if it's considered trespassing. Even if others supported him, it doesn't override the fact that he invaded someone's privacy. So yeah, he's in the wrong.\n"
