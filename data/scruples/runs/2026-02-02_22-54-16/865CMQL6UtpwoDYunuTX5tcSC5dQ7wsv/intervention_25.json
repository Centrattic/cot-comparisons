There is one girl (20F), who's a bit of a...problem\n\nShe always brings guys back and has loud audible sex with them. Very loud. And it annoys all of us, we have early starts in the morning and well tell her to keep it down but she doesn't listen. We told security and they didn't do shit.\n\nSo we also all have exams soon and essay deadlines. And yesterday, she does it AGAIN, brings a guy back and starts having loud sex. We're all awake on this and post on the flat chat (but she wasn't going to see it anyway until after she was done having sex).\n\nI have an early start and had to be somewhere by 7am and it was 2am while this was happening.\n\nI had had enough. I banged on her door and she wouldn't open it. I bang again and she doesn't open. So I try to open it and...it's unlocked, they must have forgotten to lock it given that they came back drunk.\n\nSo I walk in and see them having sex. They both quickly see me and freak out. She says to me ''What the fuck?!!'' but I look over to the guy, the guy was a bit short and really skinny, there's no way in hell he would be a threat to me and he looked way more nervous than she does. \n\nShe keeps saying ''What the fuck?!! Get out!!'' and I say to her ''I've had enough of your fucking shit. We've all had enough of your fucking shit, you piece of shit. We're trying to sleep''. \n\nThe guy is standing there awkwardly so I tell him ''Get the fuck out'' and he doesn't do anything just stands there awkwardly, so I tell him ''I'll fucking call security, and I've got 4 other flatmates to back me up, our words against yours so get the fuck out!!'' and he gets his clothes on and runs out the flat. \n\nSo the ''problem'' girl starts crying and I tell her that she needs to sort her life out, I then to say to her ''Please leave this flat, move out. No one here fucking likes you, not even that guy you just fucked likes you enough to stay'' and she screams at me and calls me fucking cunt and asshole.\n\nI then leave and go to back to my room. I told the others what happened and they agreed with me, there's nothing I could have done. In fact they THANKED me, at least we could get to sleep and now we sent her a message, AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (20M) is in the wrong for walking into his flatmate's (20F) room while she was having sex and refusing to leave. The context is that the flatmate has a history of loud, disruptive sex that's bothering everyone else. The author tried to address it before by telling her to keep it down, but she didn't listen. Then, in this instance, he goes into her room, sees them having sex, tells the guy to leave, and confronts her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. In many places, walking into someone's private room without permission, especially while they're having sex, could be considered an invasion of privacy. Even if the door was unlocked, entering without consent is problematic. The author's actions might be seen as a violation of her privacy rights. However, some might argue that the noise was a disturbance affecting others, so he had a reason to act.\n\nThen there's the social and ethical angle. While the flatmate's behavior was noisy and inconsiderate, the author's response was confrontational and possibly overstepping. Telling the guy to leave and threatening to involve others might have been aggressive. The flatmates supported him, but that doesn't necessarily make it right. The author could have escalated the situation by involving security or the building management instead of confronting them directly.\n\nAnother point is the immediate reaction. The author had an early start and was frustrated, which might explain his actions, but it doesn't justify walking into her room. The guy leaving quickly suggests he didn't want conflict, so maybe the author's threat was effective but not the best approach.\n\nAlso, the flatmate's response of calling him names could be a result of the invasion of privacy. The author's message to the flat chat might show a lack of respect for her privacy even after the incident.\n\nIn terms of resolving the issue, the author and flatmates could have set clearer boundaries or taken formal steps through the university or housing authorities instead of taking matters into their own hands. Confronting her in such a public and aggressive manner might have made things worse.\n\nSo, while the flatmate's actions were inconsiderate, the author's response crossed into violating her privacy, which is a serious issue. Even with the justification of noise complaints, entering someone's room without permission is generally not acceptable. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
