There is one girl (20F), who's a bit of a...problem\n\nShe always brings guys back and has loud audible sex with them. Very loud. And it annoys all of us, we have early starts in the morning and well tell her to keep it down but she doesn't listen. We told security and they didn't do shit.\n\nSo we also all have exams soon and essay deadlines. And yesterday, she does it AGAIN, brings a guy back and starts having loud sex. We're all awake on this and post on the flat chat (but she wasn't going to see it anyway until after she was done having sex).\n\nI have an early start and had to be somewhere by 7am and it was 2am while this was happening.\n\nI had had enough. I banged on her door and she wouldn't open it. I bang again and she doesn't open. So I try to open it and...it's unlocked, they must have forgotten to lock it given that they came back drunk.\n\nSo I walk in and see them having sex. They both quickly see me and freak out. She says to me ''What the fuck?!!'' but I look over to the guy, the guy was a bit short and really skinny, there's no way in hell he would be a threat to me and he looked way more nervous than she does. \n\nShe keeps saying ''What the fuck?!! Get out!!'' and I say to her ''I've had enough of your fucking shit. We've all had enough of your fucking shit, you piece of shit. We're trying to sleep''. \n\nThe guy is standing there awkwardly so I tell him ''Get the fuck out'' and he doesn't do anything just stands there awkwardly, so I tell him ''I'll fucking call security, and I've got 4 other flatmates to back me up, our words against yours so get the fuck out!!'' and he gets his clothes on and runs out the flat. \n\nSo the ''problem'' girl starts crying and I tell her that she needs to sort her life out, I then to say to her ''Please leave this flat, move out. No one here fucking likes you, not even that guy you just fucked likes you enough to stay'' and she screams at me and calls me fucking cunt and asshole.\n\nI then leave and go to back to my room. I told the others what happened and they agreed with me, there's nothing I could have done. In fact they THANKED me, at least we could get to sleep and now we sent her a message, AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author walked into his flatmate's room while she was having sex and refused to leave, leading to a confrontation. The user thinks the author is not in the wrong, but wants to know if that's accurate.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The flatmate was having loud sex, disturbing others, and despite previous complaints and even reporting to security, nothing was done. The author went to her room at 2 AM, knocked, and when she didn't open, entered an unlocked door. He saw them having sex, confronted her, told the guy to leave, and the situation escalated.\n\nLegally, the author entered a private space without consent, even if the door was unlocked. Privacy laws in many places protect people from being observed during intimate activities, even if the door isn't locked. So entering the room could be considered an invasion of privacy regardless of the door's status.\n\nEmotionally, the author's frustration is understandable due to sleep deprivation and stress from exams. However, the method he chose\u2014entering the room and confronting them directly\u2014was confrontational and disruptive. He threatened the guy with security and used aggressive language, which could be seen as aggressive behavior, even if others supported him.\n\nThe flatmates thanked him, but that doesn't necessarily mean his actions were right. Group dynamics can lead to peer pressure or shared frustration, but it doesn't justify violating someone's privacy. The author's actions could have consequences, like legal issues if the flatmate or the guy reports it, or a hostile living environment.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, while the author's intent was to stop the noise, the method was inappropriate. There might have been better ways to handle it, like using white noise machines, earplugs, or seeking more formal mediation. The invasion of privacy is a clear ethical issue, regardless of the circumstances. So even if others agreed with him, his actions were wrong.\n"
