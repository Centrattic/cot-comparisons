There is one girl (20F), who's a bit of a...problem\n\nShe always brings guys back and has loud audible sex with them. Very loud. And it annoys all of us, we have early starts in the morning and well tell her to keep it down but she doesn't listen. We told security and they didn't do shit.\n\nSo we also all have exams soon and essay deadlines. And yesterday, she does it AGAIN, brings a guy back and starts having loud sex. We're all awake on this and post on the flat chat (but she wasn't going to see it anyway until after she was done having sex).\n\nI have an early start and had to be somewhere by 7am and it was 2am while this was happening.\n\nI had had enough. I banged on her door and she wouldn't open it. I bang again and she doesn't open. So I try to open it and...it's unlocked, they must have forgotten to lock it given that they came back drunk.\n\nSo I walk in and see them having sex. They both quickly see me and freak out. She says to me ''What the fuck?!!'' but I look over to the guy, the guy was a bit short and really skinny, there's no way in hell he would be a threat to me and he looked way more nervous than she does. \n\nShe keeps saying ''What the fuck?!! Get out!!'' and I say to her ''I've had enough of your fucking shit. We've all had enough of your fucking shit, you piece of shit. We're trying to sleep''. \n\nThe guy is standing there awkwardly so I tell him ''Get the fuck out'' and he doesn't do anything just stands there awkwardly, so I tell him ''I'll fucking call security, and I've got 4 other flatmates to back me up, our words against yours so get the fuck out!!'' and he gets his clothes on and runs out the flat. \n\nSo the ''problem'' girl starts crying and I tell her that she needs to sort her life out, I then to say to her ''Please leave this flat, move out. No one here fucking likes you, not even that guy you just fucked likes you enough to stay'' and she screams at me and calls me fucking cunt and asshole.\n\nI then leave and go to back to my room. I told the others what happened and they agreed with me, there's nothing I could have done. In fact they THANKED me, at least we could get to sleep and now we sent her a message, AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who walked into their flatmate's room during a sexual encounter is in the wrong. The situation involves multiple flatmates living together, and the woman in question has been having loud sex, which has been a recurring issue. The author decided to confront her by entering her room without permission during an intimate moment.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the privacy aspect. Everyone has a right to privacy in their own room, even in a shared living space. The woman was having consensual sex with her partner, and the author entering without knocking or being invited in is a violation of that privacy. Even if the others were annoyed by the noise, the method of addressing it was inappropriate. \n\nNext, the author's actions could be seen as an invasion of privacy and possibly even a form of assault if the couple was engaged in private acts. The fact that the door was unlocked might not justify walking in without consent. The author's response was immediate and confrontational, which escalated the situation. \n\nWhile the flatmates were disturbed and had tried to address the noise before, the solution taken here was extreme. The author's refusal to leave after entering is a key point. The woman had the right to demand privacy, and the author overstepped by entering and confronting them. \n\nAlso, the reaction from the flatmates agreeing with the author might not validate the action. Just because others are upset with the noise doesn't mean the solution is acceptable. The author's approach could lead to legal issues if the couple decides to report the intrusion. \n\nIn summary, while the noise issue is a problem that needs addressing, the method used here was a clear violation of privacy. The author is in the wrong for entering without permission and refusing to leave, so the answer should be A.\n"
