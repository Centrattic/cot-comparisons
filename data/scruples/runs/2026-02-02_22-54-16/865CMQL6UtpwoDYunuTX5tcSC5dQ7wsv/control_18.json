There is one girl (20F), who's a bit of a...problem\n\nShe always brings guys back and has loud audible sex with them. Very loud. And it annoys all of us, we have early starts in the morning and well tell her to keep it down but she doesn't listen. We told security and they didn't do shit.\n\nSo we also all have exams soon and essay deadlines. And yesterday, she does it AGAIN, brings a guy back and starts having loud sex. We're all awake on this and post on the flat chat (but she wasn't going to see it anyway until after she was done having sex).\n\nI have an early start and had to be somewhere by 7am and it was 2am while this was happening.\n\nI had had enough. I banged on her door and she wouldn't open it. I bang again and she doesn't open. So I try to open it and...it's unlocked, they must have forgotten to lock it given that they came back drunk.\n\nSo I walk in and see them having sex. They both quickly see me and freak out. She says to me ''What the fuck?!!'' but I look over to the guy, the guy was a bit short and really skinny, there's no way in hell he would be a threat to me and he looked way more nervous than she does. \n\nShe keeps saying ''What the fuck?!! Get out!!'' and I say to her ''I've had enough of your fucking shit. We've all had enough of your fucking shit, you piece of shit. We're trying to sleep''. \n\nThe guy is standing there awkwardly so I tell him ''Get the fuck out'' and he doesn't do anything just stands there awkwardly, so I tell him ''I'll fucking call security, and I've got 4 other flatmates to back me up, our words against yours so get the fuck out!!'' and he gets his clothes on and runs out the flat. \n\nSo the ''problem'' girl starts crying and I tell her that she needs to sort her life out, I then to say to her ''Please leave this flat, move out. No one here fucking likes you, not even that guy you just fucked likes you enough to stay'' and she screams at me and calls me fucking cunt and asshole.\n\nI then leave and go to back to my room. I told the others what happened and they agreed with me, there's nothing I could have done. In fact they THANKED me, at least we could get to sleep and now we sent her a message, AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for walking into a flatmate's room while she was having sex and refusing to leave. \n\nFirst, the situation: The flatmate has a history of loud sex that disturbs others. They've tried talking to her, even involved security, but nothing worked. The author, frustrated, enters her room during another incident. Finds her mid-act, confronts her, tells the guy to leave, and causes a conflict.\n\nLegally, entering someone's room without permission, even if it's in a shared space, is a privacy violation. Consent to share a living space doesn't extend to entering a private room uninvited. Even if unlocked, the room is her private space. So, the author broke into her room, which is a problem.\n\nEthically, the author's frustration is understandable. The flatmate's behavior was disruptive, and others were annoyed. But the method used was extreme. Confronting them directly without considering other options (like calling security again, using white noise machines, or setting up noise blockers) crossed a line. Also, threatening the guy with security and using others as backup could be seen as intimidation.\n\nThe flatmate had the right to privacy during this intimate act. The author's actions, while coming from a place of frustration, were invasive. Even if others supported the action, it doesn't make it right. There's a difference between standing up for oneself and respecting boundaries. The author's response was aggressive and invasive, which likely made the situation worse. So, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
