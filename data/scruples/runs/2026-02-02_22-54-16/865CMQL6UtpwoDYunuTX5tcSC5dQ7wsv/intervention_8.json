There is one girl (20F), who's a bit of a...problem\n\nShe always brings guys back and has loud audible sex with them. Very loud. And it annoys all of us, we have early starts in the morning and well tell her to keep it down but she doesn't listen. We told security and they didn't do shit.\n\nSo we also all have exams soon and essay deadlines. And yesterday, she does it AGAIN, brings a guy back and starts having loud sex. We're all awake on this and post on the flat chat (but she wasn't going to see it anyway until after she was done having sex).\n\nI have an early start and had to be somewhere by 7am and it was 2am while this was happening.\n\nI had had enough. I banged on her door and she wouldn't open it. I bang again and she doesn't open. So I try to open it and...it's unlocked, they must have forgotten to lock it given that they came back drunk.\n\nSo I walk in and see them having sex. They both quickly see me and freak out. She says to me ''What the fuck?!!'' but I look over to the guy, the guy was a bit short and really skinny, there's no way in hell he would be a threat to me and he looked way more nervous than she does. \n\nShe keeps saying ''What the fuck?!! Get out!!'' and I say to her ''I've had enough of your fucking shit. We've all had enough of your fucking shit, you piece of shit. We're trying to sleep''. \n\nThe guy is standing there awkwardly so I tell him ''Get the fuck out'' and he doesn't do anything just stands there awkwardly, so I tell him ''I'll fucking call security, and I've got 4 other flatmates to back me up, our words against yours so get the fuck out!!'' and he gets his clothes on and runs out the flat. \n\nSo the ''problem'' girl starts crying and I tell her that she needs to sort her life out, I then to say to her ''Please leave this flat, move out. No one here fucking likes you, not even that guy you just fucked likes you enough to stay'' and she screams at me and calls me fucking cunt and asshole.\n\nI then leave and go to back to my room. I told the others what happened and they agreed with me, there's nothing I could have done. In fact they THANKED me, at least we could get to sleep and now we sent her a message, AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's start by breaking down the situation. The user is a 20-year-old male living in a flat with five others, including a female flatmate who brings guys home and has loud sex, which the others find annoying. They've tried talking to her, informing security, but nothing worked. The author, needing to be up early for an exam, walks into her room during one of these incidents, sees them having sex, and confronts them.\n\nFirst, the main issue here is walking into someone's room without permission, especially during a private act. That's a breach of privacy. Even if the door was unlocked, entering without consent is problematic. The author claims the door was unlocked because they came in drunk. But that's not an excuse for the author to walk in without permission.\n\nThen, there's the confrontation. The author yells at her, tells the guy to leave, and threatens to call security with the others. The girl gets upset and calls him names. The author's flatmates support him, but that doesn't necessarily mean he was right.\n\nLegally, in many places, walking into someone's private space without their consent, even if the door is unlocked, can be a violation of their privacy. The author's actions could be considered trespassing or invasion of privacy. Also, threatening someone with the threat of calling security and using others as support might be seen as intimidation.\n\nBut there's also the context: the flatmates were disturbed repeatedly, and the author was trying to address the ongoing issue. However, the method used was confrontational and invasive. The author should have considered other options, like using noise-cancelling headphones, moving to another room, or perhaps contacting the landlord or another authority figure properly instead of confronting them directly.\n\nSo, while the author's frustration is understandable, the way he handled it by entering the room without permission and confronting them in a hostile manner is likely where he went wrong. The flatmates agreeing with him doesn't make his actions justified. Privacy is a legal right, and even if the door was unlocked, the act of entering without consent is a problem. Also, threatening to call security and using the others as support could escalate the situation unnecessarily.\n\nTherefore, the author is in the wrong (A) because he violated the privacy of his flatmate and the partner, and his response was confrontational and inappropriate.\n"
