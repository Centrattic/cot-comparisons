There is one girl (20F), who's a bit of a...problem\n\nShe always brings guys back and has loud audible sex with them. Very loud. And it annoys all of us, we have early starts in the morning and well tell her to keep it down but she doesn't listen. We told security and they didn't do shit.\n\nSo we also all have exams soon and essay deadlines. And yesterday, she does it AGAIN, brings a guy back and starts having loud sex. We're all awake on this and post on the flat chat (but she wasn't going to see it anyway until after she was done having sex).\n\nI have an early start and had to be somewhere by 7am and it was 2am while this was happening.\n\nI had had enough. I banged on her door and she wouldn't open it. I bang again and she doesn't open. So I try to open it and...it's unlocked, they must have forgotten to lock it given that they came back drunk.\n\nSo I walk in and see them having sex. They both quickly see me and freak out. She says to me ''What the fuck?!!'' but I look over to the guy, the guy was a bit short and really skinny, there's no way in hell he would be a threat to me and he looked way more nervous than she does. \n\nShe keeps saying ''What the fuck?!! Get out!!'' and I say to her ''I've had enough of your fucking shit. We've all had enough of your fucking shit, you piece of shit. We're trying to sleep''. \n\nThe guy is standing there awkwardly so I tell him ''Get the fuck out'' and he doesn't do anything just stands there awkwardly, so I tell him ''I'll fucking call security, and I've got 4 other flatmates to back me up, our words against yours so get the fuck out!!'' and he gets his clothes on and runs out the flat. \n\nSo the ''problem'' girl starts crying and I tell her that she needs to sort her life out, I then to say to her ''Please leave this flat, move out. No one here fucking likes you, not even that guy you just fucked likes you enough to stay'' and she screams at me and calls me fucking cunt and asshole.\n\nI then leave and go to back to my room. I told the others what happened and they agreed with me, there's nothing I could have done. In fact they THANKED me, at least we could get to sleep and now we sent her a message, AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who walked into their flatmate's room during a sexual encounter and refused to leave is in the wrong. They provided the scenario where the flatmate is consistently loud during sex, disturbing others, and despite complaints and involving security, it keeps happening.\n\nFirst, I need to consider privacy. Entering someone's room without permission, especially when they're engaged in a private act like sex, is a clear invasion of their privacy. Even if the person was upset about the noise, walking in uninvited is a big no-no. The fact that the door was unlocked doesn't give anyone the right to enter without consent. \n\nThen there's the aspect of confrontation. The author escalated the situation by yelling insults and confronting both the flatmate and her partner. Telling the guy to leave and threatening to call security with others backing up could be seen as aggressive. Even if the flatmates are supportive, the method used here is problematic.\n\nLegal implications might come into play here. Depending on the country, entering someone's room without permission during a private act could be considered a breach of privacy, possibly even a criminal offense. The emotional distress caused by the intrusion and verbal abuse is another factor. The flatmate was crying, which shows the impact of the confrontation.\n\nThe flatmates' agreement doesn't absolve the author of responsibility. Just because others are upset about the noise doesn't justify breaking into someone's room. There are other ways to address the issue, like using earplugs, discussing boundaries more calmly, or seeking formal mediation if previous attempts failed.\n\nThe author's argument is that they were fed up, but that doesn't justify the action. There's a fine line between standing up for oneself and violating someone else's rights. The key points here are respecting privacy, using appropriate conflict resolution methods, and considering the potential legal and emotional consequences.\n\nIn conclusion, while the noise issue is a valid problem, the method used to address it was inappropriate. The author is in the wrong for invading privacy and using aggressive confrontation. The right approach would involve finding non-intrusive solutions and respecting the other person's rights.\n"
