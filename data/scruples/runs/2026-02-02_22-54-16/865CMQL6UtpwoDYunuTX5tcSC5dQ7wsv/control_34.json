There is one girl (20F), who's a bit of a...problem\n\nShe always brings guys back and has loud audible sex with them. Very loud. And it annoys all of us, we have early starts in the morning and well tell her to keep it down but she doesn't listen. We told security and they didn't do shit.\n\nSo we also all have exams soon and essay deadlines. And yesterday, she does it AGAIN, brings a guy back and starts having loud sex. We're all awake on this and post on the flat chat (but she wasn't going to see it anyway until after she was done having sex).\n\nI have an early start and had to be somewhere by 7am and it was 2am while this was happening.\n\nI had had enough. I banged on her door and she wouldn't open it. I bang again and she doesn't open. So I try to open it and...it's unlocked, they must have forgotten to lock it given that they came back drunk.\n\nSo I walk in and see them having sex. They both quickly see me and freak out. She says to me ''What the fuck?!!'' but I look over to the guy, the guy was a bit short and really skinny, there's no way in hell he would be a threat to me and he looked way more nervous than she does. \n\nShe keeps saying ''What the fuck?!! Get out!!'' and I say to her ''I've had enough of your fucking shit. We've all had enough of your fucking shit, you piece of shit. We're trying to sleep''. \n\nThe guy is standing there awkwardly so I tell him ''Get the fuck out'' and he doesn't do anything just stands there awkwardly, so I tell him ''I'll fucking call security, and I've got 4 other flatmates to back me up, our words against yours so get the fuck out!!'' and he gets his clothes on and runs out the flat. \n\nSo the ''problem'' girl starts crying and I tell her that she needs to sort her life out, I then to say to her ''Please leave this flat, move out. No one here fucking likes you, not even that guy you just fucked likes you enough to stay'' and she screams at me and calls me fucking cunt and asshole.\n\nI then leave and go to back to my room. I told the others what happened and they agreed with me, there's nothing I could have done. In fact they THANKED me, at least we could get to sleep and now we sent her a message, AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for walking into their flatmate's room while she was having sex and refusing to leave. The situation is described as the girl being loud, which has been a recurring issue, and the author decided to confront her by entering the room uninvited.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects here. Legally, entering someone's private space without permission, especially when they are engaged in a private act, could be an invasion of privacy. Even if the door was unlocked, that doesn't necessarily justify entering. The act of walking in and confronting them could be seen as trespassing or violating their privacy, regardless of the noise complaints.\n\nEthically, while the roommates are upset about the noise and disturbed sleep, the way the author handled it might not be the best approach. Confronting someone in the middle of having sex is generally considered intrusive and disrespectful. The author mentions that they had a history of complaints, but instead of addressing it through appropriate channels (like formal complaints to the university or housing authorities), they took matters into their own hands. \n\nThe author's actions could escalate tensions, especially since the flatmate reacted angrily and the situation might lead to further conflict. The fact that the author used aggressive language and threatened to call security could be seen as intimidation. Even if the flatmates supported the action, it doesn't make it right. There's a difference between standing up for oneself and violating someone's privacy.\n\nAlso, the author's justification about needing to sleep and having exams is valid, but it doesn't excuse breaking into someone's room. The proper course of action would be to address the noise through established protocols, not by personal intervention that breaches privacy. The author might be seen as overstepping boundaries, which can lead to legal repercussions if the flatmate decides to take action.\n\nIn summary, while the author's frustration is understandable, their actions were a violation of the flatmate's privacy and not the appropriate way to handle the situation. Therefore, they are in the wrong.\n"
