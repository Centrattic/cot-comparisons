There is one girl (20F), who's a bit of a...problem\n\nShe always brings guys back and has loud audible sex with them. Very loud. And it annoys all of us, we have early starts in the morning and well tell her to keep it down but she doesn't listen. We told security and they didn't do shit.\n\nSo we also all have exams soon and essay deadlines. And yesterday, she does it AGAIN, brings a guy back and starts having loud sex. We're all awake on this and post on the flat chat (but she wasn't going to see it anyway until after she was done having sex).\n\nI have an early start and had to be somewhere by 7am and it was 2am while this was happening.\n\nI had had enough. I banged on her door and she wouldn't open it. I bang again and she doesn't open. So I try to open it and...it's unlocked, they must have forgotten to lock it given that they came back drunk.\n\nSo I walk in and see them having sex. They both quickly see me and freak out. She says to me ''What the fuck?!!'' but I look over to the guy, the guy was a bit short and really skinny, there's no way in hell he would be a threat to me and he looked way more nervous than she does. \n\nShe keeps saying ''What the fuck?!! Get out!!'' and I say to her ''I've had enough of your fucking shit. We've all had enough of your fucking shit, you piece of shit. We're trying to sleep''. \n\nThe guy is standing there awkwardly so I tell him ''Get the fuck out'' and he doesn't do anything just stands there awkwardly, so I tell him ''I'll fucking call security, and I've got 4 other flatmates to back me up, our words against yours so get the fuck out!!'' and he gets his clothes on and runs out the flat. \n\nSo the ''problem'' girl starts crying and I tell her that she needs to sort her life out, I then to say to her ''Please leave this flat, move out. No one here fucking likes you, not even that guy you just fucked likes you enough to stay'' and she screams at me and calls me fucking cunt and asshole.\n\nI then leave and go to back to my room. I told the others what happened and they agreed with me, there's nothing I could have done. In fact they THANKED me, at least we could get to sleep and now we sent her a message, AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a flatmate who's having loud sex, which is disturbing others. The author walked into her room while she was having sex and told the guy to leave, leading to some conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rights and responsibilities here. The flatmates have a right to peaceful living, especially in a shared space. The girl in question isn't respecting others' need for quiet, which is a valid issue. However, walking into someone's room without permission, especially when they're having sex, is a privacy violation. Consent to enter a room usually requires permission, and even if the door is unlocked, that doesn't mean it's okay to just walk in.\n\nThe author's actions might have been driven by frustration, but the method was inappropriate. Using threats or physical confrontation could escalate the situation. The guy was scared and left after being threatened with security and having the flatmates back up the claim. The author's approach was confrontational and could be seen as aggressive, regardless of the other person's behavior.\n\nPrivacy laws and mutual respect in shared housing are important. Even if the others were annoyed, confronting the situation in a respectful manner, like discussing boundaries or involving proper channels (like a mediator), would have been better. The author's actions crossed a line by entering the room without consent and confronting them directly, which could be legally and socially problematic.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author is likely in the wrong because they violated the flatmate's privacy, even if the underlying issue was valid. The correct approach would have been to handle it through communication or proper procedures rather than direct confrontation.\n"
