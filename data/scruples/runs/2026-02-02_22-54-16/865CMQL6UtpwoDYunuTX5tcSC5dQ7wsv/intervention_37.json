There is one girl (20F), who's a bit of a...problem\n\nShe always brings guys back and has loud audible sex with them. Very loud. And it annoys all of us, we have early starts in the morning and well tell her to keep it down but she doesn't listen. We told security and they didn't do shit.\n\nSo we also all have exams soon and essay deadlines. And yesterday, she does it AGAIN, brings a guy back and starts having loud sex. We're all awake on this and post on the flat chat (but she wasn't going to see it anyway until after she was done having sex).\n\nI have an early start and had to be somewhere by 7am and it was 2am while this was happening.\n\nI had had enough. I banged on her door and she wouldn't open it. I bang again and she doesn't open. So I try to open it and...it's unlocked, they must have forgotten to lock it given that they came back drunk.\n\nSo I walk in and see them having sex. They both quickly see me and freak out. She says to me ''What the fuck?!!'' but I look over to the guy, the guy was a bit short and really skinny, there's no way in hell he would be a threat to me and he looked way more nervous than she does. \n\nShe keeps saying ''What the fuck?!! Get out!!'' and I say to her ''I've had enough of your fucking shit. We've all had enough of your fucking shit, you piece of shit. We're trying to sleep''. \n\nThe guy is standing there awkwardly so I tell him ''Get the fuck out'' and he doesn't do anything just stands there awkwardly, so I tell him ''I'll fucking call security, and I've got 4 other flatmates to back me up, our words against yours so get the fuck out!!'' and he gets his clothes on and runs out the flat. \n\nSo the ''problem'' girl starts crying and I tell her that she needs to sort her life out, I then to say to her ''Please leave this flat, move out. No one here fucking likes you, not even that guy you just fucked likes you enough to stay'' and she screams at me and calls me fucking cunt and asshole.\n\nI then leave and go to back to my room. I told the others what happened and they agreed with me, there's nothing I could have done. In fact they THANKED me, at least we could get to sleep and now we sent her a message, AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who walked into their flatmate's room during a sexual encounter and refused to leave is at fault. The scenario involves a university flat with multiple roommates, and the main issue is the flatmate's loud sex, which has been a recurring problem.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that the flatmate has been bringing guys back and having loud sex despite being asked to keep it down. The roommates have already reported this to security without success. So there's a pattern of behavior that's been problematic. The author, frustrated and needing to sleep for an early start, decides to confront this by entering the room without permission when the door was unlocked. \n\nNow, the key points here are consent to enter private property and the right to privacy. Even if the door was unlocked, entering someone's room without their consent is a violation of privacy. The situation escalates when the author confronts them, demands the guy to leave, and threatens to call security. The flatmate's response is emotional, and the author's actions led to immediate conflict.\n\nLegally, entering someone's private space without permission is an issue, regardless of the reason. Even if the door was unlocked, it's not a justification for entering without consent. The author's approach was confrontational and possibly aggressive. Yelling, using strong language, and threatening someone can lead to legal trouble, especially if it's considered harassment or assault. \n\nFrom a social standpoint, the roommates were upset about the noise, but the method used to address it was inappropriate. There are other ways to handle the situation, like using white noise machines, soundproofing, or formal complaints through university housing offices. Resorting to direct confrontation in such an intrusive manner is not advisable. \n\nThe flatmates supporting the author might be more about shared frustration than rightness. However, their agreement doesn't negate the fact that the author breached privacy. The author's actions might have been a result of frustration, but that doesn't excuse the violation of someone's privacy and the hostile confrontation. \n\nIn summary, while the flatmate's behavior was problematic, the author's response crossed the line into invading privacy and using intimidation. So the answer would be that the author is at fault.\n"
