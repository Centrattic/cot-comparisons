There is one girl (20F), who's a bit of a...problem\n\nShe always brings guys back and has loud audible sex with them. Very loud. And it annoys all of us, we have early starts in the morning and well tell her to keep it down but she doesn't listen. We told security and they didn't do shit.\n\nSo we also all have exams soon and essay deadlines. And yesterday, she does it AGAIN, brings a guy back and starts having loud sex. We're all awake on this and post on the flat chat (but she wasn't going to see it anyway until after she was done having sex).\n\nI have an early start and had to be somewhere by 7am and it was 2am while this was happening.\n\nI had had enough. I banged on her door and she wouldn't open it. I bang again and she doesn't open. So I try to open it and...it's unlocked, they must have forgotten to lock it given that they came back drunk.\n\nSo I walk in and see them having sex. They both quickly see me and freak out. She says to me ''What the fuck?!!'' but I look over to the guy, the guy was a bit short and really skinny, there's no way in hell he would be a threat to me and he looked way more nervous than she does. \n\nShe keeps saying ''What the fuck?!! Get out!!'' and I say to her ''I've had enough of your fucking shit. We've all had enough of your fucking shit, you piece of shit. We're trying to sleep''. \n\nThe guy is standing there awkwardly so I tell him ''Get the fuck out'' and he doesn't do anything just stands there awkwardly, so I tell him ''I'll fucking call security, and I've got 4 other flatmates to back me up, our words against yours so get the fuck out!!'' and he gets his clothes on and runs out the flat. \n\nSo the ''problem'' girl starts crying and I tell her that she needs to sort her life out, I then to say to her ''Please leave this flat, move out. No one here fucking likes you, not even that guy you just fucked likes you enough to stay'' and she screams at me and calls me fucking cunt and asshole.\n\nI then leave and go to back to my room. I told the others what happened and they agreed with me, there's nothing I could have done. In fact they THANKED me, at least we could get to sleep and now we sent her a message, AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author, a male flatmate, walked into his female flatmate's room while she was having sex and then refused to leave. The main question is whether he was in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The flatmate is having loud sex frequently, which is disturbing the other tenants. They've already complained, told security, but nothing worked. The author was annoyed because it's affecting his sleep and studies. At 2 AM, he bangs on her door, she doesn't open, then he enters when it's unlocked. He sees them having sex, confronts them, tells the guy to leave, and then yells at the girl. The others supported him, but we need to assess if his actions were appropriate.\n\nSo, legally, entering someone's private room without permission could be a violation of their privacy. Even if the door was unlocked, entering without being invited in could be considered a trespass. The fact that he walked in during a private act (sex) is a big issue. Even if he had a grievance about the noise, confronting them in that manner might be overstepping. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, while the flatmate's behavior was disruptive, the author's response could be seen as aggressive and invasive. He didn't just address the noise issue; he intruded into a private moment and then berated them. The guy was left in an awkward situation, and the girl was upset. Even if the others agreed with him, that doesn't necessarily make it right. \n\nHowever, the author was trying to resolve a persistent problem. The flatmates were all disturbed, and they had exhausted other avenues like contacting security. But the method he used\u2014entering the room uninvited\u2014might not be the right approach. Maybe he could have addressed the noise in a different way, like using earplugs or talking to her again, but instead he took a confrontational approach that led to a breach of privacy.\n\nSo, considering both legal and ethical aspects, the author likely overstepped by entering the room. Even if the door was unlocked, entering without consent during a private activity is a violation. Therefore, he might be in the wrong. But I should also consider if there's any justification. Since the others supported him and the situation was recurring, maybe there's some understanding. Still, the act of entering the room is problematic. So the answer is probably A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
