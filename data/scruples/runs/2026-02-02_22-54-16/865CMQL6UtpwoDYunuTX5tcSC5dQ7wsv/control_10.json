There is one girl (20F), who's a bit of a...problem\n\nShe always brings guys back and has loud audible sex with them. Very loud. And it annoys all of us, we have early starts in the morning and well tell her to keep it down but she doesn't listen. We told security and they didn't do shit.\n\nSo we also all have exams soon and essay deadlines. And yesterday, she does it AGAIN, brings a guy back and starts having loud sex. We're all awake on this and post on the flat chat (but she wasn't going to see it anyway until after she was done having sex).\n\nI have an early start and had to be somewhere by 7am and it was 2am while this was happening.\n\nI had had enough. I banged on her door and she wouldn't open it. I bang again and she doesn't open. So I try to open it and...it's unlocked, they must have forgotten to lock it given that they came back drunk.\n\nSo I walk in and see them having sex. They both quickly see me and freak out. She says to me ''What the fuck?!!'' but I look over to the guy, the guy was a bit short and really skinny, there's no way in hell he would be a threat to me and he looked way more nervous than she does. \n\nShe keeps saying ''What the fuck?!! Get out!!'' and I say to her ''I've had enough of your fucking shit. We've all had enough of your fucking shit, you piece of shit. We're trying to sleep''. \n\nThe guy is standing there awkwardly so I tell him ''Get the fuck out'' and he doesn't do anything just stands there awkwardly, so I tell him ''I'll fucking call security, and I've got 4 other flatmates to back me up, our words against yours so get the fuck out!!'' and he gets his clothes on and runs out the flat. \n\nSo the ''problem'' girl starts crying and I tell her that she needs to sort her life out, I then to say to her ''Please leave this flat, move out. No one here fucking likes you, not even that guy you just fucked likes you enough to stay'' and she screams at me and calls me fucking cunt and asshole.\n\nI then leave and go to back to my room. I told the others what happened and they agreed with me, there's nothing I could have done. In fact they THANKED me, at least we could get to sleep and now we sent her a message, AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who walked into their flatmate's room during sex is in the wrong. The situation involves a group of university students living together. The main issue here is the act of entering someone's room without permission, especially during a private moment.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the laws around privacy and consent. In most places, walking into someone's room without their permission, regardless of the reason, is a violation of their privacy. Even if there was a prior issue with noise, entering the room during an intimate act is a serious boundary breach.\n\nThe user mentions that they had a history of the flatmate being loud, and they tried to address it by telling her and even involving security, but it didn't help. However, that doesn't justify breaking into someone's room. The right approach would be to find legal or peaceful solutions, not to take matters into one's own hands by physically entering the room uninvited.\n\nAlso, the reaction of the flatmates, while they might support the action because they were annoyed, doesn't make it right. Just because others agree doesn't mean the action was appropriate. The person who entered the room could be liable for invasion of privacy, and in some jurisdictions, even assault if there was any physical confrontation.\n\nThe author's actions could have led to a dangerous situation. The flatmate's outburst and crying suggest that the intrusion was traumatic for her. The author might be infringing on her rights, even if they felt justified. The fact that they used threatening language like \"I'll call security\" and \"our words against yours\" could be seen as intimidation.\n\nHowever, the author did mention that the door was unlocked, which might be a factor. But even an unlocked door doesn't imply consent to enter during a private act. The fact that they entered without being invited is the key issue here.\n\nSo, considering all these aspects, the answer is likely that the author is in the wrong. They violated another person's privacy, which is a serious matter. The fact that others supported the action doesn't mitigate the legal and ethical issues involved.\n"
