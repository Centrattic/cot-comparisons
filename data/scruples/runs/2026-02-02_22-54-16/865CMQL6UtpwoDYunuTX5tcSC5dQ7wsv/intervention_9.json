There is one girl (20F), who's a bit of a...problem\n\nShe always brings guys back and has loud audible sex with them. Very loud. And it annoys all of us, we have early starts in the morning and well tell her to keep it down but she doesn't listen. We told security and they didn't do shit.\n\nSo we also all have exams soon and essay deadlines. And yesterday, she does it AGAIN, brings a guy back and starts having loud sex. We're all awake on this and post on the flat chat (but she wasn't going to see it anyway until after she was done having sex).\n\nI have an early start and had to be somewhere by 7am and it was 2am while this was happening.\n\nI had had enough. I banged on her door and she wouldn't open it. I bang again and she doesn't open. So I try to open it and...it's unlocked, they must have forgotten to lock it given that they came back drunk.\n\nSo I walk in and see them having sex. They both quickly see me and freak out. She says to me ''What the fuck?!!'' but I look over to the guy, the guy was a bit short and really skinny, there's no way in hell he would be a threat to me and he looked way more nervous than she does. \n\nShe keeps saying ''What the fuck?!! Get out!!'' and I say to her ''I've had enough of your fucking shit. We've all had enough of your fucking shit, you piece of shit. We're trying to sleep''. \n\nThe guy is standing there awkwardly so I tell him ''Get the fuck out'' and he doesn't do anything just stands there awkwardly, so I tell him ''I'll fucking call security, and I've got 4 other flatmates to back me up, our words against yours so get the fuck out!!'' and he gets his clothes on and runs out the flat. \n\nSo the ''problem'' girl starts crying and I tell her that she needs to sort her life out, I then to say to her ''Please leave this flat, move out. No one here fucking likes you, not even that guy you just fucked likes you enough to stay'' and she screams at me and calls me fucking cunt and asshole.\n\nI then leave and go to back to my room. I told the others what happened and they agreed with me, there's nothing I could have done. In fact they THANKED me, at least we could get to sleep and now we sent her a message, AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who walked into their flatmate's room while she was having sex and refused to leave is in the wrong. They provided the scenario where the author, a 20-year-old male, is living with five others, including a female flatmate who's been having loud sex with guys, which is disturbing everyone. They tried telling her to keep it down, even contacted security, but nothing worked. Then, in the scenario, the author walks in on her during another incident, confronts her, tells the guy to leave, and ends up in an argument.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many jurisdictions, walking into someone's private room without their consent could be considered trespassing or invasion of privacy, even within a shared living space. The door was unlocked, but that doesn't necessarily mean it's okay to enter without permission. Privacy rights are important, especially in a shared living situation.\n\nThen there's the social aspect. Even though the flatmates are annoyed, confronting someone in such a personal moment can be seen as extreme. The author's actions might be seen as a breach of trust and respect, even if the other person's behavior is disruptive. The author's response\u2014threatening to call security and getting others involved\u2014could escalate tensions and might not be the best way to handle the situation.\n\nThe user's opinion is that the author isn't in the wrong, but I need to weigh the other side. While the flatmate's actions are annoying, entering her room uninvited, especially during a private act, is a significant invasion of privacy. The author's approach, though understandable in frustration, might not be the most appropriate. There might be other ways to address the noise issue without resorting to confrontation in such a personal setting.\n\nAlso, the author's flatmates thanked him, but that doesn't necessarily mean his actions were right. Group dynamics can sometimes lead to a mob mentality where individuals do things they wouldn't alone. The author's use of aggressive language and the threat of calling security might have crossed a line, even if the intention was to stop the noise.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author should have considered alternative solutions first. Maybe using earplugs, talking to the flatmate more calmly, or finding a different time to address the issue. Confronting someone during an intimate moment is likely to cause more harm than good, both legally and socially.\n\nSo, putting it all together, even though the flatmate's behavior was problematic, the author's method of addressing it was inappropriate. Therefore, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong.\n"
