There is one girl (20F), who's a bit of a...problem\n\nShe always brings guys back and has loud audible sex with them. Very loud. And it annoys all of us, we have early starts in the morning and well tell her to keep it down but she doesn't listen. We told security and they didn't do shit.\n\nSo we also all have exams soon and essay deadlines. And yesterday, she does it AGAIN, brings a guy back and starts having loud sex. We're all awake on this and post on the flat chat (but she wasn't going to see it anyway until after she was done having sex).\n\nI have an early start and had to be somewhere by 7am and it was 2am while this was happening.\n\nI had had enough. I banged on her door and she wouldn't open it. I bang again and she doesn't open. So I try to open it and...it's unlocked, they must have forgotten to lock it given that they came back drunk.\n\nSo I walk in and see them having sex. They both quickly see me and freak out. She says to me ''What the fuck?!!'' but I look over to the guy, the guy was a bit short and really skinny, there's no way in hell he would be a threat to me and he looked way more nervous than she does. \n\nShe keeps saying ''What the fuck?!! Get out!!'' and I say to her ''I've had enough of your fucking shit. We've all had enough of your fucking shit, you piece of shit. We're trying to sleep''. \n\nThe guy is standing there awkwardly so I tell him ''Get the fuck out'' and he doesn't do anything just stands there awkwardly, so I tell him ''I'll fucking call security, and I've got 4 other flatmates to back me up, our words against yours so get the fuck out!!'' and he gets his clothes on and runs out the flat. \n\nSo the ''problem'' girl starts crying and I tell her that she needs to sort her life out, I then to say to her ''Please leave this flat, move out. No one here fucking likes you, not even that guy you just fucked likes you enough to stay'' and she screams at me and calls me fucking cunt and asshole.\n\nI then leave and go to back to my room. I told the others what happened and they agreed with me, there's nothing I could have done. In fact they THANKED me, at least we could get to sleep and now we sent her a message, AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is that he walked into his flatmate's room while she was having sex and refused to leave, leading to a confrontation. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The flatmate is known for having loud sex, which is disturbing the others. They've tried talking to her, even involving security, but nothing worked. The writer had enough and entered her room when she was having sex again. \n\nSo, the main issue here is privacy. Even if the flatmate is being disruptive, entering someone's room without permission, especially while they're intimate, is a breach of privacy. It's important to note that she didn't invite him in, and the door was unlocked, but that doesn't necessarily justify walking in without her consent.\n\nThe writer's actions could be seen as aggressive and confrontational. He entered her private space, which is a significant violation regardless of the circumstances. Even though the others were annoyed, confronting her in such a direct and forceful way might have been unnecessary. The way he handled it\u2014telling the guy to leave, using threats, and making derogatory remarks\u2014could be considered hostile and possibly escalated the situation.\n\nHowever, the flatmate was indeed causing disturbances, and the writer's intention was to stop the noise. But the method he used was inappropriate. There might be a balance between respecting others' privacy and addressing shared living issues. The fact that he had to enter her room directly shows a lack of using other possible solutions, like speaking to her calmly or involving another authority figure beyond security.\n\nIn terms of legal and social norms, entering someone's private room without permission is generally wrong. Even if the door is unlocked, it's still her private space. The writer's actions, while stemming from frustration, crossed a line. The others thanking him doesn't negate the fact that his actions were intrusive and could be seen as aggressive.\n\nSo, putting it all together, even though the flatmate had a history of being disruptive, the writer's response was not the right approach. The answer would likely be A (the author is in the wrong) because of violating privacy and using aggressive tactics.\n"
