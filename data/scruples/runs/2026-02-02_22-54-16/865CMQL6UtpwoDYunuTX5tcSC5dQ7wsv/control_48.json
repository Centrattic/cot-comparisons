There is one girl (20F), who's a bit of a...problem\n\nShe always brings guys back and has loud audible sex with them. Very loud. And it annoys all of us, we have early starts in the morning and well tell her to keep it down but she doesn't listen. We told security and they didn't do shit.\n\nSo we also all have exams soon and essay deadlines. And yesterday, she does it AGAIN, brings a guy back and starts having loud sex. We're all awake on this and post on the flat chat (but she wasn't going to see it anyway until after she was done having sex).\n\nI have an early start and had to be somewhere by 7am and it was 2am while this was happening.\n\nI had had enough. I banged on her door and she wouldn't open it. I bang again and she doesn't open. So I try to open it and...it's unlocked, they must have forgotten to lock it given that they came back drunk.\n\nSo I walk in and see them having sex. They both quickly see me and freak out. She says to me ''What the fuck?!!'' but I look over to the guy, the guy was a bit short and really skinny, there's no way in hell he would be a threat to me and he looked way more nervous than she does. \n\nShe keeps saying ''What the fuck?!! Get out!!'' and I say to her ''I've had enough of your fucking shit. We've all had enough of your fucking shit, you piece of shit. We're trying to sleep''. \n\nThe guy is standing there awkwardly so I tell him ''Get the fuck out'' and he doesn't do anything just stands there awkwardly, so I tell him ''I'll fucking call security, and I've got 4 other flatmates to back me up, our words against yours so get the fuck out!!'' and he gets his clothes on and runs out the flat. \n\nSo the ''problem'' girl starts crying and I tell her that she needs to sort her life out, I then to say to her ''Please leave this flat, move out. No one here fucking likes you, not even that guy you just fucked likes you enough to stay'' and she screams at me and calls me fucking cunt and asshole.\n\nI then leave and go to back to my room. I told the others what happened and they agreed with me, there's nothing I could have done. In fact they THANKED me, at least we could get to sleep and now we sent her a message, AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for walking into his flatmate's room while she was having sex and refusing to leave. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The author describes that the girl is bringing guys back and having loud sex, which is disturbing the other flatmates. They've tried talking to her and even reported to security, but nothing changed. The author, frustrated, decides to confront her by entering her room when she's with someone else.\n\nNow, the key points here: entering someone's room without permission, even if the door is unlocked. That's a privacy issue. The room is her private space, so walking in uninvited is a violation of her privacy. Even if the door was unlocked, that doesn't necessarily mean it's okay to enter without consent. People might forget to lock doors, but that's not the same as giving permission to enter.\n\nAlso, the author's reaction\u2014yelling at her, telling the guy to leave, and threatening to involve security\u2014could be seen as aggressive. While the flatmates are annoyed, the method of confrontation was confrontational and possibly overstepping. The guy being there is another aspect, but the author's actions might have escalated the situation. \n\nThe flatmates agreed with him afterward, but that doesn't necessarily justify the action. It's about respecting privacy. Even if others are annoyed, the solution shouldn't involve invading someone's privacy. There are other ways to address the issue, like setting boundaries through mutual agreement, using earplugs, or perhaps involving a mediator if security wasn't effective. \n\nSo, the author's actions violated the flatmate's privacy, used aggressive language, and potentially made the situation worse. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong. The answer should be A.\n"
