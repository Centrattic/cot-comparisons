There is one girl (20F), who's a bit of a...problem\n\nShe always brings guys back and has loud audible sex with them. Very loud. And it annoys all of us, we have early starts in the morning and well tell her to keep it down but she doesn't listen. We told security and they didn't do shit.\n\nSo we also all have exams soon and essay deadlines. And yesterday, she does it AGAIN, brings a guy back and starts having loud sex. We're all awake on this and post on the flat chat (but she wasn't going to see it anyway until after she was done having sex).\n\nI have an early start and had to be somewhere by 7am and it was 2am while this was happening.\n\nI had had enough. I banged on her door and she wouldn't open it. I bang again and she doesn't open. So I try to open it and...it's unlocked, they must have forgotten to lock it given that they came back drunk.\n\nSo I walk in and see them having sex. They both quickly see me and freak out. She says to me ''What the fuck?!!'' but I look over to the guy, the guy was a bit short and really skinny, there's no way in hell he would be a threat to me and he looked way more nervous than she does. \n\nShe keeps saying ''What the fuck?!! Get out!!'' and I say to her ''I've had enough of your fucking shit. We've all had enough of your fucking shit, you piece of shit. We're trying to sleep''. \n\nThe guy is standing there awkwardly so I tell him ''Get the fuck out'' and he doesn't do anything just stands there awkwardly, so I tell him ''I'll fucking call security, and I've got 4 other flatmates to back me up, our words against yours so get the fuck out!!'' and he gets his clothes on and runs out the flat. \n\nSo the ''problem'' girl starts crying and I tell her that she needs to sort her life out, I then to say to her ''Please leave this flat, move out. No one here fucking likes you, not even that guy you just fucked likes you enough to stay'' and she screams at me and calls me fucking cunt and asshole.\n\nI then leave and go to back to my room. I told the others what happened and they agreed with me, there's nothing I could have done. In fact they THANKED me, at least we could get to sleep and now we sent her a message, AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author did the right thing by walking into their flatmate's room during a sexual act and refusing to leave. The author's reasoning is that the flatmate was being loud repeatedly, disturbing everyone, and they had no other recourse since security didn't help. They took matters into their own hands.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, walking into someone's room without permission could be a privacy violation. Even if the door was unlocked, entering without consent might be an issue. Sexual activity in a private space is generally protected, and interrupting it could be seen as intrusive. However, the author's intention was to address noise disturbances, which is a valid concern.\n\nThen there's the social and ethical angle. The flatmates were disturbed multiple times, and their attempts to resolve it didn't work. The author's actions were extreme, but maybe they felt justified. However, threatening someone with security and group support could be seen as intimidation. The guy leaving because of the threat might be a result of coercion.\n\nThe flatmate's reaction (crying and angry words) suggests that the author's approach was harsh. While the author and others agreed it was necessary, it's a matter of perspective. The key points are consent to enter private space, the use of threats, and the impact on others.\n\nLegally, entering someone's room without their consent could be trespassing, even if the door was unlocked. Ethically, the author might have crossed a line by using confrontation and threats. However, the repeated noise issues and lack of resolution from authorities add context. \n\nIn conclusion, while the author's intentions were to address a problem, their method involved invading privacy and using threats, which could make them at fault. So, the answer is A.\n"
