There is one girl (20F), who's a bit of a...problem\n\nShe always brings guys back and has loud audible sex with them. Very loud. And it annoys all of us, we have early starts in the morning and well tell her to keep it down but she doesn't listen. We told security and they didn't do shit.\n\nSo we also all have exams soon and essay deadlines. And yesterday, she does it AGAIN, brings a guy back and starts having loud sex. We're all awake on this and post on the flat chat (but she wasn't going to see it anyway until after she was done having sex).\n\nI have an early start and had to be somewhere by 7am and it was 2am while this was happening.\n\nI had had enough. I banged on her door and she wouldn't open it. I bang again and she doesn't open. So I try to open it and...it's unlocked, they must have forgotten to lock it given that they came back drunk.\n\nSo I walk in and see them having sex. They both quickly see me and freak out. She says to me ''What the fuck?!!'' but I look over to the guy, the guy was a bit short and really skinny, there's no way in hell he would be a threat to me and he looked way more nervous than she does. \n\nShe keeps saying ''What the fuck?!! Get out!!'' and I say to her ''I've had enough of your fucking shit. We've all had enough of your fucking shit, you piece of shit. We're trying to sleep''. \n\nThe guy is standing there awkwardly so I tell him ''Get the fuck out'' and he doesn't do anything just stands there awkwardly, so I tell him ''I'll fucking call security, and I've got 4 other flatmates to back me up, our words against yours so get the fuck out!!'' and he gets his clothes on and runs out the flat. \n\nSo the ''problem'' girl starts crying and I tell her that she needs to sort her life out, I then to say to her ''Please leave this flat, move out. No one here fucking likes you, not even that guy you just fucked likes you enough to stay'' and she screams at me and calls me fucking cunt and asshole.\n\nI then leave and go to back to my room. I told the others what happened and they agreed with me, there's nothing I could have done. In fact they THANKED me, at least we could get to sleep and now we sent her a message, AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through the situation carefully. The author is 20M, lives in a flat with five others, including a 20F flatmate who brings guys back and has loud sex, even after being asked to keep it down. They tried talking to her and even contacted security, but nothing worked. Now, the author is stressed about exams and essays, and when the girl does it again at 2am, he bangs on the door, it's unlocked, he walks in, sees her in the act, confronts her, threatens to call security, and tells her to leave the flat. The others agreed with him and thanked him, but she was upset. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, let's break down the key points. The flatmate's behavior is a recurring issue. She's having loud sex multiple times, disturbing others even after being asked. The author and flatmates have tried non-confrontational methods like talking and contacting security, which failed. The author then takes a direct approach by entering her room at 2am, which is a private moment. He confronts her and a guy, who leaves after being threatened. The girl reacts angrily, calling him names. The author argues that it was necessary to stop the disturbance.\n\nNow, considering privacy and consent. Even if the flatmate is being loud, entering someone's room uninvited while they are having sex is a clear violation of privacy. Everyone, regardless of their behavior, has a right to privacy in their own room. The author didn't check if they were expecting someone or if it was an appropriate time to enter. The fact that he walked in without knocking properly or giving them a chance to stop suggests he acted impulsively.\n\nThen there's the confrontation. He used aggressive language, called the girl a \"piece of shit,\" threatened the guy with security and the other flatmates. Even if the others supported him, his actions were confrontational and could be considered harassment. The guy was made to leave under threat, which might be a form of intimidation. The author's refusal to leave after being asked is problematic. The girl had the right to tell him to leave her room, and he continued to stay and escalate the situation.\n\nThe flatmates' support doesn't negate the fact that his actions were inappropriate. Just because others are annoyed doesn't justify a violation of privacy. There are other ways to handle disturbances, like using earplugs, setting a curfew, or finding a mutual agreement. Confronting them in such a manner could lead to legal issues or a hostile living environment. The author's response was extreme and could be seen as an overreaction, even if the noise was a legitimate problem. The use of threats and aggressive language is not a constructive solution. So, the author is in the wrong here.\n"
