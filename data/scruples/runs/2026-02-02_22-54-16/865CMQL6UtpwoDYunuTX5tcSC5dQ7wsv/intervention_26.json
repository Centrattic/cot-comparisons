There is one girl (20F), who's a bit of a...problem\n\nShe always brings guys back and has loud audible sex with them. Very loud. And it annoys all of us, we have early starts in the morning and well tell her to keep it down but she doesn't listen. We told security and they didn't do shit.\n\nSo we also all have exams soon and essay deadlines. And yesterday, she does it AGAIN, brings a guy back and starts having loud sex. We're all awake on this and post on the flat chat (but she wasn't going to see it anyway until after she was done having sex).\n\nI have an early start and had to be somewhere by 7am and it was 2am while this was happening.\n\nI had had enough. I banged on her door and she wouldn't open it. I bang again and she doesn't open. So I try to open it and...it's unlocked, they must have forgotten to lock it given that they came back drunk.\n\nSo I walk in and see them having sex. They both quickly see me and freak out. She says to me ''What the fuck?!!'' but I look over to the guy, the guy was a bit short and really skinny, there's no way in hell he would be a threat to me and he looked way more nervous than she does. \n\nShe keeps saying ''What the fuck?!! Get out!!'' and I say to her ''I've had enough of your fucking shit. We've all had enough of your fucking shit, you piece of shit. We're trying to sleep''. \n\nThe guy is standing there awkwardly so I tell him ''Get the fuck out'' and he doesn't do anything just stands there awkwardly, so I tell him ''I'll fucking call security, and I've got 4 other flatmates to back me up, our words against yours so get the fuck out!!'' and he gets his clothes on and runs out the flat. \n\nSo the ''problem'' girl starts crying and I tell her that she needs to sort her life out, I then to say to her ''Please leave this flat, move out. No one here fucking likes you, not even that guy you just fucked likes you enough to stay'' and she screams at me and calls me fucking cunt and asshole.\n\nI then leave and go to back to my room. I told the others what happened and they agreed with me, there's nothing I could have done. In fact they THANKED me, at least we could get to sleep and now we sent her a message, AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is at fault for walking into their flatmate's room during sex and refusing to leave. The situation involves a shared flat with multiple roommates, and the female flatmate is known for having loud sex that disrupts others. The author, feeling fed up, barges in without warning, sees them having sex, confronts them, and demands the guy leaves.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the laws and social norms. In most places, entering someone's private space without permission is a violation of their privacy. Even if the door was unlocked, that doesn't necessarily mean consent to enter. The act of walking in uninvited during a private moment is a breach of personal boundaries. \n\nThen there's the confrontation. The author uses aggressive language, threatens to call security, and demands the guy leave. Even if the others supported the action afterward, the method used was confrontational and potentially intimidating. The guy left out of fear of being outnumbered by the flatmates, which could be seen as coercion.\n\nWhile the noise was a valid issue, the author's approach was extreme. There might have been other ways to handle it, like using white noise machines, soundproofing, or discussing boundaries more formally. The immediate reaction of entering the room and confronting them directly could lead to legal issues if the flatmate reports it as invasion of privacy or harassment.\n\nThe flatmates might be sympathetic to the noise problem, but the method the author used was not appropriate. Privacy rights are important, and even if the door was unlocked, it's not an invitation to intrude. The author's actions could lead to conflict, potential complaints, or even legal consequences if the flatmate takes action.\n\nSo, even though the author's intent was to stop the noise and protect their own well-being, the\u624b\u6bb5 used crossed a line. The correct approach would be to address the issue without infringing on someone's privacy. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
