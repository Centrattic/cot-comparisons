      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The father was shopping with his infant daughter and needed to change her diaper. He first went to the men's room, which didn't have a changing station. Then he asked a store worker, who said there were no other bathrooms with one and suggested another store nearby. Since he couldn't wait, he went to the women's restroom and started changing the diaper. A woman entered, freaked out, and called the manager. He was allowed to finish but then escorted out by security for store policy reasons. He's wondering if he's the asshole here.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether using the women's bathroom to change a baby's diaper is acceptable. Legally, in the US, Title VII and other laws might require access, but store policies can vary. Some stores might have policies that only allow diaper changes in designated areas, which might not be in the men's room. However, there's a growing trend to have gender-neutral changing stations to accommodate parents of any gender. \n\nThe father had a legitimate need to change his baby, and the store might not have provided adequate facilities. On the other hand, entering the opposite gender's restroom could be seen as a privacy violation, especially if the store's policy prohibits it. But if the store didn't have any changing stations in the men's room, it's the store's fault for not providing adequate facilities. \n\nFrom a public opinion angle, many would side with the father since he's taking care of his child and the store didn't have the necessary facilities. However, the store might have had a policy in place that he violated, regardless of intent. The key here is whether the store's policy explicitly allows or prohibits such actions. If the policy is clear, then the father might have been at fault. But if the store's policies are lacking, the fault could be on the store.\n\nHowever, since the user is asking if the author is in the wrong, the answer depends on the situation. The father did use the wrong restroom, which could be against store policy, even if his intention was to care for his child. So, the answer might be A (he's in the wrong) because he violated the store's policy, but there's also a counterargument that the store should have better facilities. However, legally, the store might have grounds to enforce their policy regardless of intent. So, the answer is A.\n"
