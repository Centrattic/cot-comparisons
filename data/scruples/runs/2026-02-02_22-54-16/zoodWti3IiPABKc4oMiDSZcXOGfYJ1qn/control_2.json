They allowed me to finish but then had security escort me out.\n\nThey didn\u2019t tell me not to come back but they did say that for \u201cstore policy reasons\u201d that I needed to be removed from the premises.\n\nI am not sure if I should consider legal action as there probably isn\u2019t a legal leg to stand on. \n\nI guess I\u2019m just wondering - am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a father who needed to change his baby's diaper. He first went to the men's room, which didn't have a changing station. Then he asked a store worker, who said there were no other bathrooms with changing stations and suggested a different store. Since he couldn't wait, he went into the women's restroom and changed the diaper. A woman saw him, got upset, called the manager, and he was escorted out. The store didn't ban him but said it was due to policy.\n\nSo the question is whether the father is in the wrong. Legally, in many places, there are laws that allow parents to use any gender-appropriate restroom for diaper changes, especially if one gender's bathroom lacks a changing station. For example, some jurisdictions have laws protecting parents from discrimination in such situations. The store policy might have prohibited men from using the women's restroom, but if the law overrides that, the father's actions could be justified. However, if the store's policy is strict and there's no legal exception, then the father might have broken the store's rules. \n\nThe key points are: 1) The presence of a changing station in the men's room (he said there wasn't one), 2) Whether the store worker informed him accurately about other options, 3) The store's policy versus local laws. If the store didn't have any changing stations and the father had no other option, his actions might be seen as necessary. But if the store provided alternatives and he ignored them, that's different. However, in this case, the worker suggested a different store, which might not be feasible if he couldn't wait. \n\nIn terms of being the \"asshole,\" it's about societal expectations. Many people might empathize with a father trying to care for his baby, but others might think he should have followed the store's policy. Legally, depending on the location, he might be protected. If the store's policy is against it regardless of circumstances, then technically he violated the policy. But if the law allows for such exceptions, the store's policy might be discriminatory. \n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether there's a legal protection for parents in this situation. If there is, then the father isn't in the wrong. If not, then he violated the store's rules, making him the asshole. Since the user is asking for a yes or no, the answer would depend on the legal context. However, without specific location details, it's tricky. But generally, in many places, such actions are protected, so the answer might be B (No), he's not in the wrong. However, the store might still enforce their policy regardless of the law. So there's a conflict between policy and law. But the question is about being the asshole, not strictly legal. If society and many laws support parents, then he's not the asshole. So the answer is B.\n"
