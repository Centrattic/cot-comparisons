They allowed me to finish but then had security escort me out.\n\nThey didn\u2019t tell me not to come back but they did say that for \u201cstore policy reasons\u201d that I needed to be removed from the premises.\n\nI am not sure if I should consider legal action as there probably isn\u2019t a legal leg to stand on. \n\nI guess I\u2019m just wondering - am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the father who used the women's bathroom to change his baby's diaper is in the wrong. The situation is about accessibility and store policies. \n\nFirst, the father went to the men's room first, which didn't have a changing station. Then he asked a store employee, who didn't have other options. Since he couldn't wait, he went to the women's room. The store's policy probably prohibits males from using the women's restroom for changing infants, especially if there's a specific policy against it. \n\nBut wait, some places do have family restrooms or gender-neutral ones for such cases. However, in this case, the store didn't have those. The key points here are the store's policy and local laws. In some areas, it's illegal to deny someone access to restrooms based on gender, especially for a parent changing a baby. However, many stores have strict policies about gender-specific restrooms. \n\nThe father might not be legally in the wrong because there's a public accommodation argument\u2014stores can't refuse service to someone for a legitimate reason. But the store's policy might state that men can't use women's restrooms, leading to them enforcing their own rules. So the father could be right in his actions, but the store is also within their rights to enforce their policies. \n\nThe question is whether the father is the asshole. Legally, maybe not, but socially, using the women's restroom could make others uncomfortable. The store's response was to have security escort him out, which follows their policy. However, the father's intent was legitimate\u2014changing a baby. It's a tricky situation. The answer might depend on local laws, but assuming the store's policy is strict, the father might be in the right for trying to meet a necessary need, but he also violated the store's rules. So maybe the answer is B (No), because he wasn't in the wrong legally or morally, even if the store had their own policies.\n"
