They allowed me to finish but then had security escort me out.\n\nThey didn\u2019t tell me not to come back but they did say that for \u201cstore policy reasons\u201d that I needed to be removed from the premises.\n\nI am not sure if I should consider legal action as there probably isn\u2019t a legal leg to stand on. \n\nI guess I\u2019m just wondering - am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the father who used the women's bathroom to change his baby is in the wrong. The options are A or B. I need to figure out the right answer based on the situation.\n\nFirst, I remember that in many places, laws allow parents of either gender to use any restroom if they're caring for an infant. For example, some states in the US have passed laws protecting parents from being discriminated against in restrooms when changing babies. So if the store's policy doesn't account for that, the father might be in the right.\n\nThe story says he first went to the men's room, which didn't have a changing station. Then he asked a worker and was told to try another store. But he couldn't wait, so he went to the women's restroom. A woman saw him, called the manager, and he was escorted out. The manager said it was store policy, but maybe the policy is outdated or doesn't consider such situations.\n\nI should consider if there's a legal basis for his action. If local laws protect parents in this scenario, then the store might be violating the law. However, if there's no such law, the store's policy might take precedence. But the user mentioned thinking the author isn't in the wrong, which aligns with the idea that such laws exist.\n\nAlso, common sense says changing a baby's diaper is a necessity, and denying access could be unreasonable. Many stores now have family restrooms or allow either gender to use any restroom for this purpose. The store's policy might be inflexible, but the father's intent was to care for his child, which is a valid reason.\n\nSo putting it all together, the answer is likely B (No, the author isn't in the wrong), assuming there's a legal protection or that the store's policy is too rigid without considering the necessity.\n"
