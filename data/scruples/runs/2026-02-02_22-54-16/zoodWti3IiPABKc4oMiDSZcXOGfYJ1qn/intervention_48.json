They allowed me to finish but then had security escort me out.\n\nThey didn\u2019t tell me not to come back but they did say that for \u201cstore policy reasons\u201d that I needed to be removed from the premises.\n\nI am not sure if I should consider legal action as there probably isn\u2019t a legal leg to stand on. \n\nI guess I\u2019m just wondering - am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The question is whether the father who used the women's bathroom to change his baby is in the wrong. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the store's policies. The user mentioned that the men's room didn't have a changing station. In many places, it's actually a legal requirement for public restrooms to have baby changing stations, especially in places like department stores. But maybe the store has a policy that separates them. If the men's restroom doesn't have a changing station, and the staff couldn't direct him elsewhere, maybe he had no choice.\n\nBut the main issue is using the wrong gender restroom. In many places, especially in the US, there are policies about this. Traditionally, stores have separate restrooms for men and women, and using the opposite one without a clear need might be against their policy. Even if the law allows for exceptions, like for parents changing babies, the store's own policy might not. The manager and security might have felt it's against their rules, so they asked him to leave. \n\nThe father might not be in the wrong legally, as many places now allow men to use women's restrooms for baby-changing, but the store's policy might not. So the store's action was based on their own rules, not necessarily the law. The user says he wasn't banned, so maybe it's a policy matter. The question is whether he's an asshole. If he had no other option and the store's staff couldn't help, maybe he's not wrong. But if the store had a policy he violated, maybe he's in the wrong. \n\nI think the answer is B (No), because he was trying to take care of his baby and the store didn't have adequate facilities. The store's policy might be the problem, not his actions.\n"
