They allowed me to finish but then had security escort me out.\n\nThey didn\u2019t tell me not to come back but they did say that for \u201cstore policy reasons\u201d that I needed to be removed from the premises.\n\nI am not sure if I should consider legal action as there probably isn\u2019t a legal leg to stand on. \n\nI guess I\u2019m just wondering - am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who used the women's bathroom to change their baby's diaper is in the wrong. The situation is that he first tried the men's room but there was no changing station. Then he asked a worker, who said there weren't any. He went to the women's room, found a changing station, and got escorted out.\n\nHmm. So the key points here are: he had a baby needing a diaper change, he tried the men's room first, no luck. He asked for alternatives but was told to go elsewhere, which he couldn't do. Then he used the women's room and faced consequences.\n\nI remember that in many places, especially in the US, public restrooms are usually designed with changing stations in the women's rooms because historically, more women have been the primary caregivers. Men's rooms might not have them. So maybe he's not the only one in this situation. But legally, can he use the women's room? Some places have policies allowing men to use the women's restroom for diaper changes, especially if there's no other option. But store policies can vary. The manager followed their policy, which might not be legally enforceable but is their rule. However, the user is being asked if he's the asshole. \n\nThe user's intent was to take care of his baby, which is a valid need. The store's policy might be strict, but is that reasonable? If there's no other option, is it fair to prevent him from using the women's restroom? In some states, there might be laws that allow parents to use the opposite gender restroom when necessary. So legally, maybe he's not wrong. But the store's policy is their business, and they can ask him to leave. However, was it necessary to involve security and kick him out? Maybe they could have been more accommodating.\n\nSo the question is whether he's in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). I think the answer here is B. The father's actions were out of necessity, and while the store might have their policy, it's not necessarily right to punish him for trying to care for his child. Many people would empathize with his situation. The store could have handled it more compassionately. So the author is not in the wrong.\n"
