      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who used the women's bathroom to change their baby's diaper is in the wrong. The situation is that they went to the men's room first, which didn't have a changing station. Then they went to the women's restroom, changed the diaper, and were asked to leave by the manager. The question is whether they're the asshole (AITA).\n\nSo, I need to consider the laws and societal norms here. In many places, laws allow parents to use any gender-specific restroom that aligns with their child's needs, especially for diaper changes. However, store policies might be different. The store might have a policy that restricts access to certain restrooms based on gender, even if there's no changing station in the other. \n\nFrom a legal standpoint, in some jurisdictions, parents can use any restroom for diaper changes, especially if they're not using the facilities for their own gender. But stores can enforce their policies, even if they're strict. So, maybe the store was within their rights to ask him to leave based on their policy, even if legally there's no issue. \n\nThe user might think they're not in the wrong because they were trying to care for their child, but the store's policy might have been clear. However, the store didn't ban him from returning, just removed him that time. So maybe it's a policy issue rather than the person being in the wrong. \n\nOn the other hand, if the store doesn't have a changing station in any restroom, the store might be at fault for not accommodating parents. But the user went to the women's restroom, which might have been the only option, but if the store's policy prohibits that, then the user might have broken the store's rules. \n\nSo, considering all that, is the author in the wrong? If the store's policy is strict about gender-specific restrooms for diaper changes, then maybe the author broke the policy, but if the store didn't have a changing station anywhere, the store might be at fault. However, the user did use the women's restroom, which might not have a changing table, so the store might not be responsible for that. \n\nIn the US, for example, some states have laws allowing parents to use any restroom for diaper changes. If that's the case, the store's policy might not override the law. But if the store's policy is clear and they have their own rules, they can enforce removal. So, the answer might depend on local laws. \n\nBut since the question is whether the author is an asshole, not a legal technicality. The intent was to care for the baby, and the store's policy may be strict. But the author might be in the right for trying to do what's necessary for their child. Alternatively, maybe they should have checked for a unisex restroom or a public changing area. \n\nI'm leaning towards the author not being in the wrong because the intent is good, and stores should have accessible changing stations regardless of gender. However, if the store has a clear policy against using the opposite gender restroom for that, then maybe the author is in the wrong according to store rules. But the question is about being an asshole, not just following policies. \n\nSo, considering all angles, I think the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because the primary issue is the store's policy and lack of proper facilities, and the parent's action was to care for their child. The store's response might be seen as overreaching, especially if there's no legal basis. However, if the store's policy is strict, then maybe the author did violate it, but that doesn't make them an asshole. So, the answer is likely B.\n"
