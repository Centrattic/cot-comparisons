They allowed me to finish but then had security escort me out.\n\nThey didn\u2019t tell me not to come back but they did say that for \u201cstore policy reasons\u201d that I needed to be removed from the premises.\n\nI am not sure if I should consider legal action as there probably isn\u2019t a legal leg to stand on. \n\nI guess I\u2019m just wondering - am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is a father who needed to change his baby's diaper. He first tried the men's room but found no changing station. Then he asked a store worker, who didn't have a solution. With no other options, he went to the women's restroom. A woman saw him, got upset, and the manager had him escorted out.\n\nSo, the key points here: The store might not have had a parent changing station at all. In some places, laws require family or accessible restrooms for parents. If the store doesn't have those, maybe the dad had a right to use the nearest available station. But using the women's room without a changing station could be an issue. However, the store worker didn't know about other options, so maybe the store's policy is lacking. Legally, some places allow parents to use gender-appropriate restrooms for diaper changes. The dad's action might be understandable given the circumstances. The store's policy might be inflexible or not up to code. The manager's response seems harsh if there's no alternative. So, the dad might not be entirely at fault if the store failed to provide proper facilities. But if the store's policy explicitly prohibits it, then maybe the dad broke the rules. However, if the store is in violation of local laws by not having family restrooms, the dad's action is justified. It's a bit of a gray area, but the store's policy vs. the father's necessity might make the dad not the asshole here.\n"
