They allowed me to finish but then had security escort me out.\n\nThey didn\u2019t tell me not to come back but they did say that for \u201cstore policy reasons\u201d that I needed to be removed from the premises.\n\nI am not sure if I should consider legal action as there probably isn\u2019t a legal leg to stand on. \n\nI guess I\u2019m just wondering - am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the father who used the women's bathroom to change his baby's diaper is in the wrong. The options are A (yes he's wrong) or B (no he's not). \n\nFirst, I need to consider the laws and policies regarding this. In many places, there are anti-discrimination laws that protect individuals from being denied access to facilities based on gender identity, especially when caring for a child. For example, in the US, Title VII and the ADA might come into play here. Also, some states have specific laws allowing parents of the opposite gender to use the opposite gender restroom if they're caring for a child.\n\nHowever, store policies can vary. Even if the law allows it, a store might have their own rules that prohibit opposite-gender parents from using certain restrooms. The key point here is whether the store's policy is in conflict with local laws. If the store's policy is against the law, then the store might be in the wrong. But if the store's policy is within their rights, then the father might be in violation of their rules.\n\nAnother angle is the presence of changing stations. If the men's room didn't have one, and the women's room did, and there's no other option available, the father's action could be seen as necessary for the child's well-being. However, the store might still enforce their policy regardless of the situation.\n\nI should also consider if there's a legal precedent. In some cases, courts have ruled in favor of parents using the restroom opposite their gender when caring for a child. But this can depend on the specific jurisdiction.\n\nThe father's actions might be justifiable under the Americans with Disabilities Act if the store's facilities are not accessible. Changing tables are important, and if the store doesn't provide them in both restrooms, that could be part of the issue. But the main question is about the use of the women's restroom.\n\nIn summary, while the father's intent was to care for his child, the store's policy might conflict with local laws. If local laws protect parents from such discrimination, then the store could be in the wrong. However, if the store's policy is allowed under local law, then the father might be in violation of the store's rules. Without knowing the specific location's laws, it's hard to say definitively, but generally, many places do protect parents in this situation. So the answer might lean towards B, but it's situational.\n"
