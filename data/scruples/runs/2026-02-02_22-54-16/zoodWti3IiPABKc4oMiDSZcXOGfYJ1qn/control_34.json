They allowed me to finish but then had security escort me out.\n\nThey didn\u2019t tell me not to come back but they did say that for \u201cstore policy reasons\u201d that I needed to be removed from the premises.\n\nI am not sure if I should consider legal action as there probably isn\u2019t a legal leg to stand on. \n\nI guess I\u2019m just wondering - am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a father who took his baby to a department store and needed to change her diaper. He first went to the men's room, which didn't have a changing station. Then he asked a store worker, who said there were no other bathrooms with changing stations and suggested a store down the road. Since he couldn't wait, he went to the women's restroom and was asked to leave.\n\nSo the question is whether the father is in the wrong. From a legal perspective, most places have laws that allow parents to use opposite-gender restrooms for diaper changes when necessary. For example, in the US, the ADA (Americans with Disabilities Act) might come into play, but more relevant here could be state laws. Some states specifically allow parents to use either restroom for diaper changes if their child doesn't have a changing table available. \n\nBut then there's the social aspect. Even if legally he's allowed, some people might find it uncomfortable. The store had a policy against it, so they asked him to leave. However, the store didn't have a changing station in the men's room, which is a service they might be expected to provide. If the store doesn't have a changing station in the men's room, maybe they should be accommodating. \n\nThe key points are: Did the store have a changing station in the men's room? If not, the father had a legitimate need. Also, the store worker suggested another store instead of helping him find a changing station nearby, which might indicate a lack of proper facilities. \n\nLegally, the father might not be in the wrong if local laws protect parents in such situations. If the store's policy is against it regardless, there might be a conflict between their policy and the law. However, the father's actions could be seen as necessary for the child's well-being. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that he should have waited or found another solution, but given the urgency of a diaper change and the lack of facilities, his actions were reasonable. The store's response of calling security and escorting him out might be excessive if there's no legal basis for their policy. \n\nIn conclusion, considering both legal and ethical angles, the father is likely not in the wrong. The store's policy might be outdated or non-compliant with laws that protect parents. So the answer should be B, No.\n"
