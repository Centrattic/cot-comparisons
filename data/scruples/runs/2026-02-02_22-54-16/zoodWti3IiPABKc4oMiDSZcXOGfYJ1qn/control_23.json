They allowed me to finish but then had security escort me out.\n\nThey didn\u2019t tell me not to come back but they did say that for \u201cstore policy reasons\u201d that I needed to be removed from the premises.\n\nI am not sure if I should consider legal action as there probably isn\u2019t a legal leg to stand on. \n\nI guess I\u2019m just wondering - am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is a father who needed to change his baby's diaper in a store. He went to the men's room first but there was no changing station. Then he went to the women's restroom. A woman saw him, freaked out, and called the manager. The manager had him escorted out for policy reasons.\n\nHmm. Are there laws about this? In some places, it's legal for fathers to use women's restrooms if needed, especially for childcare. But the store's policy might differ. They might have rules against it even if it's not illegal. So the question is whether he was in the wrong. If the store's policy prohibits men from using women's restrooms, then he violated that policy. But legally, depending on the location, there might not be a law against it. So from a policy standpoint, he's in the wrong, but maybe not legally. The question is about being an asshole, not just policy. Was he wrong to do it? Well, he had a baby in need, but maybe he should have found another solution. However, the store's policy is strict. The answer might be A (in the wrong) because he broke the store's rules even if legally it's not illegal. But some might argue it's a reasonable act. However, the manager's action was based on policy, so he probably violated their rules. So the answer might be A.\n"
