      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let's read the situation again. He's a father with an infant daughter, and he needed to change her diaper. First, he goes to the men's bathroom but there's no changing station. Then he asks a store worker, who says no other bathrooms have one and suggests a store down the road. But he couldn't wait, so he went into the women's restroom and changed the baby. A lady came in, saw him, freaked out, and called the manager. The manager let him finish but had security escort him out. The question is whether he's the asshole.\n\nHmm. Let's start by considering the laws and policies. In many places, there are laws about using the opposite gender's restroom, but when it comes to changing diapers, some states have exceptions. For example, I remember that in some U.S. states, it's allowed for parents to use the opposite gender restroom if they're changing a baby. The idea is that it's a necessity and not for the purpose of the restroom itself. But if the store has a policy that prohibits this, even if it's legal, they might enforce their own rules. \n\nThe user mentioned that the store didn't tell him not to come back, just that he had to be removed for policy reasons. So from a policy standpoint, the store might have a no exceptions rule, even if it's a common practice elsewhere. Legally, if the state allows it, then maybe the store can't enforce that policy to the point of banning him, but the store could still ask him to leave based on their rules. \n\nNow, considering the \"am I the asshole\" angle. The main issue is whether his actions were reasonable. He had a baby who needed a diaper change, and the men's room didn't have a changing station. The store employee didn't have any alternatives. So he went to the women's room. While the intention was good, using a single-stall bathroom meant for women could be seen as violating a social norm, even if it's a common practice. However, if the store's policy explicitly says no, then the manager might have to follow that. \n\nBut is it fair for the store to have such a policy? Some stores do have changing stations in both men's and women's rooms, but if the men's room is consistently without one, that's a problem. Still, the father's choice to use the women's room when the men's didn't have a facility might be considered necessary, especially since he had no other options. However, the way he did it\u2014just entering without asking or checking\u2014might be part of the issue. Maybe he should have tried to find an ADA-compliant changing station or a family restroom if available, but he said the worker told him there were none.\n\nAnother angle is the reaction of the lady and the manager. The lady freaked out, which suggests that it's not common or acceptable in that store. The manager's response was to have him escorted out, which seems strict but maybe not unreasonable given their policy. The father might not be legally in the wrong if the law allows it, but socially or according to store policy, he did do something wrong. The \"asshole\" part is about social judgment, not just legal. So even if it's not illegal, if the store's policy is clear and he violated it, maybe he's the asshole. But if the store's policy is not in line with common practices or laws, then the store might be at fault.\n\nI think the key here is whether the store's policy is legally enforceable. If the law in that area permits parents to use any restroom for diaper changes, then the store can't legally kick him out. But if the store's policy is more restrictive, they might be within their rights to ask him to leave. However, the father's action might still be considered reasonable. \n\nIn some places, like in the U.S., the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) requires that diaper changing facilities be available in restrooms for people with disabilities, including those who care for infants. So if the men's room didn't have one, the store might be non-compliant with ADA. But the father using the women's room could be seen as a workaround to that lack of compliance. \n\nSo, depending on the location and the specific laws, the father might not be in the wrong if the store is actually violating the law by not having changing stations in both restrooms. But if the store's policy doesn't allow it regardless of the situation, then he might be breaching their rules. However, from a social perspective, many people would understand the necessity of changing a baby, so the store's policy could be seen as overly strict or discriminatory. \n\nThe user says he's not sure about legal action but thinks there's probably no legal case. If the store's policy conflicts with local laws, maybe there is a case. But even if not, the social judgment (AITA) is about whether his actions were acceptable. The store employee didn't know about the changing stations, so the father might have acted in desperation. \n\nIn conclusion, if the store is violating the law by not having the necessary facilities, the father isn't the asshole. If the store's policy is just strict, then maybe he's not in the wrong because of the necessity. However, if the store's policy is within the law and he violated it, then he could be considered in the wrong. But given that the store didn't ban him and just removed him for policy reasons, perhaps the father isn't the asshole. So the answer is B, he is not in the wrong.\n"
