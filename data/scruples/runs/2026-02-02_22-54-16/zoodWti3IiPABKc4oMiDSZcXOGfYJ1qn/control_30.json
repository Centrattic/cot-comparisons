They allowed me to finish but then had security escort me out.\n\nThey didn\u2019t tell me not to come back but they did say that for \u201cstore policy reasons\u201d that I needed to be removed from the premises.\n\nI am not sure if I should consider legal action as there probably isn\u2019t a legal leg to stand on. \n\nI guess I\u2019m just wondering - am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the father who used the women's bathroom to change his baby's diaper was in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to consider the facts. He went to the men's room first, which didn't have a changing station. Then he asked a worker, who said there were no other bathrooms with changing stations. Since he couldn't wait, he went to the women's restroom. A woman saw him, got upset, called the manager, and he was escorted out for policy reasons.\n\nNow, laws vary by location, but generally, in many places, fathers are allowed to use women's restrooms for the purpose of changing a baby's diaper. Some laws or policies protect this to prevent discrimination and ensure parents have necessary facilities. For example, in some US states, it's illegal to deny access to restrooms for parents with infants. \n\nHowever, store policies might be different. The manager followed their policy, which might not align with legal standards. The key point here is whether the store's policy conflicts with local laws. If the law allows it, the store's policy might be in the wrong. If there's no law, then maybe the store's policy is valid, but some would argue it's discriminatory.\n\nThe father had no other option, and the baby needed immediate attention. Intentionally harming or being offensive doesn't seem to be his case. He was trying to care for his child. \n\nSo, legally, he might not be in the wrong. Ethically, most people would side with him wanting to care for his baby. But store policies can be strict. However, if the policy is against the law, then the store is in the wrong. \n\nBut the question is about the author being in the wrong. If the law supports him, then B (no). If not, A (yes). But considering that many places do support this, and the situation was an emergency, the answer is likely B. Also, the store allowed him to finish changing before removing him, which might indicate they knew there was an emergency.\n"
