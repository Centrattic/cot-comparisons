They allowed me to finish but then had security escort me out.\n\nThey didn\u2019t tell me not to come back but they did say that for \u201cstore policy reasons\u201d that I needed to be removed from the premises.\n\nI am not sure if I should consider legal action as there probably isn\u2019t a legal leg to stand on. \n\nI guess I\u2019m just wondering - am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this AITA post is in the wrong for using the women's bathroom to change their baby's diaper. The situation is that the father went to the men's room first, found no changing station, asked a store worker and was told no other bathrooms had one. He then used the women's restroom, got into a confrontation, and was escorted out.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. In many places, laws about bathroom access for parents with infants might be more flexible. For example, some states in the US have laws that allow parents to use any gender-neutral bathroom if it has a diaper-changing station. But if the store's policy strictly prohibits men from using the women's bathroom, even for changing diapers, then legally the father might have broken that policy. However, public policy and common sense might clash here. The baby's immediate need is critical, and denying access could be seen as inhumane. \n\nNext, the ethical angle. The father was trying to take care of his child's essential needs. Infants can't wait, so the urgency is there. But the woman who saw him was uncomfortable, which is a valid concern. It's a balance between the necessity of the action and the respect for others' comfort. \n\nI should check if there are any relevant laws. For instance, the ADA (Americans with Disabilities Act) might have some provisions regarding accessibility for parents. Also, some stores might have family restrooms or single-stall facilities. The key point is whether the store allowed diaper-changing stations in the women's restroom and if the father was aware of that. If the store had family restrooms but the worker didn't direct him there, that's a different scenario. \n\nThe store worker directed him to the women's restroom, but maybe that's not the right approach. Legally, stores can enforce their own policies, even if they're strict. However, some jurisdictions have laws that require diaper-changing facilities for parents, regardless of gender. If the store's policy is against it, but local law allows it, the father could be in the right. \n\nThe father did ask first, which is a good step. The worker might have been unaware of the policy or didn't know where the changing stations were. The confrontation happened because someone else was present, so the woman's reaction is about privacy and personal space. Even if the law allows it, social norms might make this a sensitive issue. \n\nSo, the answer hinges on the specific store's policy and local laws. If the store's policy is clear and the father violated it despite the need, he might be in the wrong. But if the law permits it and the store's policy is outdated or not in line with legal requirements, then he's not in the wrong. Also, the intent is to care for the child, which is a noble cause, but the method might be contentious. \n\nThe user says there probably isn't a legal leg to stand on, implying that the store's policy might not hold up legally. In that case, the father isn't in the wrong. But if the store's policy is legally enforceable, then maybe he is. However, considering that the baby needed a change immediately and the worker didn't have a solution, using the women's bathroom could be justified. \n\nIn summary, the father's actions were driven by necessity and he did try to follow proper procedures by asking, but the store's policy might not have been in line with legal requirements regarding parental access. Therefore, he's likely not in the wrong.\n"
