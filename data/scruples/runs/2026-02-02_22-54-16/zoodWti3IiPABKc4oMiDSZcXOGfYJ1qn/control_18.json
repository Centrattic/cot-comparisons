They allowed me to finish but then had security escort me out.\n\nThey didn\u2019t tell me not to come back but they did say that for \u201cstore policy reasons\u201d that I needed to be removed from the premises.\n\nI am not sure if I should consider legal action as there probably isn\u2019t a legal leg to stand on. \n\nI guess I\u2019m just wondering - am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the father is in the wrong for using the women's bathroom to change his baby's diaper. So, the situation is he went to the men's room first, found no changing station. Then asked a store worker, who said there's none. He couldn't wait, so he went to the women's restroom. A lady saw him, freaked out, called the manager. They let him finish but had security escort him out. He's wondering if he's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the laws and policies around public restrooms. In many places, especially in the US, it's legal for parents to use either restroom if there's no gender-specific policy. Some states have laws allowing parents to use the opposite gender restroom when necessary for changing diapers. But stores might have their own policies. If the store's policy strictly prohibits it, then the father might be violating that.\n\nHowever, stores can't typically charge you with a crime unless there's a specific law being broken. The manager could ask him to leave for policy reasons, but that doesn't mean the father is legally at fault. The question is about whether he's in the wrong morally or legally. \n\nFrom a public opinion angle, some people might argue that the father was just trying to do what's necessary for his baby, and it's unreasonable to expect him to find a changing station. Others might say he should have found another solution, like using a restroom with a changing station or bringing a portable one. But in terms of legal responsibility, if there's no law against it, maybe he's not in the wrong.\n\nBut the store's policy is their own rule, so if they said he violated it, they can enforce it. However, unless there's a criminal law being broken, maybe it's a civil issue. The user is asking if he's the asshole, so more about social morality. Some might see him as reasonable, others as inconsiderate. The answer depends on the context of local laws and societal norms.\n"
