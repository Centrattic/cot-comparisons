      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the father who used the women's bathroom to change his baby's diaper is in the wrong. The situation is presented as an \"Am I the asshole?\" (AITA) scenario.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the facts. The father went to the men's room first, which didn't have a changing station. He asked a store worker and was told there weren't any other changing stations, maybe to go to another store. Since he couldn't wait, he went to the women's restroom. A woman came in, saw him, got upset, and called the manager. The manager had him escorted out but didn't ban him. The question is whether he's at fault.\n\nLegally, I know that in many places, public restrooms are required to have changing stations. But sometimes only the women's rooms have them because historically, more women were expected to care for babies. However, that doesn't mean it's right for a man to use the women's room if there's no changing station. But maybe the law allows it because it's for a baby's care.\n\nAnother angle is store policy. Even if there's no legal requirement, stores might have their own rules. If the men's room doesn't have a changing station, the store might not be in violation, but they should have a station in the women's room. So if the father used the women's room because that's where the station is, maybe that's expected. But using it without a changing station might be considered a policy violation.\n\nAlso, the response from the store: they escorted him out but didn't press charges. The manager said it was store policy. So if the store's policy prohibits men from using women's rooms, even for diaper changes, then he violated that policy. But if the store is required to have changing stations and only has them in women's rooms, then the store might be at fault for not providing a facility for men.\n\nIn terms of social norms, some people might be upset by a man using the women's room, even for a baby. Others might empathize with the need to care for the child. However, the store's policy is probably strict on this, even if the reasoning is outdated.\n\nLegally, in some jurisdictions, it's permissible for fathers to use women's restrooms with infants, especially if there's no alternative. But store policies can vary. The father might have a point if the store didn't provide a changing station in the men's room. But if the store's policy explicitly prohibits men from using the women's room regardless of the need, then the father might be in the wrong according to that policy.\n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the store's policy or local laws support his action. If the store had no changing stations except in the women's room, maybe the store is partially at fault. But since he went into the women's room without permission, the store's response might be justified under their policy. Therefore, the father might be at fault for violating store policy, even if the store's setup is problematic.\n"
