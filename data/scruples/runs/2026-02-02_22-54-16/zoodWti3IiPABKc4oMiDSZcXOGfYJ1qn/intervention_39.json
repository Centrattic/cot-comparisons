      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation again.\n\nThe user is a father who was shopping with his infant daughter and needed to change her diaper. He first went to the men's restroom, which didn't have a changing station. He asked a store worker, who said there were no other bathrooms with one and suggested a store down the road. Since he couldn't wait, he went into the women's restroom and changed the baby. A woman came in, freaked out, and called the manager. The manager let him finish but had security escort him out. The store didn't ban him but said it was their policy. The user is wondering if he's the asshole and if he's in the wrong legally.\n\nFirst, I should check the laws regarding this. In many places, laws require that parents have access to diaper-changing facilities. Some states have laws allowing parents to use any restroom with a child in need. For example, in the U.S., some states have \"Safe Access to Public Restrooms Act\" which permits parents or caregivers of children under 8 to use either gender's restroom if needed. However, it varies by location.\n\nThe store's policy is another angle. Even if the law allows it, the store might have their own rules. If the store's policy explicitly prohibits using the wrong restroom, the father might be violating their rules regardless of local laws. The manager's response was based on policy, so that's a store-level issue.\n\nThe key points here are: 1) Legal rights of the father in that jurisdiction, 2) Store's specific policies. If the father's actions are legally protected, then the store's policy might be in conflict with the law. However, if the store's policy is strict and there's no legal requirement to allow it, then the father might have violated the store's rules, even if it's understandable.\n\nThe user mentions possibly no legal leg to stand on, so maybe he's aware that the store's policy might be stricter. The question is whether he's in the wrong. If the law allows it, he's not in the wrong. If the law doesn't, then maybe he is. But without knowing the specific location, it's hard. But the general Reddit AITA context often assumes U.S. laws, and some U.S. states do have those laws.\n\nSo, in the absence of specific information, the answer might lean towards the user not being in the wrong if the law supports it. But if the store's policy is strict and there's no legal requirement, then he's at least in the wrong per the store's rules, which led to his removal. But the question is about being in the wrong ethically or legally. The user's main question is if he's the asshole, which is more about social judgment. From a social perspective, many would side with the father since it's a baby in need, and some places have laws protecting that. However, others might argue that he should have waited or found another solution.\n\nBut the user's own thought is that he's not in the wrong. Considering all factors, I think the answer is B (No), as the father's actions were out of necessity and possibly legally protected, depending on location, so he's not in the wrong.\n"
