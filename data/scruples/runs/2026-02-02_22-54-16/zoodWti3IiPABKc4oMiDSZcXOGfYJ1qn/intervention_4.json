They allowed me to finish but then had security escort me out.\n\nThey didn\u2019t tell me not to come back but they did say that for \u201cstore policy reasons\u201d that I needed to be removed from the premises.\n\nI am not sure if I should consider legal action as there probably isn\u2019t a legal leg to stand on. \n\nI guess I\u2019m just wondering - am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a father who needed to change his baby's diaper. He first went to the men's room, which didn't have a changing station. He asked a store employee, who said there were no other bathrooms with changing stations nearby. Then he went to the women's restroom to change the diaper. A woman saw him and called the manager, leading to being escorted out.\n\nFirst, the legal aspect. In many places, it's legal for parents to use either gender's bathroom when changing a baby, especially if the other doesn't have a changing station. However, store policies might vary. The store's policy could require using only the designated bathroom for diaper changes. If the men's room didn't have a changing table, maybe the store's policy is that women's is the only one. But the employee didn't direct him properly? He was told to try another store, but he couldn't wait. \n\nThe father's intention was to take care of his child, which is a reasonable need. But the store's policy might prioritize preventing any potential discomfort or complaints from other customers. Even if legally he's okay, the store can enforce their policy, leading to being asked to leave. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? If the store's policy explicitly states that only women can use the women's bathroom for diaper changes (even if men aren't allowed), then he violated that policy. However, if there's no such policy and employees didn't direct him properly, the store might be at fault. But the store employee did tell him there were no changing stations, so maybe the father had no choice. \n\nThe key here is whether the store had a policy that men can't use the women's bathroom for this purpose. If they didn't have a clear policy, the father might not be wrong. However, the store can enforce their policy regardless of legality. So, the answer depends on local laws and store policies. But since the user is asking if he's the asshole, the store might be strict, but the father's action was out of necessity. So maybe he's not the asshole, but maybe he did violate the store's policy. The answer might be B (not in the wrong), but the store's policy enforcement is their right. Hmm.\n"
