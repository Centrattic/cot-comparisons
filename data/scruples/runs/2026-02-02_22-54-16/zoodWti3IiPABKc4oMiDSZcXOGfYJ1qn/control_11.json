They allowed me to finish but then had security escort me out.\n\nThey didn\u2019t tell me not to come back but they did say that for \u201cstore policy reasons\u201d that I needed to be removed from the premises.\n\nI am not sure if I should consider legal action as there probably isn\u2019t a legal leg to stand on. \n\nI guess I\u2019m just wondering - am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the father is the asshole (AITA) for using the women's bathroom to change his baby's diaper when the men's room didn't have a changing station. He asked a store worker, who said there were none available and suggested another store. Since he couldn't wait, he went into the women's restroom, got escorted out by security, and now he's wondering if he was wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if he violated any rules or social norms. Most stores, especially in many countries, have women's restrooms with baby-changing facilities. The men's restroom typically doesn't have them. However, using a women's restroom as a male adult, even with a baby, might be against store policy. Even if there's no legal obligation for stores to have changing stations in men's rooms (which varies by location), the store might have specific policies against men using women's restrooms, regardless of the reason.\n\nSo, he was in a situation where he needed to change his daughter, but the men's room didn't have the facility. He tried to follow the store worker's suggestion but couldn't. However, entering the women's restroom as a male, even for a baby change, is likely to be seen as a breach of policy. The store's reaction was to have him removed, which suggests their policy is strict. Legally, in some places, parents might be allowed to use the opposite gender restroom for diaper changes, but it's more about social norms and store policies here. \n\nThe key points are: Did he have a legitimate right to use the women's restroom? Or did he violate a policy? Since the store had a policy and he was asked to leave, he probably violated it. Even if his intention was good, the action went against the store's rules, leading to the incident. So, the answer would be A, he's in the wrong. But I need to check if there are any legal precedents where parents can use any restroom for diaper changes. However, the user mentioned there's probably no legal leg to stand on, so the store's policy is the main issue here. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
