They allowed me to finish but then had security escort me out.\n\nThey didn\u2019t tell me not to come back but they did say that for \u201cstore policy reasons\u201d that I needed to be removed from the premises.\n\nI am not sure if I should consider legal action as there probably isn\u2019t a legal leg to stand on. \n\nI guess I\u2019m just wondering - am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is a father who was trying to change his baby's diaper. He went to the men's room first, which didn't have a changing station. Then he went to the women's restroom because he needed to do it immediately. A woman saw him, got upset, and called the manager. The store had him removed for policy reasons.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the store's policy vs. the father's urgent need. In many places, laws require public restrooms to have baby-changing facilities, but often those are in the women's rooms because historically they're used more by mothers. However, some states or cities have laws allowing fathers to use women's restrooms for diaper changes without issue.\n\nThe store worker didn't know about other bathrooms, so the father had no option. Legally, in some areas, it's permissible for any parent to use the restroom where the changing station is. But the store's policy might prohibit non-female employees or customers from using the women's room, even for a diaper change. So the father might be violating the store's rules, even if the law doesn't strictly hold their policy. \n\nThe question is whether the father is in the wrong. If the store has a strict policy against it, then the father might be at fault for not following their guidelines. However, if the store's policy is discriminatory or not aligned with local laws, maybe not. But since the store acted on their policy, he might be considered in the wrong from their perspective. But from a legal standpoint, he might not be. The user is asking if he's the asshole, which is more about social judgment than legal.\n\nIn terms of social norms, some might see him as reasonable for taking care of his child, while others see him as violating privacy. The answer depends on local laws and policies. Since the store enforced their policy, he was removed, which suggests they considered him in violation. But legally, in some places, he's protected. The user is asking if he's the asshole, which is more about societal judgment. If the store's policy is outdated, maybe he's not. But the manager followed their policy, so he might be considered in the wrong by the store's standards. So maybe A (yes, in the wrong) based on the store's policy, but B (not in the wrong) if considering parental needs. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong, which depends on the context. Given that the store acted on their policy, perhaps the answer is A.\n"
