They allowed me to finish but then had security escort me out.\n\nThey didn\u2019t tell me not to come back but they did say that for \u201cstore policy reasons\u201d that I needed to be removed from the premises.\n\nI am not sure if I should consider legal action as there probably isn\u2019t a legal leg to stand on. \n\nI guess I\u2019m just wondering - am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a father who needed to change his baby's diaper. He first went to the men's restroom, which is common for men to use for that purpose. But there was no changing station. He asked a store worker and was told there might not be any other options nearby. Since he couldn't wait, he went into the women's restroom to change the diaper.\n\nNow, the key points here. In many public places, men's restrooms often have changing stations for male parents, but women's restrooms also have them. However, there might be a lack of awareness or communication about this. The father's action of entering the women's restroom without checking if there was a changing station there first could be an issue. But given that he was told there were no other options and needed to act quickly for his baby, that adds context.\n\nLegally, in some places, there are laws protecting parents who use any restroom available to care for their children. For example, in the US, some states have laws allowing parents to use any restroom if necessary. However, store policies might still enforce strict gender-specific rules regardless of the situation. The manager's decision to have him escorted out was based on policy, but that doesn't necessarily mean the father was in the wrong legally or morally.\n\nEthically, it's about balancing the need to care for a child versus respecting others' comfort. The mother who freaked out had a valid concern about privacy and safety, but the father's intent was to care for his baby. The store's policy might be inflexible, but it's possible that a more compassionate approach could have been taken, like allowing him to use a private area or guiding him to another location.\n\nSo, the author's actions were driven by necessity. He tried the men's room first, sought help, and only went to the women's when there were no other options. While the store enforced their policy, the father's intent was to provide for his child, which is a common parental responsibility. Therefore, he might not be in the wrong, especially if local laws support such actions. However, it's a nuanced situation where both sides have valid points, but the father's intent is more about child care than violating norms.\n"
