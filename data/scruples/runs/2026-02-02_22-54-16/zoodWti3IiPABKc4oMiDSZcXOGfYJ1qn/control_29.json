      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the father who used the women's bathroom to change his baby is the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. He had an infant daughter and needed to change her diaper. He checked the men's room but there was no changing station. He asked a store worker, who couldn't help. Then he went to the women's restroom. A woman saw him, freaked out, called the manager, and he was escorted out.\n\nNow, the key points here are about store policies and societal norms. Many stores have changing stations in both men's and women's restrooms. But some only have them in women's rooms. If the store in question had a policy that men aren't allowed in women's restrooms, even with infants, then technically he violated their policy. However, in many places, laws do allow men to use women's restrooms for diaper changes, especially if there's no other option. \n\nBut the store's policy might override that. If the store explicitly states that men can't use the women's restroom for any reason, then he's violating their rules. The manager followed their policy by removing him. Legally, it's tricky. Some places have laws permitting this, but if the store's policy prohibits it, they might still enforce their rules regardless. \n\nFrom a social perspective, while it's understandable he needed to change the diaper, entering a women's restroom without permission might make others uncomfortable. Even if he's a father, some people might find it inappropriate. So there's a social expectation here that might be against his action, even if legally he's in the right.\n\nSo, the answer depends on the store's specific policies and local laws. If the store's policy is clear and he violated it, then he's in the wrong. If the law protects his action, then the store might be overstepping. But generally, the store's policy is their right to enforce, so the father might be considered the asshole for not following their rules, even if his intent was good.\n"
