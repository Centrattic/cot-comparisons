They allowed me to finish but then had security escort me out.\n\nThey didn\u2019t tell me not to come back but they did say that for \u201cstore policy reasons\u201d that I needed to be removed from the premises.\n\nI am not sure if I should consider legal action as there probably isn\u2019t a legal leg to stand on. \n\nI guess I\u2019m just wondering - am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for using the women's bathroom to change their baby. The author is a father who couldn't find a changing station in the men's room and then went to the women's restroom. A woman saw him, freaked out, and called the manager. The store had him escorted out under their policy.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the laws regarding this. In many places, laws allow parents to use any restroom with a child in a diaper, especially if there's no changing station available. For example, in the US, some states have laws that permit parents to use the opposite gender's restroom if necessary. However, store policies might be stricter. Even if the law allows it, the store can have their own rules. So the store might have a policy against it regardless of legal standing.\n\nThe key point is whether using the women's restroom was necessary. The author had no changing station in the men's room and couldn't go to another store. Changing a baby's diaper in a restroom not designated for one's gender is a common dilemma. Legally, in some jurisdictions, the parent could be protected, but the store's policy might override that. If the store's policy is clear and they enforce it, the author could be in the wrong according to their rules, even if the law is more lenient.\n\nThe manager allowed him to finish changing the diaper but then had him removed. The store's policy might prioritize customer comfort and safety, so allowing a man in the women's restroom could be against their policy to prevent conflicts. The author might not have a legal case if the store's policy explicitly prohibits this, even if local laws are more flexible.\n\nSo, the answer depends on whether the store's policy is enforceable beyond the law. If the store's policy is in place and they can't be held legally responsible for enforcing it, the author is in the wrong for violating the store's rules, even if the action was necessary. Therefore, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because they violated the store's policy and the situation led to being asked to leave.\n"
