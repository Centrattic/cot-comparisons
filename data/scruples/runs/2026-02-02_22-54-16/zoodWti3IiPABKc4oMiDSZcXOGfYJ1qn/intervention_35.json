They allowed me to finish but then had security escort me out.\n\nThey didn\u2019t tell me not to come back but they did say that for \u201cstore policy reasons\u201d that I needed to be removed from the premises.\n\nI am not sure if I should consider legal action as there probably isn\u2019t a legal leg to stand on. \n\nI guess I\u2019m just wondering - am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the father is in the wrong for using the women's bathroom to change his baby's diaper. He first went to the men's room, which didn't have a changing station. Then he asked a store worker, who said there were no other bathrooms with one. He went to the women's restroom, changed the diaper, a woman saw him and called the manager, and he was escorted out.\n\nSo, the main points here. The father had a legitimate need to change his baby's diaper. Many stores have changing stations in men's rooms, but not all. If the store didn't have one, he was left with a problem. He tried to find another bathroom but couldn't. Using the women's bathroom might be considered inappropriate in some contexts because it's typically for women, but the baby is an infant, so there's no risk of exposure or privacy issues here. \n\nLegally, in many places, it's allowed for parents to use any restroom where there's a changing station, regardless of gender. However, store policies might be more strict. The manager followed their policy by removing him, but whether that policy is fair is another question. \n\nThe key factors are the intent (changing a diaper, not any other reason), the urgency, and the lack of alternatives. The father's actions were necessary for the baby's care. The store's policy might be based on preventing misuse, but in this case, the use was legitimate. So, the father isn't in the wrong morally, but maybe the store had to enforce their policy. But the question is about being the asshole, not about legal technicalities. \n\nIn terms of societal norms, some people might be uncomfortable seeing a man in a women's restroom, even with a baby, but the situation is exceptional. The father had no other option. The store's response was strict but perhaps not unjustified by their policy. However, the father acted in good faith. So the answer is B, he's not the asshole.\n"
