They allowed me to finish but then had security escort me out.\n\nThey didn\u2019t tell me not to come back but they did say that for \u201cstore policy reasons\u201d that I needed to be removed from the premises.\n\nI am not sure if I should consider legal action as there probably isn\u2019t a legal leg to stand on. \n\nI guess I\u2019m just wondering - am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the father who used the women's bathroom to change his baby is in the wrong. The user thinks he's not, but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. He had an infant and needed a diaper change. He checked the men's room, which didn't have a changing station. The store employee said there were no other bathrooms with one nearby. He couldn't wait, so he went to the women's room. A woman saw him, got upset, and he was escorted out.\n\nHmm. In many places, laws about this vary. Some states have laws allowing parents to use opposite-gender restrooms for diaper changes. For example, some U.S. states have such laws, but others don't. The key here is whether the store's policy conflicts with or complies with local laws. If the store's policy prohibits it, but the law allows it, then the store might be wrong. But if the store's policy aligns with local regulations, then maybe the father did violate the policy.\n\nAlso, there's the aspect of intent. The father wasn't using the restroom for inappropriate reasons but out of necessity. However, stores might have strict policies to avoid any potential issues, especially if they're in a state where such laws don't exist. The manager might have followed the policy strictly to avoid liability.\n\nBut some arguments could be made that it's a public necessity, and stores should accommodate parents. However, if the store doesn't have mixed-gender changing stations, then the father's choice might be problematic. The store employee didn't direct him to another location, so maybe there's some responsibility on the store's part for not providing adequate facilities.\n\nI'm leaning towards the father not being in the wrong because his action was necessary for his child's care, and maybe the store should have better facilities. But it's a bit of a gray area. The answer depends on local laws and store policies. Since the question is about being in the wrong, if the store's policy was against it, then technically he violated that. But morally, he might not be the asshole. However, the question is about whether he's in the wrong in terms of the situation, not just the manager's action. So, maybe the answer is B (No), but I'm not entirely sure. Wait, in some places, it's illegal to deny access for such a reason. If that's the case, then the store was wrong. If not, then the father might be in the wrong. Without knowing the jurisdiction, it's hard. But since the user is asking for a general answer, maybe B is the answer because the father was acting out of necessity and the store's policy might be unreasonable.\n"
