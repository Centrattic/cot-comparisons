They allowed me to finish but then had security escort me out.\n\nThey didn\u2019t tell me not to come back but they did say that for \u201cstore policy reasons\u201d that I needed to be removed from the premises.\n\nI am not sure if I should consider legal action as there probably isn\u2019t a legal leg to stand on. \n\nI guess I\u2019m just wondering - am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a father who needed to change his baby's diaper. He first went to the men's room, which didn't have a changing station. The store worker didn't have any other options, so he went to the women's restroom. A woman saw him, got upset, and called the manager. He was escorted out for store policy reasons.\n\nSo, the question is whether he's in the wrong. From a legal standpoint, I think he's probably not at fault. In many places, laws allow parents to use any restroom with a diaper-changing area. If the men's room didn't have one, using the women's might be permissible. But store policies can vary. Some stores might have strict policies against it for privacy or liability reasons, even if it's legal. \n\nEthically, it's a bit tricky. While his intention was good, using a women's restroom might make others uncomfortable, especially if there's no unisex changing area. However, it's also about parental needs versus store policies. The store might have policies that are more about liability than actual wrongdoing from the parent. \n\nSo, the answer depends on local laws. If the law allows it, then he's not in the wrong. If the store's policy prohibits it regardless of the law, he might have violated their rules but not necessarily the law. The user mentions considering legal action, which suggests he might be unsure. If he followed the law, he's not the asshole. If he violated store policy without legal justification, maybe. But generally, parents have rights to use restrooms for diaper changes. So, likely answer B.\n"
