They allowed me to finish but then had security escort me out.\n\nThey didn\u2019t tell me not to come back but they did say that for \u201cstore policy reasons\u201d that I needed to be removed from the premises.\n\nI am not sure if I should consider legal action as there probably isn\u2019t a legal leg to stand on. \n\nI guess I\u2019m just wondering - am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the father who used the women's bathroom to change his baby's diaper is in the wrong. They mentioned that he first went to the men's room, which didn't have a changing station, and a store worker said there were no other bathrooms available. Then he went to the women's restroom, got caught, and was escorted out.\n\nHmm, so the first thing I need to consider is the store's policies. In many places, especially in the U.S., public restrooms are gender-segregated, and using the opposite sex's restroom can be a point of contention. But there are also laws regarding parental access. Some states have laws that allow men to use women's restrooms for diaper changes if there's no other option. However, store policies might be stricter than local laws. \n\nThe key points here are: the father had no other option, the men's room didn't have a changing station, and the store worker didn't know of any alternatives. Then he used the women's restroom. The woman freaked out, and security escorted him out based on store policy. The user is unsure if he's in the wrong legally or socially.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, in some places, it's permitted for a parent to use the opposite gender restroom if necessary. But stores can have their own policies, and if they enforce those, even if the law allows it, the store might ask him to leave. However, if the store's policy violates the law, then the store could be in the wrong. But I'm not certain about the exact legal details here. \n\nSocially, there's a lot of discussion around this. Some people might think it's reasonable to prioritize the baby's needs over gender norms, especially when no alternatives are available. Others might feel it's inappropriate regardless of the situation. The store's response might be seen as overreacting, but also as enforcing policy to avoid potential legal issues or customer complaints.\n\nSo, the answer depends on the specific laws in the area where the store is located. If the store's policy is against it, but the law allows it, then the father might be justified. If the store's policy is in line with local regulations, then he might be in the wrong for not following the store's rules. But since the user is asking from a general perspective, I should consider common practices and laws in the U.S.\n\nIn many U.S. states, it's actually against the law to restrict a parent from using any restroom to change a baby's diaper, regardless of the parent's gender. For example, California and some others have such laws. However, if the store had a strict policy, they might have a right to remove him, even if the law allows it, because of their own rules. But if their policy is in conflict with the law, then the store could face legal consequences. \n\nThe user is asking if the author is in the wrong. If the father acted under the law, then he's not in the wrong. If the store's policy is valid and he violated it, then he could be. But given that the store worker didn't know of any other bathrooms, maybe the store is at fault for not providing adequate facilities. \n\nIn the \"Am I the Asshole\" community, the answer often hinges on social norms and common sense. Many would argue that the father is in the right because the baby's needs are urgent and the store didn't provide a solution. But others might say he should have known better or that it's a matter of respecting privacy. \n\nSince the user is considering legal action, it's important to check if the store's policy is legally enforceable. If the state law allows parents to use any restroom for diaper changes, then the store's removal would be illegal. But if there's no such law, then the store might be within their rights. \n\nIn the absence of specific state laws, the general rule is that while it's a common practice for parents to use the opposite gender restroom when necessary, store policies can vary. The answer could be B (No) if the law supports the father, but A (Yes) if the store's policy is valid and he broke it. However, since the user is from a place where such laws might exist, and the store didn't provide an alternative, it's possible that the father isn't in the wrong. \n\nBut since I don't know the exact location, I have to make a general assumption. The answer likely is B (No) because parents are often allowed to use any restroom for diaper changes, and the store's policy might be outdated or not in line with current societal norms. The store's enforcement could be seen as unnecessary, especially when the alternative was non-existent. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the father probably isn't in the wrong, especially given the lack of alternatives and the common understanding that parents need to do what's necessary for their babies. The store's reaction might be more about policy than actual wrongdoing. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
