      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that he used the women's bathroom to change his infant daughter's diaper because the men's room didn't have a changing station. He went to the women's room, someone saw him, called the manager, and he was escorted out. He's wondering if he's the asshole here.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. Legally, in many places, there's something called the \"baby rule\" where men can use women's restrooms if they need to care for a baby. This is to prevent discrimination against parents, especially fathers. So legally, he might not be the asshole because the law might protect him in this case.\n\nEthically, it's a bit trickier. Some people might feel that using the women's room without a changing table is a breach of privacy for the women using it. However, the store's policy might be strict about this. The store worker didn't know about other options, so maybe the store is at fault for not having accessible changing stations for all parents. \n\nThe manager's response was to have him removed, which could be seen as an overreaction if the store's policy isn't clear or if they don't have any changing facilities for men. If the store is enforcing a policy that doesn't account for fathers with infants, that might be the store's problem. \n\nAlso, the fact that he was in a hurry and couldn't wait might add context. The key here is whether there's a legal precedent or local laws allowing fathers to use women's restrooms for diaper changes. If such a law exists, then the store's action might be wrong. If not, maybe the father overstepped. \n\nBut since the user is asking if the author is in the wrong, considering the common baby rule and the lack of male changing stations, the answer might lean towards the author not being the asshole. The store's policy might be the issue here. However, there's also the social norm aspect where some people might find it uncomfortable regardless of the law. \n\nSo putting it all together, the answer is probably B (No), because the author isn't in the wrong if the store didn't provide adequate facilities for fathers, and there's a legal allowance for such situations.\n"
