They allowed me to finish but then had security escort me out.\n\nThey didn\u2019t tell me not to come back but they did say that for \u201cstore policy reasons\u201d that I needed to be removed from the premises.\n\nI am not sure if I should consider legal action as there probably isn\u2019t a legal leg to stand on. \n\nI guess I\u2019m just wondering - am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The person is a father who brought his infant daughter to a department store and needed to change her diaper. He went to the men's bathroom, which didn't have a changing station, then asked a worker and was told there were none. He couldn't wait, so he went into the women's restroom, changed the baby, and was confronted by a woman, then escorted out by security.\n\nSo, the question is whether he's in the wrong. From a moral or social standpoint, I can see both sides. As a parent, especially caring for an infant, it's a real need. But using the women's bathroom as a man might be seen as a breach of privacy or policy for the other people using that facility. \n\nLegally, I think it's a bit tricky. Public restrooms often have policies about gender-specific access, but do those policies hold up if there's a legitimate need? In some places, laws might allow for diaper changes if there's no other option, but it depends on local regulations. The store's policy is clear, so even if the man's action was out of necessity, he violated the store's rules.\n\nHowever, from a societal perspective, there's a growing understanding that parents, especially fathers, might need to use opposite-gender restrooms for necessary tasks. Some places are adding gender-neutral restrooms to accommodate this. But in this case, the store didn't have that infrastructure.\n\nSo, the man had a need, followed what he thought was the best course of action, but the store's policy and the social expectations for privacy for others in the restroom are on the other side. The store had the right to enforce their policy, but maybe they could have handled it more compassionately. \n\nThe user's own thought is that he's not in the wrong. I can see why someone would think that the parent's need is justified. But legally and according to the store's rules, he violated something. So, the answer might hinge on whether we're judging by the store's policy (he's in the wrong) or by the necessity (he's not in the wrong). The question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the answer is about the store's policy, then A. If it's about the necessity and intent, then B. \n\nIn the context of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" subreddit, the community often considers both the letter of the law and the spirit of the situation. If the father acted out of genuine need and didn't intend to cause harm, many might side with him. But technically, he violated the store's rules, which could make him the asshole. \n\nSo, I think the correct answer is B, but I'm a bit torn. The key is whether the author's actions were wrong despite the circumstances. If the store's policy is strict and he broke it, then he's in the wrong. But if the policy is outdated and his need was legitimate, then not. The answer here probably leans towards B because the situation is a genuine need and the store's policy might be seen as inflexible in this case.\n"
