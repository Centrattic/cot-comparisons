They allowed me to finish but then had security escort me out.\n\nThey didn\u2019t tell me not to come back but they did say that for \u201cstore policy reasons\u201d that I needed to be removed from the premises.\n\nI am not sure if I should consider legal action as there probably isn\u2019t a legal leg to stand on. \n\nI guess I\u2019m just wondering - am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the father who used the women's bathroom to change his baby's diaper is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The father went to the men's room, which didn't have a changing station. He asked a store worker about other bathrooms, but they said no. Then he went into the women's room and changed the diaper. A woman saw him, freaked out, called the manager, and he was escorted out.\n\nNow, in many places, public restrooms have laws that allow parents of either gender to use the opposite gender restroom for the purpose of changing an infant's diaper. There are anti-discrimination laws that protect parents from being harassed or removed for this reason. For example, in some states in the US, it's illegal to deny access to restrooms for parents changing babies. The reasoning is that it's a temporary, legitimate need and not a violation of privacy or inappropriate behavior, especially when the parent is of the opposite gender but is doing a necessary task for their child.\n\nHowever, store policies might vary. The manager might have followed their own policy, which could be stricter than the law. But legally, the father might have a case. The store's action in removing him could be seen as discriminatory or against public policy. However, if the store's policy explicitly prohibits this, even if unlawful, the father could still be asked to leave based on their rules. But then, the father might have the right to challenge that policy in court if he can show it's against public policy.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, some people might think it's okay to use the other restroom if there's no option, while others might not. But legally, the father is likely in the right. The key here is the existence of laws protecting parents from such situations. So the answer would probably be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
