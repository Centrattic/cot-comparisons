They allowed me to finish but then had security escort me out.\n\nThey didn\u2019t tell me not to come back but they did say that for \u201cstore policy reasons\u201d that I needed to be removed from the premises.\n\nI am not sure if I should consider legal action as there probably isn\u2019t a legal leg to stand on. \n\nI guess I\u2019m just wondering - am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a father who needed to change his infant daughter's diaper. He first went to the men's restroom, which didn't have a changing station. Then he asked a store worker and was told there were none, maybe try another store. Since he couldn't wait, he went to the women's bathroom to change the diaper. A woman came in, got upset, called the manager, and he was escorted out. The question is whether he was in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider store policies. Many stores have policies that men are not allowed in women's restrooms unless it's an emergency. Even if there's no changing station in men's rooms, using the women's restroom might violate their rules. So from a policy standpoint, he might be in the wrong.\n\nLegally, it's a bit different. In some places, laws might allow fathers to use women's restrooms for diaper changes, especially if the store doesn't provide alternatives. But the store's policy isn't necessarily the law. The manager followed their internal policy, even if it's not legally required.\n\nThe user's intent was to take care of his baby, which is understandable and necessary. However, the store's policy might not have exceptions for such cases. The key here is whether the store is required by law to have changing stations in men's rooms. If they are, then the store is at fault for not providing them. If not, then the father might have to follow the store's specific rules.\n\nIn some regions, there are laws mandating that public restrooms have diaper changing facilities for both genders. If that's the case here, the store could be violating the law by not having a changing station in the men's restroom. But if there's no such law, the store can set their own policy.\n\nSo the answer depends on local laws and the store's policies. If the store's policy prohibits men from using the women's restroom for diaper changes and there's no legal requirement for them to have changing stations in the men's room, then the father might be in the wrong according to the store's rules. But if the law requires changing stations, the store is at fault for not providing them.\n\nThe user's situation is a common dilemma. Even if he did what he had to do to care for his child, if the store's policy doesn't allow it, he might be seen as violating their rules. The manager's action was based on policy, not necessarily legal grounds. So from the store's perspective, he's in the wrong. However, if there's a legal precedent that supports fathers using women's restrooms in such cases, then the store might be overstepping.\n\nIn conclusion, considering the information given and without knowing the specific local laws, the store's policy is likely the reason he was asked to leave. Therefore, he might be considered in the wrong according to their policy, even if his intentions were good. But if the law requires changing stations, then the store is at fault. Since the user mentions not having a legal leg to stand on, it suggests the store's policy might not be legally challenged. So the answer is A (he's in the wrong according to the store's policy) but there's a nuanced legal angle.\n"
