They allowed me to finish but then had security escort me out.\n\nThey didn\u2019t tell me not to come back but they did say that for \u201cstore policy reasons\u201d that I needed to be removed from the premises.\n\nI am not sure if I should consider legal action as there probably isn\u2019t a legal leg to stand on. \n\nI guess I\u2019m just wondering - am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The person is a father trying to change his baby's diaper. He first goes to the men's room, which doesn't have a changing station. He asks a store worker, who says there are none and maybe to try another store. But he can't wait, so he goes into the women's restroom and changes the baby. A woman comes in, gets upset, calls the manager. The manager lets him finish but then has security escort him out. The store didn't ban him but said it was policy.\n\nSo, the question is: Is the father in the wrong? The user thinks not, but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, consider the intent. The father is trying to care for his infant, which is a basic need. Diaper changes are necessary. The men's room doesn't have a changing station, which is a common issue. The store worker didn't help, so he had to improvise. \n\nBut then he used the women's restroom. Now, in many places, there are laws that allow parents to use any restroom if there's no gender-specific changing station. For example, some states in the US have laws that permit this because it's an exception for child care. So legally, he might be okay.\n\nHowever, store policies can be different. Even if it's legal, the store might have a strict policy against it for privacy reasons. The manager followed their policy by removing him, even if they didn't mention a ban. \n\nSo from a legal standpoint, he's probably not in the wrong, especially if the local law allows it. From a policy standpoint, the store had the right to enforce their rules. But the question is about being in the wrong, which is more about morality or social norms. The father's intention was good, to care for his child. The woman's reaction was likely due to unexpected situation and maybe discomfort. \n\nThe key here is whether using the women's restroom when necessary and with no other options is considered wrong. In many places, it's seen as reasonable. So the answer is B (No), he's not in the wrong."
