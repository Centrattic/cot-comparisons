They allowed me to finish but then had security escort me out.\n\nThey didn\u2019t tell me not to come back but they did say that for \u201cstore policy reasons\u201d that I needed to be removed from the premises.\n\nI am not sure if I should consider legal action as there probably isn\u2019t a legal leg to stand on. \n\nI guess I\u2019m just wondering - am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the father who used the women's bathroom to change his baby is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the laws and policies around this. In many places, laws allow parents or caregivers to use opposite-gender restrooms to attend to infants. For example, I remember reading that in some states, it's illegal to discriminate against parents with babies in restrooms. There's a law in California that allows people to use the restroom that matches their gender identity or that of their child. \n\nThen there's the store policy aspect. The store worker didn't direct him to another bathroom, which might be part of the issue. If the store doesn't have a family restroom or a changing station, maybe the store is at fault for not providing adequate facilities. The manager's response was to have him escorted out, but if the law supports the father's action, the store might have overstepped their policy.\n\nAlso, the intent here is important. The father wasn't using the bathroom to violate any norms but to attend to an infant's basic need. The woman's reaction and the store's policy enforcement could be based on misunderstanding or outdated policies that don't account for such situations. \n\nHowever, from the store's perspective, they might have policies that restrict bathroom usage to prevent misuse or ensure privacy for all customers. But if local laws protect caregivers of infants, the store's policy might be in violation. \n\nSo, considering both legal protections for parents and the store's possible failure to provide appropriate facilities, the father might not be in the wrong. The answer would likely be B (No), as he was acting in the child's best interest and possibly protected by law.\n"
