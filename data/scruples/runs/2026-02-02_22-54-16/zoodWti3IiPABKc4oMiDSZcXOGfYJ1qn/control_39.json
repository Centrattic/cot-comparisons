They allowed me to finish but then had security escort me out.\n\nThey didn\u2019t tell me not to come back but they did say that for \u201cstore policy reasons\u201d that I needed to be removed from the premises.\n\nI am not sure if I should consider legal action as there probably isn\u2019t a legal leg to stand on. \n\nI guess I\u2019m just wondering - am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the father who used the women's bathroom to change his infant's diaper is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the facts. The father went to the men's room first, which didn't have a changing station. Then he asked a store employee, who said there were none and suggested another store. Since he couldn't wait, he went to the women's restroom. A woman saw him, freaked out, and called the manager. The store had him removed for policy reasons.\n\nNow, legally, in many places, it's allowed for parents to use opposite-gender restrooms to change diapers if there's no other option. Some laws protect this right, like in certain U.S. states. But store policies can be different. The store might have their own rules against it, which could lead to being asked to leave even if there's no legal violation. \n\nEthically, the father's intent was to care for his child, which is understandable. However, using the women's restroom without considering the discomfort of others might be seen as inconsiderate. The store's policy might be strict to maintain privacy and comfort for all customers. \n\nSo, the father may not be legally wrong, but he might be in the wrong according to the store's policy and social norms. The store's action was based on their rules, not necessarily legal grounds. The question is whether he's the asshole, which is more about social judgment than legal right. \n\nIn many cases, people support parents in such situations, but the store's policy here forced him out. The answer hinges on whether the action was necessary and if there were alternatives. Since there were no changing stations and he couldn't wait, his choice was made out of necessity. However, using the opposite-gender restroom might not be the expected norm in that store, leading to the reaction.\n\nConsidering all that, the answer might be B (No), because his intent was to care for his child and there were no other options. However, the store's policy is in place to protect all customers, so he violated that policy. But legally, he might not be in the wrong. The question is if he's the asshole, which is more about social judgment. The store's policy is strict, but his action was driven by necessity. So, depending on the perspective, maybe B is the answer.\n"
