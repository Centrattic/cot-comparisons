They allowed me to finish but then had security escort me out.\n\nThey didn\u2019t tell me not to come back but they did say that for \u201cstore policy reasons\u201d that I needed to be removed from the premises.\n\nI am not sure if I should consider legal action as there probably isn\u2019t a legal leg to stand on. \n\nI guess I\u2019m just wondering - am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the father is in the wrong for using the women's bathroom to change his infant's diaper. The situation is that he went to the men's room first, which didn't have a changing station. Then he asked a store worker, who said there weren't any other bathrooms with a changing station and suggested another store. Since he couldn't wait, he went to the women's restroom, changed the diaper, someone got upset, and he was escorted out.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if using the women's bathroom was appropriate. In most places, laws regarding diaper changing in public restrooms can vary. Some places have laws that allow men to use women's restrooms to change diapers if necessary, especially for infants. For example, in some U.S. states, it's legal for parents to use either gender's restroom to change a baby's diaper if the other doesn't have a changing station. However, store policies might be different. The store might have their own rules about who can use which restrooms, even if local laws permit it. The manager might have enforced their policy regardless of legal allowances.\n\nThen there's the social aspect. Even if legally allowed, some people might find it uncomfortable or inappropriate. The woman who freaked out probably felt that the men's room should have had a changing station, or that the father should have found another solution. The key here is whether the father had a reasonable alternative. He went to the men's room first, which didn't have a changing station, and the store employee didn't direct him to another one. So maybe he didn't have a choice. However, the store's policy might require using the men's room regardless, which he didn't have. \n\nLegal action? If the law supports parents in such cases, the store might not have a legal basis to kick him out. But if the store's policy strictly prohibits it, they might have followed their own rules. So, the answer depends on local laws versus store policy. Without specific location details, it's hard, but generally, many places do have laws protecting parents from being discriminated against in restrooms for diaper changes. Therefore, the father might not be in the wrong. But from a store policy perspective, they might have done what they had to do. However, the question is whether the author is the asshole, which is more about social judgment than legality. The store might have handled it poorly, but the father's actions could be seen as justified given the lack of alternatives. So the answer might be B (not in the wrong).\n"
