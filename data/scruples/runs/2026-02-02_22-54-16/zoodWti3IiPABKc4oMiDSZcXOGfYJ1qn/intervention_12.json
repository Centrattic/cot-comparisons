They allowed me to finish but then had security escort me out.\n\nThey didn\u2019t tell me not to come back but they did say that for \u201cstore policy reasons\u201d that I needed to be removed from the premises.\n\nI am not sure if I should consider legal action as there probably isn\u2019t a legal leg to stand on. \n\nI guess I\u2019m just wondering - am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The situation is about a father using the women's bathroom to change his baby's diaper. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the man went to the men's room but there was no changing station. Then he asked a store worker, who said there were no other options and suggested another store. Since he couldn't wait, he used the women's bathroom, which led to a confrontation.\n\nNow, laws vary by location, but generally, public restrooms are required to have diaper changing facilities. However, sometimes men's rooms might not have them, especially in some regions. If the store doesn't have a changing station in the men's room, maybe the policy is lacking. But the store worker didn't mention any alternatives, which could be an issue.\n\nIn many places, it's legal for fathers to use the women's restroom for changing diapers if necessary, but policies can be strict. The manager followed their policy by removing him, but legally, if the store's policy is not in line with local laws, the father might have a case. However, the store's policy might be based on their own rules, not necessarily the law. \n\nThe key points are: Did the store have a changing station in the men's room? If not, maybe the store is at fault. Also, was there an alternative available? The worker suggested another store, which might not be feasible if the father couldn't wait. The manager's action was based on store policy, but if the policy is too strict, it could be problematic. \n\nSince the father had no other option and the store didn't provide adequate facilities, he might not be in the wrong. But depending on the store's policies and local regulations, it's a bit of a gray area. However, the fact that the store allowed him to finish before removing him shows some consideration. \n\nI think the answer is B (No), because the father had no other choice and the store might be lacking in providing proper facilities. But it's a close call depending on local laws and store policies.\n"
