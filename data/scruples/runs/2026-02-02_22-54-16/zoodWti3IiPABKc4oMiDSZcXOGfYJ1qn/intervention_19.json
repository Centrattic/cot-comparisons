      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for using the women's bathroom to change their baby's diaper. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nFirst, the user is a father with an infant daughter. They went to a department store, and when they entered the men's restroom, there was no changing station. I know that in many places, men's restrooms might not have diaper changing facilities, which is a common issue. Then they asked a store worker about other bathrooms with changing stations, and the worker said there weren't any, maybe suggesting a store down the road. But the father couldn't wait, so he went into the women's restroom and changed the baby there. \n\nNow, the key points here are: he's a parent in a hurry, he checked the men's restroom first, and he used the women's bathroom as a last resort. The woman who saw him freaked out and called the manager. The manager didn't ban him but escorted him out due to store policy. The user is wondering if they're the asshole here and if they have a legal case.\n\nFrom a parental perspective, changing a baby's diaper is a necessity, and it's important to do so in a clean and safe environment to protect the baby's health. However, using the women's restroom could be seen as a privacy issue. In many public restrooms, there's a policy that allows men to use the women's restroom for diaper changes, especially if the men's room doesn't have a changing station. But it's also possible that the store has a strict policy against it, even if it's common practice elsewhere.\n\nLegally, I think parents have a right to care for their children, but there might be specific laws or policies regarding access to restrooms. Some places have laws that permit fathers or male caregivers to use women's restrooms with infants, while others don't. The store's policy might not align with those laws, leading to a conflict. The manager's reaction was based on policy, but if the policy is discriminatory or doesn't account for parental needs, that could be an issue. \n\nHowever, in many jurisdictions, public accommodations laws require that diaper changing facilities be available. If the men's restroom didn't have one, the store might be at fault for not providing adequate facilities. Yet, the father's action of entering the women's restroom without prior knowledge of the policy could be seen as a mistake. He might not have realized that the store had a strict rule against it, even if it's a common practice elsewhere.\n\nAdditionally, the woman's reaction is understandable because she might have felt her privacy was invaded. Even though the intent was to change a diaper, the presence of a man in a women's restroom can be alarming. The store's response, while allowing him to finish, then removing him, might be standard procedure to de-escalate the situation and maintain their policy, but also to avoid further complaints.\n\nSo, the question is whether the father's action was justified under the circumstances. If the store didn't have a changing station in the men's room, which is a requirement in some places, then the store could be in the wrong. But if the policy explicitly prohibits men from using the women's restroom for diaper changes, regardless of the reason, then the father might have violated that policy. However, public policy and parental rights often intersect here. In some states, it's illegal to prevent a parent from using a restroom of the opposite gender for their child. \n\nOn the other hand, the father could have been more cautious. Maybe he should have checked with the store worker about the policy before entering, or used a different method to handle the situation, like finding a more secluded area if possible. But given that the worker didn't inform him about the policy, he might not have known. \n\nSo, considering all angles: the father's intent was to care for his infant, which is a reasonable need. If the store's policy is too rigid without considering parental needs, they might be at fault. But if he entered without prior permission and it's against their stated policy, he might be in the wrong. The answer likely depends on local laws and the store's specific policies. However, in the absence of legal precedent or specific store information, it's a bit tricky. \n\nI think the father's action is understandable, but he might have overlooked the store's policy. However, if the store is required by law to accommodate parents, then the manager's response was inappropriate. The woman's reaction also shows a societal norm issue, where people might not expect a man in the women's restroom, even if it's for a baby. \n\nIn this case, maybe the author isn't the asshole because he was trying to do the right thing for his baby, but he did violate the store's policy. So the store's policy might be the problem, but his action was against it. But if the store's policy is illegal, then he's in the right. Since the user mentions they probably don't have a legal leg, maybe the store's policy is valid there, making the author technically in the wrong, though possibly with good intentions.\n"
