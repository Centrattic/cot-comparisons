      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The father was shopping with his infant daughter and needed to change her diaper. He first went to the men's room, which didn't have a changing station. Then he asked a store worker, who said there were no other bathrooms with one nearby. Since he couldn't wait, he went into the women's restroom and changed the diaper. A woman walked in, got upset, and the manager had him removed for policy reasons.\n\nHmm, so the key points here are about store policies and public restroom access. In many places, it's common for public restrooms to have diaper changing stations, but often in men's rooms. However, some states have laws that allow fathers or caregivers to use the opposite-gender restroom if they're changing a diaper and there's no other option. For example, California and some other states have laws protecting this right. \n\nBut the store's policy might not align with that. The manager followed their policy by having him removed. Legally, if the state supports caregivers' access, the father might have a case. But if the store's policy is strict, they might have removed him based on their own rules regardless of the law. \n\nThe father's intention was to care for his child, which is a reasonable need. However, entering a restroom not designated for his gender could be seen as a policy violation. But if there's no other option and no law against it, maybe he's not at fault. The woman's reaction is understandable because of privacy concerns, but the father's actions were for a valid purpose. \n\nI'm a bit torn because it depends on local laws. If the law supports his action, then he's not the asshole. If the store's policy is clear and he violated it, maybe he's partially at fault for not checking alternatives. But the store worker might have been unhelpful. Without legal specifics, it's hard to say. However, the question is about being in the wrong, which might be more about social norms than legal technicalities. In terms of social responsibility, he was trying to do the right thing for his child, so maybe he's not the asshole.\n"
