They allowed me to finish but then had security escort me out.\n\nThey didn\u2019t tell me not to come back but they did say that for \u201cstore policy reasons\u201d that I needed to be removed from the premises.\n\nI am not sure if I should consider legal action as there probably isn\u2019t a legal leg to stand on. \n\nI guess I\u2019m just wondering - am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if the father who used the women's bathroom to change his baby is in the wrong. The story says he went to the men's room first but there was no changing station. He asked a worker and was told to try another store. Since he couldn't wait, he went to the women's restroom, changed the baby, and then a woman confronted him. Security escorted him out.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the laws and common practices regarding this. In many places, it's legal for parents to use either gender's restroom to change a baby's diaper, especially if the other doesn't have a changing station. The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) requires accessible changing tables, but they might not be in all restrooms. Some states have laws allowing parents to use either restroom. \n\nThe store's policy might prohibit this, but if the law supports the parent's action, the store's policy could be considered discriminatory. The father had a valid reason (needing to change his baby) and couldn't wait. The store's response was to remove him, which might be their policy, but if the law is on his side, he might not be in the wrong. \n\nHowever, if the store's policy explicitly states that men can't use women's restrooms for this, there could be a conflict. But generally, the necessity of caring for an infant would outweigh gender policies. So, the answer might be B (No, he's not in the wrong).\n"
