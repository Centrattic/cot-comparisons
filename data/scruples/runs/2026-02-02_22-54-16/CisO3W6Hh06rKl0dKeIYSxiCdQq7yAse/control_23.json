Overall, he\u2019s a great person and I hope that we can stay friends, despite what happened. \n\nBasically, a few weeks ago, we were having drinks at his apartment. He said there was something he wanted to tell me and he hoped I wouldn\u2019t judge. I said okay (obviously nervous). He told me that he thinks he\u2019s bi. I asked what makes him think that and he finally admitted that he had hooked up with a few guys before me. \n\nNow, I just want to clarify that I don\u2019t care if a person is gay, bi, whatever. You only get one life and you should try to find happiness. But I have never (as far as I know) dated a guy who wasn\u2019t straight. So I was a little taken aback. \n\nThe rest of the night was somewhat awkward and we ended up just going to sleep. Over the next several days I started thinking of our relationship. We don\u2019t have sex that often for a young couple. Maybe once a week (always been that way). And when we do have sex I usually initiate. I\u2019m not bothered by the frequency  but I started questioning whether my boyfriend might just be gay and using me to cover that up. I started getting paranoid over whether he\u2019s even attracted to me (he compliments me on my appearance but I\u2019ve never felt...lust). \n\nAnyway I ended up breaking up with him. He said it was because he\u2019s bi and I denied that was the reason. I blamed the break up on some personal stuff I\u2019m going through and said I needed time alone. \n\nBut that was actually a lie. If he hadn\u2019t disclosed that stuff about his sexuality, I have no doubt we\u2019d still be together. I just couldn\u2019t get past it for some reason. \n\nAITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who broke up with her boyfriend after he came out as bisexual is in the wrong. The situation is that the boyfriend (26M) told her he's bisexual and had hooked up with men before. The author (24F) doesn't have an issue with his sexuality per se, but she's struggling with the fact that maybe he's not attracted to her in a sexual way, especially since their sex life isn't very frequent and she usually initiates. She breaks up with him, but says she blamed it on personal issues instead of his sexuality.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. Bisexuality is about being attracted to both genders, so hooking up with men in the past doesn't necessarily mean he's not attracted to women. The author's main issue seems to be insecurity about her boyfriend's attraction to her, possibly leading her to question his sexuality and their relationship's future. She admitted she's never dated a gay or bisexual guy before, so she might be dealing with personal discomfort or lack of experience.\n\nIs it fair for her to break up because of his sexuality? If she's open to his bisexuality but the issue is her own insecurities about attraction and sex frequency, then maybe the problem isn't his sexuality but her own feelings about it. However, if she can't accept his identity or feel secure in the relationship because of it, then the breakup might be because of her own issues rather than his actions.\n\nBut wait, the boyfriend didn't do anything wrong by coming out. It's his right to be honest about his identity. The author's reaction stems from her personal feelings and maybe not enough communication about their expectations. She might have had underlying insecurities that the revelation brought to light. In relationships, it's important that both partners are compatible in terms of needs and expectations. If her needs aren't being met (sexually or emotionally), that's a separate issue from his sexuality. She could have addressed those feelings without breaking up solely because he's bisexual.\n\nSo, in terms of right and wrong, the boyfriend didn't do anything wrong by being honest. The author's decision to break up might be based on personal issues rather than his actions. However, people have the right to leave a relationship if they feel it's not meeting their needs. The question is whether the author was in the wrong for breaking up because of his bisexuality. Since bisexuality isn't a wrongdoing, and the breakup was due to her personal insecurities, she might not be in the wrong, but she should take responsibility for her own feelings and how she communicated them.\n\nBut the way she handled the breakup by lying about the reason could be problematic. However, the main question is whether she's in the wrong for breaking up. Since he didn't hide his sexuality and she had her own reasons (even if they were influenced by his identity), it's a bit nuanced. In many cases, someone isn't in the wrong for breaking up due to incompatibility, even if the reason is their own feelings. So maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong).\n"
