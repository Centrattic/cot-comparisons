Overall, he\u2019s a great person and I hope that we can stay friends, despite what happened. \n\nBasically, a few weeks ago, we were having drinks at his apartment. He said there was something he wanted to tell me and he hoped I wouldn\u2019t judge. I said okay (obviously nervous). He told me that he thinks he\u2019s bi. I asked what makes him think that and he finally admitted that he had hooked up with a few guys before me. \n\nNow, I just want to clarify that I don\u2019t care if a person is gay, bi, whatever. You only get one life and you should try to find happiness. But I have never (as far as I know) dated a guy who wasn\u2019t straight. So I was a little taken aback. \n\nThe rest of the night was somewhat awkward and we ended up just going to sleep. Over the next several days I started thinking of our relationship. We don\u2019t have sex that often for a young couple. Maybe once a week (always been that way). And when we do have sex I usually initiate. I\u2019m not bothered by the frequency  but I started questioning whether my boyfriend might just be gay and using me to cover that up. I started getting paranoid over whether he\u2019s even attracted to me (he compliments me on my appearance but I\u2019ve never felt...lust). \n\nAnyway I ended up breaking up with him. He said it was because he\u2019s bi and I denied that was the reason. I blamed the break up on some personal stuff I\u2019m going through and said I needed time alone. \n\nBut that was actually a lie. If he hadn\u2019t disclosed that stuff about his sexuality, I have no doubt we\u2019d still be together. I just couldn\u2019t get past it for some reason. \n\nAITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that they were in a two-year relationship, the boyfriend is 26 and the author is 24. The boyfriend told her he's bisexual and had hooked up with guys before. The author then broke up with him, but later admitted that it was actually because of his bisexuality, even though she tried to blame it on her own personal issues.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the dynamics here. The boyfriend came out as bisexual and had prior experiences. The author says she doesn't care about someone's sexuality, but she's been in relationships with straight guys. She was taken aback but claims she's not judgmental. The main issue seems to be her reaction to his bisexuality leading to the breakup, even though she denied it was the reason.\n\nNow, considering the question: Is the author in the wrong? The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFrom what I know, being bisexual means being attracted to both males and females. It's a valid sexual orientation. The boyfriend's disclosure was about his identity and past actions. The author's problem isn't with his bisexuality per se, but possibly with the fact that he had relationships with others before her. However, the boyfriend didn't say he was currently seeing someone else or planning to. The breakup happened after his confession, and the author couldn't get past it.\n\nIn relationships, honesty is important. The boyfriend was honest about his sexuality, which is a personal aspect. The author's reaction is based on her discomfort with his bisexuality, even though she claims she's okay with it. She might be projecting her own insecurities or societal biases. If she couldn't accept his identity, even if he's monogamous and committed, that's a problem. \n\nBut wait, the boyfriend's actions\u2014hooking up with others before the relationship\u2014might have been a red flag. However, the author is breaking up because of his bisexuality, not his infidelity. If they were monogamous and he was truthful, then the issue is her inability to accept his sexuality. \n\nOn the other hand, everyone has their own deal-breakers. The author might feel that her partner's bisexuality affects their relationship dynamics. She mentions not feeling lust and initiating sex. Maybe his bisexuality made her question his attraction to her. But that's more about the relationship's current state rather than his orientation. \n\nIs it fair for her to break up because of his bisexuality? If the problem is that he's not sexually active with her as much as she expects, but his orientation is the underlying cause, then the real issue is his sexual behavior, not his identity. However, she's breaking up because of his identity, which is a choice she made. \n\nAlso, she lied about the reason for the breakup. That's not honest. Even if she had her reasons, not being truthful about why she ended things could be seen as inconsiderate. \n\nIn terms of societal norms, being bisexual is not unethical. So if the author broke up because he's bi, she might be in the wrong for not accepting his identity. However, if the problem was that he had previously engaged in relationships with others, which is more about past behavior, that could be a different issue. But the question is about his bisexuality specifically. \n\nThe key here is that the boyfriend's disclosure was about his sexuality, not about cheating in the current relationship. The author's issue seems to stem from his identity, not from any current actions. Therefore, if she couldn't accept his bisexuality as part of who he is, even if he's monogamous and committed, then she might be the one in the wrong. \n\nBut some might argue that it's his choice to be honest, and if she couldn't handle it, then maybe it's her issue. However, the fact that she denied the real reason and lied about the breakup being due to her personal stuff makes it seem like she's not being truthful, which could be a problem. \n\nSo, in the AITA context, the typical expectation is to accept people as they are, including their sexuality. Unless the boyfriend was being deceptive or the relationship had specific agreements that were broken, the author's reaction based on his orientation alone would make her at fault. Since she's breaking up because of something that's a part of his identity and not any behavior that violates their relationship terms, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong). \n\nBut wait, maybe there's a nuance. The boyfriend had hooked up with guys before, but if those were past experiences and not ongoing, then it's about his past. The author might have issues with his past, but that's not the same as his current orientation. If the problem is his bisexuality leading to possible future issues (like not being attracted to her), that's different. But the boyfriend didn't indicate he was no longer interested in her. \n\nSo, if the breakup was due to not accepting his bisexuality when he's in a committed relationship with her, then she's in the wrong. If the issue was his past hookups, then maybe it's about trust or jealousy. However, the main point he made was about his bisexuality, and she couldn't get past that. \n\nTherefore, the answer is A, the author is in the wrong because she broke up with him due to his sexuality, which is a personal choice and not a valid reason for a breakup unless there's a specific reason like infidelity or lack of commitment. Since the boyfriend was honest and there's no indication of betrayal, her reaction is based on her own inability to accept his identity, making her at fault.\n"
