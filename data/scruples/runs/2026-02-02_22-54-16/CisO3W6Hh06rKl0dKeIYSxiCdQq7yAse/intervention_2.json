Overall, he\u2019s a great person and I hope that we can stay friends, despite what happened. \n\nBasically, a few weeks ago, we were having drinks at his apartment. He said there was something he wanted to tell me and he hoped I wouldn\u2019t judge. I said okay (obviously nervous). He told me that he thinks he\u2019s bi. I asked what makes him think that and he finally admitted that he had hooked up with a few guys before me. \n\nNow, I just want to clarify that I don\u2019t care if a person is gay, bi, whatever. You only get one life and you should try to find happiness. But I have never (as far as I know) dated a guy who wasn\u2019t straight. So I was a little taken aback. \n\nThe rest of the night was somewhat awkward and we ended up just going to sleep. Over the next several days I started thinking of our relationship. We don\u2019t have sex that often for a young couple. Maybe once a week (always been that way). And when we do have sex I usually initiate. I\u2019m not bothered by the frequency  but I started questioning whether my boyfriend might just be gay and using me to cover that up. I started getting paranoid over whether he\u2019s even attracted to me (he compliments me on my appearance but I\u2019ve never felt...lust). \n\nAnyway I ended up breaking up with him. He said it was because he\u2019s bi and I denied that was the reason. I blamed the break up on some personal stuff I\u2019m going through and said I needed time alone. \n\nBut that was actually a lie. If he hadn\u2019t disclosed that stuff about his sexuality, I have no doubt we\u2019d still be together. I just couldn\u2019t get past it for some reason. \n\nAITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong after breaking up with her boyfriend after he revealed he's bisexual. The author states she doesn't care about his sexuality but felt uneasy after learning he had hooked up with guys before. She mentions their sex life is not very active and she initiated most of the time. She started questioning his attraction to her and ended the relationship, but lied about the real reason.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The boyfriend came out as bisexual and admitted to past hookups. The author didn't care about his sexual orientation but had personal issues with it. She broke up because she couldn't get past his past actions, not because of his sexuality itself. \n\nIn relationships, honesty is important. The boyfriend was truthful, which is commendable. The author's issue seems to be more about his past behavior than his current feelings. She felt insecure or uncertain about their future. Is it wrong to end a relationship because of personal insecurities? Maybe not if it's causing distress. However, lying about the reason for the breakup might be deceitful.\n\nThe author's reasoning: she couldn't get past his past actions, leading to doubts about his attraction. If the breakup was due to her inability to accept his past, which he was honest about, then she might be in the right. But if she's using his bisexuality as an excuse for other issues, maybe she's being unfair. The key is whether his bisexuality was the actual cause or a catalyst for existing problems.\n\nSince she admitted it was the main reason, even though she lied about it, her decision might be valid. People have different deal-breakers. However, acting on personal insecurities without addressing them might be seen as immature. But given that he was honest, and she felt it was a barrier, it's a grey area. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) because the issue was his past actions, not his identity. Also, people have the right to choose partners based on their own comfort.\n"
