Overall, he\u2019s a great person and I hope that we can stay friends, despite what happened. \n\nBasically, a few weeks ago, we were having drinks at his apartment. He said there was something he wanted to tell me and he hoped I wouldn\u2019t judge. I said okay (obviously nervous). He told me that he thinks he\u2019s bi. I asked what makes him think that and he finally admitted that he had hooked up with a few guys before me. \n\nNow, I just want to clarify that I don\u2019t care if a person is gay, bi, whatever. You only get one life and you should try to find happiness. But I have never (as far as I know) dated a guy who wasn\u2019t straight. So I was a little taken aback. \n\nThe rest of the night was somewhat awkward and we ended up just going to sleep. Over the next several days I started thinking of our relationship. We don\u2019t have sex that often for a young couple. Maybe once a week (always been that way). And when we do have sex I usually initiate. I\u2019m not bothered by the frequency  but I started questioning whether my boyfriend might just be gay and using me to cover that up. I started getting paranoid over whether he\u2019s even attracted to me (he compliments me on my appearance but I\u2019ve never felt...lust). \n\nAnyway I ended up breaking up with him. He said it was because he\u2019s bi and I denied that was the reason. I blamed the break up on some personal stuff I\u2019m going through and said I needed time alone. \n\nBut that was actually a lie. If he hadn\u2019t disclosed that stuff about his sexuality, I have no doubt we\u2019d still be together. I just couldn\u2019t get past it for some reason. \n\nAITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for breaking up with her boyfriend after he came out as bisexual. The scenario is that the boyfriend told her he's bi and had hooked up with guys before, which made her uncomfortable. She broke up with him, but she later admitted that it was because of his bisexuality, even though she initially lied about the reason.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author says she's not opposed to people being gay or bi, but she's never dated someone who wasn't straight. The boyfriend had been with her for two years, and the relationship had some issues like infrequent sex and her feeling she initiates it. She starts doubting his attraction to her after he comes out, leading her to break up.\n\nNow, the key points here are about whether being bisexual is a valid reason to break up. Bisexuality is about being attracted to more than one gender, so if the boyfriend had been with guys before but is in a relationship with a woman now, that's normal. However, the author is straight, so maybe she's uncomfortable with the idea that he's attracted to men as well. But if he's in a monogamous relationship, how does that affect their relationship? Unless he's being deceptive or has different expectations, bisexuality alone shouldn't be a deal-breaker for her.\n\nBut the author mentions that after the disclosure, she started questioning whether he's even attracted to her, leading her to break up. That makes me wonder if her insecurities were projected onto him. Maybe the issues in the relationship were pre-existing, and the bi disclosure was the final thing that made her decide to end it. The fact that they had infrequent sex and she initiated it might have been causing her discomfort before the disclosure. If the breakup was really about her not being able to accept his bisexuality, even though she claims she's okay with it, then she's in the wrong because he came out honestly. On the other hand, if the bisexuality made her realize the relationship wasn't compatible because of her own feelings, then she's not at fault because it's her right to end a relationship if it's not working for her reasons.\n\nAlso, the boyfriend might have felt that he was upfront with her, and she ended it based on that. But the author says she's fine with people being bi, but this situation made her uncomfortable. Maybe she's okay with someone being openly gay or bi but not when it's her partner. It's possible she's projecting her own discomfort onto the relationship. However, people have different boundaries. Some people are okay with their partner being bi as long as they're in a monogamous relationship. If he's not cheating or planning to leave, then maybe her breakup was unnecessary. But if she found out he had a history of hooking up with men before them, maybe she felt it changed her perception of the relationship. But the key is whether he was honest from the start. If he hadn't come out before, and she only found out later, that's different. But according to the story, he told her during their drinks, so he was upfront. She had the chance to process it, but her insecurities led her to break up.\n\nAnother angle is that she might have been using his bisexuality as an excuse to end the relationship because of other issues. The fact that they had a low sex drive and she felt she had to initiate might have been her deeper issues. But she attributes it to his sexuality. In that case, she's in the wrong because she's not being honest with herself and him. But if the disclosure made her realize that his bisexuality was a deal-breaker for her, even though she thought she was okay with it, then it's a valid reason. It's important to note that people change their views when faced with real situations, even if they thought they were okay with it. So, if she came to terms with it and decided it wasn't right for her, then she's not in the wrong. But if she's being hypocritical or not accepting, then she is. However, there's no indication that he was being dishonest or that his bisexuality affected their relationship in a negative way beyond her personal feelings. So, in that case, she's not in the wrong because it's her right to end a relationship if it's not working for her reasons, even if those reasons are based on personal discomfort with something about her partner.\n"
