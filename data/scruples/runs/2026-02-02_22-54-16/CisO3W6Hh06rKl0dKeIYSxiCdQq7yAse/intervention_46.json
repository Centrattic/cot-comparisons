Overall, he\u2019s a great person and I hope that we can stay friends, despite what happened. \n\nBasically, a few weeks ago, we were having drinks at his apartment. He said there was something he wanted to tell me and he hoped I wouldn\u2019t judge. I said okay (obviously nervous). He told me that he thinks he\u2019s bi. I asked what makes him think that and he finally admitted that he had hooked up with a few guys before me. \n\nNow, I just want to clarify that I don\u2019t care if a person is gay, bi, whatever. You only get one life and you should try to find happiness. But I have never (as far as I know) dated a guy who wasn\u2019t straight. So I was a little taken aback. \n\nThe rest of the night was somewhat awkward and we ended up just going to sleep. Over the next several days I started thinking of our relationship. We don\u2019t have sex that often for a young couple. Maybe once a week (always been that way). And when we do have sex I usually initiate. I\u2019m not bothered by the frequency  but I started questioning whether my boyfriend might just be gay and using me to cover that up. I started getting paranoid over whether he\u2019s even attracted to me (he compliments me on my appearance but I\u2019ve never felt...lust). \n\nAnyway I ended up breaking up with him. He said it was because he\u2019s bi and I denied that was the reason. I blamed the break up on some personal stuff I\u2019m going through and said I needed time alone. \n\nBut that was actually a lie. If he hadn\u2019t disclosed that stuff about his sexuality, I have no doubt we\u2019d still be together. I just couldn\u2019t get past it for some reason. \n\nAITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about breaking up with a boyfriend after he came out as bisexual. The author says they don't care about sexuality, but the issue is that the boyfriend had hooked up with guys before, which made the author question if he's really into her. They ended up breaking up, but the author later admitted it was his bisexuality that caused it, even though they lied about the reason.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The boyfriend came out as bisexual, which is a personal revelation. The author says they don't judge, but their reaction led to the breakup. The key points are: the author's discomfort with the boyfriend's past relationships with men, questioning his attraction, and the fact that the breakup was primarily due to his sexuality.\n\nIn relationships, honesty is important, and the boyfriend was honest about his sexuality. However, the author's reaction might be about personal boundaries. If the author can't accept that aspect of the boyfriend, even if he's committed, then maybe the breakup is justified for them. On the other hand, if the author is making a decision based on the boyfriend's sexuality rather than actions like infidelity or lack of commitment, it might be seen as discriminatory.\n\nThe author is clear that they don't care about someone's orientation in general but had never dated a non-straight person before. This could be a case of personal discomfort they hadn't anticipated. Breaking up because of something fundamental like sexual orientation might be seen as invalid if the issue is not about behavior in the relationship. The boyfriend didn't do anything wrong by coming out; it's his identity. If the author can't accept that, they might be in the wrong for ending the relationship based on a core aspect of his identity, especially if there's no other issue like cheating or neglect.\n\nBut then again, relationships require mutual compatibility. If the author's values or comfort levels are incompatible with the boyfriend's orientation, it's their choice. However, the AITA community often views breaking up over sexuality as the person's fault if there's no other issue. So the author might be in the wrong because they ended the relationship based on something the boyfriend can't change. The fact that the author lied about the reason shows they knew their own discomfort was the real issue, which might not make them in the wrong, but could affect how others perceive it.\n"
