Overall, he\u2019s a great person and I hope that we can stay friends, despite what happened. \n\nBasically, a few weeks ago, we were having drinks at his apartment. He said there was something he wanted to tell me and he hoped I wouldn\u2019t judge. I said okay (obviously nervous). He told me that he thinks he\u2019s bi. I asked what makes him think that and he finally admitted that he had hooked up with a few guys before me. \n\nNow, I just want to clarify that I don\u2019t care if a person is gay, bi, whatever. You only get one life and you should try to find happiness. But I have never (as far as I know) dated a guy who wasn\u2019t straight. So I was a little taken aback. \n\nThe rest of the night was somewhat awkward and we ended up just going to sleep. Over the next several days I started thinking of our relationship. We don\u2019t have sex that often for a young couple. Maybe once a week (always been that way). And when we do have sex I usually initiate. I\u2019m not bothered by the frequency  but I started questioning whether my boyfriend might just be gay and using me to cover that up. I started getting paranoid over whether he\u2019s even attracted to me (he compliments me on my appearance but I\u2019ve never felt...lust). \n\nAnyway I ended up breaking up with him. He said it was because he\u2019s bi and I denied that was the reason. I blamed the break up on some personal stuff I\u2019m going through and said I needed time alone. \n\nBut that was actually a lie. If he hadn\u2019t disclosed that stuff about his sexuality, I have no doubt we\u2019d still be together. I just couldn\u2019t get past it for some reason. \n\nAITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for breaking up with her boyfriend after he confessed he's bisexual. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author is a 24-year-old woman who was in a two-year relationship with a 26-year-old guy. The boyfriend told her he's bisexual and had hooked up with guys before. The author says she doesn't care about someone's sexuality but had only been with straight guys. She was taken aback, and after some days of thinking, she broke up, lying about the reason. She admits if he hadn't come out, they'd still be together. The question is whether she's at fault.\n\nHmm, so the main points here are the boyfriend's bisexuality and the author's reaction. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. Let's see. The author isn't judging his sexuality, but her personal experience with straight guys made her uncomfortable. She felt he might be using her to \"cover up\" being gay, which led to her breaking up. But she's lying about the reason, so he might be confused or hurt.\n\nNow, the key is whether it's fair to break up over his sexuality. Since the author mentions she doesn't care about being gay or bi, but was uncomfortable about possible hidden motives. But if the relationship wasn't fulfilling in terms of intimacy (sex once a week, she initiates), maybe that's a separate issue. But the breakup was directly after the confession, so it's tied to his sexuality. \n\nWait, the author is not directly addressing whether the bisexuality itself is the problem. She's worried about him not being attracted to her, even though he compliments her. So maybe she felt insecure or there were other issues. However, the main reason she cites is his bisexuality, even if she's lying about it. \n\nFrom a fairness perspective, if the author was uncomfortable with his bisexuality, even if she says she's not judgmental, it's still a personal conflict. But is that making her wrong? Or is it just a personal incompatibility? Also, she broke up before addressing the real reason, which could be hurtful. But people have different tolerances and comfort levels. \n\nThe boyfriend might have felt betrayed or that she didn't handle it well, but if she's not in a position to accept a partner's bisexuality, maybe it's her choice. But lying about the reason and then breaking up seems a bit inconsiderate. \n\nI think the core is that the author's discomfort stems from her lack of experience and possible insecurities. If she can't accept his sexuality, even if she claims she does, then the breakup might be because of her own issues rather than his actions. That could make her at fault. However, if she's honest about her feelings, maybe it's a mutual decision. But since she lied and ended the relationship, it's not entirely his fault. \n\nSo the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because she ended the relationship based on her own insecurities and didn't handle the situation with honesty and respect. But others might say it's B (not in the wrong) because it's her choice and she had her reasons. Need to consider the community's typical responses. In AITA contexts, people often say it's a personal choice if there's no malice. But lying about the reason could be seen as a problem.\n"
