Overall, he\u2019s a great person and I hope that we can stay friends, despite what happened. \n\nBasically, a few weeks ago, we were having drinks at his apartment. He said there was something he wanted to tell me and he hoped I wouldn\u2019t judge. I said okay (obviously nervous). He told me that he thinks he\u2019s bi. I asked what makes him think that and he finally admitted that he had hooked up with a few guys before me. \n\nNow, I just want to clarify that I don\u2019t care if a person is gay, bi, whatever. You only get one life and you should try to find happiness. But I have never (as far as I know) dated a guy who wasn\u2019t straight. So I was a little taken aback. \n\nThe rest of the night was somewhat awkward and we ended up just going to sleep. Over the next several days I started thinking of our relationship. We don\u2019t have sex that often for a young couple. Maybe once a week (always been that way). And when we do have sex I usually initiate. I\u2019m not bothered by the frequency  but I started questioning whether my boyfriend might just be gay and using me to cover that up. I started getting paranoid over whether he\u2019s even attracted to me (he compliments me on my appearance but I\u2019ve never felt...lust). \n\nAnyway I ended up breaking up with him. He said it was because he\u2019s bi and I denied that was the reason. I blamed the break up on some personal stuff I\u2019m going through and said I needed time alone. \n\nBut that was actually a lie. If he hadn\u2019t disclosed that stuff about his sexuality, I have no doubt we\u2019d still be together. I just couldn\u2019t get past it for some reason. \n\nAITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who asked \"Am I the Asshole?\" (AITA) is in the wrong for breaking up with her boyfriend after he came out as bisexual.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The girlfriend (24F) was in a two-year relationship with her boyfriend (26M). He told her he's bisexual and had hooked up with guys before. She doesn't have an issue with his sexuality in general but wasn't used to dating someone not straight. The relationship had infrequent sex, usually initiated by her, and she started questioning if he was even attracted to her. She then broke up with him but lied about the reason, saying it was personal issues instead of his bisexuality.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but they want my opinion. The options are A (yes, wrong) or B (no, not wrong).\n\nSo, considering the situation: Is it fair to break up because someone is bisexual if you're not comfortable with it? The woman stated she didn't care about his orientation but was taken aback because she hadn't dated non-straight people before. She ended the relationship because she couldn't get past the fact that he was bisexual. However, he wasn't in the relationship to hide his sexuality; he came clean. The user's main point was that she couldn't deal with the fact that his past experiences with men made her question his attraction to her. \n\nFrom a relationship standpoint, if you can't accept your partner's true self, including their sexuality, it's not a deal-breaker for some but for others, it might be. The question is whether being in a relationship with a bisexual partner is a valid reason for a breakup. Since she admitted she wasn't comfortable with it and couldn't move past it, even if he was honest, it's a personal choice. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, if the issue is about authenticity and honesty, the boyfriend did the right thing by being upfront. The woman had the right to end the relationship if his bisexuality was a deal-breaker for her. However, lying about the reason for the breakup could be seen as dishonest. But the main question is about whether she's in the wrong for the breakup itself. Since the decision is based on her personal inability to accept his sexuality, it's not necessarily her fault. People have different boundaries, and if she can't accept that, ending the relationship is her choice.\n\nTherefore, the answer would be B (not in the wrong) because she had the right to end the relationship if his sexuality made her uncomfortable, even if it's not a matter of right or wrong in a moral sense, but rather a personal compatibility issue.\n"
