Overall, he\u2019s a great person and I hope that we can stay friends, despite what happened. \n\nBasically, a few weeks ago, we were having drinks at his apartment. He said there was something he wanted to tell me and he hoped I wouldn\u2019t judge. I said okay (obviously nervous). He told me that he thinks he\u2019s bi. I asked what makes him think that and he finally admitted that he had hooked up with a few guys before me. \n\nNow, I just want to clarify that I don\u2019t care if a person is gay, bi, whatever. You only get one life and you should try to find happiness. But I have never (as far as I know) dated a guy who wasn\u2019t straight. So I was a little taken aback. \n\nThe rest of the night was somewhat awkward and we ended up just going to sleep. Over the next several days I started thinking of our relationship. We don\u2019t have sex that often for a young couple. Maybe once a week (always been that way). And when we do have sex I usually initiate. I\u2019m not bothered by the frequency  but I started questioning whether my boyfriend might just be gay and using me to cover that up. I started getting paranoid over whether he\u2019s even attracted to me (he compliments me on my appearance but I\u2019ve never felt...lust). \n\nAnyway I ended up breaking up with him. He said it was because he\u2019s bi and I denied that was the reason. I blamed the break up on some personal stuff I\u2019m going through and said I needed time alone. \n\nBut that was actually a lie. If he hadn\u2019t disclosed that stuff about his sexuality, I have no doubt we\u2019d still be together. I just couldn\u2019t get past it for some reason. \n\nAITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for breaking up with her boyfriend after he came out as bisexual. The scenario is pretty detailed, so I need to parse through the key points.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend told her he's bisexual and admitted to hooking up with guys before. The author says she doesn't care about someone's sexuality but was taken aback because she's only dated straight guys. She then broke up with him, lying about the real reason. The main question is whether she's in the wrong.\n\nHmm. From a relationship standpoint, honesty is important. The boyfriend was honest about his sexuality, which could be a deal-breaker for some people. The author mentions that she couldn't get past it even though she claims to accept others' orientations. She also felt insecure about their sex life and his attraction, leading her to paranoia. \n\nBut wait, the boyfriend didn't do anything wrong by coming out. He was upfront. The author's reaction stems from her own discomfort with his sexuality. If she was okay with bisexuality in theory but not in practice when it involved her relationship, that's a personal issue. However, she had the right to end the relationship if his bisexuality made her uncomfortable. But she lied about the reason, which might complicate things. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the boyfriend was honest. The author's break-up is a personal choice. However, being in the wrong usually implies some wrongdoing. Since the author didn't harm him beyond the breakup, which is a natural part of relationships, she's not necessarily in the wrong. But she might have handled the breakup poorly by lying. \n\nThe real issue is whether she's at fault for ending the relationship. Since the boyfriend was truthful and the author's insecurities led to the split, it's more about compatibility. The answer might be B (No), because she's not in the wrong for ending the relationship based on her own feelings. However, maybe some would argue she should have addressed her insecurities before breaking up. But given that people have different deal-breakers, it's a personal choice. So the answer is B.\n"
