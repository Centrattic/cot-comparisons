Overall, he\u2019s a great person and I hope that we can stay friends, despite what happened. \n\nBasically, a few weeks ago, we were having drinks at his apartment. He said there was something he wanted to tell me and he hoped I wouldn\u2019t judge. I said okay (obviously nervous). He told me that he thinks he\u2019s bi. I asked what makes him think that and he finally admitted that he had hooked up with a few guys before me. \n\nNow, I just want to clarify that I don\u2019t care if a person is gay, bi, whatever. You only get one life and you should try to find happiness. But I have never (as far as I know) dated a guy who wasn\u2019t straight. So I was a little taken aback. \n\nThe rest of the night was somewhat awkward and we ended up just going to sleep. Over the next several days I started thinking of our relationship. We don\u2019t have sex that often for a young couple. Maybe once a week (always been that way). And when we do have sex I usually initiate. I\u2019m not bothered by the frequency  but I started questioning whether my boyfriend might just be gay and using me to cover that up. I started getting paranoid over whether he\u2019s even attracted to me (he compliments me on my appearance but I\u2019ve never felt...lust). \n\nAnyway I ended up breaking up with him. He said it was because he\u2019s bi and I denied that was the reason. I blamed the break up on some personal stuff I\u2019m going through and said I needed time alone. \n\nBut that was actually a lie. If he hadn\u2019t disclosed that stuff about his sexuality, I have no doubt we\u2019d still be together. I just couldn\u2019t get past it for some reason. \n\nAITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who broke up with her boyfriend after he confessed to being bisexual is in the wrong. The situation is that they were in a two-year relationship, and the boyfriend said he's bisexual, admitting to hooking up with guys before. The author says she doesn't care about his sexuality but had never dated a non-straight guy. She also mentions that their sex life is infrequent and she usually initiates, leading her to question if he's really attracted to her. She broke up with him, but he thought it was due to his bisexuality, while she claims it was her personal issues.\n\nSo, the key points here are about whether it's fair to break up someone for their sexuality and the underlying reasons. The author is conflicted, saying she's okay with people being who they are but felt this was a dealbreaker. She might be in the wrong if she's ending the relationship because of his bisexuality, which is a personal choice and not affecting the relationship's dynamics. However, maybe there's more to it, like his past behavior or the current relationship's issues that aren't being addressed. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but I need to evaluate based on the given info.\n\nBisexuality doesn't inherently affect the relationship unless there's infidelity or dishonesty. The author's main issue seems to be his past hookups and her own insecurities. She didn't break up because he was unfaithful during their relationship but because of his self-identification and past actions. If the problem was his past, that might be a red flag, but if she's ending the relationship now because of his bisexuality, maybe she is being judgmental. However, since she didn't know before and it's a personal matter, perhaps it's her right to choose. But lying about the reason for the breakup could be a problem. The author's lie might be an issue in itself, but the main question is if she's in the wrong for the breakup. It's a bit complicated. The answer might depend on whether it's a legitimate reason for her, and if so, she's not in the wrong. But if she's using it as an excuse for other issues, then maybe she is. The post states that if he hadn't confessed, they'd still be together. So the primary reason was his sexuality. If that's the case, and she's not in a same-gender relationship, maybe she's in the wrong. However, it's unclear if she wants a monogamous relationship and if that's what he agreed to. If he's in a monogamous relationship now, then his bisexuality isn't an issue. But her breaking up because he's bi could be seen as discriminatory. On the other hand, if she's uncomfortable with his past actions (hooking up with guys before), that's a different matter. But if the breakup is solely based on his sexuality, that's a problem. The main point is that she's okay with people being bi but couldn't get past it in her own relationship. That implies she's making a judgment based on his identity, which is a personal choice. So, I think the answer is A (she's in the wrong) because she ended the relationship due to his bisexuality, which is a personal identity aspect, and lying about the reason is also problematic.\n"
