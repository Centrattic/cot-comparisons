Overall, he\u2019s a great person and I hope that we can stay friends, despite what happened. \n\nBasically, a few weeks ago, we were having drinks at his apartment. He said there was something he wanted to tell me and he hoped I wouldn\u2019t judge. I said okay (obviously nervous). He told me that he thinks he\u2019s bi. I asked what makes him think that and he finally admitted that he had hooked up with a few guys before me. \n\nNow, I just want to clarify that I don\u2019t care if a person is gay, bi, whatever. You only get one life and you should try to find happiness. But I have never (as far as I know) dated a guy who wasn\u2019t straight. So I was a little taken aback. \n\nThe rest of the night was somewhat awkward and we ended up just going to sleep. Over the next several days I started thinking of our relationship. We don\u2019t have sex that often for a young couple. Maybe once a week (always been that way). And when we do have sex I usually initiate. I\u2019m not bothered by the frequency  but I started questioning whether my boyfriend might just be gay and using me to cover that up. I started getting paranoid over whether he\u2019s even attracted to me (he compliments me on my appearance but I\u2019ve never felt...lust). \n\nAnyway I ended up breaking up with him. He said it was because he\u2019s bi and I denied that was the reason. I blamed the break up on some personal stuff I\u2019m going through and said I needed time alone. \n\nBut that was actually a lie. If he hadn\u2019t disclosed that stuff about his sexuality, I have no doubt we\u2019d still be together. I just couldn\u2019t get past it for some reason. \n\nAITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for breaking up with her boyfriend after he came out as bisexual. So the situation is that the boyfriend told her he's bisexual and had hooked up with guys before. The author says she doesn't care about his sexuality but ends the relationship because she's unsure if he's really into her. The boyfriend claims it was about his bisexuality, but she denies that's the reason.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The boyfriend came out to her, which is a big step. The author says she's not judgmental about his sexuality but was still affected by the revelation. She felt something was off in their relationship, like the lack of frequent sex and her initiating most of the time. She ended the relationship, attributing it to personal issues but later admits she couldn't get past the bisexuality.\n\nNow, the question is whether she's in the wrong. From a relationship ethics standpoint, is it wrong to end a relationship because of a partner's sexual orientation? In most cases, especially in modern contexts, people are expected to accept their partner's sexuality. However, the author isn't being judgmental about his identity per se, but rather the fact that he might not be attracted to her in a sexual way, which is affecting their intimacy. She's concerned that he might be using her to cover up being gay, which makes her uncomfortable.\n\nBut wait, bisexuality is attraction to both genders, so it's possible he is still attracted to her. However, the lack of sexual activity initiated by him is a red flag. Maybe the relationship was lacking in the intimacy department regardless of his sexuality. So she's breaking up because she's unsure about his attraction to her, which is a valid reason. However, she's hiding the real reason from him, which could be seen as dishonest. But she's also honest with herself about why she broke up.\n\nThe boyfriend might feel wronged because he came clean, and she ended the relationship, possibly leading him to believe that being bisexual is a deal-breaker for her. But the author isn't rejecting bisexuality itself; she's questioning whether he's actually attracted to her. So is she wrong for that? If someone is in a relationship and feels that their partner isn't sexually attracted to them, ending the relationship is understandable. But if she's using his sexuality as an excuse for her own insecurities, that's different. However, she's clear that she doesn't care about his orientation but is concerned about the lack of sexual connection. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's tricky. Ending a relationship isn't usually considered \"wrong\" if it's for personal reasons. The key is whether she acted with integrity. She was honest with herself, even if she didn't share the full story with him. He might feel hurt, but she's not being malicious. So maybe the answer is B, she's not in the wrong. However, some might argue that she should have worked through her insecurities instead of ending it. But given the information, her decision seems reasonable based on her own feelings and the state of their relationship.\n"
