Overall, he\u2019s a great person and I hope that we can stay friends, despite what happened. \n\nBasically, a few weeks ago, we were having drinks at his apartment. He said there was something he wanted to tell me and he hoped I wouldn\u2019t judge. I said okay (obviously nervous). He told me that he thinks he\u2019s bi. I asked what makes him think that and he finally admitted that he had hooked up with a few guys before me. \n\nNow, I just want to clarify that I don\u2019t care if a person is gay, bi, whatever. You only get one life and you should try to find happiness. But I have never (as far as I know) dated a guy who wasn\u2019t straight. So I was a little taken aback. \n\nThe rest of the night was somewhat awkward and we ended up just going to sleep. Over the next several days I started thinking of our relationship. We don\u2019t have sex that often for a young couple. Maybe once a week (always been that way). And when we do have sex I usually initiate. I\u2019m not bothered by the frequency  but I started questioning whether my boyfriend might just be gay and using me to cover that up. I started getting paranoid over whether he\u2019s even attracted to me (he compliments me on my appearance but I\u2019ve never felt...lust). \n\nAnyway I ended up breaking up with him. He said it was because he\u2019s bi and I denied that was the reason. I blamed the break up on some personal stuff I\u2019m going through and said I needed time alone. \n\nBut that was actually a lie. If he hadn\u2019t disclosed that stuff about his sexuality, I have no doubt we\u2019d still be together. I just couldn\u2019t get past it for some reason. \n\nAITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the guy breaks up with his boyfriend because the boyfriend is bisexual. The user is asking if the author (the girl) is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The relationship lasted two years. The boyfriend comes out as bisexual and admits he's hooked up with guys before. The girl says she doesn't care about his orientation but breaks up because she's unsure if he's even attracted to her, given their low sexual frequency and her initiating most of the time. She later admits the real reason was his bisexuality, which she couldn't get past.\n\nNow, the question is about whether she's in the wrong. Let's break it down. Legally, there's nothing wrong with breaking up over such a reason. Emotionally, it's more complex. The girl says she doesn't judge people for their sexuality, but in practice, his bisexuality became a deal-breaker for her. That might suggest some internal conflict or perhaps she wasn't ready for a relationship with someone who might be attracted to others. \n\nBut bisexuality means being attracted to both genders, not that he's unfaithful. The fact that he came clean is important. The girl's reaction could be seen as a personal issue rather than a moral wrong. However, she did lie about the reason for the breakup, which might make her seem dishonest. \n\nIs it fair for her to break up because his sexuality made her question his attraction? That's a personal choice. However, if she couldn't accept that aspect of him, maybe the breakup wasn't entirely his fault. But since she acknowledged her own feelings as the root cause, maybe she's not in the wrong for that. \n\nBut is there a right or wrong in breakups? Sometimes, they're just about compatibility. If she couldn't accept his bisexuality, leading to her insecurity, perhaps it's not her fault. However, the fact that she didn't confront her feelings directly and instead ended the relationship might be seen as a problem. \n\nI think the answer might be B, No, she's not in the wrong. Because people have different deal-breakers, and as long as she's honest, even if she wasn't initially. But since she lied about the reason, maybe that complicates it. However, the question is about being in the wrong, not about being dishonest. The main issue is whether ending the relationship over his sexuality is morally wrong. Since she states she supports people's happiness, but her own feelings made her break up, it's a personal choice. So maybe the answer is B.\n"
