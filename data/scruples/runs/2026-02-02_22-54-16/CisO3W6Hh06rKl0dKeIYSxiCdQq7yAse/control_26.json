Overall, he\u2019s a great person and I hope that we can stay friends, despite what happened. \n\nBasically, a few weeks ago, we were having drinks at his apartment. He said there was something he wanted to tell me and he hoped I wouldn\u2019t judge. I said okay (obviously nervous). He told me that he thinks he\u2019s bi. I asked what makes him think that and he finally admitted that he had hooked up with a few guys before me. \n\nNow, I just want to clarify that I don\u2019t care if a person is gay, bi, whatever. You only get one life and you should try to find happiness. But I have never (as far as I know) dated a guy who wasn\u2019t straight. So I was a little taken aback. \n\nThe rest of the night was somewhat awkward and we ended up just going to sleep. Over the next several days I started thinking of our relationship. We don\u2019t have sex that often for a young couple. Maybe once a week (always been that way). And when we do have sex I usually initiate. I\u2019m not bothered by the frequency  but I started questioning whether my boyfriend might just be gay and using me to cover that up. I started getting paranoid over whether he\u2019s even attracted to me (he compliments me on my appearance but I\u2019ve never felt...lust). \n\nAnyway I ended up breaking up with him. He said it was because he\u2019s bi and I denied that was the reason. I blamed the break up on some personal stuff I\u2019m going through and said I needed time alone. \n\nBut that was actually a lie. If he hadn\u2019t disclosed that stuff about his sexuality, I have no doubt we\u2019d still be together. I just couldn\u2019t get past it for some reason. \n\nAITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The scenario is that the author broke up with their boyfriend after he confessed to being bisexual and having hooked up with men before. The author says they don't care about his sexuality in general but felt conflicted because he might not be attracted to them, leading to the breakup.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if the author's actions were justified. The boyfriend was honest about his bisexuality and past experiences. The author claims that they don't judge, but the breakup happened because they couldn't get past his bisexuality. They mentioned feeling paranoid about whether he's attracted to them and the infrequent sex initiated by the author. \n\nThe key points here are about honesty and compatibility. The boyfriend was upfront about his sexuality, which is a valid reason for someone to reconsider the relationship if it's a deal-breaker. However, the author is denying that their issue was his sexuality, which might indicate they're not being entirely honest with themselves or their partner. \n\nIn relationships, it's important that both partners are comfortable with each other's identities and past. If the author realized that their boyfriend's bisexuality made them uncomfortable, even if they claim not to care, then breaking up could be seen as a personal choice based on their own feelings. It's not about right or wrong in a moral sense but about mutual compatibility.\n\nHowever, the author might be in the wrong if they didn't communicate their feelings openly. Instead of addressing the issue, they lied about the reason for the breakup. Honesty is crucial in relationships, so not being transparent about why the relationship ended could be problematic. \n\nOn the other hand, the author isn't obligated to stay in a relationship if they feel their needs aren't met. If they felt uncertain about his attraction and couldn't move past it, breaking up might be their right. But the fact that they didn't confront the issue directly and instead lied could be seen as unfair to the ex. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author's decision was based on their personal feelings, but the way they handled the breakup (lying) might make them partially at fault. However, the core reason for breaking up is a personal choice regarding compatibility. The answer might be that the author isn't in the wrong because they have the right to their feelings, even if their approach could have been better.\n"
