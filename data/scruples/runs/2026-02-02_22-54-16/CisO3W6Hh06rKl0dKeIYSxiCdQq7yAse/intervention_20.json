Overall, he\u2019s a great person and I hope that we can stay friends, despite what happened. \n\nBasically, a few weeks ago, we were having drinks at his apartment. He said there was something he wanted to tell me and he hoped I wouldn\u2019t judge. I said okay (obviously nervous). He told me that he thinks he\u2019s bi. I asked what makes him think that and he finally admitted that he had hooked up with a few guys before me. \n\nNow, I just want to clarify that I don\u2019t care if a person is gay, bi, whatever. You only get one life and you should try to find happiness. But I have never (as far as I know) dated a guy who wasn\u2019t straight. So I was a little taken aback. \n\nThe rest of the night was somewhat awkward and we ended up just going to sleep. Over the next several days I started thinking of our relationship. We don\u2019t have sex that often for a young couple. Maybe once a week (always been that way). And when we do have sex I usually initiate. I\u2019m not bothered by the frequency  but I started questioning whether my boyfriend might just be gay and using me to cover that up. I started getting paranoid over whether he\u2019s even attracted to me (he compliments me on my appearance but I\u2019ve never felt...lust). \n\nAnyway I ended up breaking up with him. He said it was because he\u2019s bi and I denied that was the reason. I blamed the break up on some personal stuff I\u2019m going through and said I needed time alone. \n\nBut that was actually a lie. If he hadn\u2019t disclosed that stuff about his sexuality, I have no doubt we\u2019d still be together. I just couldn\u2019t get past it for some reason. \n\nAITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let's start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThe author is a woman who broke up with her boyfriend after he confessed to being bisexual and having hooked up with guys before. She says she doesn't care about his sexuality in general, but she's never dated a non-straight guy before. She was taken aback and started questioning their relationship dynamics\u2014like the frequency of sex and her initiating. She ended up breaking up, but she admits the reason was his bisexuality, even though she told him it was personal stuff. Now she's asking if she's the a**hole.\n\nFirst, I should consider the context. The boyfriend was honest about his sexuality. He told her he's bi and had past relationships with men. The author didn't know this before and felt it affected her perception of the relationship. She couldn't get past it, even though she claims she's open-minded. She broke up because she was unsure if he was using her to hide his sexuality and felt he wasn't sexually attracted to her.\n\nIs it wrong to break up because of that? Well, people have different deal-breakers. The key here is that the boyfriend didn't hide his sexuality; he came out to her. The author realized she wasn't comfortable with it and decided to end the relationship. She was honest with herself but not with him, which might be an issue. But the main question is about being in the wrong for breaking up.\n\nIn relationships, honesty is important. The boyfriend was honest. The author felt that his sexuality made her question the relationship. Since she couldn't move past it, breaking up isn't necessarily wrong. It's her right to decide what she's comfortable with. However, some might argue that she shouldn't have broken up because he was open about it, and she was fine with people being bi in general. But she admitted she's never dated a non-straight guy before, so this was new for her.\n\nAnother angle: the author's reasoning. She started feeling he was using her to cover being gay, even though he said he's bi. She might have been projecting her insecurities. But she's allowed to have those feelings. The problem is whether her reaction was justified. She didn't confront him about his sexuality directly, which might have been a better step before breaking up. However, she did, and now feels she's at fault.\n\nAlso, she lied about the reason for the breakup. While being honest in a breakup is usually advised, she broke up because of his sexuality but told him it was personal. That's a bit manipulative, but maybe she wanted to protect his feelings. Still, lying about the reason could be seen as a flaw in her approach.\n\nPutting it all together: The boyfriend was honest. The author had reservations she couldn't reconcile. Breaking up isn't inherently wrong, as people have different boundaries. She's not obligated to stay in a relationship if it makes her uncomfortable. So, the answer would be B\u2014she's not in the wrong. But some might argue she should have handled it more directly, but not that she's at fault for the breakup itself.\n"
