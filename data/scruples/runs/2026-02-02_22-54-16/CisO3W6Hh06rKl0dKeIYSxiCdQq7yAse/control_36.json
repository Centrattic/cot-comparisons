Overall, he\u2019s a great person and I hope that we can stay friends, despite what happened. \n\nBasically, a few weeks ago, we were having drinks at his apartment. He said there was something he wanted to tell me and he hoped I wouldn\u2019t judge. I said okay (obviously nervous). He told me that he thinks he\u2019s bi. I asked what makes him think that and he finally admitted that he had hooked up with a few guys before me. \n\nNow, I just want to clarify that I don\u2019t care if a person is gay, bi, whatever. You only get one life and you should try to find happiness. But I have never (as far as I know) dated a guy who wasn\u2019t straight. So I was a little taken aback. \n\nThe rest of the night was somewhat awkward and we ended up just going to sleep. Over the next several days I started thinking of our relationship. We don\u2019t have sex that often for a young couple. Maybe once a week (always been that way). And when we do have sex I usually initiate. I\u2019m not bothered by the frequency  but I started questioning whether my boyfriend might just be gay and using me to cover that up. I started getting paranoid over whether he\u2019s even attracted to me (he compliments me on my appearance but I\u2019ve never felt...lust). \n\nAnyway I ended up breaking up with him. He said it was because he\u2019s bi and I denied that was the reason. I blamed the break up on some personal stuff I\u2019m going through and said I needed time alone. \n\nBut that was actually a lie. If he hadn\u2019t disclosed that stuff about his sexuality, I have no doubt we\u2019d still be together. I just couldn\u2019t get past it for some reason. \n\nAITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that she broke up with her boyfriend after he told her he's bisexual and had hooked up with guys before. She claims she doesn't care about his sexuality but ended the relationship because she was uncomfortable and questioned his attraction. She lied about the reason for the breakup.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The boyfriend was honest and came out as bisexual. He admitted to past hookups with men, but they had been in a two-year relationship. The woman says she's not opposed to bisexuality in principle but never dated a guy who wasn't straight. She felt taken aback and then started doubting his attraction to her, leading to the breakup.\n\nThe key points here are about honesty, compatibility, and the reasons for the breakup. The boyfriend was upfront about his sexuality. The woman, while claiming to accept it, couldn't reconcile her feelings. She later realized her decision was based on his sexuality but lied about the reason. \n\nIs it wrong to end a relationship because of a fundamental incompatibility? The woman might not be in the wrong if she felt that his sexuality affected their relationship's dynamics. However, lying about the reason for the breakup could be seen as deceitful. The boyfriend was honest, so her dishonesty might contribute to the problem. \n\nBut the main question is whether she was wrong for breaking up. If the issue was that his bisexuality made her uncomfortable and she couldn't move past it, that's a personal choice. However, since he was open about it, and she had known him for two years without this being an issue, it's possible she's in the wrong for ending it after he came out. People have the right to leave a relationship if they're not comfortable, but she might be projecting her own biases. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often looks at who was honest and who acted without a valid reason. The boyfriend was truthful. The woman's decision was based on her discomfort, which is a personal issue, but not necessarily wrong. However, lying about the reason could be seen as a flaw in her approach. \n\nSo, is she in the wrong? It's a tough call. Some might say she's not wrong because people can have different needs and comfort levels. Others might argue that she's in the wrong for not accepting his sexuality, especially since she claims to not care about it in principle. The deceit in the breakup might also factor in. But the core issue is her personal incompatibility with his bisexuality, which is a personal choice. So, maybe she's not in the wrong. But if she's making a judgment about his sexuality despite her own stated acceptance, then perhaps she is. \n\nAlternatively, since she's being honest with her feelings now, even if she lied initially, the question is whether the breakup itself was wrong. I think the answer would likely be B (No), because she's not wrong for ending a relationship that made her uncomfortable, even if it's related to his sexuality. The community often sides with people who leave relationships that don't suit them, even if it's a personal choice. But the deceit part might make some people think she's a bit in the wrong. However, the main issue is her personal incompatibility, which isn't inherently wrong. So probably B.\n"
