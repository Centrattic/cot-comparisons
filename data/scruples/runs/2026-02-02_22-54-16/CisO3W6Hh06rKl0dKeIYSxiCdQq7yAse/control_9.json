Overall, he\u2019s a great person and I hope that we can stay friends, despite what happened. \n\nBasically, a few weeks ago, we were having drinks at his apartment. He said there was something he wanted to tell me and he hoped I wouldn\u2019t judge. I said okay (obviously nervous). He told me that he thinks he\u2019s bi. I asked what makes him think that and he finally admitted that he had hooked up with a few guys before me. \n\nNow, I just want to clarify that I don\u2019t care if a person is gay, bi, whatever. You only get one life and you should try to find happiness. But I have never (as far as I know) dated a guy who wasn\u2019t straight. So I was a little taken aback. \n\nThe rest of the night was somewhat awkward and we ended up just going to sleep. Over the next several days I started thinking of our relationship. We don\u2019t have sex that often for a young couple. Maybe once a week (always been that way). And when we do have sex I usually initiate. I\u2019m not bothered by the frequency  but I started questioning whether my boyfriend might just be gay and using me to cover that up. I started getting paranoid over whether he\u2019s even attracted to me (he compliments me on my appearance but I\u2019ve never felt...lust). \n\nAnyway I ended up breaking up with him. He said it was because he\u2019s bi and I denied that was the reason. I blamed the break up on some personal stuff I\u2019m going through and said I needed time alone. \n\nBut that was actually a lie. If he hadn\u2019t disclosed that stuff about his sexuality, I have no doubt we\u2019d still be together. I just couldn\u2019t get past it for some reason. \n\nAITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who broke up with their boyfriend because he's bisexual is in the wrong. \n\nFirst, the boyfriend came out as bisexual and mentioned he had hooked up with guys before. The author says they don't care about someone's sexuality but were taken aback because they've only dated straight guys. They started questioning the relationship, feeling maybe he wasn't really into them, and eventually broke up but lied about the reason.\n\nSo, the key points here: Was the breakup justified? The author admits that the bisexual aspect was the real reason, but they lied about it. The boyfriend didn't hide it; he came out to her. The author had two years with him, and only now, after this confession, things fell apart. \n\nNow, in relationships, honesty is important. The boyfriend was honest about his sexuality, which is a valid part of his identity. The author might have had underlying insecurities about the lack of sex and initiation, but those issues were there before the confession. The fact that the breakup happened immediately after he came out could suggest that the author's discomfort with his bisexuality was the real issue, even if they don't see themselves as judgmental. \n\nAlso, the author's reasoning that they can't move past it despite claiming not to care about orientation is contradictory. If they truly don't care, why let it affect them? But maybe they need time to process. However, the decision to break up because someone is bisexual when it's not a dealbreaker for them (they claim) might be seen as unfair. \n\nOn the other hand, if the author felt that the relationship wasn't working due to other factors, then the breakup isn't entirely about his sexuality. But the user is asking if the author is in the wrong specifically because the breakup was caused by the boyfriend's bisexuality. \n\nIn many views, being bisexual is a valid sexual orientation, and it's not the boyfriend's fault. The author's inability to accept it, even if they say they don't care, might make them the one in the wrong. However, people have different boundaries, and the author might feel it's incompatible with their own needs, even if unconsciously. \n\nBut since the author admitted they couldn't get past it, even though they tried to rationalize it, that might indicate they are not in the wrong for ending the relationship. But lying about the reason could be seen as dishonest. However, the main question is about being in the wrong for breaking up. \n\nConsidering all this, the answer might hinge on whether the author had a legitimate reason. If they were already having issues like low sexual frequency and their own insecurities, and the bisexuality just pushed them over the edge, then maybe not entirely their fault. But if the bisexuality itself was the primary issue, then maybe they are at fault for not being able to accept his identity. \n\nBut given that the user says they don't care about orientation, but still broke up, it's more about their personal incompatibility. So the answer is probably B (No, the author isn't in the wrong) because they made a choice based on their own feelings, even if it was uncomfortable. However, some might argue that being bisexual isn't a reason to break up if you say you don't care. But since they admitted their own feelings of insecurity existed before, it's a mix. \n\nBut in the context of the AITA format, usually, if someone breaks up over a sexual orientation that's not a dealbreaker and they can't get past it, they might be seen as AT (answer A). But the user claims they don't care, so maybe not. Hmm. This is tricky. \n\nWait, the user says they don't care about orientation, but they were taken aback. The problem arose because they started questioning if he was using them to cover being gay. That's where the real issue is. The author's insecurity might be their own issue rather than the boyfriend's. So the author's decision to break up is based on their own unresolved feelings rather than the boyfriend's actions. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not addressing their own issues and projecting them onto the boyfriend. \n\nSo, considering all angles, the answer is likely A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because they broke up due to their own insecurities rather than the boyfriend's wrongdoings. But I need to be careful here. The boyfriend was honest, and the author's reaction is perhaps due to their own biases, even if unacknowledged. So, yes, the author is at fault here.\n"
