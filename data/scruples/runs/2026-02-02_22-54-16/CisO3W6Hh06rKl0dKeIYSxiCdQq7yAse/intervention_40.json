Overall, he\u2019s a great person and I hope that we can stay friends, despite what happened. \n\nBasically, a few weeks ago, we were having drinks at his apartment. He said there was something he wanted to tell me and he hoped I wouldn\u2019t judge. I said okay (obviously nervous). He told me that he thinks he\u2019s bi. I asked what makes him think that and he finally admitted that he had hooked up with a few guys before me. \n\nNow, I just want to clarify that I don\u2019t care if a person is gay, bi, whatever. You only get one life and you should try to find happiness. But I have never (as far as I know) dated a guy who wasn\u2019t straight. So I was a little taken aback. \n\nThe rest of the night was somewhat awkward and we ended up just going to sleep. Over the next several days I started thinking of our relationship. We don\u2019t have sex that often for a young couple. Maybe once a week (always been that way). And when we do have sex I usually initiate. I\u2019m not bothered by the frequency  but I started questioning whether my boyfriend might just be gay and using me to cover that up. I started getting paranoid over whether he\u2019s even attracted to me (he compliments me on my appearance but I\u2019ve never felt...lust). \n\nAnyway I ended up breaking up with him. He said it was because he\u2019s bi and I denied that was the reason. I blamed the break up on some personal stuff I\u2019m going through and said I needed time alone. \n\nBut that was actually a lie. If he hadn\u2019t disclosed that stuff about his sexuality, I have no doubt we\u2019d still be together. I just couldn\u2019t get past it for some reason. \n\nAITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who broke up with their boyfriend because he's bisexual is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the situation: the boyfriend came out as bi, admitted to hooking up with guys before. The author says they don't care about someone's sexuality, but this was a shock. They dated for two years. The relationship had some issues like low sexual frequency and the author initiating. The author then broke up, but admitted the real reason was his bisexuality, even though they told him it was due to personal stuff.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't wrong, but wants confirmation. Hmm. Well, being bisexual isn't a reason to break up unless it's a dealbreaker for the person. The author says they don't care about others' sexuality, but maybe they realized they were uncomfortable with it after the fact. The boyfriend didn't hide it but came out when asked. The author felt it made them question his attraction to her. \n\nIs the author wrong? Well, if the author can't accept their partner's sexuality, that's a personal issue. However, breaking up because someone is bi might be seen as invalid if the author previously said they don't care. But maybe they realized they couldn't handle it despite their initial thoughts. The key here is whether the author's feelings are valid. People have different boundaries. If the author can't accept a partner who has attractions or past interactions with others of the same sex, even in a monogamous relationship, then maybe it's a personal choice. \n\nBut some might argue that being bisexual doesn't affect the relationship's fidelity if he's monogamous. The author's issues might stem from insecurity or lack of attraction, not the bisexuality itself. However, the decision to break up is a personal one. The author isn't wrong for choosing to leave if they can't be happy despite the reasons. So, maybe the answer is B.\n"
