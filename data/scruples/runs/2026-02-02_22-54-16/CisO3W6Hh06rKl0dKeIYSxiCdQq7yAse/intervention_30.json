Overall, he\u2019s a great person and I hope that we can stay friends, despite what happened. \n\nBasically, a few weeks ago, we were having drinks at his apartment. He said there was something he wanted to tell me and he hoped I wouldn\u2019t judge. I said okay (obviously nervous). He told me that he thinks he\u2019s bi. I asked what makes him think that and he finally admitted that he had hooked up with a few guys before me. \n\nNow, I just want to clarify that I don\u2019t care if a person is gay, bi, whatever. You only get one life and you should try to find happiness. But I have never (as far as I know) dated a guy who wasn\u2019t straight. So I was a little taken aback. \n\nThe rest of the night was somewhat awkward and we ended up just going to sleep. Over the next several days I started thinking of our relationship. We don\u2019t have sex that often for a young couple. Maybe once a week (always been that way). And when we do have sex I usually initiate. I\u2019m not bothered by the frequency  but I started questioning whether my boyfriend might just be gay and using me to cover that up. I started getting paranoid over whether he\u2019s even attracted to me (he compliments me on my appearance but I\u2019ve never felt...lust). \n\nAnyway I ended up breaking up with him. He said it was because he\u2019s bi and I denied that was the reason. I blamed the break up on some personal stuff I\u2019m going through and said I needed time alone. \n\nBut that was actually a lie. If he hadn\u2019t disclosed that stuff about his sexuality, I have no doubt we\u2019d still be together. I just couldn\u2019t get past it for some reason. \n\nAITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The question is whether breaking up because the boyfriend is bisexual is justified. \n\nFirst, the user mentions that she doesn't care about someone's sexuality and is open-minded. But she's never dated a non-straight guy before. So maybe she wasn't prepared for this situation. When her boyfriend confessed, he had already hooked up with guys before they were together. She felt taken aback, and after some days, she broke up with him.\n\nShe's in her mid-twenties, and the relationship lasted two years. They had a low sexual frequency, which she attributes to him possibly not being attracted to her. However, he compliments her appearance, but she doesn't feel lust. So she's questioning if he's using her to cover being gay. \n\nShe broke up, but she lied about the reason. She says the real issue was his bisexuality. Now she's asking if she's at fault.\n\nI need to consider both sides. On one hand, bisexuality is a valid orientation, and she might not be wrong to feel uncomfortable if she expects monogamy and exclusivity. If she felt that his bisexuality made her feel like he wasn't attracted to her, maybe she's justified. On the other hand, he came clean, and she didn't want to be in a relationship where she felt insecure. But is breaking up over this the wrong choice?\n\nAlternatively, maybe she should have communicated her feelings instead of ending things abruptly. She admitted she lied about the breakup reason, which could be seen as dishonest. But the core issue is whether his sexuality is a valid reason for breaking up. If she can't accept his identity, then she's not in the wrong for leaving. But others might argue that she's closing her mind to his identity. \n\nIn many relationships, people have different reasons for staying or leaving. If she couldn't move past his bisexuality, even though he was honest, then she's not necessarily wrong. However, some might say that she's being unfair because bisexuality doesn't mean he's unfaithful or not into her. So there's a balance here between personal boundaries and accepting a partner's identity. \n\nI think the key points are that the boyfriend was honest, and the author had to make a choice based on her comfort. Since she's not against bisexuality in principle but had personal issues in the relationship, her decision to leave might be seen as her right. But others might say she's being selfish. However, the fact that she's honest about her feelings in the long run suggests she's in the right.\n"
