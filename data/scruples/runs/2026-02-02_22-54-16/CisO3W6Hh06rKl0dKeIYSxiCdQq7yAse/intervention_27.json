Overall, he\u2019s a great person and I hope that we can stay friends, despite what happened. \n\nBasically, a few weeks ago, we were having drinks at his apartment. He said there was something he wanted to tell me and he hoped I wouldn\u2019t judge. I said okay (obviously nervous). He told me that he thinks he\u2019s bi. I asked what makes him think that and he finally admitted that he had hooked up with a few guys before me. \n\nNow, I just want to clarify that I don\u2019t care if a person is gay, bi, whatever. You only get one life and you should try to find happiness. But I have never (as far as I know) dated a guy who wasn\u2019t straight. So I was a little taken aback. \n\nThe rest of the night was somewhat awkward and we ended up just going to sleep. Over the next several days I started thinking of our relationship. We don\u2019t have sex that often for a young couple. Maybe once a week (always been that way). And when we do have sex I usually initiate. I\u2019m not bothered by the frequency  but I started questioning whether my boyfriend might just be gay and using me to cover that up. I started getting paranoid over whether he\u2019s even attracted to me (he compliments me on my appearance but I\u2019ve never felt...lust). \n\nAnyway I ended up breaking up with him. He said it was because he\u2019s bi and I denied that was the reason. I blamed the break up on some personal stuff I\u2019m going through and said I needed time alone. \n\nBut that was actually a lie. If he hadn\u2019t disclosed that stuff about his sexuality, I have no doubt we\u2019d still be together. I just couldn\u2019t get past it for some reason. \n\nAITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if the author (the person who wrote the AITA post) is in the wrong for breaking up with her boyfriend after he came out as bisexual. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The boyfriend told her he's bisexual and had hooked up with guys before. The author is okay with people being gay or bi but had never dated someone not straight. The relationship wasn't super sexual\u2014rarely have sex, and she usually initiates. She started doubting if he was even into women and broke up, but told him it was due to her personal issues.\n\nSo, the main points here are: she's not opposed to bisexuality in principle, but the revelation made her uncomfortable. She felt it affected her trust or security in the relationship. The boyfriend didn't hide it; he came out to her. She broke up because she couldn't get past his bisexuality, even though she admitted she didn't care about others' orientations.\n\nIs she wrong? Well, relationships are based on mutual compatibility. If she can't accept his bisexuality, even though she claims she's okay with it, then maybe it's a dealbreaker for her. But since he didn't lie before, just came out, maybe she's overreacting. Also, the lack of physical intimacy might have contributed to her insecurity. But is that his fault? She might have had unmet needs in the relationship, but she's pointing to his sexuality as the main reason.\n\nOn the other hand, breaking up because of someone's sexuality could be seen as prejudiced, even if it's not outright hatred. She's in a position where she realized their fundamental differences in this aspect made the relationship unsustainable. But he was honest, so maybe she's the one who can't handle it. \n\nAlso, she lied about the reason for the breakup. That's not great, but it's a common thing in breakups. The key is whether her decision was justified. Since she's the one who can't accept his orientation, she's not in the wrong for choosing to end the relationship. However, if she had known earlier, maybe she could have handled it differently. But he only came out now, so maybe it's a recent issue. \n\nI think the answer is B, No. She's not in the wrong because she's choosing herself and her needs. People have different dealbreakers, and if bisexuality is a dealbreaker for her, even if she's okay with it in others, it's her right to end the relationship. The boyfriend was honest, so she can't blame him for lying. Her insecurity might have been influenced by the low sex frequency, but she's honest about the real reason now.\n"
