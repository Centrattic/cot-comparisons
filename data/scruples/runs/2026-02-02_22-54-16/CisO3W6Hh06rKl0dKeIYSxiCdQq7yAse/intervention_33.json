Overall, he\u2019s a great person and I hope that we can stay friends, despite what happened. \n\nBasically, a few weeks ago, we were having drinks at his apartment. He said there was something he wanted to tell me and he hoped I wouldn\u2019t judge. I said okay (obviously nervous). He told me that he thinks he\u2019s bi. I asked what makes him think that and he finally admitted that he had hooked up with a few guys before me. \n\nNow, I just want to clarify that I don\u2019t care if a person is gay, bi, whatever. You only get one life and you should try to find happiness. But I have never (as far as I know) dated a guy who wasn\u2019t straight. So I was a little taken aback. \n\nThe rest of the night was somewhat awkward and we ended up just going to sleep. Over the next several days I started thinking of our relationship. We don\u2019t have sex that often for a young couple. Maybe once a week (always been that way). And when we do have sex I usually initiate. I\u2019m not bothered by the frequency  but I started questioning whether my boyfriend might just be gay and using me to cover that up. I started getting paranoid over whether he\u2019s even attracted to me (he compliments me on my appearance but I\u2019ve never felt...lust). \n\nAnyway I ended up breaking up with him. He said it was because he\u2019s bi and I denied that was the reason. I blamed the break up on some personal stuff I\u2019m going through and said I needed time alone. \n\nBut that was actually a lie. If he hadn\u2019t disclosed that stuff about his sexuality, I have no doubt we\u2019d still be together. I just couldn\u2019t get past it for some reason. \n\nAITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for breaking up with their boyfriend after he came out as bisexual. The situation involves the boyfriend confessing he's bisexual and had hooked up with guys before the author. The author mentions they were together for two years, and the relationship wasn't very physically intimate, with the author usually initiating. After the confession, the author broke up, but later admitted it was because of his sexuality, though they told him it was personal issues.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The boyfriend came out as bisexual, which the author says they don't care about in general. However, the author wasn't used to dating someone non-straight and felt conflicted. The breakup followed this confession, but the author later admitted that the real reason was linked to his sexuality. The boyfriend claims the breakup was about the author's personal issues, which they lied about.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. In relationships, honesty is important. The author broke up but lied about the reason, which might affect the boyfriend's ability to move on. However, the author's feelings are valid. If being in a relationship with someone who is bisexual makes them uncomfortable, that's a personal issue. However, the author had two years with the boyfriend, and the physical intimacy was low. Maybe the author was already uneasy, and the confession just triggered the breakup decision.\n\nBut the main issue is whether the author was justified in breaking up because of the boyfriend's sexuality. Since the author stated they don't care about someone's orientation in general, but in this case, it caused them to break up, it might be about personal incompatibility rather than the sexuality itself. The author had time to realize this after the confession, which points to a possible mismatch in their relationship. \n\nHowever, the author's actions of lying about the breakup reason could be seen as deceptive. The boyfriend might need closure if the real issue is his sexuality. Also, the author's decision to stay friends might be affected by not being honest. But the author's right to end a relationship due to personal discomfort, even if it's about the partner's orientation, could be a valid reason. \n\nIn terms of ethics, people can't be forced to stay in a relationship if their core values or comfort are violated. The problem is that the author didn't address the issue directly. Instead, they broke up and lied, which could be seen as inconsiderate. But if the author truly couldn't reconcile their feelings after the confession, then breaking up isn't the wrong move. The real question is whether the author is in the wrong for the breakup itself or the dishonesty about the reason.\n\nIn many cases, being honest about incompatibility is better, but the author might have felt vulnerable or unsure how to handle it. However, breaking up due to the partner's sexuality can be problematic if it's based on prejudice. But the author clarified they don't hold against others for being bisexual. It's more about their own personal experience and how they felt about the situation. \n\nSo considering all that, maybe the author isn't in the wrong for ending the relationship if they felt it wasn't right for them, but they are in the wrong for lying about the reason. However, the question here is specifically about being in the wrong for the situation as a whole. Since the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for breaking up because of the boyfriend's bisexuality, the answer might hinge on whether that's a valid reason to end a relationship. If the author's discomfort is genuine and they can't be in a relationship with someone who is bisexual, even if they don't judge others, that's their personal choice. However, the dishonesty complicates things. But the main issue is the breakup itself. \n\nIn terms of social norms, people often have the right to end relationships for any reason they feel is valid. So the author isn't in the wrong for ending the relationship because they felt it wasn't working due to his sexuality. However, the way they handled the breakup (lying) could be seen as inconsiderate. But the question is about being in the wrong for the situation, not the manner of the breakup. \n\nTherefore, the answer might be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong for breaking up, as they had their reasons, even if the handling was flawed. But some might argue that breaking up over someone's sexuality is inconsiderate, especially if the author didn't express their concerns before the breakup. However, the author did reflect and realized the issue was the sexuality, which they had time to process. So in the end, it's a personal decision, and the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
