Overall, he\u2019s a great person and I hope that we can stay friends, despite what happened. \n\nBasically, a few weeks ago, we were having drinks at his apartment. He said there was something he wanted to tell me and he hoped I wouldn\u2019t judge. I said okay (obviously nervous). He told me that he thinks he\u2019s bi. I asked what makes him think that and he finally admitted that he had hooked up with a few guys before me. \n\nNow, I just want to clarify that I don\u2019t care if a person is gay, bi, whatever. You only get one life and you should try to find happiness. But I have never (as far as I know) dated a guy who wasn\u2019t straight. So I was a little taken aback. \n\nThe rest of the night was somewhat awkward and we ended up just going to sleep. Over the next several days I started thinking of our relationship. We don\u2019t have sex that often for a young couple. Maybe once a week (always been that way). And when we do have sex I usually initiate. I\u2019m not bothered by the frequency  but I started questioning whether my boyfriend might just be gay and using me to cover that up. I started getting paranoid over whether he\u2019s even attracted to me (he compliments me on my appearance but I\u2019ve never felt...lust). \n\nAnyway I ended up breaking up with him. He said it was because he\u2019s bi and I denied that was the reason. I blamed the break up on some personal stuff I\u2019m going through and said I needed time alone. \n\nBut that was actually a lie. If he hadn\u2019t disclosed that stuff about his sexuality, I have no doubt we\u2019d still be together. I just couldn\u2019t get past it for some reason. \n\nAITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for breaking up with her boyfriend after he came out as bisexual. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points of the story. The boyfriend is 26, the author is 24. They were in a two-year relationship. The boyfriend confessed he's bisexual and had hooked up with guys before. The author claims she doesn't care about his sexuality but breaks up with him, attributing it to personal issues but later admitting the real reason was his bisexuality.\n\nThe main question here is whether the author is in the wrong for ending the relationship based on her partner's sexuality, even though she claims he didn't hide it. She acknowledges that she lied about the reason for the breakup. \n\nIn relationships, honesty and mutual acceptance are important. The boyfriend was honest about his bisexuality, which he felt needed to be shared. The author, while accepting of others' sexuality, couldn't accept his. That raises the question of whether it's fair to end a relationship based on something the partner disclosed and didn't hide. \n\nBut wait, the author says she doesn't care about his sexuality itself. So maybe the issue isn't bisexuality per se but the fact that he had hooked up with others before. However, she admits she didn't mind dating a straight guy, but this revelation made her question his attraction to her and his possible use of the relationship. \n\nAnother angle: she mentions they had a low sex frequency and she usually initiated. This might have made her feel insecure, and his bisexuality amplified her doubts. But was the breakup fair because she couldn't accept his sexuality even though he was truthful? \n\nIn many cases, people in relationships may have deal-breakers. If the author's deal-breaker was being with someone who isn't exclusively heterosexual, even if they claim to be okay with it, that's a personal choice. However, since the partner came clean and the issue is the author's discomfort, not the partner's actions, it's a matter of whether the author's choice is valid. \n\nOn one hand, the author is honest about her feelings upon reflection. She took time to think and realized she couldn't move past it. On the other hand, the boyfriend didn't hide his past and came clean, which could be seen as respectful. \n\nBut the AITA aspect depends on societal views. Some might say the author is wrong because it's unfair to end a relationship over something the partner didn't hide. Others might say she's not wrong because everyone has their boundaries, and if she can't accept his sexuality, it's better to part ways. \n\nI think the key here is that the boyfriend was truthful, and the author's issue is with his bisexuality despite claiming she's accepting. It might be seen as a personal choice, but since the partner was honest, the author's reaction isn't necessarily wrong. However, the fact that she lied about the reason for the breakup could be seen as a red flag. \n\nBut the main question is whether she's in the wrong. Since she didn't force him to hide his sexuality and he was honest, her decision to leave might not be wrong. However, if the issue is that she couldn't accept his bisexuality despite saying she could, that's a contradiction. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong because the boyfriend was honest, and she had the right to decide the relationship wasn't right for her. But there's a nuance here. Alternatively, maybe A (Yes) because she let her partner's sexuality affect their relationship, even if it was a personal choice. \n\nBut in AITA scenarios, people often get called out for being judgmental. Since the author claims she's accepting, but her actions contradict that, she might be in the wrong. However, if she's honest about her feelings, then it's a matter of personal choice. \n\nHmm. The community might split, but typically, if someone comes clean and you can't accept it, you're not in the wrong for ending the relationship. So likely B.\n"
