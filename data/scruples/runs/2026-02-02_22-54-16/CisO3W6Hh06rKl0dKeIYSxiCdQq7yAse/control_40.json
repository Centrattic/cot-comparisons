Overall, he\u2019s a great person and I hope that we can stay friends, despite what happened. \n\nBasically, a few weeks ago, we were having drinks at his apartment. He said there was something he wanted to tell me and he hoped I wouldn\u2019t judge. I said okay (obviously nervous). He told me that he thinks he\u2019s bi. I asked what makes him think that and he finally admitted that he had hooked up with a few guys before me. \n\nNow, I just want to clarify that I don\u2019t care if a person is gay, bi, whatever. You only get one life and you should try to find happiness. But I have never (as far as I know) dated a guy who wasn\u2019t straight. So I was a little taken aback. \n\nThe rest of the night was somewhat awkward and we ended up just going to sleep. Over the next several days I started thinking of our relationship. We don\u2019t have sex that often for a young couple. Maybe once a week (always been that way). And when we do have sex I usually initiate. I\u2019m not bothered by the frequency  but I started questioning whether my boyfriend might just be gay and using me to cover that up. I started getting paranoid over whether he\u2019s even attracted to me (he compliments me on my appearance but I\u2019ve never felt...lust). \n\nAnyway I ended up breaking up with him. He said it was because he\u2019s bi and I denied that was the reason. I blamed the break up on some personal stuff I\u2019m going through and said I needed time alone. \n\nBut that was actually a lie. If he hadn\u2019t disclosed that stuff about his sexuality, I have no doubt we\u2019d still be together. I just couldn\u2019t get past it for some reason. \n\nAITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user wants to know if the person who broke up with their boyfriend for being bisexual is at fault. Let me try to work through this step by step.\n\nFirst, the key points from the scenario: The boyfriend disclosed his bisexuality and admitted to past relationships with men. The author is a woman in a two-year relationship. She broke up with him after this revelation, even though she said she doesn't care about his orientation. She's conflicted because she's never been with a non-straight person before and started doubting his attraction to her. She lied about the reason for the breakup, blaming it on her own issues instead.\n\nThe main question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider the dynamics here. Legally, there's no wrongdoing; no laws are broken. Ethically, it's more about personal responsibility and honesty in relationships.\n\nBisexuality is a valid sexual orientation. The boyfriend coming out as bi isn't inherently problematic. The author states she's accepting of different orientations, but her feelings towards the disclosure led to the breakup. She felt uneasy because of his past, leading to paranoia about his attraction. She broke up but didn't disclose the real reason, which might be a point against her.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. If the author had issues with his past or his orientation, she should have discussed them openly. Lying about the reason for the breakup could be seen as dishonest. However, she felt she couldn't handle the situation, so she ended the relationship. It's important to recognize that people have different comfort levels, and while bisexuality is consensual and valid, the author's discomfort might not be the other person's fault.\n\nAlso, the fact that the couple didn't have sex often and when they did, she initiated, might indicate other underlying issues, but she attributed them to his sexuality. That could be a case of misdiagnosing the problem.\n\nIs she in the wrong? If she's not comfortable with his sexuality and chose to end the relationship, she's not in the wrong for making a choice that's right for her. However, lying about the reason might be ethically questionable. But the question is about being \"in the wrong,\" which could relate to moral fault. Since she did break up with him for his sexuality (which is a personal choice) and lied about it, there's a case for her being in the wrong. On the other hand, she isn't obligated to stay in a relationship if it makes her uncomfortable.\n\nI think the answer hinges on whether breaking up for his sexuality is considered wrong. Since it's not illegal or unethical for him to be bi, her decision to end the relationship isn't inherently wrong. However, the dishonesty about the reason could be a flaw. But the main issue is her choice to leave. In many cases, people have different deal-breakers. If she wasn't comfortable with his past or orientation, she's not in the wrong for ending it. However, if the real issue was her inability to accept his identity, that would be a problem. But she claims she's accepting, just not used to it. So perhaps she's not in the wrong, but the situation is complex.\n"
