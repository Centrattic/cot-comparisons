Overall, he\u2019s a great person and I hope that we can stay friends, despite what happened. \n\nBasically, a few weeks ago, we were having drinks at his apartment. He said there was something he wanted to tell me and he hoped I wouldn\u2019t judge. I said okay (obviously nervous). He told me that he thinks he\u2019s bi. I asked what makes him think that and he finally admitted that he had hooked up with a few guys before me. \n\nNow, I just want to clarify that I don\u2019t care if a person is gay, bi, whatever. You only get one life and you should try to find happiness. But I have never (as far as I know) dated a guy who wasn\u2019t straight. So I was a little taken aback. \n\nThe rest of the night was somewhat awkward and we ended up just going to sleep. Over the next several days I started thinking of our relationship. We don\u2019t have sex that often for a young couple. Maybe once a week (always been that way). And when we do have sex I usually initiate. I\u2019m not bothered by the frequency  but I started questioning whether my boyfriend might just be gay and using me to cover that up. I started getting paranoid over whether he\u2019s even attracted to me (he compliments me on my appearance but I\u2019ve never felt...lust). \n\nAnyway I ended up breaking up with him. He said it was because he\u2019s bi and I denied that was the reason. I blamed the break up on some personal stuff I\u2019m going through and said I needed time alone. \n\nBut that was actually a lie. If he hadn\u2019t disclosed that stuff about his sexuality, I have no doubt we\u2019d still be together. I just couldn\u2019t get past it for some reason. \n\nAITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let's start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe author, a woman, broke up with her boyfriend after he told her he's bisexual. He was open about his past relationships with men. She says she doesn't care about his sexuality in general, but she's never dated a guy who wasn't straight. She felt shocked and started doubting their relationship dynamics, like the lack of frequent sex and her initiating it. She ended up breaking up with him, but she admits the real reason was his bisexuality, even though she told him it was due to her personal issues. The question is if she's at fault.\n\nFirst, let's consider the facts. The boyfriend came out as bisexual, which he had actually done before the relationship. The author found out he had hooked up with men before they met. She claims she's okay with people being gay or bi, but she's never been with someone who isn't straight. She felt conflicted and ended the relationship, but didn't tell him the real reason. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The boyfriend was honest about his sexuality, which is important. However, the author's reaction is based on her own feelings and assumptions. Just because he's bisexual doesn't necessarily mean he's not attracted to her or that he's hiding something. She started to question his attraction to her and felt paranoid, which might stem from insecurity or preconceived notions. \n\nBreaking up because of someone's sexuality can be seen as invalid if they were honest from the start. However, people have different boundaries and comfort levels. The author might have realized that being with a bisexual man isn't something she can accept, even if she claims not to judge. It's possible she's not in the wrong because everyone has the right to their own comfort in a relationship. But on the other hand, if she knew about his bisexuality beforehand and it didn't affect their relationship, ending it later could be seen as unfair. \n\nThe key point is whether the breakup was a genuine decision based on incompatibility or if it's a reaction to something he disclosed. Since she admitted the real reason was his sexuality, and not the other factors she mentioned, it might be considered her being in the wrong. But some might argue that it's her right to end a relationship if it's making her uncomfortable, even if the reason seems trivial to others. \n\nI think the answer depends on perspective. If the boyfriend had been dishonest, maybe she's justified. But since he was upfront, and she broke up because of his sexuality despite being okay with it in principle, she might be in the wrong. However, people do have the right to their own limits in relationships. The community might split on this. The Reddit AITA threads often consider the person in the wrong if they broke up over something the other party was honest about. So maybe answer A, yes, she's in the wrong.\n"
