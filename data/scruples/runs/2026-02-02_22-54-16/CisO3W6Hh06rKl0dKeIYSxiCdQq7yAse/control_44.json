Overall, he\u2019s a great person and I hope that we can stay friends, despite what happened. \n\nBasically, a few weeks ago, we were having drinks at his apartment. He said there was something he wanted to tell me and he hoped I wouldn\u2019t judge. I said okay (obviously nervous). He told me that he thinks he\u2019s bi. I asked what makes him think that and he finally admitted that he had hooked up with a few guys before me. \n\nNow, I just want to clarify that I don\u2019t care if a person is gay, bi, whatever. You only get one life and you should try to find happiness. But I have never (as far as I know) dated a guy who wasn\u2019t straight. So I was a little taken aback. \n\nThe rest of the night was somewhat awkward and we ended up just going to sleep. Over the next several days I started thinking of our relationship. We don\u2019t have sex that often for a young couple. Maybe once a week (always been that way). And when we do have sex I usually initiate. I\u2019m not bothered by the frequency  but I started questioning whether my boyfriend might just be gay and using me to cover that up. I started getting paranoid over whether he\u2019s even attracted to me (he compliments me on my appearance but I\u2019ve never felt...lust). \n\nAnyway I ended up breaking up with him. He said it was because he\u2019s bi and I denied that was the reason. I blamed the break up on some personal stuff I\u2019m going through and said I needed time alone. \n\nBut that was actually a lie. If he hadn\u2019t disclosed that stuff about his sexuality, I have no doubt we\u2019d still be together. I just couldn\u2019t get past it for some reason. \n\nAITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. So, the user is asking whether the person who broke up with their boyfriend because he's bisexual is in the wrong. The story is that the boyfriend (26M) told her he's bisexual and had hooked up with guys before. The author (24F) didn't care about his orientation but felt conflicted because she's only dated straight guys. She broke up, but she's lying about the reason, saying it's her personal issues instead. She's questioning if she was right.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical angles here. The boyfriend was honest about his sexuality, which is a significant step. The author's main issue seems to be not with his bisexuality per se, but maybe with the fact that he had past relationships with men. However, it's his right to explore his sexuality before the relationship. \n\nThe author's decision to break up is based on her own discomfort, even though she claims she's okay with others' orientations. There's a contradiction here. If she values honesty and acceptance, then her reaction might be inconsistent. On the other hand, she's allowed to feel that this is a deal-breaker for her, even if it seems surprising. But lying about the reason for the breakup adds another layer. Deception in a breakup can be hurtful, even if the person is trying to be kind. \n\nAnother point is that the relationship already had some issues, like infrequent sex that she initiates. Maybe her insecurities about the relationship were exacerbated by his sexuality. But is that a fair reason? The boyfriend didn't hide his orientation; he came out to her. So the author's problem isn't with his orientation itself but possibly with her own expectations. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's tricky. She isn't in the wrong for having feelings or finding out something that makes her realize it's not a good fit. However, lying about the reason might be inconsiderate. But the main question is about the breakup. If he was honest, and she made a decision based on her own feelings, even if it's unexpected, she's not necessarily wrong. But the lie complicates it. \n\nHowever, in most ethical viewpoints, if someone is honest about their sexuality, and the other person can't accept that, the person making the decision isn't in the wrong. The lie about the reason might be the part that's questionable. But the central issue is the breakup. So maybe AITA (Am I the Asshole) here is about the author. But the answer depends on whether the author is in the wrong for breaking up because of his bisexuality. Since she's allowed to have her own boundaries, even if they seem shallow, she's not in the wrong for making that choice. The lie is another issue, but the main question is about the breakup. So the answer might be B (not in the wrong). But some might argue she's being hypocritical. However, the core of the question is about the breakup's justification. Since she's honest about her feelings now, even if she lied initially, the decision itself is her right.\n"
