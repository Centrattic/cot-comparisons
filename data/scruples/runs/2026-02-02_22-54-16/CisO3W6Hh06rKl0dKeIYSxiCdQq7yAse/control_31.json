Overall, he\u2019s a great person and I hope that we can stay friends, despite what happened. \n\nBasically, a few weeks ago, we were having drinks at his apartment. He said there was something he wanted to tell me and he hoped I wouldn\u2019t judge. I said okay (obviously nervous). He told me that he thinks he\u2019s bi. I asked what makes him think that and he finally admitted that he had hooked up with a few guys before me. \n\nNow, I just want to clarify that I don\u2019t care if a person is gay, bi, whatever. You only get one life and you should try to find happiness. But I have never (as far as I know) dated a guy who wasn\u2019t straight. So I was a little taken aback. \n\nThe rest of the night was somewhat awkward and we ended up just going to sleep. Over the next several days I started thinking of our relationship. We don\u2019t have sex that often for a young couple. Maybe once a week (always been that way). And when we do have sex I usually initiate. I\u2019m not bothered by the frequency  but I started questioning whether my boyfriend might just be gay and using me to cover that up. I started getting paranoid over whether he\u2019s even attracted to me (he compliments me on my appearance but I\u2019ve never felt...lust). \n\nAnyway I ended up breaking up with him. He said it was because he\u2019s bi and I denied that was the reason. I blamed the break up on some personal stuff I\u2019m going through and said I needed time alone. \n\nBut that was actually a lie. If he hadn\u2019t disclosed that stuff about his sexuality, I have no doubt we\u2019d still be together. I just couldn\u2019t get past it for some reason. \n\nAITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a breakup where the boyfriend confessed he's bisexual. The author is a woman, and she broke up with her boyfriend after he told her he's bi and had hooked up with guys before. \n\nFirst, the key points: The boyfriend came out as bisexual, which the author didn't expect. She clarifies she doesn't have an issue with bisexuality in general, but she's never dated a guy who wasn't straight. She's questioning his attraction to her because their sex life is infrequent, and she initiates it. She ends up breaking up, but lies about the reason, saying it's due to her personal issues instead of his sexuality.\n\nSo, is she in the wrong? Well, relationships are about mutual respect and compatibility. The boyfriend was honest about his sexuality, which he felt was important to share. The author had reservations she couldn't overcome, even though she says it's not about his orientation per se. She's concerned he might be using her to hide his true sexuality. \n\nBut wait, how does that work? Being bisexual means he's attracted to both genders. The fact that he had past relationships with men doesn't necessarily mean he's hiding anything. The author's main issue is that she's uncomfortable with his bisexuality, even though she claims she doesn't care about others' orientations. Her breakup is based on her inability to accept this part of him, which is a personal choice. \n\nHowever, breaking up because someone's sexuality is different isn't inherently wrong if it's a dealbreaker for you. But the author is lying about the reason for the breakup, which could be seen as dishonest. Also, if the issue was the frequency of sex and her initiating it, maybe those were underlying issues that weren't resolved. \n\nBut the main point is that the author couldn't accept his bisexuality, which he had already shared. If the relationship can't work because of that, then it's a matter of personal choice. However, the author is in denial about her real reason for breaking up, which is a problem. Honesty is important in relationships, so lying about the cause could be a mistake. \n\nBut is she in the wrong? If the problem was his bisexuality, then she's honest in her feelings. But since she lied, maybe that's where the issue is. The question is whether she's at fault for breaking up or for lying about the reason. The Reddit-style question often focuses on moral judgment. \n\nIn AITA contexts, people often consider whether the action is justified. If the author felt that the relationship was incompatible because she couldn't accept his bisexuality, then she might not be wrong for ending it. However, if the problem was that he wasn't attracted to her, that's a different issue. But the root was his sexuality. \n\nSo, the answer might hinge on whether her decision was based on his identity (bisexuality) versus his actions (hooking up with others). Since he came clean, and she couldn't accept it, maybe she's not in the wrong. However, lying about the breakup reason is a red flag. But the original question is whether she's in the wrong for breaking up because he's bisexual. \n\nIn many cases, people aren't in the wrong for breaking up if they can't accept their partner's identity. However, if the issue was that he was hiding things, but he did come clean, then it's a different story. She might be in the wrong if she's judging him for something he's not hiding. \n\nHmm, this is tricky. I think the consensus might be that she's not in the wrong because she had valid reasons she couldn't overcome, even if she later realizes it. But the lying part complicates it. However, the main question is about breaking up due to his bisexuality. In AITA, often the person isn't at fault if they can't accept their partner's identity, especially if it's shared honestly. So the answer is B (No).\n"
