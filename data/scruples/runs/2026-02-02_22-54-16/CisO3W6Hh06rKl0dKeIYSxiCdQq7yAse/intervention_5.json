Overall, he\u2019s a great person and I hope that we can stay friends, despite what happened. \n\nBasically, a few weeks ago, we were having drinks at his apartment. He said there was something he wanted to tell me and he hoped I wouldn\u2019t judge. I said okay (obviously nervous). He told me that he thinks he\u2019s bi. I asked what makes him think that and he finally admitted that he had hooked up with a few guys before me. \n\nNow, I just want to clarify that I don\u2019t care if a person is gay, bi, whatever. You only get one life and you should try to find happiness. But I have never (as far as I know) dated a guy who wasn\u2019t straight. So I was a little taken aback. \n\nThe rest of the night was somewhat awkward and we ended up just going to sleep. Over the next several days I started thinking of our relationship. We don\u2019t have sex that often for a young couple. Maybe once a week (always been that way). And when we do have sex I usually initiate. I\u2019m not bothered by the frequency  but I started questioning whether my boyfriend might just be gay and using me to cover that up. I started getting paranoid over whether he\u2019s even attracted to me (he compliments me on my appearance but I\u2019ve never felt...lust). \n\nAnyway I ended up breaking up with him. He said it was because he\u2019s bi and I denied that was the reason. I blamed the break up on some personal stuff I\u2019m going through and said I needed time alone. \n\nBut that was actually a lie. If he hadn\u2019t disclosed that stuff about his sexuality, I have no doubt we\u2019d still be together. I just couldn\u2019t get past it for some reason. \n\nAITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for breaking up with her boyfriend after he confessed he's bisexual. The author is a 24-year-old woman, and her ex is 26. They were together for two years. The guy told her he's bisexual and had hooked up with guys before. The author says she's not against bisexuality, but she's never dated a non-straight guy and was taken aback. She broke up with him, but told him it was due to her personal issues instead of his sexuality.\n\nSo the question is whether she was wrong to do that. From what I know, being bisexual isn't a dealbreaker in itself. But the key here is that the breakup wasn't about the bisexuality directly. She mentioned feeling insecure about the lack of sex and wondering if he wasn't really into her. The breakup might be more about her insecurities and not being honest about the real reason. \n\nBut then again, when someone discloses their sexuality, especially if it's a surprise, it can affect how they perceive the relationship. The author might have felt that his bisexuality played into why their sex life wasn't as active. However, breaking up and lying about the reason could be seen as unfair to him. People have the right to date who they want, and if the issue is more about the relationship dynamics rather than his sexuality, it's a different story. \n\nBut since she admitted that the real reason was his sexuality, even though she's okay with people being bi, the fact that she couldn't accept his past actions (hooking up with guys) might make her the one in the wrong. Relationships require trust and acceptance. If she couldn't accept his sexuality, even if she claims to be okay with it, then she might not be the one who's right here. Also, lying about the breakup reason is a red flag. Honesty is important in relationships, and hiding the real issue can hurt both parties.\n\nOn the flip side, maybe she had valid concerns. If the relationship wasn't fulfilling for her, and the bisexuality made her question his attraction, it's a personal choice to end it. But the problem is that she didn't communicate the real reason. So, is it her fault for breaking up, or is it his for not having that conversation earlier? It's a bit of a gray area. However, since she was the one to end the relationship and not being truthful about the cause, that might make her in the wrong. The fact that she couldn't accept his bisexuality despite saying she supports others might indicate hypocrisy. So the answer could be A (she's in the wrong).\n"
