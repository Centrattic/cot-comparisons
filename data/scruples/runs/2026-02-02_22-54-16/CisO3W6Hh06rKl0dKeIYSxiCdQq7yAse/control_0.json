Overall, he\u2019s a great person and I hope that we can stay friends, despite what happened. \n\nBasically, a few weeks ago, we were having drinks at his apartment. He said there was something he wanted to tell me and he hoped I wouldn\u2019t judge. I said okay (obviously nervous). He told me that he thinks he\u2019s bi. I asked what makes him think that and he finally admitted that he had hooked up with a few guys before me. \n\nNow, I just want to clarify that I don\u2019t care if a person is gay, bi, whatever. You only get one life and you should try to find happiness. But I have never (as far as I know) dated a guy who wasn\u2019t straight. So I was a little taken aback. \n\nThe rest of the night was somewhat awkward and we ended up just going to sleep. Over the next several days I started thinking of our relationship. We don\u2019t have sex that often for a young couple. Maybe once a week (always been that way). And when we do have sex I usually initiate. I\u2019m not bothered by the frequency  but I started questioning whether my boyfriend might just be gay and using me to cover that up. I started getting paranoid over whether he\u2019s even attracted to me (he compliments me on my appearance but I\u2019ve never felt...lust). \n\nAnyway I ended up breaking up with him. He said it was because he\u2019s bi and I denied that was the reason. I blamed the break up on some personal stuff I\u2019m going through and said I needed time alone. \n\nBut that was actually a lie. If he hadn\u2019t disclosed that stuff about his sexuality, I have no doubt we\u2019d still be together. I just couldn\u2019t get past it for some reason. \n\nAITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who broke up with their boyfriend because he's bisexual is in the wrong. The situation is presented through the AITA format.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points here. The girlfriend found out her boyfriend is bisexual and decided to break up. She mentions she doesn't care about his sexuality but felt conflicted because he had hooked up with guys before. She also notes that their sex life is infrequent, she usually initiates, and she's questioning his attraction to her. The breakup was influenced by her not being able to get past his bisexuality, even though she claims she's accepting of different sexual orientations.\n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nI should consider factors like whether her reaction is justified. She's not opposed to bisexuality in principle, but the fact that he had past relationships with men made her uncomfortable. It's possible she's projecting her own insecurities or expectations onto him. Maybe she felt he wasn't fully committed to her, especially given the low sexual frequency and her need to initiate. However, his bisexuality wasn't the cause of the sex frequency; there could be other reasons. \n\nAlso, the breakup was a lie to him, which might add to the moral consideration. She might be avoiding conflict or not being honest about her feelings. \n\nBut in terms of being in the wrong, if she can't accept his sexuality despite her stated acceptance, that's a personal issue. Relationships require mutual acceptance of each other's traits. If she can't move past this, maybe the breakup is a result of her own inability to cope, not necessarily the boyfriend's fault. \n\nOn the other hand, if the boyfriend's disclosure was honest and he didn't hide his sexuality, then maybe she's the one who can't handle it, making her the one in the wrong. \n\nI need to weigh whether her reaction stems from a place of genuine incompatibility or personal prejudice. The fact that she's okay with people being gay but not with the specific circumstance might indicate some internal conflict. \n\nConsidering all this, the answer might be A (she's in the wrong) because she's breaking up over something she claims to accept, and the breakup is her choice. However, some might argue that she's within her right to end a relationship if she's unhappy. \n\nBut the key point is that she couldn't get past his bisexuality despite her own stated acceptance. That contradiction might make her the one at fault. So the answer is A.\n"
