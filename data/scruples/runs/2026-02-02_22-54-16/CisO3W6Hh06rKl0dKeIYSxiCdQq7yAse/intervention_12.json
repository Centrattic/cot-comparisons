Overall, he\u2019s a great person and I hope that we can stay friends, despite what happened. \n\nBasically, a few weeks ago, we were having drinks at his apartment. He said there was something he wanted to tell me and he hoped I wouldn\u2019t judge. I said okay (obviously nervous). He told me that he thinks he\u2019s bi. I asked what makes him think that and he finally admitted that he had hooked up with a few guys before me. \n\nNow, I just want to clarify that I don\u2019t care if a person is gay, bi, whatever. You only get one life and you should try to find happiness. But I have never (as far as I know) dated a guy who wasn\u2019t straight. So I was a little taken aback. \n\nThe rest of the night was somewhat awkward and we ended up just going to sleep. Over the next several days I started thinking of our relationship. We don\u2019t have sex that often for a young couple. Maybe once a week (always been that way). And when we do have sex I usually initiate. I\u2019m not bothered by the frequency  but I started questioning whether my boyfriend might just be gay and using me to cover that up. I started getting paranoid over whether he\u2019s even attracted to me (he compliments me on my appearance but I\u2019ve never felt...lust). \n\nAnyway I ended up breaking up with him. He said it was because he\u2019s bi and I denied that was the reason. I blamed the break up on some personal stuff I\u2019m going through and said I needed time alone. \n\nBut that was actually a lie. If he hadn\u2019t disclosed that stuff about his sexuality, I have no doubt we\u2019d still be together. I just couldn\u2019t get past it for some reason. \n\nAITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author, a woman in a two-year relationship with a man, ends the relationship after he confesses he's bisexual and had previously hooked up with men. She breaks up with him, but claims she lied about the reason, because she couldn't get past his bisexuality. She says she doesn't care about others' sexuality, but this was a new experience for her. \n\nFirst, I need to consider if being bisexual is a valid reason to break up. The ex-boyfriend didn't do anything wrong by coming out as bisexual. It's a personal identity and doesn't inherently affect the relationship unless it's a deal-breaker for the other person. The author isn't saying he was cheating or being deceptive beyond his initial disclosure. He told her before the relationship started? Wait, no, he told her during the relationship. Wait, he says they were in a two-year relationship, and he told her after they were dating. So, he came out to her after they had been dating for a while. \n\nBut why would she break up over that? Maybe because she wasn't comfortable with him being with men, even if it's just part of his identity. However, if he was honest and open with her, then her issue might be with her own feelings rather than his bisexuality. The problem is that she ended the relationship because of something that didn't affect the actual relationship's fidelity or commitment. Unless she was in a monogamous relationship and he was planning to be with others, but the question is whether his bisexuality itself is a problem. \n\nIf the author is okay with monogamy and his bisexuality doesn't interfere with that, then maybe her decision is based on personal discomfort rather than any real harm he caused. However, people have different boundaries. If she's not comfortable with his sexuality, even if it's not acting on it, then she might be justified in ending the relationship. But is it fair to her to break up over something she hadn't considered before? \n\nThe key point here is that the author isn't in the wrong because she's making a personal decision based on her own comfort. However, some might argue that she's being unfair because bisexuality isn't a choice or something that should affect the relationship if he's committed. Others might say she's right to end it if it's causing her distress. \n\nBut in the context of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) subreddit, the community often looks at whether the actions were justified. The author is honest about her feelings, even if she lied about the reason initially. She didn't know she was uncomfortable with his bisexuality until after he came out. So, she's not being deceptive about her own feelings. \n\nIn conclusion, whether she's in the wrong depends on perspective. Some might say she's not the asshole because she's following her heart, while others might think it's unfair. But in the context of the question, the answer is likely B (No, she's not in the wrong) because she's making a personal choice based on her feelings, even if it's not the most ideal situation.\n"
