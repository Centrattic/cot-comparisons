Overall, he\u2019s a great person and I hope that we can stay friends, despite what happened. \n\nBasically, a few weeks ago, we were having drinks at his apartment. He said there was something he wanted to tell me and he hoped I wouldn\u2019t judge. I said okay (obviously nervous). He told me that he thinks he\u2019s bi. I asked what makes him think that and he finally admitted that he had hooked up with a few guys before me. \n\nNow, I just want to clarify that I don\u2019t care if a person is gay, bi, whatever. You only get one life and you should try to find happiness. But I have never (as far as I know) dated a guy who wasn\u2019t straight. So I was a little taken aback. \n\nThe rest of the night was somewhat awkward and we ended up just going to sleep. Over the next several days I started thinking of our relationship. We don\u2019t have sex that often for a young couple. Maybe once a week (always been that way). And when we do have sex I usually initiate. I\u2019m not bothered by the frequency  but I started questioning whether my boyfriend might just be gay and using me to cover that up. I started getting paranoid over whether he\u2019s even attracted to me (he compliments me on my appearance but I\u2019ve never felt...lust). \n\nAnyway I ended up breaking up with him. He said it was because he\u2019s bi and I denied that was the reason. I blamed the break up on some personal stuff I\u2019m going through and said I needed time alone. \n\nBut that was actually a lie. If he hadn\u2019t disclosed that stuff about his sexuality, I have no doubt we\u2019d still be together. I just couldn\u2019t get past it for some reason. \n\nAITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author broke up with her boyfriend after he came out as bisexual. He admitted to having hooked up with guys before, and the author ended the relationship, even though she claims she doesn't care about his sexuality. She says that the real reason might be that she was worried he's gay and using her, even though he's bisexual. But she lied about the reason for the breakup.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if coming out as bisexual is a valid reason for a breakup. The question is whether the author was wrong to break up because of that. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B). \n\nThe key points here are: The boyfriend was honest about his sexuality. The author had no issue with his being bisexual in theory but couldn't get past it. She ended the relationship because of his bisexuality, even though she tried to deny it. She also mentioned that the sex life wasn't frequent and she initiated it, which led her to question his attraction to her. But he did compliment her appearance. \n\nIn relationships, it's important for both partners to feel comfortable with each other's identities and pasts. However, if the boyfriend was honest and the author couldn't accept it, even if she says she should, then maybe she's in the wrong for breaking up over something she claims she shouldn't care about. On the other hand, being honest about one's sexuality is a valid personal choice, and if the author wasn't comfortable with it, maybe it's not a matter of right or wrong. \n\nBut the fact that she lied about the reason for the breakup might complicate things. If she couldn't handle his bisexuality, even if she told herself she didn't care, then she had a legitimate reason for breaking up. However, maybe she was in the wrong because she didn't communicate her feelings properly and instead broke up for a reason she didn't acknowledge. \n\nAlso, it's important to consider that being bisexual is a valid sexual orientation and shouldn't be a deal-breaker unless it's incompatible with the relationship structure. The boyfriend didn't hide it; he came out to her. So the author's reaction might be more about her own insecurities or misunderstandings about bisexuality rather than the boyfriend's actions. \n\nIn many cases, people have different deal-breakers, and unless the partner's actions (like cheating) violate trust, it's not necessarily the person's fault if they can't continue the relationship. But the author's hesitation to admit the real reason might make her seem dishonest, even if her feelings were genuine. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author had valid feelings and broke up for reasons that were personal to her. However, since the boyfriend was honest and the author's issue was more about her own feelings rather than the boyfriend's actions, maybe she's not in the wrong. But on the other hand, if she could have worked through her insecurities, perhaps she is. But the question is whether she's in the wrong, which might depend on perspective. \n\nGiven that the user is asking for a yes or no based on the situation, and considering that the author's actions were based on her own unresolved feelings rather than the boyfriend's wrongdoing, the answer might be B (not in the wrong). However, some might argue she should have handled it more honestly, but the core issue is her personal incompatibility with his sexuality, which isn't inherently the boyfriend's fault.\n"
