Overall, he\u2019s a great person and I hope that we can stay friends, despite what happened. \n\nBasically, a few weeks ago, we were having drinks at his apartment. He said there was something he wanted to tell me and he hoped I wouldn\u2019t judge. I said okay (obviously nervous). He told me that he thinks he\u2019s bi. I asked what makes him think that and he finally admitted that he had hooked up with a few guys before me. \n\nNow, I just want to clarify that I don\u2019t care if a person is gay, bi, whatever. You only get one life and you should try to find happiness. But I have never (as far as I know) dated a guy who wasn\u2019t straight. So I was a little taken aback. \n\nThe rest of the night was somewhat awkward and we ended up just going to sleep. Over the next several days I started thinking of our relationship. We don\u2019t have sex that often for a young couple. Maybe once a week (always been that way). And when we do have sex I usually initiate. I\u2019m not bothered by the frequency  but I started questioning whether my boyfriend might just be gay and using me to cover that up. I started getting paranoid over whether he\u2019s even attracted to me (he compliments me on my appearance but I\u2019ve never felt...lust). \n\nAnyway I ended up breaking up with him. He said it was because he\u2019s bi and I denied that was the reason. I blamed the break up on some personal stuff I\u2019m going through and said I needed time alone. \n\nBut that was actually a lie. If he hadn\u2019t disclosed that stuff about his sexuality, I have no doubt we\u2019d still be together. I just couldn\u2019t get past it for some reason. \n\nAITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for breaking up with their boyfriend after he came out as bisexual. The situation is that the boyfriend had a two-year relationship, and after he confessed to being bisexual and having hooked up with guys before, the author broke up with him, but later lied about the reason.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The boyfriend came out to the author. The author states they don't have an issue with people being gay or bi but were taken aback because they hadn't dated a non-straight person before. The author then started questioning the relationship's dynamics, like infrequent sex and not feeling lust, which led to breaking up. However, they admitted that the real reason was the boyfriend's bisexuality, but they lied about it by blaming personal issues.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break down possible angles. In relationships, honesty is important. The author broke up because of their own feelings and insecurities, not because the boyfriend did anything wrong like cheating. The boyfriend was honest about his sexuality, which is a personal aspect. The author had a problem with this, possibly due to their own biases or inexperience with non-heterosexual partners. \n\nThe author's decision to break up might not be wrong if they felt uncomfortable with the partner's sexuality. However, there's a nuance here. The author mentions they don't care if someone is gay or bi, but their actions suggest otherwise. The breakup was based on the boyfriend's self-disclosure, which is a personal choice. However, the author's reasoning might be influenced by their own insecurities rather than the boyfriend's behavior. \n\nIn terms of ethics, breaking up because of a partner's sexual orientation could be seen as discriminatory, especially if the partner is being honest and there's no betrayal. But if the author felt that their own happiness is compromised, it's a personal choice. The key here is whether the breakup was a result of the boyfriend's actions or the author's own feelings. Since the boyfriend didn't do anything deceitful, and the author's issue is with their own expectations versus the partner's identity, the author might be in the wrong for not accepting the partner as they are. However, it's also possible that the author isn't in the wrong because they were honest about their own needs and limits.\n\nAnother angle is that the author lied about the reason for the breakup. Lying could be seen as wrong, but the intention was to protect the boyfriend's feelings. But if the real issue was the bisexuality, then the author's honesty could have led to a better resolution. Maybe they didn't want to confront their own biases, leading to a dishonest breakup.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, it's a bit of a gray area. But generally, if someone can't accept their partner's true self after they come out, especially without any deceit from the partner, it might be seen as the person breaking up without just cause. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong.\n"
