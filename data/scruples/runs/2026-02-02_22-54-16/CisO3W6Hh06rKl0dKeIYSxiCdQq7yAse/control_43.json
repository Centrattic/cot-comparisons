Overall, he\u2019s a great person and I hope that we can stay friends, despite what happened. \n\nBasically, a few weeks ago, we were having drinks at his apartment. He said there was something he wanted to tell me and he hoped I wouldn\u2019t judge. I said okay (obviously nervous). He told me that he thinks he\u2019s bi. I asked what makes him think that and he finally admitted that he had hooked up with a few guys before me. \n\nNow, I just want to clarify that I don\u2019t care if a person is gay, bi, whatever. You only get one life and you should try to find happiness. But I have never (as far as I know) dated a guy who wasn\u2019t straight. So I was a little taken aback. \n\nThe rest of the night was somewhat awkward and we ended up just going to sleep. Over the next several days I started thinking of our relationship. We don\u2019t have sex that often for a young couple. Maybe once a week (always been that way). And when we do have sex I usually initiate. I\u2019m not bothered by the frequency  but I started questioning whether my boyfriend might just be gay and using me to cover that up. I started getting paranoid over whether he\u2019s even attracted to me (he compliments me on my appearance but I\u2019ve never felt...lust). \n\nAnyway I ended up breaking up with him. He said it was because he\u2019s bi and I denied that was the reason. I blamed the break up on some personal stuff I\u2019m going through and said I needed time alone. \n\nBut that was actually a lie. If he hadn\u2019t disclosed that stuff about his sexuality, I have no doubt we\u2019d still be together. I just couldn\u2019t get past it for some reason. \n\nAITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this AITA (Am I the Asshole?) story is in the wrong. The situation is that the author broke up with her boyfriend after he told her he's bisexual. They were in a two-year relationship, and he mentioned he had hooked up with guys before but it wasn't a big issue while they were dating. The author initially didn't care about his sexuality but became uncomfortable after the confession, leading her to break up. She admitted that if he hadn't told her, they'd still be together.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The boyfriend was honest about his bisexuality and past hookups. The author's main issue seems to be her own discomfort with his sexuality, even though she claims not to care. She lied about the reason for the breakup, which might be a red flag. In relationships, honesty is crucial. If she couldn't handle the situation openly, maybe she was being unfair. Also, she's taking his honesty as a reason to end things, which could be seen as holding it against him for being truthful. On the other hand, people have different boundaries. If she's not comfortable with a bisexual partner, even if he's monogamous, it's her right to set that boundary. However, the question is if she's in the wrong. \n\nIn some cases, making a partner \"the asshole\" for their inherent identity (like bisexuality) might be seen as unjust. But the author isn't rejecting him for being bisexual per se; she's upset because he had past relationships with men. However, she's also acknowledging she didn't know that before and now feels it's a dealbreaker. The problem is that she broke up when he was honest, which is a key part of a healthy relationship. Also, her reasoning for the breakup was a lie, which could add to the wrongdoing. \n\nBut it's also true that everyone has their own dealbreakers. If she values a monogamous relationship where the partner is only attracted to women, maybe that's valid. However, bisexuality is about attraction to both sexes, not necessarily about being unfaithful. The fact that she started questioning his attraction to her and felt the need to break up because of his sexuality might imply that she's not respecting his identity. \n\nSo, the core issue is whether it's fair to break up based on something that was disclosed and didn't affect the relationship before. Since the boyfriend was honest and there's no indication of deceit, the author might be in the wrong for ending the relationship over his sexuality. But if she felt it was a fundamental incompatibility, even if it's not the norm, that's her choice. However, lying about the reason for the breakup could be seen as manipulative. \n\nI think the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because she broke up when he was honest, which is a positive trait. Her discomfort isn't a valid reason to end the relationship, especially if she claims not to care about his orientation. Also, lying about the cause of the breakup adds to the issue. But there's a nuance here where maybe she's dealing with her own biases. In some contexts, people might argue it's not wrong if it's a personal boundary. However, considering the boyfriend was truthful and not unfaithful, the author is more likely the asshole here.\n"
