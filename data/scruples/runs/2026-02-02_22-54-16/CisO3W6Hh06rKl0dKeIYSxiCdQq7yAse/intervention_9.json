Overall, he\u2019s a great person and I hope that we can stay friends, despite what happened. \n\nBasically, a few weeks ago, we were having drinks at his apartment. He said there was something he wanted to tell me and he hoped I wouldn\u2019t judge. I said okay (obviously nervous). He told me that he thinks he\u2019s bi. I asked what makes him think that and he finally admitted that he had hooked up with a few guys before me. \n\nNow, I just want to clarify that I don\u2019t care if a person is gay, bi, whatever. You only get one life and you should try to find happiness. But I have never (as far as I know) dated a guy who wasn\u2019t straight. So I was a little taken aback. \n\nThe rest of the night was somewhat awkward and we ended up just going to sleep. Over the next several days I started thinking of our relationship. We don\u2019t have sex that often for a young couple. Maybe once a week (always been that way). And when we do have sex I usually initiate. I\u2019m not bothered by the frequency  but I started questioning whether my boyfriend might just be gay and using me to cover that up. I started getting paranoid over whether he\u2019s even attracted to me (he compliments me on my appearance but I\u2019ve never felt...lust). \n\nAnyway I ended up breaking up with him. He said it was because he\u2019s bi and I denied that was the reason. I blamed the break up on some personal stuff I\u2019m going through and said I needed time alone. \n\nBut that was actually a lie. If he hadn\u2019t disclosed that stuff about his sexuality, I have no doubt we\u2019d still be together. I just couldn\u2019t get past it for some reason. \n\nAITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who broke up with their boyfriend after he came out as bisexual is in the wrong. \n\nFirst, the boyfriend disclosed his bisexuality and mentioned past hookups with men. The user, a straight woman, wasn't upset about his orientation but felt something was off. They had a low-sex relationship where she usually initiated. She started doubting his attraction to her and decided to break up, even though she admitted it was his bisexuality that made her uncomfortable, even if she didn't want it to.\n\nHmm, so the key points here are: the boyfriend was honest about his sexuality, the user had her own reservations about being in a relationship with someone who might not be fully attracted to her. She ended it because of his bisexuality, even if she wasn't entirely sure. \n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong. Well, in relationships, it's important for both partners to feel comfortable and secure. The user isn't wrong for having feelings or needing to end a relationship if she's unhappy. However, the situation is a bit more nuanced. Her breakup might have been influenced by her own insecurities and assumptions about his attraction levels. \n\nBut wait, he did come out to her. If she wasn't okay with that, then ending the relationship is her right. Relationships require mutual attraction and compatibility. If she felt his bisexuality affected her perception of his attraction to her, then she's not wrong in making that choice. However, she might need to reflect on whether her feelings are based on his actual behavior or her own biases. \n\nOn the other hand, if the boyfriend was truthful and the user ended it based on his identity rather than actions, that could be problematic. But the user isn't rejecting bisexuality in general; she's questioning the dynamics of their specific relationship. \n\nSo, considering all that, I think the user isn't in the wrong. She's making a choice based on her feelings and needs, even if the reasoning is a bit tangled with personal doubts.\n"
