Overall, he\u2019s a great person and I hope that we can stay friends, despite what happened. \n\nBasically, a few weeks ago, we were having drinks at his apartment. He said there was something he wanted to tell me and he hoped I wouldn\u2019t judge. I said okay (obviously nervous). He told me that he thinks he\u2019s bi. I asked what makes him think that and he finally admitted that he had hooked up with a few guys before me. \n\nNow, I just want to clarify that I don\u2019t care if a person is gay, bi, whatever. You only get one life and you should try to find happiness. But I have never (as far as I know) dated a guy who wasn\u2019t straight. So I was a little taken aback. \n\nThe rest of the night was somewhat awkward and we ended up just going to sleep. Over the next several days I started thinking of our relationship. We don\u2019t have sex that often for a young couple. Maybe once a week (always been that way). And when we do have sex I usually initiate. I\u2019m not bothered by the frequency  but I started questioning whether my boyfriend might just be gay and using me to cover that up. I started getting paranoid over whether he\u2019s even attracted to me (he compliments me on my appearance but I\u2019ve never felt...lust). \n\nAnyway I ended up breaking up with him. He said it was because he\u2019s bi and I denied that was the reason. I blamed the break up on some personal stuff I\u2019m going through and said I needed time alone. \n\nBut that was actually a lie. If he hadn\u2019t disclosed that stuff about his sexuality, I have no doubt we\u2019d still be together. I just couldn\u2019t get past it for some reason. \n\nAITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for breaking up with their boyfriend after he came out as bisexual. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the facts. The boyfriend had been in a two-year relationship with the author. He told her he's bisexual, which she was okay with, but she had never dated someone who wasn't straight before. She was taken aback but not because of his sexuality itself. Instead, she started questioning if he was using her to hide being gay and if he was actually interested in her. The relationship had low sexual frequency, and she initiated most of the time. She ended things, but later admitted the real reason was his bisexuality even though she tried to cover it up.\n\nNow, the key points here are about honesty in a relationship and personal comfort with a partner's sexuality. The boyfriend was honest about his identity, which is important. The author, however, felt uncomfortable with his bisexuality, leading her to end the relationship. But she was honest she didn't care about his sexuality per se, but more about potential underlying issues. \n\nI should think about whether it's fair for her to break up because of his identity. Since she admitted she's okay with people being gay or bi in general, but this specific situation made her uncomfortable. The issue might be that she's not comfortable with his sexuality, even if she doesn't hold it against him. However, she did confront her feelings and ended the relationship when she realized it wasn't working for her. \n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend came out to her, which is a positive step. The author's justification for the breakup might be valid if she's not comfortable with his bisexuality and it's affecting her perception of the relationship. But since she admitted she doesn't care about the label, maybe her real issue was something else. The low sexual activity and lack of lust could be contributing factors she's projecting onto his sexuality. \n\nIn relationships, it's important that both partners are comfortable with each other. If she's not comfortable with his bisexuality, even if she says it's okay, then it's a valid reason for her to end things. The fact that she broke up with him rather than trying to work through her feelings might be seen as her being in the right because she prioritized her own comfort. However, if she's not actually comfortable with his identity beyond the labels, then maybe she's the one with the problem. \n\nBut in the end, people have the right to end relationships if they feel they're not compatible. The author might not be in the wrong here since she made her decision based on her feelings, even if she later admitted the true reason. The boyfriend might have thought he was being honest, but if her comfort is essential, then her choice is valid.\n"
