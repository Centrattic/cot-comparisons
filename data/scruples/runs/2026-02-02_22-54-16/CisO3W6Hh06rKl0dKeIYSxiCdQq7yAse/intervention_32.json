Overall, he\u2019s a great person and I hope that we can stay friends, despite what happened. \n\nBasically, a few weeks ago, we were having drinks at his apartment. He said there was something he wanted to tell me and he hoped I wouldn\u2019t judge. I said okay (obviously nervous). He told me that he thinks he\u2019s bi. I asked what makes him think that and he finally admitted that he had hooked up with a few guys before me. \n\nNow, I just want to clarify that I don\u2019t care if a person is gay, bi, whatever. You only get one life and you should try to find happiness. But I have never (as far as I know) dated a guy who wasn\u2019t straight. So I was a little taken aback. \n\nThe rest of the night was somewhat awkward and we ended up just going to sleep. Over the next several days I started thinking of our relationship. We don\u2019t have sex that often for a young couple. Maybe once a week (always been that way). And when we do have sex I usually initiate. I\u2019m not bothered by the frequency  but I started questioning whether my boyfriend might just be gay and using me to cover that up. I started getting paranoid over whether he\u2019s even attracted to me (he compliments me on my appearance but I\u2019ve never felt...lust). \n\nAnyway I ended up breaking up with him. He said it was because he\u2019s bi and I denied that was the reason. I blamed the break up on some personal stuff I\u2019m going through and said I needed time alone. \n\nBut that was actually a lie. If he hadn\u2019t disclosed that stuff about his sexuality, I have no doubt we\u2019d still be together. I just couldn\u2019t get past it for some reason. \n\nAITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author (the person who wrote the AITA post) is in the wrong here. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the main issue is that the boyfriend confessed he's bisexual and had hooked up with guys before. The author breaks up with him, but later admits that his bisexuality was the real reason, even though she claims it wasn't. She says she's not against people being gay or bi, but she's never dated a non-straight guy before. The breakup comes after she starts questioning if he's gay and using her as a cover, even though their sex life was infrequent and she usually initiated it.\n\nSo, the key points here are: The boyfriend comes out as bi with past experiences, the author is taken aback but claims she doesn't care about orientation. However, the underlying issue seems to be her discomfort with his bisexuality and possible insecurities about the relationship dynamics. She breaks up with him, but lies about the reason, which later causes her to feel conflicted.\n\nNow, to determine if she's in the wrong. In relationships, honesty is important. The boyfriend was honest about his sexuality, which is a valid aspect of his identity. The author felt uncomfortable and couldn't get past it, even though she says she's okay with it. That might be a personal issue, but acting on that by breaking up isn't inherently wrong. However, lying about the reason for the breakup could be seen as dishonest. But the main question is whether she's in the wrong for breaking up because of his bisexuality.\n\nBisexuality is a legitimate sexual orientation. If the author wasn't comfortable with that, even if she claims she is, then she's not in the wrong for ending the relationship. People have the right to be in relationships with partners whose orientation aligns with their comfort. The fact that she's lying about the reason might show she's conflicted or avoiding confrontation, but the breakup itself isn't necessarily wrong. Also, the boyfriend using his bisexuality as a confession is a responsible step, and if the author couldn't handle it, then the breakup is a result of mutual incompatibility in values or comfort zones.\n\nBut some might argue that the author is being hypocritical because she claims not to care but actually does. However, the act of breaking up because of something she wasn't prepared for isn't unethical. People have the right to leave relationships where they feel their needs aren't met. So, considering all that, the answer might be B (not in the wrong). But I need to check if there's anything else. The boyfriend didn't hide his bisexuality, he came out to her, so he wasn't deceptive. Therefore, the author's decision to leave is her choice, even if it's based on personal discomfort.\n"
