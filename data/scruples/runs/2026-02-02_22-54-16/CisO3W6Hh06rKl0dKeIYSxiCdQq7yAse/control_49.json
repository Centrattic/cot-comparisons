Overall, he\u2019s a great person and I hope that we can stay friends, despite what happened. \n\nBasically, a few weeks ago, we were having drinks at his apartment. He said there was something he wanted to tell me and he hoped I wouldn\u2019t judge. I said okay (obviously nervous). He told me that he thinks he\u2019s bi. I asked what makes him think that and he finally admitted that he had hooked up with a few guys before me. \n\nNow, I just want to clarify that I don\u2019t care if a person is gay, bi, whatever. You only get one life and you should try to find happiness. But I have never (as far as I know) dated a guy who wasn\u2019t straight. So I was a little taken aback. \n\nThe rest of the night was somewhat awkward and we ended up just going to sleep. Over the next several days I started thinking of our relationship. We don\u2019t have sex that often for a young couple. Maybe once a week (always been that way). And when we do have sex I usually initiate. I\u2019m not bothered by the frequency  but I started questioning whether my boyfriend might just be gay and using me to cover that up. I started getting paranoid over whether he\u2019s even attracted to me (he compliments me on my appearance but I\u2019ve never felt...lust). \n\nAnyway I ended up breaking up with him. He said it was because he\u2019s bi and I denied that was the reason. I blamed the break up on some personal stuff I\u2019m going through and said I needed time alone. \n\nBut that was actually a lie. If he hadn\u2019t disclosed that stuff about his sexuality, I have no doubt we\u2019d still be together. I just couldn\u2019t get past it for some reason. \n\nAITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author (a woman) broke up with her boyfriend after he told her he's bisexual. She says she doesn't care about people's sexuality, but she's never dated a non-straight guy before. She was taken aback by his confession, started questioning if he was using her to cover being gay, and became paranoid about his lack of sexual interest. Then she broke up with him, but lied about the reason, saying it was personal stuff instead of his bisexuality.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. The boyfriend came out as bisexual and admitted to hooking up with guys before. The author felt she couldn't get past this, even though she claims it's not about his sexuality per se but maybe his attraction to her. She ended the relationship but lied about the reason, which complicates things.\n\nIs it wrong to break up because of someone's bisexuality? Well, if the author isn't okay with her partner being bi, that could be an issue in the relationship. But bisexuality is a valid sexual orientation. If the author can't accept that, maybe the breakup is her being honest about her deal-breakers. However, the way she handled it\u2014lying about the reason\u2014might be problematic. Honesty is important in relationships, so lying post-breakup could be inconsiderate.\n\nAdditionally, the author mentions that their sex life wasn't frequent, and she initiated it. She started to think he might be gay and using her. But if he's bi, that doesn't necessarily mean he's not attracted to her. Maybe there are other reasons for the low sex drive. The author's assumptions here could be unfounded. Projection or insecurity might be playing a role here.\n\nThe key points are whether the author is in the wrong for ending the relationship because of her partner's bisexuality, and for lying about the reason. On one hand, people have the right to be with someone who aligns with their needs and expectations. If being with a bi person isn't something she can accept, ending the relationship isn't inherently wrong. However, if the issue is more about insecurity or a lack of attraction that's not directly tied to his bisexuality, that's a different matter.\n\nBut the AITA (Am I the Asshole) context usually looks at whether the person acted unreasonably. The boyfriend was honest about his sexuality, which is a valid aspect of himself. The author couldn't accept that, even though she claims not to care about people's sexuality. That contradiction might make her the asshole. Also, lying about the reason for the breakup could be seen as being dishonest, especially if the real reason is something the author isn't proud of.\n\nIn relationships, when one partner can't accept the other's identity, it's often seen as a deal-breaker, but the person who can't accept it is usually the one in the wrong. So in this case, the author is ending the relationship because of her partner's bisexuality, even though she says she doesn't care. The fact that she's lying about the reason suggests she feels guilty but still thinks she was right to end it. However, the community on AITA often sides with the person who was honest about their identity. So the boyfriend isn't in the wrong for being bi and telling her. The author is in the wrong for not being able to accept his identity and for lying about the reason for the breakup.\n"
