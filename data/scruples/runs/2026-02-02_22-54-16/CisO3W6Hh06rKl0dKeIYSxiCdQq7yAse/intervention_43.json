Overall, he\u2019s a great person and I hope that we can stay friends, despite what happened. \n\nBasically, a few weeks ago, we were having drinks at his apartment. He said there was something he wanted to tell me and he hoped I wouldn\u2019t judge. I said okay (obviously nervous). He told me that he thinks he\u2019s bi. I asked what makes him think that and he finally admitted that he had hooked up with a few guys before me. \n\nNow, I just want to clarify that I don\u2019t care if a person is gay, bi, whatever. You only get one life and you should try to find happiness. But I have never (as far as I know) dated a guy who wasn\u2019t straight. So I was a little taken aback. \n\nThe rest of the night was somewhat awkward and we ended up just going to sleep. Over the next several days I started thinking of our relationship. We don\u2019t have sex that often for a young couple. Maybe once a week (always been that way). And when we do have sex I usually initiate. I\u2019m not bothered by the frequency  but I started questioning whether my boyfriend might just be gay and using me to cover that up. I started getting paranoid over whether he\u2019s even attracted to me (he compliments me on my appearance but I\u2019ve never felt...lust). \n\nAnyway I ended up breaking up with him. He said it was because he\u2019s bi and I denied that was the reason. I blamed the break up on some personal stuff I\u2019m going through and said I needed time alone. \n\nBut that was actually a lie. If he hadn\u2019t disclosed that stuff about his sexuality, I have no doubt we\u2019d still be together. I just couldn\u2019t get past it for some reason. \n\nAITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong after breaking up with her boyfriend when he came out as bisexual. \n\nFirst, the boyfriend told her he's bisexual and had hooked up with guys before. The author doesn't care about his sexuality in general but was shocked because she's only dated straight guys. She felt he might be using her to \"cover up\" being gay and became paranoid about his attraction. She broke up with him, but lied about the reason, saying it was due to personal issues instead of his bisexuality.\n\nNow, to determine if she's in the wrong. The key points here are honesty in relationships and personal compatibility. The boyfriend was honest about his sexuality. The author's issue wasn't with him being bi per se, but with the possibility that he might be gay and not genuinely attracted to her. She felt his bisexuality was a factor in their infrequent and initiated sex. However, she denied the real reason for the breakup and later admitted it was because of his sexuality.\n\nIn a relationship, both partners need to be comfortable with each other's identities. If the author realized that his bisexuality was a deal-breaker for her, then she made a decision based on her own feelings. But lying about the reason for the breakup might be where she's in the wrong. Honesty is crucial for mutual respect. Even if her feelings are valid, not being truthful could be seen as manipulative or disrespectful.\n\nOn the other hand, people have different levels of comfort when it comes to their partner's sexuality. The author might not have realized her own biases until the truth came out. But once she acknowledged the real reason, she should have communicated it. By not doing so, she might have left him confused and not given him a chance to address her concerns. For example, if he was committed to being in a monogamous relationship with her, she might have needed more discussion to understand his feelings or her own.\n\nSo, the main ethical point is whether she was honest in her decision. If she couldn't accept his bisexuality and that was the real reason, she should have been upfront. Lying to spare his feelings or avoid conflict might be worse than the initial breakup. Therefore, she's in the wrong for not being truthful about the cause of the breakup, even if her feelings were genuine.\n"
