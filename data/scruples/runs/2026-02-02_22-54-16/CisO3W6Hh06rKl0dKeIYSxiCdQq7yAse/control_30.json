Overall, he\u2019s a great person and I hope that we can stay friends, despite what happened. \n\nBasically, a few weeks ago, we were having drinks at his apartment. He said there was something he wanted to tell me and he hoped I wouldn\u2019t judge. I said okay (obviously nervous). He told me that he thinks he\u2019s bi. I asked what makes him think that and he finally admitted that he had hooked up with a few guys before me. \n\nNow, I just want to clarify that I don\u2019t care if a person is gay, bi, whatever. You only get one life and you should try to find happiness. But I have never (as far as I know) dated a guy who wasn\u2019t straight. So I was a little taken aback. \n\nThe rest of the night was somewhat awkward and we ended up just going to sleep. Over the next several days I started thinking of our relationship. We don\u2019t have sex that often for a young couple. Maybe once a week (always been that way). And when we do have sex I usually initiate. I\u2019m not bothered by the frequency  but I started questioning whether my boyfriend might just be gay and using me to cover that up. I started getting paranoid over whether he\u2019s even attracted to me (he compliments me on my appearance but I\u2019ve never felt...lust). \n\nAnyway I ended up breaking up with him. He said it was because he\u2019s bi and I denied that was the reason. I blamed the break up on some personal stuff I\u2019m going through and said I needed time alone. \n\nBut that was actually a lie. If he hadn\u2019t disclosed that stuff about his sexuality, I have no doubt we\u2019d still be together. I just couldn\u2019t get past it for some reason. \n\nAITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who broke up with their boyfriend after he came out as bisexual is in the wrong. The question is whether the author (AITA) is at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The boyfriend (24M) told his girlfriend (26F) he's bisexual and had hooked up with guys before. She was okay with people being gay or bi but had never dated someone not straight. She broke up with him, but she admitted it was because of his bisexuality, though she blamed it on personal issues. He says she denied the real reason.\n\nSo, the key points here: She broke up because of his sexual orientation. Is that valid? Well, people have different deal-breakers. She's not against bisexuality in general, but perhaps felt uncomfortable because he had been with men before, even though they were in a relationship now. But wait, he came out to her before the breakup. She had time to process it but still chose to end things. \n\nBut why did she break up? She mentions that the sex wasn't frequent, she usually initiates, and she wondered if he's even attracted to her. Maybe she felt insecure or doubted his attraction because of his bisexuality. But is it fair to end a two-year relationship over someone's sexual orientation, especially when she claims to accept it? \n\nAlso, she lied about the reason for the breakup. He thought it was personal stuff, but she actually couldn't get past his bisexuality. That's a problem because she didn't own up to the real reason, which could be dishonest. \n\nBut maybe she felt that his bisexuality made her feel insecure. However, that's her issue to work through. If she couldn't accept his past or his orientation despite her stated acceptance, maybe she was being hypocritical. \n\nOn the other hand, people can have different boundaries. If she was only comfortable dating straight guys, then maybe it's her choice. But since she was okay with being with him before he came out, and only broke up after he did, it's possible she was using his bisexuality as an excuse for deeper issues, like the lack of attraction or sexual frequency. \n\nBut the question is whether she's in the wrong. If she genuinely couldn't accept his bisexuality, even if she said she would, then yes, she's being inconsistent. Also, lying about the reason for the breakup is dishonest. However, if she feels that his bisexuality is incompatible with their relationship, maybe she's not wrong. \n\nIn the AITA context, the community often looks at whether the person acted in a way that's fair and honest. Since she broke up with him after he came out, and then lied about the reason, she might be considered \"not in the wrong\" if she felt it was necessary for her happiness. But some might say she should have addressed her insecurities instead of breaking up and lying. \n\nAlternatively, if her issue was really about his past hookups rather than his current orientation, that's a different angle. But she admitted the real issue was his bisexuality. So, in the end, it's a bit of a toss-up. However, in the AITA format, the community often sides with people who are honest but struggle with accepting others' identities. But since she didn't act in bad faith\u2014she just had a personal issue\u2014it might be considered not her fault. \n\nBut some might argue that she shouldn't base her breakup on someone's sexuality if she claims to accept it. So the answer is B (No), the author is not in the wrong because she's allowed to have boundaries, even if they're based on personal discomfort. However, her dishonesty might complicate it. But given the context, the answer is B.\n"
