Overall, he\u2019s a great person and I hope that we can stay friends, despite what happened. \n\nBasically, a few weeks ago, we were having drinks at his apartment. He said there was something he wanted to tell me and he hoped I wouldn\u2019t judge. I said okay (obviously nervous). He told me that he thinks he\u2019s bi. I asked what makes him think that and he finally admitted that he had hooked up with a few guys before me. \n\nNow, I just want to clarify that I don\u2019t care if a person is gay, bi, whatever. You only get one life and you should try to find happiness. But I have never (as far as I know) dated a guy who wasn\u2019t straight. So I was a little taken aback. \n\nThe rest of the night was somewhat awkward and we ended up just going to sleep. Over the next several days I started thinking of our relationship. We don\u2019t have sex that often for a young couple. Maybe once a week (always been that way). And when we do have sex I usually initiate. I\u2019m not bothered by the frequency  but I started questioning whether my boyfriend might just be gay and using me to cover that up. I started getting paranoid over whether he\u2019s even attracted to me (he compliments me on my appearance but I\u2019ve never felt...lust). \n\nAnyway I ended up breaking up with him. He said it was because he\u2019s bi and I denied that was the reason. I blamed the break up on some personal stuff I\u2019m going through and said I needed time alone. \n\nBut that was actually a lie. If he hadn\u2019t disclosed that stuff about his sexuality, I have no doubt we\u2019d still be together. I just couldn\u2019t get past it for some reason. \n\nAITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author broke up with her boyfriend after he admitted to being bisexual and having hooked up with guys before. She claims she doesn't care about his sexuality, but the breakup happened because she was worried he might not be attracted to her and was using her to cover up being gay. She now feels guilty because she lied about the reason for the breakup.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the facts. The boyfriend came out as bisexual, which the author says she's okay with. However, she started questioning his attraction to her because they don't have sex often and she has to initiate. She felt insecure and decided to break up. The key points here are her emotional reaction and the lack of communication.\n\nIn relationships, communication is crucial. Did the author handle this the right way? She didn't confront her insecurities directly with him. Instead, she broke up without being honest about the real reason. That might have been hurtful because he thought the issue was his sexuality. On the other hand, she had a right to feel her feelings, but maybe a more open conversation could have resolved things.\n\nIs she in the wrong? If she couldn't accept his bisexuality or his past, then maybe she was right to break up. But the fact that she lied about the reason and didn't address her concerns openly might make her responsible for the way the breakup was handled. The question is whether her actions were justified given her feelings. Since she admitted she couldn't get past it, even though she's not against bisexuality, it's a personal issue. But lying about the reason adds guilt. So maybe she's not in the wrong for the breakup itself but for not being honest. The answer might be B (Not in the wrong), but the nuances matter.\n"
