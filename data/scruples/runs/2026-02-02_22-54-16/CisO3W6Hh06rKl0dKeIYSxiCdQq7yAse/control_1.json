Overall, he\u2019s a great person and I hope that we can stay friends, despite what happened. \n\nBasically, a few weeks ago, we were having drinks at his apartment. He said there was something he wanted to tell me and he hoped I wouldn\u2019t judge. I said okay (obviously nervous). He told me that he thinks he\u2019s bi. I asked what makes him think that and he finally admitted that he had hooked up with a few guys before me. \n\nNow, I just want to clarify that I don\u2019t care if a person is gay, bi, whatever. You only get one life and you should try to find happiness. But I have never (as far as I know) dated a guy who wasn\u2019t straight. So I was a little taken aback. \n\nThe rest of the night was somewhat awkward and we ended up just going to sleep. Over the next several days I started thinking of our relationship. We don\u2019t have sex that often for a young couple. Maybe once a week (always been that way). And when we do have sex I usually initiate. I\u2019m not bothered by the frequency  but I started questioning whether my boyfriend might just be gay and using me to cover that up. I started getting paranoid over whether he\u2019s even attracted to me (he compliments me on my appearance but I\u2019ve never felt...lust). \n\nAnyway I ended up breaking up with him. He said it was because he\u2019s bi and I denied that was the reason. I blamed the break up on some personal stuff I\u2019m going through and said I needed time alone. \n\nBut that was actually a lie. If he hadn\u2019t disclosed that stuff about his sexuality, I have no doubt we\u2019d still be together. I just couldn\u2019t get past it for some reason. \n\nAITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA story is in the wrong. Let me read through the details again.\n\nSo the situation is that the woman broke up with her boyfriend after he told her he's bisexual. He mentioned he had hooked up with guys before, which she knew about. She says she doesn't care about his sexuality but wasn't with any gay guy before. She was taken aback but admitted that. The relationship had low sex frequency, which she didn't mind, but she started questioning if he was using her to hide being gay. She ended up breaking up, but lied about the reason, saying it was her personal stuff. However, she admits that if he hadn't told her, they'd still be together. The question is whether she's at fault.\n\nHmm. First, let's consider consent and honesty. He was honest about his bisexuality and past behavior. She claims she's accepting of other sexual orientations, but her reaction shows discomfort. She broke up because of his sexuality, even though she said it's okay. That's a conflict. \n\nIn relationships, both partners need to feel comfortable and accepted. If one is uncomfortable with the other's sexual orientation, that's a problem. However, the woman is in her right to end a relationship if she's not happy. But the issue is whether she's in the wrong for ending it because of his bisexuality, especially when she claims to accept it. \n\nAlso, the fact that she lied about the breakup reason suggests she's conflicted. She might have internal biases. The community's AITA responses often consider if the action was justified. Since she's not in a toxic relationship but ends it over sexuality she initially said she's okay with, that could be seen as discriminatory. But if she's not in the wrong because she's not obligated to stay in a relationship she's unhappy in, even if the reason is subconscious or unacknowledged biases.\n\nAnother angle: he was honest from the start. If she wasn't okay with bisexuality, she should have addressed it. But she says she is okay. So perhaps she's not at fault because she can't force herself to be in a relationship if her feelings have changed. But then again, if she's breaking up over something she claims not to care about, that's a problem.\n\nI think the answer depends on whether the breakup was based on a lie or not. Since she admitted the real reason was his sexuality, and she couldn't get past it, even though she said she was open-minded, that could be seen as being in the wrong. Because she's acting against her stated beliefs. But if the problem is her own insecurities or unacknowledged feelings, maybe she's not at fault. The community usually sides with people who are honest about their feelings. However, if she's breaking up because of something she claims not to care about, that's a contradiction. So the answer is maybe A.\n"
