Overall, he\u2019s a great person and I hope that we can stay friends, despite what happened. \n\nBasically, a few weeks ago, we were having drinks at his apartment. He said there was something he wanted to tell me and he hoped I wouldn\u2019t judge. I said okay (obviously nervous). He told me that he thinks he\u2019s bi. I asked what makes him think that and he finally admitted that he had hooked up with a few guys before me. \n\nNow, I just want to clarify that I don\u2019t care if a person is gay, bi, whatever. You only get one life and you should try to find happiness. But I have never (as far as I know) dated a guy who wasn\u2019t straight. So I was a little taken aback. \n\nThe rest of the night was somewhat awkward and we ended up just going to sleep. Over the next several days I started thinking of our relationship. We don\u2019t have sex that often for a young couple. Maybe once a week (always been that way). And when we do have sex I usually initiate. I\u2019m not bothered by the frequency  but I started questioning whether my boyfriend might just be gay and using me to cover that up. I started getting paranoid over whether he\u2019s even attracted to me (he compliments me on my appearance but I\u2019ve never felt...lust). \n\nAnyway I ended up breaking up with him. He said it was because he\u2019s bi and I denied that was the reason. I blamed the break up on some personal stuff I\u2019m going through and said I needed time alone. \n\nBut that was actually a lie. If he hadn\u2019t disclosed that stuff about his sexuality, I have no doubt we\u2019d still be together. I just couldn\u2019t get past it for some reason. \n\nAITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to unpack this. The user is asking if the person who broke up with their boyfriend because he's bisexual is in the wrong. The question is about whether the author (AITA) is at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the situation. The boyfriend came out as bisexual after two years of dating. The author was okay with his sexuality in general but felt conflicted because he had hooked up with guys before. They had a low sex frequency, and the author started to question if the boyfriend was really into her. She ended the relationship, but she admitted it was because of his bisexuality, even though she told him it was due to her personal issues.\n\nNow, the key points here. Bisexuality is a valid sexual orientation. Breaking up because someone is bi might be an issue because it's not a choice, but the author's reasoning seems to be that she had never dated someone not straight before and felt unsure. She also mentioned that the sex wasn't as frequent or passionate as she expected, leading her to paranoia. However, she also acknowledged that he's a good person and they might stay friends.\n\nSome might argue that it's wrong to end a relationship based on someone's sexuality, especially if it's a valid orientation. But others might say that if the relationship wasn't fulfilling her needs and she couldn't move past the issue, then it's her right to leave. The problem is whether she's being unfair to him by ending the relationship because of his bisexuality, or if her decision is valid given her personal feelings and the relationship's dynamics.\n\nThe author admitted she couldn't get past the fact that he's bi, which made her break up. But she lied about the reason, which might complicate things. However, the core issue is whether bisexuality is a valid reason to stay in a relationship. Since bisexuality isn't a choice and doesn't inherently affect relationship dynamics, some might say the author is at fault for ending it on that basis.\n\nBut then, she also had other issues like the lack of sex and his lack of lust. Maybe those were contributing factors, but the main trigger was his bisexuality. So the question is, is it wrong to break up over someone being bi, even if it's not affecting the relationship? In some cases, people have different deal-breakers. If the author is uncomfortable with his sexuality and can't reconcile that, then it's her right. However, if the issue is that he's bi and it's not affecting their relationship, she might be the one at fault for having prejudice.\n\nBut the original question is if the author is in the wrong. If she's breaking up because of his sexuality, that's a problem. But if she's breaking up because she had doubts about the relationship's compatibility in terms of attraction and frequency, then it's more about their relationship not working out. The line here is thin, but the fact that she admitted the bisexuality was the main reason might make her at fault. However, she also mentioned that she's not opposed to bisexuality in general, just the fact that he had hooked up with guys before. Maybe she felt insecure or that he wasn't fully committed to her. But in a monogamous relationship, past relationships shouldn't matter unless there's infidelity.\n\nSo, the answer depends on whether bisexuality itself is the issue. Since he's in a monogamous relationship with her, his bisexuality doesn't mean he's cheating. If the author is breaking up because of his orientation, she's at fault. But if she's breaking up because she felt he wasn't attracted to her, that's a different matter. The problem is that she didn't know for sure if he wasn't attracted to her; her assumptions led to the breakup. However, if the main reason is his bisexuality, then the answer would be A (she's wrong). But if other factors (low sex drive, lack of connection) are the real issues, then B (not wrong). The user's own assessment is that the author isn't wrong, but the answer depends on the reasoning. The key is that the author admits the bisexuality was the main trigger, even if she lied about it. So, in that case, the answer might be A because she ended it based on his sexuality, which is a fixed trait and not a choice. However, if the issue was her insecurities and not his bisexuality itself, then B. But the way the story is told, she explicitly says she couldn't get past the fact he's bi. Hence, A.\n"
