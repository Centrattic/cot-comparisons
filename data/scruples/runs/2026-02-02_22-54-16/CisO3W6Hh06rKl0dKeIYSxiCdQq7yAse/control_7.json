Overall, he\u2019s a great person and I hope that we can stay friends, despite what happened. \n\nBasically, a few weeks ago, we were having drinks at his apartment. He said there was something he wanted to tell me and he hoped I wouldn\u2019t judge. I said okay (obviously nervous). He told me that he thinks he\u2019s bi. I asked what makes him think that and he finally admitted that he had hooked up with a few guys before me. \n\nNow, I just want to clarify that I don\u2019t care if a person is gay, bi, whatever. You only get one life and you should try to find happiness. But I have never (as far as I know) dated a guy who wasn\u2019t straight. So I was a little taken aback. \n\nThe rest of the night was somewhat awkward and we ended up just going to sleep. Over the next several days I started thinking of our relationship. We don\u2019t have sex that often for a young couple. Maybe once a week (always been that way). And when we do have sex I usually initiate. I\u2019m not bothered by the frequency  but I started questioning whether my boyfriend might just be gay and using me to cover that up. I started getting paranoid over whether he\u2019s even attracted to me (he compliments me on my appearance but I\u2019ve never felt...lust). \n\nAnyway I ended up breaking up with him. He said it was because he\u2019s bi and I denied that was the reason. I blamed the break up on some personal stuff I\u2019m going through and said I needed time alone. \n\nBut that was actually a lie. If he hadn\u2019t disclosed that stuff about his sexuality, I have no doubt we\u2019d still be together. I just couldn\u2019t get past it for some reason. \n\nAITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who broke up with their boyfriend because he's bisexual is in the wrong. The situation is that the boyfriend came out as bisexual, admitting he had hooked up with guys before. The author of the post says they don't care about someone's sexuality, but they were taken aback because they've never dated someone not straight. They ended the relationship, claiming it was due to personal issues but actually because of the boyfriend's sexuality. The boyfriend says it was because he's bi, but the author denies that. \n\nSo, the main question here is whether the author was in the wrong for breaking up because of the boyfriend's bisexuality. Let's break it down. \n\nFirst, bisexuality is a valid sexual orientation. It means being attracted to both genders. The fact that the boyfriend had past relationships with men doesn't inherently make him any less committed to his relationship with the author. The author states they don't care about someone's sexuality, but the breakup happened because of it. That seems contradictory. \n\nThe author's reasoning for the breakup is rooted in their own discomfort with the boyfriend's bisexuality. Even though they say they don't judge, their actions suggest otherwise. They admit that if the boyfriend hadn't come out, they would still be together, which implies that the disclosure was the main reason. That's a problem because in a healthy relationship, a partner's sexuality shouldn't be a deal-breaker unless there's infidelity or dishonesty. The boyfriend came clean, so he wasn't hiding it. \n\nThe author also mentions that they initiated sex and that their sexual frequency is low, leading them to question if the boyfriend is even attracted to them. However, the boyfriend still compliments the author and they had been in a two-year relationship. Maybe the lack of sex is a separate issue, but the author's paranoia might stem from the boyfriend's bisexuality. \n\nThe key point is that the author broke up because of the boyfriend's genuine, non-harmful self-identification. Since the boyfriend didn't do anything wrong\u2014no cheating, no deceit\u2014the author's decision to end the relationship solely because of his bisexuality could be seen as discriminatory. Even if the author felt uncomfortable, the right approach would be to work through those feelings or part ways for honest reasons, not by lying about the cause. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that relationships are about compatibility. If the author couldn't accept the boyfriend's bisexuality, then breaking up is their right. However, the issue here is that the author is using personal issues as an excuse while actually being influenced by the boyfriend's sexuality. That dishonesty and the fact that the breakup is based on a non-issue (bisexuality isn't a reason to break up if there's no actual misconduct) points to the author being in the wrong.\n"
