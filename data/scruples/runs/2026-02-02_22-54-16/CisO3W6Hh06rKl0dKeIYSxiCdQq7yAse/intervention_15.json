Overall, he\u2019s a great person and I hope that we can stay friends, despite what happened. \n\nBasically, a few weeks ago, we were having drinks at his apartment. He said there was something he wanted to tell me and he hoped I wouldn\u2019t judge. I said okay (obviously nervous). He told me that he thinks he\u2019s bi. I asked what makes him think that and he finally admitted that he had hooked up with a few guys before me. \n\nNow, I just want to clarify that I don\u2019t care if a person is gay, bi, whatever. You only get one life and you should try to find happiness. But I have never (as far as I know) dated a guy who wasn\u2019t straight. So I was a little taken aback. \n\nThe rest of the night was somewhat awkward and we ended up just going to sleep. Over the next several days I started thinking of our relationship. We don\u2019t have sex that often for a young couple. Maybe once a week (always been that way). And when we do have sex I usually initiate. I\u2019m not bothered by the frequency  but I started questioning whether my boyfriend might just be gay and using me to cover that up. I started getting paranoid over whether he\u2019s even attracted to me (he compliments me on my appearance but I\u2019ve never felt...lust). \n\nAnyway I ended up breaking up with him. He said it was because he\u2019s bi and I denied that was the reason. I blamed the break up on some personal stuff I\u2019m going through and said I needed time alone. \n\nBut that was actually a lie. If he hadn\u2019t disclosed that stuff about his sexuality, I have no doubt we\u2019d still be together. I just couldn\u2019t get past it for some reason. \n\nAITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe main points from the story are: The author (a 24-year-old woman) dated her boyfriend for two years. He's a 26-year-old who identifies as bisexual. He told her he's had relationships with men before, which she found surprising because she's only dated straight guys. She admitted she doesn't have an issue with people being gay or bi in general but was taken aback. They didn't have sex often, and when they did, she usually initiated. She started wondering if he was using her to cover up being gay and felt paranoid about his attraction. She ended up breaking up with him, but she didn't tell him the real reason\u2014she lied and said it was about her personal stuff. She now feels conflicted because she knows he's a good person and wants to stay friends, but she can't get past his bisexuality.\n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong (AITA) for breaking up with him because of his bisexuality. The user thinks she's not in the wrong and wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. Relationships are based on mutual compatibility. If someone's values or needs aren't met, it's okay to end the relationship. However, breaking up based on someone's sexuality might be seen as discriminatory. But the author clarifies she doesn't care about bisexuality in general, just that she's uncomfortable with it in this case. She's never dated a non-straight person before, which adds to her discomfort.\n\nShe mentions that the frequency of sex is low, and she usually initiates. This might indicate that her sexual needs aren't being met, which could be a factor. However, she attributes this to his possible lack of attraction to her, which might not be directly related to his bisexuality but rather a different issue. The fact that he came out to her shows some level of honesty, which is important in a relationship.\n\nBut why would she break up because of his bisexuality? If she's okay with gay/bi people in general, but not in her own partner, that could be seen as a personal issue. However, it's also his right to be honest about his sexuality. The problem here is whether her decision to break up is justified. She felt her needs weren't met, but the root cause seems to be her discomfort with his bisexuality leading to doubt in his attraction to her.\n\nAnother angle is that she broke up with him but lied about the reason. Honesty is crucial in relationships, but since the relationship was ending, maybe she wanted to protect his feelings. Still, lying about the reason could be seen as dishonest. However, sometimes people lie to avoid hurting someone else, especially if they feel guilty.\n\nIs it fair to break up because of someone's sexuality if they've already disclosed it? The boyfriend was honest, which is a positive. The author's issue might stem from insecurity or not understanding her own needs. If she couldn't accept his bisexuality, maybe the relationship wasn't compatible from the start. However, it's also possible that she had other unaddressed issues in the relationship that the bisexuality highlighted.\n\nIn terms of right vs. wrong, there's no absolute right or wrong in personal relationships. But if the author's decision was based on personal discomfort rather than any wrongdoing by her partner, then she's not in the wrong. She's not obligated to stay in a relationship that doesn't meet her emotional or physical needs. However, some might argue that she should have addressed her concerns before breaking up instead of letting them fester. But she did communicate her feelings in the end, even if indirectly.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, I think the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). Her decision, while based on personal discomfort, is a valid reason for her to end the relationship. She was honest with herself about her feelings and made a choice based on her needs, even if it wasn't the easiest path. It's important to respect one's own needs and boundaries in relationships.\n"
