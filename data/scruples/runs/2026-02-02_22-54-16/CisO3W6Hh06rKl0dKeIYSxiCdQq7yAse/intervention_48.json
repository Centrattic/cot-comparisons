Overall, he\u2019s a great person and I hope that we can stay friends, despite what happened. \n\nBasically, a few weeks ago, we were having drinks at his apartment. He said there was something he wanted to tell me and he hoped I wouldn\u2019t judge. I said okay (obviously nervous). He told me that he thinks he\u2019s bi. I asked what makes him think that and he finally admitted that he had hooked up with a few guys before me. \n\nNow, I just want to clarify that I don\u2019t care if a person is gay, bi, whatever. You only get one life and you should try to find happiness. But I have never (as far as I know) dated a guy who wasn\u2019t straight. So I was a little taken aback. \n\nThe rest of the night was somewhat awkward and we ended up just going to sleep. Over the next several days I started thinking of our relationship. We don\u2019t have sex that often for a young couple. Maybe once a week (always been that way). And when we do have sex I usually initiate. I\u2019m not bothered by the frequency  but I started questioning whether my boyfriend might just be gay and using me to cover that up. I started getting paranoid over whether he\u2019s even attracted to me (he compliments me on my appearance but I\u2019ve never felt...lust). \n\nAnyway I ended up breaking up with him. He said it was because he\u2019s bi and I denied that was the reason. I blamed the break up on some personal stuff I\u2019m going through and said I needed time alone. \n\nBut that was actually a lie. If he hadn\u2019t disclosed that stuff about his sexuality, I have no doubt we\u2019d still be together. I just couldn\u2019t get past it for some reason. \n\nAITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author, a woman in a two-year relationship with her boyfriend, breaks up with him after he comes out as bisexual and admits to hooking up with guys before they met. The author says she's not judgmental about sexuality but wasn't in a relationship with a gay or bi guy before. She felt taken aback but clarified that she doesn't care about his sexuality. However, she started doubting if he was even attracted to her, leading to the breakup. She lied about the reason, blaming personal issues instead.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The boyfriend came out as bisexual, which the author wasn't expecting. She claims she's not against that, but the timing and context might matter. He admitted to past relationships with men, which the author didn't know about. Now, is it fair for her to break up because of that?\n\nIn relationships, honesty and communication are important. The boyfriend was honest about his sexuality and past, which is a positive. The author couldn't move past that, even though she claims it's not the issue. She felt the breakup was necessary, but lied about the reason. That might be where the problem is. Lying about the cause of a breakup could be seen as inconsiderate, even if her feelings are genuine.\n\nBut is the author in the wrong for breaking up? Well, people have the right to end relationships if they feel incompatible. However, the fact that she was okay with his sexuality but then doubted his attraction to her might indicate deeper issues. She mentions they have sex infrequently and she usually initiates, which could hint at underlying issues in the relationship before the disclosure. Maybe the coming out just became the catalyst for existing doubts.\n\nThe question is whether her reaction was justified. If the main issue was his bisexuality and past relationships, but she claims not to care about that, then maybe her real issue was something else. However, the fact that she couldn't reconcile this aspect of his identity could be a valid reason for her to end the relationship. On the other hand, lying about the reason shows a lack of honesty, which could be seen as wrong.\n\nBut in terms of being in the wrong, is it the author's fault? If the boyfriend was honest and the author felt the relationship wasn't right for her after this disclosure, then she's not in the wrong. People have different deal-breakers. However, if the real issue was her own insecurities or lack of attraction unrelated to his bisexuality, then maybe her reasoning is flawed. The fact that she couldn't get past the disclosure, even though she said it didn't matter, might indicate that she's projecting her own issues. But she's not in the wrong for breaking up because she's not obligated to stay in a relationship that makes her uncomfortable. However, the dishonesty about the reason might be a separate issue. So, the answer could be B (No), because she's not in the wrong for ending the relationship, even if her reasoning might be a bit conflicted.\n"
