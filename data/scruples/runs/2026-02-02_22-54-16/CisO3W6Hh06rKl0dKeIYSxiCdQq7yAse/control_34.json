Overall, he\u2019s a great person and I hope that we can stay friends, despite what happened. \n\nBasically, a few weeks ago, we were having drinks at his apartment. He said there was something he wanted to tell me and he hoped I wouldn\u2019t judge. I said okay (obviously nervous). He told me that he thinks he\u2019s bi. I asked what makes him think that and he finally admitted that he had hooked up with a few guys before me. \n\nNow, I just want to clarify that I don\u2019t care if a person is gay, bi, whatever. You only get one life and you should try to find happiness. But I have never (as far as I know) dated a guy who wasn\u2019t straight. So I was a little taken aback. \n\nThe rest of the night was somewhat awkward and we ended up just going to sleep. Over the next several days I started thinking of our relationship. We don\u2019t have sex that often for a young couple. Maybe once a week (always been that way). And when we do have sex I usually initiate. I\u2019m not bothered by the frequency  but I started questioning whether my boyfriend might just be gay and using me to cover that up. I started getting paranoid over whether he\u2019s even attracted to me (he compliments me on my appearance but I\u2019ve never felt...lust). \n\nAnyway I ended up breaking up with him. He said it was because he\u2019s bi and I denied that was the reason. I blamed the break up on some personal stuff I\u2019m going through and said I needed time alone. \n\nBut that was actually a lie. If he hadn\u2019t disclosed that stuff about his sexuality, I have no doubt we\u2019d still be together. I just couldn\u2019t get past it for some reason. \n\nAITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author broke up with her boyfriend after he told her he's bisexual. The boyfriend had hooked up with guys before, but the author had never dated a non-straight person. The main issue here is the author's reaction to his bisexuality and the subsequent breakup.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author claims she doesn't care about someone's sexuality, but she's never been with a non-straight person. She got uncomfortable when her boyfriend came out as bi. She then broke up with him, but denied that his bisexuality was the reason, instead blaming personal issues. The boyfriend said the breakup was because he's bi, and she lied about the reason.\n\nSo, the question is whether she's in the wrong. Let's think about the factors. Bisexuality is about attraction to both genders, and it's a valid sexual orientation. The boyfriend's actions (hooking up with guys before) are his past behavior, which the author might not have been aware of. The author's reaction could be seen as judgmental, even if she claims she doesn't care. By breaking up because of his bisexuality, even if she's being honest, she's choosing not to be in a relationship with someone because of something fundamental about him. However, she did lie about the reason, which adds another layer of dishonesty.\n\nBut the core issue is her comfort in the relationship. If she can't accept his bisexuality, even if she claims to support it, that could be a problem. The fact that she started questioning his attraction to her after his disclosure might indicate that his bisexuality made her insecure, leading to the breakup. The AITA community often considers whether the action was fair and if there was malicious intent. Here, the author's action (breaking up) is personal, but the lie about the reason could be seen as wrong. \n\nOn one hand, she has the right to end a relationship if she's unhappy. But if her main issue was his bisexuality, which he had the right to disclose, then she's in the wrong for not accepting that. The lie complicates things because it's not honest. However, the breakup itself might not be wrong if she felt incompatible, even if her reasoning is problematic. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often judges based on fairness and respect. The boyfriend was honest, and the author's reaction could be seen as unfair. However, the author isn't necessarily wrong if she felt the relationship wasn't working for her. The key is whether her action (breaking up) was justified. The lie about the reason adds to the problem, but the main question is if the breakup was her being in the wrong. \n\nSo, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because she broke up with him over his bisexuality, which is a personal choice and not a deal-breaker for others, but she admitted it was the main reason. However, if she felt the relationship wasn't working and this was a factor, maybe not. But since she didn't accept his sexuality and lied about the reason, the community might side with A.\n"
