Overall, he\u2019s a great person and I hope that we can stay friends, despite what happened. \n\nBasically, a few weeks ago, we were having drinks at his apartment. He said there was something he wanted to tell me and he hoped I wouldn\u2019t judge. I said okay (obviously nervous). He told me that he thinks he\u2019s bi. I asked what makes him think that and he finally admitted that he had hooked up with a few guys before me. \n\nNow, I just want to clarify that I don\u2019t care if a person is gay, bi, whatever. You only get one life and you should try to find happiness. But I have never (as far as I know) dated a guy who wasn\u2019t straight. So I was a little taken aback. \n\nThe rest of the night was somewhat awkward and we ended up just going to sleep. Over the next several days I started thinking of our relationship. We don\u2019t have sex that often for a young couple. Maybe once a week (always been that way). And when we do have sex I usually initiate. I\u2019m not bothered by the frequency  but I started questioning whether my boyfriend might just be gay and using me to cover that up. I started getting paranoid over whether he\u2019s even attracted to me (he compliments me on my appearance but I\u2019ve never felt...lust). \n\nAnyway I ended up breaking up with him. He said it was because he\u2019s bi and I denied that was the reason. I blamed the break up on some personal stuff I\u2019m going through and said I needed time alone. \n\nBut that was actually a lie. If he hadn\u2019t disclosed that stuff about his sexuality, I have no doubt we\u2019d still be together. I just couldn\u2019t get past it for some reason. \n\nAITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the person who broke up with their boyfriend because he's bisexual is in the wrong. The situation is presented as an \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) scenario.\n\nFirst, the key points: The woman broke up with her boyfriend after he came out as bisexual. He admitted he had hookups with guys before the relationship. She claims she doesn't care about his sexuality in general but had never dated someone not straight. She felt he was using her to hide his sexuality and wasn't attracted to her. She ended things but later admitted the bi aspect was the real reason, even though she lied about it.\n\nThe main issue here is whether it's fair to break up someone because they're bisexual. Bisexuality is a valid sexual orientation, and being attracted to more than one gender doesn't inherently affect the current relationship if both partners are on the same page. However, the woman felt uncomfortable because he had past relationships with men, which made her question his attraction to her and his potential being gay. \n\nNow, considering that she ended the relationship not because of any specific actions he took while in the relationship, but because of his sexuality and past behavior. Even though she says she doesn't have an issue with people being gay or bi, her actions suggest otherwise. She's in a monogamous relationship but didn't ask if he was open to non-monogamy or if his bisexuality affected their current arrangement. \n\nIs it wrong to end things because of someone's sexuality? That's a tricky area. If she wasn't comfortable with his bisexuality and it made her feel insecure or questioned his attraction, then she's not necessarily wrong to end the relationship. However, if she's breaking up based on his identity rather than any behavior that's harmful or a deal-breaker, it might be seen as invalid. \n\nAlso, she had the choice to ask questions and address her insecurities instead of breaking up. She might have been in denial about her real reason for ending things. But if she felt it wasn't working because of her feelings and not his actions, it's a personal choice. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because she's allowed to have personal boundaries and feelings. However, some might argue she should have communicated better or given more time. But given the context, she's not in the wrong for ending the relationship due to her own discomfort with his sexuality, even if she later lied about the reason.\n"
