Overall, he\u2019s a great person and I hope that we can stay friends, despite what happened. \n\nBasically, a few weeks ago, we were having drinks at his apartment. He said there was something he wanted to tell me and he hoped I wouldn\u2019t judge. I said okay (obviously nervous). He told me that he thinks he\u2019s bi. I asked what makes him think that and he finally admitted that he had hooked up with a few guys before me. \n\nNow, I just want to clarify that I don\u2019t care if a person is gay, bi, whatever. You only get one life and you should try to find happiness. But I have never (as far as I know) dated a guy who wasn\u2019t straight. So I was a little taken aback. \n\nThe rest of the night was somewhat awkward and we ended up just going to sleep. Over the next several days I started thinking of our relationship. We don\u2019t have sex that often for a young couple. Maybe once a week (always been that way). And when we do have sex I usually initiate. I\u2019m not bothered by the frequency  but I started questioning whether my boyfriend might just be gay and using me to cover that up. I started getting paranoid over whether he\u2019s even attracted to me (he compliments me on my appearance but I\u2019ve never felt...lust). \n\nAnyway I ended up breaking up with him. He said it was because he\u2019s bi and I denied that was the reason. I blamed the break up on some personal stuff I\u2019m going through and said I needed time alone. \n\nBut that was actually a lie. If he hadn\u2019t disclosed that stuff about his sexuality, I have no doubt we\u2019d still be together. I just couldn\u2019t get past it for some reason. \n\nAITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for breaking up with her boyfriend after he came out as bisexual. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend comes out as bisexual and mentions he's hooked up with guys before. The author says she doesn't care about his orientation but was taken aback. The relationship was already having issues\u2014low frequency of sex, her initiating most of the time. She starts getting paranoid he's using her to hide being gay, which leads her to break up, but she denies it's because of his bisexuality and blames personal issues instead.\n\nSo, the key points here are: 1) The boyfriend was honest about his sexuality. 2) The author lied about the reason for the breakup. 3) The relationship had existing issues in terms of intimacy and connection.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Let's think. When someone comes out, it's a personal revelation that requires trust and support. However, the author's issue isn't with his bisexuality per se, but perhaps with the fact that he had past relationships with men, leading to distrust and insecurity. She felt he wasn't attracted to her, given the low sex frequency and her initiating.\n\nBut here's the thing: if the author couldn't accept his past or his orientation, even if she says she doesn't care, then maybe the breakup was her way of dealing with her own discomfort. However, lying about the reason for the breakup could be seen as dishonest. On the other hand, if the relationship had existing problems, maybe his coming out was just the catalyst for her decision.\n\nBisexuality isn't a deal-breaker for everyone, but for the author, it seems to have triggered insecurities. The question is whether she's in the wrong for ending the relationship due to his bisexuality. Since the boyfriend was honest and the breakup was based on her own insecurities and possible unaddressed issues in the relationship, the author might not be in the wrong. However, lying about the reason could be seen as a red flag.\n\nBut in terms of being \"in the wrong,\" if her decision was based on her inability to accept his bisexuality, then maybe she is. However, since she was truthful in her feelings later (admitting the real reason), and the relationship had other issues, it's a bit of a gray area. The key is whether his bisexuality was a legitimate deal-breaker for her. If she couldn't move past it despite her initial acceptance, then she might be in the right to end it. But if she's using the bisexuality as an excuse for other issues, then maybe not. The situation is complex, but the answer likely leans towards her not being in the wrong.\n"
