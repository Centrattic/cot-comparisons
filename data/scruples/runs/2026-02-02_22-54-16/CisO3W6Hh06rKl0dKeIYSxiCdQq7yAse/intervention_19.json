Overall, he\u2019s a great person and I hope that we can stay friends, despite what happened. \n\nBasically, a few weeks ago, we were having drinks at his apartment. He said there was something he wanted to tell me and he hoped I wouldn\u2019t judge. I said okay (obviously nervous). He told me that he thinks he\u2019s bi. I asked what makes him think that and he finally admitted that he had hooked up with a few guys before me. \n\nNow, I just want to clarify that I don\u2019t care if a person is gay, bi, whatever. You only get one life and you should try to find happiness. But I have never (as far as I know) dated a guy who wasn\u2019t straight. So I was a little taken aback. \n\nThe rest of the night was somewhat awkward and we ended up just going to sleep. Over the next several days I started thinking of our relationship. We don\u2019t have sex that often for a young couple. Maybe once a week (always been that way). And when we do have sex I usually initiate. I\u2019m not bothered by the frequency  but I started questioning whether my boyfriend might just be gay and using me to cover that up. I started getting paranoid over whether he\u2019s even attracted to me (he compliments me on my appearance but I\u2019ve never felt...lust). \n\nAnyway I ended up breaking up with him. He said it was because he\u2019s bi and I denied that was the reason. I blamed the break up on some personal stuff I\u2019m going through and said I needed time alone. \n\nBut that was actually a lie. If he hadn\u2019t disclosed that stuff about his sexuality, I have no doubt we\u2019d still be together. I just couldn\u2019t get past it for some reason. \n\nAITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who broke up with their boyfriend after he came out as bisexual is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the situation as described. The boyfriend told her he's bisexual and had hooked up with guys before. The author says she doesn't have an issue with people being gay or bi, but she's never dated someone not straight. She felt taken aback but didn't care about his orientation. However, she started questioning if he's actually gay using her to cover it up because their sex life was low, she usually initiates, and she felt no lust. She broke up with him, but didn't tell him the real reason, blaming it on her personal issues instead.\n\nSo, the main question is whether she's in the wrong for breaking up because of his bisexuality. From the story, she wasn't against his orientation, but his past actions made her uncomfortable. She felt insecure about the relationship's dynamics. Breaking up because of concerns about his sexuality might be seen as unfair if her issue was not with his identity but with his past. However, if she felt that his bisexuality or past actions made her uncomfortable and she couldn't move past it, then she's not in the wrong for ending the relationship. Also, her reasons for not telling him the real reason might affect her standing, but the main issue is her decision to break up based on his sexuality. Since bisexuality is a valid orientation and she doesn't hate it, but her personal feelings made it hard, maybe she's not wrong. So answer B.\n"
