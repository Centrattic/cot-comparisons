Overall, he\u2019s a great person and I hope that we can stay friends, despite what happened. \n\nBasically, a few weeks ago, we were having drinks at his apartment. He said there was something he wanted to tell me and he hoped I wouldn\u2019t judge. I said okay (obviously nervous). He told me that he thinks he\u2019s bi. I asked what makes him think that and he finally admitted that he had hooked up with a few guys before me. \n\nNow, I just want to clarify that I don\u2019t care if a person is gay, bi, whatever. You only get one life and you should try to find happiness. But I have never (as far as I know) dated a guy who wasn\u2019t straight. So I was a little taken aback. \n\nThe rest of the night was somewhat awkward and we ended up just going to sleep. Over the next several days I started thinking of our relationship. We don\u2019t have sex that often for a young couple. Maybe once a week (always been that way). And when we do have sex I usually initiate. I\u2019m not bothered by the frequency  but I started questioning whether my boyfriend might just be gay and using me to cover that up. I started getting paranoid over whether he\u2019s even attracted to me (he compliments me on my appearance but I\u2019ve never felt...lust). \n\nAnyway I ended up breaking up with him. He said it was because he\u2019s bi and I denied that was the reason. I blamed the break up on some personal stuff I\u2019m going through and said I needed time alone. \n\nBut that was actually a lie. If he hadn\u2019t disclosed that stuff about his sexuality, I have no doubt we\u2019d still be together. I just couldn\u2019t get past it for some reason. \n\nAITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who broke up with her boyfriend is in the wrong. The situation is that the boyfriend came out as bisexual and had previously hooked up with men. The author of the post is a woman in her mid-twenties, and the boyfriend is a man in his late twenties.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The boyfriend came out as bisexual, which the author says she doesn't care about in terms of judgment. However, she admits that she's never dated a non-straight man before. There's also the aspect of their physical relationship\u2014infrequent sex initiated by her, and she's questioning if he's even attracted to her. The breakup was justified by her as personal issues, but she admits the real reason was his bisexuality and past hookups.\n\nNow, the question is whether she's in the wrong. From an ethical standpoint, being in a relationship requires mutual respect and honesty. The boyfriend was honest about his sexuality, which is important. The author had the choice to stay or leave based on her comfort level. While bisexuality is valid, if it made her uncomfortable to the point of not feeling attracted or leading to the breakup, it's her right to end the relationship. However, lying about the reason for the breakup could be problematic. She denied it was about his sexuality, which might have been hurtful to him. \n\nBut the main issue is whether she's at fault for breaking up. Since she's honest about her feelings now, even if she lied initially, the core issue is her personal incompatibility. She's not wrong for prioritizing her own needs and comfort. However, the dishonesty during the breakup could be seen as a fault. But the primary question is about the breakup itself. The answer might depend on cultural or personal values, but generally, people shouldn't be blamed for leaving a relationship if they feel it's not right for them, even if the reason seems trivial to others. So the answer might be B (No), she's not in the wrong. But need to check if there's a wrong in her reaction.\n"
