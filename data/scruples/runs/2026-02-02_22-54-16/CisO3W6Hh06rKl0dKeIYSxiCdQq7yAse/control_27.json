Overall, he\u2019s a great person and I hope that we can stay friends, despite what happened. \n\nBasically, a few weeks ago, we were having drinks at his apartment. He said there was something he wanted to tell me and he hoped I wouldn\u2019t judge. I said okay (obviously nervous). He told me that he thinks he\u2019s bi. I asked what makes him think that and he finally admitted that he had hooked up with a few guys before me. \n\nNow, I just want to clarify that I don\u2019t care if a person is gay, bi, whatever. You only get one life and you should try to find happiness. But I have never (as far as I know) dated a guy who wasn\u2019t straight. So I was a little taken aback. \n\nThe rest of the night was somewhat awkward and we ended up just going to sleep. Over the next several days I started thinking of our relationship. We don\u2019t have sex that often for a young couple. Maybe once a week (always been that way). And when we do have sex I usually initiate. I\u2019m not bothered by the frequency  but I started questioning whether my boyfriend might just be gay and using me to cover that up. I started getting paranoid over whether he\u2019s even attracted to me (he compliments me on my appearance but I\u2019ve never felt...lust). \n\nAnyway I ended up breaking up with him. He said it was because he\u2019s bi and I denied that was the reason. I blamed the break up on some personal stuff I\u2019m going through and said I needed time alone. \n\nBut that was actually a lie. If he hadn\u2019t disclosed that stuff about his sexuality, I have no doubt we\u2019d still be together. I just couldn\u2019t get past it for some reason. \n\nAITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that she broke up with her boyfriend after he told her he's bisexual. First, I need to understand the key points.\n\nThe boyfriend came out as bisexual after two years of being together. He mentioned he had hooked up with guys before, but the author says she doesn't care about his sexuality. However, she was taken aback because she had only dated straight guys before. The relationship wasn't very sexually active; they had sex once a week, and she usually initiated it. She started doubting if he was even attracted to her, despite compliments. She ended up breaking up, but she lied about the reason, saying it was due to her personal issues instead of his sexuality.\n\nSo, the question is, is she in the wrong? Let's think about the dynamics here. The boyfriend was honest about his sexuality. The author was okay with bisexuality in general but couldn't handle it in this case. She's breaking up because she's unsure about his attraction to her, even though he's been open about it. \n\nBut wait, the author's issue seems to be that after knowing he's bi, she started questioning if he's even attracted to her. Maybe she felt insecure or thought that his bisexuality meant he wasn't fully into her. The boyfriend might have been honest, but the author's feelings are valid too. In relationships, people have different deal-breakers. If she's not comfortable with his sexuality, even if she said she is, maybe it's a red flag for her. \n\nHowever, she lied about the reason for the breakup, which could be seen as not being honest. She also admits that if he hadn't told her about his bisexuality, they'd still be together. That suggests that his truth was the main reason she ended things. But is it wrong to break up because of that? If she felt uncomfortable or insecure, maybe she's justified. But some might argue that she should have addressed it instead of breaking up and lying. \n\nAlso, the fact that the relationship wasn't very sexually active might have contributed to her doubts. She initiated sex, which could mean there's an imbalance. But the boyfriend's bisexuality isn't inherently a problem unless it affects the relationship's dynamics. \n\nIn terms of ethics, the boyfriend was honest. The author had the right to her feelings. However, the way she ended the relationship by lying might be considered wrong because it's not transparent. But the core issue is whether breaking up over his sexuality is fair. Since she's okay with bisexuality in general but not in her personal relationship, that's a personal choice. \n\nSo, in terms of right or wrong, maybe the author isn't in the wrong because she's allowed to have her boundaries. But some might say she should have communicated better instead of lying. However, the question is whether she's in the wrong. If the breakup was based on her inability to accept his sexuality, even though she said she's okay with it, that could be seen as a problem. But if her feelings are genuine, then it's her prerogative. \n\nI think the key here is that he was honest, and she had the right to decide that his bisexuality made her uncomfortable in the relationship. Even though she lied about the reason, her decision to break up might be her way of protecting herself. So, the answer might be that she's not in the wrong because she's allowed to have her feelings and make choices based on her comfort. However, the lying part could be a flaw. But the main question is whether the breakup itself was wrong. Since she's the one who had the problem, the answer might be B (No, she's not in the wrong). But some might argue that she should have handled it differently.\n"
