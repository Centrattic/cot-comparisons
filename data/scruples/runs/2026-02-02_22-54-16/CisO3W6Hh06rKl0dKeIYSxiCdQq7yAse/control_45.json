Overall, he\u2019s a great person and I hope that we can stay friends, despite what happened. \n\nBasically, a few weeks ago, we were having drinks at his apartment. He said there was something he wanted to tell me and he hoped I wouldn\u2019t judge. I said okay (obviously nervous). He told me that he thinks he\u2019s bi. I asked what makes him think that and he finally admitted that he had hooked up with a few guys before me. \n\nNow, I just want to clarify that I don\u2019t care if a person is gay, bi, whatever. You only get one life and you should try to find happiness. But I have never (as far as I know) dated a guy who wasn\u2019t straight. So I was a little taken aback. \n\nThe rest of the night was somewhat awkward and we ended up just going to sleep. Over the next several days I started thinking of our relationship. We don\u2019t have sex that often for a young couple. Maybe once a week (always been that way). And when we do have sex I usually initiate. I\u2019m not bothered by the frequency  but I started questioning whether my boyfriend might just be gay and using me to cover that up. I started getting paranoid over whether he\u2019s even attracted to me (he compliments me on my appearance but I\u2019ve never felt...lust). \n\nAnyway I ended up breaking up with him. He said it was because he\u2019s bi and I denied that was the reason. I blamed the break up on some personal stuff I\u2019m going through and said I needed time alone. \n\nBut that was actually a lie. If he hadn\u2019t disclosed that stuff about his sexuality, I have no doubt we\u2019d still be together. I just couldn\u2019t get past it for some reason. \n\nAITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for breaking up with their boyfriend after he confessed to being bisexual. The situation is that they were in a two-year relationship, and during a conversation, the boyfriend reveals he's bisexual and had hooked up with guys before. The author doesn't care about his sexuality but was taken aback since all previous partners were straight. They mention that the sex was infrequent and usually initiated by them, leading to doubts about the boyfriend's attraction. The breakup was attributed to personal issues, but the author admits the real reason was his bisexuality.\n\nHmm, so the key points here are the author's feelings and the boyfriend's disclosure. The author feels the breakup was because of the boyfriend's bisexuality, even though they tried to cover it up. The boyfriend claims it was his bisexuality, but the author denies that. \n\nFirst, I need to consider if being bisexual is a valid reason for a breakup. Bisexuality is a sexual orientation, and the man's actions (hooking up before) might have been part of his exploration. The author says they don't judge but were uncomfortable because all their past partners were straight. That might indicate a personal issue with the boyfriend's bisexuality, even if it's not about prejudice.\n\nThen, there's the part about the relationship dynamics. They mention low frequency of sex and the author usually initiating. The author is questioning if the boyfriend is even attracted to them. So maybe the breakup was a mix of factors, but the main issue is the bisexuality. \n\nBut wait, the author admits that if the boyfriend hadn't disclosed, they'd still be together. That implies the breakup was directly because of the disclosure, not any actual infidelity or ongoing issues. The author is feeling guilty about lying about the reason for the breakup. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? It depends on whether the boyfriend's bisexuality is something the author should have been okay with. If the relationship was monogamous and the boyfriend wasn't cheating, then the author's reason for breaking up is their own personal discomfort. However, if the author had issues with bisexuality from the start, maybe they were in denial until the confession. \n\nAlso, the author's own insecurities about the relationship's sexual aspects might have been a bigger issue. They might have used the bisexuality as a catalyst for underlying problems. But they explicitly say that the confession was the main reason. \n\nIn terms of fairness, the boyfriend was honest, and the author had the choice to stay or leave. The author isn't in the wrong for not being compatible, but maybe they are for not being honest about their true reason for the breakup. The boyfriend was upfront, and the author's reaction could be seen as shallow if the main issue was his sexuality without any breach of trust. \n\nSo, the answer would be that the author isn't in the wrong because it's their personal choice based on their comfort, but there's a nuance. However, according to AITA principles, people are often not in the wrong if they break up for personal reasons, especially if there's no deceit from the other person. The boyfriend was honest, so the author's choice, while perhaps based on their own biases, is their prerogative. Therefore, the answer is B (No).\n"
