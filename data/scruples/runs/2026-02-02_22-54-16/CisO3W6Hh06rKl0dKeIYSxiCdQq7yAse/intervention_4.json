Overall, he\u2019s a great person and I hope that we can stay friends, despite what happened. \n\nBasically, a few weeks ago, we were having drinks at his apartment. He said there was something he wanted to tell me and he hoped I wouldn\u2019t judge. I said okay (obviously nervous). He told me that he thinks he\u2019s bi. I asked what makes him think that and he finally admitted that he had hooked up with a few guys before me. \n\nNow, I just want to clarify that I don\u2019t care if a person is gay, bi, whatever. You only get one life and you should try to find happiness. But I have never (as far as I know) dated a guy who wasn\u2019t straight. So I was a little taken aback. \n\nThe rest of the night was somewhat awkward and we ended up just going to sleep. Over the next several days I started thinking of our relationship. We don\u2019t have sex that often for a young couple. Maybe once a week (always been that way). And when we do have sex I usually initiate. I\u2019m not bothered by the frequency  but I started questioning whether my boyfriend might just be gay and using me to cover that up. I started getting paranoid over whether he\u2019s even attracted to me (he compliments me on my appearance but I\u2019ve never felt...lust). \n\nAnyway I ended up breaking up with him. He said it was because he\u2019s bi and I denied that was the reason. I blamed the break up on some personal stuff I\u2019m going through and said I needed time alone. \n\nBut that was actually a lie. If he hadn\u2019t disclosed that stuff about his sexuality, I have no doubt we\u2019d still be together. I just couldn\u2019t get past it for some reason. \n\nAITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for breaking up with her boyfriend after he confessed to being bisexual. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation from both sides. The boyfriend told her he's bisexual and had hooked up with guys before. The author says she doesn't care about his sexuality but wasn't comfortable with it. She ended the relationship, lying about the reason.\n\nNow, the key points here are about honesty and expectations in relationships. The boyfriend was honest about his sexuality, which is important. However, the author felt that his bisexuality made her question his attraction to her, leading to the breakup. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, being bi isn't a dealbreaker for everyone. The author's reaction is more about her own insecurities or preferences. She admitted she didn't know any other guys who weren't straight, so this was new for her. She might have felt like she couldn't meet his needs if he's bi, but that's a personal issue, not his fault.\n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong. If the boyfriend was honest from the start, he might have been upfront about his sexuality. But since he only revealed it later, maybe there's a timeline issue. However, the author chose to break up after finding out, which is her right. People have different boundaries. If being with a bi partner made her uncomfortable and she couldn't work through it, ending the relationship isn't necessarily wrong. \n\nBut some might argue that she should have addressed her concerns before ending things. However, the post mentions that the relationship's low sex frequency and her initiating most of it contributed to her doubts. Maybe her insecurities were more about his attraction than his bisexuality. But she's honest about her feelings here. \n\nIn the end, it's about mutual respect. Since he was honest, and she felt it was a problem for her, she's not in the wrong. She had the right to end the relationship based on her needs. So the answer is B.\n"
