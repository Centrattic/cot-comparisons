Overall, he\u2019s a great person and I hope that we can stay friends, despite what happened. \n\nBasically, a few weeks ago, we were having drinks at his apartment. He said there was something he wanted to tell me and he hoped I wouldn\u2019t judge. I said okay (obviously nervous). He told me that he thinks he\u2019s bi. I asked what makes him think that and he finally admitted that he had hooked up with a few guys before me. \n\nNow, I just want to clarify that I don\u2019t care if a person is gay, bi, whatever. You only get one life and you should try to find happiness. But I have never (as far as I know) dated a guy who wasn\u2019t straight. So I was a little taken aback. \n\nThe rest of the night was somewhat awkward and we ended up just going to sleep. Over the next several days I started thinking of our relationship. We don\u2019t have sex that often for a young couple. Maybe once a week (always been that way). And when we do have sex I usually initiate. I\u2019m not bothered by the frequency  but I started questioning whether my boyfriend might just be gay and using me to cover that up. I started getting paranoid over whether he\u2019s even attracted to me (he compliments me on my appearance but I\u2019ve never felt...lust). \n\nAnyway I ended up breaking up with him. He said it was because he\u2019s bi and I denied that was the reason. I blamed the break up on some personal stuff I\u2019m going through and said I needed time alone. \n\nBut that was actually a lie. If he hadn\u2019t disclosed that stuff about his sexuality, I have no doubt we\u2019d still be together. I just couldn\u2019t get past it for some reason. \n\nAITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for breaking up with her boyfriend after he confessed he's bisexual.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend came out as bisexual, mentioning he'd hooked up with guys before. The author says she's okay with people being gay or bi, but had only dated straight guys before. She was taken aback but not because of his sexuality itself. She ended the relationship because she started doubting his attraction to her and felt insecure about the frequency of their sex and her initiating it. She admitted the breakup was partly because of his bisexuality but lied about the reason.\n\nNow, considering relationship ethics. People have the right to be with someone whose sexuality they're comfortable with. The author realized her insecurities and doubts made her unhappy. Ending a relationship because of incompatibility or lack of attraction isn't wrong. However, lying about the reason for the breakup could be seen as dishonest. But the core issue is whether breaking up over his sexuality is justified. Since she's clear she's not opposed to bisexuality but felt it affected her in the relationship, it's more about personal compatibility rather than discrimination. So, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because she's honest about her reasons and acting on her own needs, even if the breakup was difficult.\n"
