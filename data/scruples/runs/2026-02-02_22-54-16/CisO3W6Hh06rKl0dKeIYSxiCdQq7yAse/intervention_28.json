Overall, he\u2019s a great person and I hope that we can stay friends, despite what happened. \n\nBasically, a few weeks ago, we were having drinks at his apartment. He said there was something he wanted to tell me and he hoped I wouldn\u2019t judge. I said okay (obviously nervous). He told me that he thinks he\u2019s bi. I asked what makes him think that and he finally admitted that he had hooked up with a few guys before me. \n\nNow, I just want to clarify that I don\u2019t care if a person is gay, bi, whatever. You only get one life and you should try to find happiness. But I have never (as far as I know) dated a guy who wasn\u2019t straight. So I was a little taken aback. \n\nThe rest of the night was somewhat awkward and we ended up just going to sleep. Over the next several days I started thinking of our relationship. We don\u2019t have sex that often for a young couple. Maybe once a week (always been that way). And when we do have sex I usually initiate. I\u2019m not bothered by the frequency  but I started questioning whether my boyfriend might just be gay and using me to cover that up. I started getting paranoid over whether he\u2019s even attracted to me (he compliments me on my appearance but I\u2019ve never felt...lust). \n\nAnyway I ended up breaking up with him. He said it was because he\u2019s bi and I denied that was the reason. I blamed the break up on some personal stuff I\u2019m going through and said I needed time alone. \n\nBut that was actually a lie. If he hadn\u2019t disclosed that stuff about his sexuality, I have no doubt we\u2019d still be together. I just couldn\u2019t get past it for some reason. \n\nAITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author broke up with her boyfriend after he told her he's bisexual and had hooked up with guys before. The key points here are about honesty, personal boundaries, and what's acceptable in a relationship.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend was honest with her. He told her he's bisexual and admitted to past hookups. That's important because transparency is a big part of relationships. The author wasn't okay with that. She says she doesn't care about someone's orientation, but since she's only dated straight guys, this was new for her. She felt taken aback and then started questioning whether he was using her to \"cover up\" being gay, even though he was open about being bi.\n\nNow, the author broke up with him but lied about the reason. She told him it was due to her personal issues, but the real reason was his bisexuality. The question is if she's in the wrong for doing that.\n\nOn one hand, people have the right to their own boundaries. If being in a relationship with a bisexual partner is something the author can't accept, then she's not in the wrong for ending it. However, she lied about the reason. Honesty in a breakup is usually considered important. By not being truthful, she might have hurt him more than necessary. \n\nBut wait, the premise is about whether she's in the wrong. If her decision was based on her personal discomfort with his bisexuality, even though he was honest, then it's her choice. However, she didn't address the issue directly. Instead of having an open conversation about her feelings, she just ended it and lied. That could be seen as unfair. \n\nBut again, people have different deal-breakers. If she can't accept a partner's bisexuality, even if he's honest and upfront, she's not obligated to stay in the relationship. The problem is the lie. She didn't confront her feelings or communicate them, which is a red flag. However, the question is whether she's in the wrong. \n\nIn relationships, it's important to be honest with each other. If she couldn't accept his bisexuality, it's her choice to end it, but lying about the reason complicates things. However, the fact remains that his bisexuality was a deal-breaker for her. So, while the lie is bad, her decision to leave might be her right. \n\nBut some might argue that she's in the wrong because she didn't confront her own issues and instead let them affect the relationship without communication. However, the core issue is her personal incompatibility with his bisexuality. If that's a valid reason for her, then she's not wrong for ending it, even if it's not a common deal-breaker. The lie is a separate issue, but the main question is about the breakup's validity. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No), because her choice to end the relationship is her prerogative if his bisexuality is a deal-breaker for her, even though the lie is problematic. The question is specifically about being in the wrong for the breakup, not the lie. The lie is a flaw, but the breakup itself isn't necessarily wrong.\n"
