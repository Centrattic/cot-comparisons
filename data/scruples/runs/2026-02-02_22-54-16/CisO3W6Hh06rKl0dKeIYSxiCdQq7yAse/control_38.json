Overall, he\u2019s a great person and I hope that we can stay friends, despite what happened. \n\nBasically, a few weeks ago, we were having drinks at his apartment. He said there was something he wanted to tell me and he hoped I wouldn\u2019t judge. I said okay (obviously nervous). He told me that he thinks he\u2019s bi. I asked what makes him think that and he finally admitted that he had hooked up with a few guys before me. \n\nNow, I just want to clarify that I don\u2019t care if a person is gay, bi, whatever. You only get one life and you should try to find happiness. But I have never (as far as I know) dated a guy who wasn\u2019t straight. So I was a little taken aback. \n\nThe rest of the night was somewhat awkward and we ended up just going to sleep. Over the next several days I started thinking of our relationship. We don\u2019t have sex that often for a young couple. Maybe once a week (always been that way). And when we do have sex I usually initiate. I\u2019m not bothered by the frequency  but I started questioning whether my boyfriend might just be gay and using me to cover that up. I started getting paranoid over whether he\u2019s even attracted to me (he compliments me on my appearance but I\u2019ve never felt...lust). \n\nAnyway I ended up breaking up with him. He said it was because he\u2019s bi and I denied that was the reason. I blamed the break up on some personal stuff I\u2019m going through and said I needed time alone. \n\nBut that was actually a lie. If he hadn\u2019t disclosed that stuff about his sexuality, I have no doubt we\u2019d still be together. I just couldn\u2019t get past it for some reason. \n\nAITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author broke up with her boyfriend after he confessed to being bisexual and having hooked up with guys before. She clarifies she doesn't have an issue with bisexuality in general but felt uncomfortable because she's only dated straight guys and started questioning his attraction to her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The boyfriend was honest about his bisexuality. The author states she's okay with being bisexual but feels something changed after the confession. She mentions the frequency of their sex and that she usually initiates, which might indicate underlying issues in the relationship even before the disclosure. However, she admits the breakup was primarily because of his bisexuality, which she lied about to avoid admitting her own feelings.\n\nNow, the key points here: Is the author wrong to break up because of his bisexuality? It depends on whether her reasons were valid. She claims she's not opposed to bisexuality but felt she couldn't get past it. If the relationship was already having issues (like low intimacy), maybe the bisexuality was a trigger for existing problems. However, the main conflict here is her inability to accept his sexuality, even though she claims it's not the issue. Also, she kept the real reason hidden, which might show she's not being honest with herself and him.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, it's about whether the person's actions were unreasonable. Since she broke up because of his identity, which is a personal choice. There's no right or wrong in personal preferences in relationships. However, if she was okay with bisexuality in theory but not in practice, maybe she's being inconsistent. Also, the fact that she lied about the reason might add to the problem. The boyfriend might feel unfairly treated if he was honest but she didn't accept it.\n\nOn the other hand, relationships require mutual compatibility. If she felt uncomfortable with his orientation, even after thinking about it, it's her right to end it. There's no obligation to stay in a relationship if one party has unresolved issues. So, maybe she's not in the wrong. The question is whether the reason for the breakup is justified. If she couldn't accept his sexuality, even if she says it's not the issue, but it's the real reason, then she might be in the right to prioritize her own needs. But she might also be missing other factors like the existing issues in the relationship.\n\nHmm. Need to weigh if bisexuality is a valid reason to break up. The answer might be B (No), because each person has their own deal-breakers. Even if the author's reasoning is complex, it's her right to end the relationship if she can't accept certain aspects. However, if the break up was based on a misunderstanding or fear, maybe A. But according to AITA standards, people aren't in the wrong for having personal limits in relationships. So probably B.\n"
