Overall, he\u2019s a great person and I hope that we can stay friends, despite what happened. \n\nBasically, a few weeks ago, we were having drinks at his apartment. He said there was something he wanted to tell me and he hoped I wouldn\u2019t judge. I said okay (obviously nervous). He told me that he thinks he\u2019s bi. I asked what makes him think that and he finally admitted that he had hooked up with a few guys before me. \n\nNow, I just want to clarify that I don\u2019t care if a person is gay, bi, whatever. You only get one life and you should try to find happiness. But I have never (as far as I know) dated a guy who wasn\u2019t straight. So I was a little taken aback. \n\nThe rest of the night was somewhat awkward and we ended up just going to sleep. Over the next several days I started thinking of our relationship. We don\u2019t have sex that often for a young couple. Maybe once a week (always been that way). And when we do have sex I usually initiate. I\u2019m not bothered by the frequency  but I started questioning whether my boyfriend might just be gay and using me to cover that up. I started getting paranoid over whether he\u2019s even attracted to me (he compliments me on my appearance but I\u2019ve never felt...lust). \n\nAnyway I ended up breaking up with him. He said it was because he\u2019s bi and I denied that was the reason. I blamed the break up on some personal stuff I\u2019m going through and said I needed time alone. \n\nBut that was actually a lie. If he hadn\u2019t disclosed that stuff about his sexuality, I have no doubt we\u2019d still be together. I just couldn\u2019t get past it for some reason. \n\nAITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who broke up with their boyfriend because he's bisexual is in the wrong. So, the situation is that the boyfriend came out as bisexual and admitted to hooking up with guys before. The author breaks up but later admits that the real reason was his bisexuality, even though she tried to blame it on her personal issues.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of the relationship. The author says they were together for two years and the boyfriend was a great person. She doesn't have an issue with his sexuality in general, but being a woman who hasn't dated non-straight men before, she's taken aback. Then, after the confession, she starts questioning his attraction to her due to the low sex frequency and her initiating it. This leads her to paranoia and eventually the breakup.\n\nNow, the key points here are about honesty, communication, and mutual compatibility. The boyfriend was honest about his sexuality, which is important in a relationship. The author, however, couldn't accept that and ended the relationship. The question is whether she's in the wrong for breaking up because of his bisexuality.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, people have the right to leave relationships if they feel incompatible. However, the way she handled it might be an issue. She blamed it on her personal stuff but later admits it's because of his bisexuality. That could be seen as dishonest. Also, the fact that she was okay with his bisexuality in theory but not in practice might indicate some internal conflict or prejudice, even if unintentional.\n\nBut then, relationships are about both partners' comfort. If one partner's identity or behavior makes the other uncomfortable, it's fair to part ways. The problem here is whether the breakup was justified because of his bisexuality itself or her insecurities. The author's reasoning seems more about her own discomfort rather than any wrongdoing by her boyfriend. He was honest, and she broke up because she couldn't accept that. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the boyfriend did the right thing by being upfront. The author had the choice to either work through her feelings or leave. Since she chose to leave, it's a personal decision. However, if her issue was not with his bisexuality but with other factors (like lack of attraction or compatibility in intimacy), that's different. But the user is asking if she's in the wrong for breaking up specifically because of his bisexuality. \n\nIn many perspectives, being bisexual isn't a deal-breaker unless it's incompatible with the relationship structure agreed upon. Since she didn't mention any specific issues like cheating or him being in a polyamorous relationship, it seems her problem was just his identity. That could be seen as discriminatory. So she might be in the wrong for ending the relationship over his sexuality, especially since she claims to accept others.\n\nBut others might argue that people have the right to leave if they can't be comfortable. The answer might depend on cultural or personal views on bisexuality. Some might say she's not in the wrong because relationships are about both people being happy, and if she can't accept his identity, it's valid to leave. Others might say she's in the wrong for not working through her insecurities.\n\nLooking at the AITA context, often the answer is A (yes, guilty) if the person's actions were based on prejudice or not justified. Here, the author's main issue was the boyfriend's bisexuality, not any actions that harmed the relationship. So she might be considered in the wrong for breaking up over his identity, which is a personal choice and not a wrong action on his part.\n"
