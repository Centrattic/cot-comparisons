Overall, he\u2019s a great person and I hope that we can stay friends, despite what happened. \n\nBasically, a few weeks ago, we were having drinks at his apartment. He said there was something he wanted to tell me and he hoped I wouldn\u2019t judge. I said okay (obviously nervous). He told me that he thinks he\u2019s bi. I asked what makes him think that and he finally admitted that he had hooked up with a few guys before me. \n\nNow, I just want to clarify that I don\u2019t care if a person is gay, bi, whatever. You only get one life and you should try to find happiness. But I have never (as far as I know) dated a guy who wasn\u2019t straight. So I was a little taken aback. \n\nThe rest of the night was somewhat awkward and we ended up just going to sleep. Over the next several days I started thinking of our relationship. We don\u2019t have sex that often for a young couple. Maybe once a week (always been that way). And when we do have sex I usually initiate. I\u2019m not bothered by the frequency  but I started questioning whether my boyfriend might just be gay and using me to cover that up. I started getting paranoid over whether he\u2019s even attracted to me (he compliments me on my appearance but I\u2019ve never felt...lust). \n\nAnyway I ended up breaking up with him. He said it was because he\u2019s bi and I denied that was the reason. I blamed the break up on some personal stuff I\u2019m going through and said I needed time alone. \n\nBut that was actually a lie. If he hadn\u2019t disclosed that stuff about his sexuality, I have no doubt we\u2019d still be together. I just couldn\u2019t get past it for some reason. \n\nAITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author broke up with her boyfriend after he told her he's bisexual. The boyfriend had hooked up with guys before, but the author was okay with people being gay or bi. She mentions she's never dated a non-straight guy before, so she was taken aback.\n\nNow, the author says she doesn't care about someone's sexuality but that the breakup was because she couldn't get past his bisexuality. She broke up with him, but she admitted it was her decision and lied about the reason. The key points here are: the boyfriend came out as bi, the author broke up because of that, and she's questioning if she was wrong.\n\nFirst, relationships are about mutual respect and compatibility. If the author couldn't accept his bisexuality despite saying she doesn't care, that might be an issue. However, it's also important to consider why she felt that way. Maybe she had underlying insecurities or the situation made her realize they weren't compatible. Also, the couple had issues with intimacy, like infrequent sex and the author initiating. Maybe the bisexuality was a catalyst for her to realize there were deeper issues.\n\nBut the main question is whether she's in the wrong. If she broke up because of his sexuality alone, that could be problematic, especially if she's against bisexuality in a partner. However, she's not against it in general but in her relationship. Maybe she felt uncomfortable or insecure, which is common. People can have valid reasons for ending a relationship, even if it's not the partner's fault. The fact that she admitted the truth later shows she's honest about her feelings.\n\nIn terms of fairness, if the boyfriend was honest and the author found out something that made her question their relationship, she's not necessarily wrong for ending it. People have different deal-breakers. However, if the issue was purely his bisexuality and not his actions (like cheating), then it might be about acceptance. But the author didn't say he was cheating; she was just uncomfortable with his past. So maybe she's not in the wrong because the breakup was based on her own comfort and realization about the relationship's incompatibility.\n"
