Overall, he\u2019s a great person and I hope that we can stay friends, despite what happened. \n\nBasically, a few weeks ago, we were having drinks at his apartment. He said there was something he wanted to tell me and he hoped I wouldn\u2019t judge. I said okay (obviously nervous). He told me that he thinks he\u2019s bi. I asked what makes him think that and he finally admitted that he had hooked up with a few guys before me. \n\nNow, I just want to clarify that I don\u2019t care if a person is gay, bi, whatever. You only get one life and you should try to find happiness. But I have never (as far as I know) dated a guy who wasn\u2019t straight. So I was a little taken aback. \n\nThe rest of the night was somewhat awkward and we ended up just going to sleep. Over the next several days I started thinking of our relationship. We don\u2019t have sex that often for a young couple. Maybe once a week (always been that way). And when we do have sex I usually initiate. I\u2019m not bothered by the frequency  but I started questioning whether my boyfriend might just be gay and using me to cover that up. I started getting paranoid over whether he\u2019s even attracted to me (he compliments me on my appearance but I\u2019ve never felt...lust). \n\nAnyway I ended up breaking up with him. He said it was because he\u2019s bi and I denied that was the reason. I blamed the break up on some personal stuff I\u2019m going through and said I needed time alone. \n\nBut that was actually a lie. If he hadn\u2019t disclosed that stuff about his sexuality, I have no doubt we\u2019d still be together. I just couldn\u2019t get past it for some reason. \n\nAITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the person who broke up with their boyfriend after he came out as bisexual is in the wrong. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThe boyfriend revealed he's bisexual and had hooked up with guys before. The author says they don't care about someone's sexual orientation but were taken aback because they've only dated straight guys. The relationship had low sexual frequency, with the author often initiating. They started doubting his attraction to them and eventually broke up, lying about the reason.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the core issue: the breakup after the boyfriend's coming out. The author admits they broke up because of his bisexuality, even though they claim to not have a problem with it. That seems contradictory. People have different comfort levels, but acting on a bias even if they claim to not care could be a problem.\n\nHowever, the author also mentions their own insecurities about the relationship's sexual dynamics. The low frequency and lack of lust might have contributed. Maybe the bisexual revelation triggered these doubts. But the key point is that the author's decision to end the relationship was based on their own discomfort with his bisexuality, even if they say they don't judge. \n\nIs it wrong to prioritize one's own feelings? If the author couldn't be in a relationship with a bisexual partner, even if they don't judge others, then their choice is valid. However, breaking up and lying about the reason might not be fair to the ex-boyfriend. The author's reasoning might be based on an underlying bias, even if unintentional.\n\nThe ex-boyfriend had a right to his sexuality, and the author's inability to accept that could be a point against them. But the author is honest about their own feelings. The question is whether it's wrong to end a relationship because of a partner's sexuality when they claim not to have an issue with it. \n\nIn many discussions, the stance is that it's wrong to end a relationship because of a partner's bisexuality, as it's a form of discrimination. However, if the author honestly couldn't move past it despite their stated acceptance, it's a personal choice. The lie about the reason for the breakup complicates things. It might have been more respectful to be honest, even if the reason was uncomfortable.\n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the author's actions were a form of bias or a genuine personal incompatibility. If the author truly doesn't care about others' sexuality but just felt uncomfortable because of their own experiences, it's a personal choice. However, if the underlying issue is a hidden bias against bisexuality, then it's more problematic. Given the information, the author admitted to lying and that the bisexual revelation was the key factor. This suggests that their decision was based on an unacknowledged bias, making them at least partially in the wrong.\n"
