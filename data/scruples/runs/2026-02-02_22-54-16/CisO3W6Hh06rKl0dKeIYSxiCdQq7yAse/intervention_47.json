Overall, he\u2019s a great person and I hope that we can stay friends, despite what happened. \n\nBasically, a few weeks ago, we were having drinks at his apartment. He said there was something he wanted to tell me and he hoped I wouldn\u2019t judge. I said okay (obviously nervous). He told me that he thinks he\u2019s bi. I asked what makes him think that and he finally admitted that he had hooked up with a few guys before me. \n\nNow, I just want to clarify that I don\u2019t care if a person is gay, bi, whatever. You only get one life and you should try to find happiness. But I have never (as far as I know) dated a guy who wasn\u2019t straight. So I was a little taken aback. \n\nThe rest of the night was somewhat awkward and we ended up just going to sleep. Over the next several days I started thinking of our relationship. We don\u2019t have sex that often for a young couple. Maybe once a week (always been that way). And when we do have sex I usually initiate. I\u2019m not bothered by the frequency  but I started questioning whether my boyfriend might just be gay and using me to cover that up. I started getting paranoid over whether he\u2019s even attracted to me (he compliments me on my appearance but I\u2019ve never felt...lust). \n\nAnyway I ended up breaking up with him. He said it was because he\u2019s bi and I denied that was the reason. I blamed the break up on some personal stuff I\u2019m going through and said I needed time alone. \n\nBut that was actually a lie. If he hadn\u2019t disclosed that stuff about his sexuality, I have no doubt we\u2019d still be together. I just couldn\u2019t get past it for some reason. \n\nAITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's dive into this situation. The user is asking whether the person who broke up with their boyfriend after he confessed to being bisexual is in the wrong. The story is that they were in a two-year relationship, and the boyfriend came out as bi, admitting he had hooked up with guys before. The author says they don't have an issue with people's sexuality but were unsettled because they had never been with a non-straight partner before. They ended up breaking up, but then lied about the reason, blaming it on personal issues instead of his bisexuality.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The boyfriend coming out as bisexual is a significant personal revelation. The author's initial reaction was surprise, which is understandable given their inexperience with non-straight partners. However, the key point is whether the author overreacted. The boyfriend didn't violate any trust by being bisexual per se; he was honest and came clean. The author's decision to break up wasn't because of infidelity but because of discomfort with the partner's sexuality. \n\nIn relationships, compatibility is crucial. If one partner is uncomfortable with the other's orientation, even if it's not a moral issue, it can create emotional distance. The author mentions feeling the relationship lacked sexual chemistry, with the boyfriend initiating sex less often. This might have contributed to their doubts, but the core issue here is the inability to accept the partner's bisexuality, even if it's not a moral stance. \n\nIs it wrong to break up because of this? Well, in terms of right and wrong, it's more about personal values. The author isn't being malicious; they're struggling with personal boundaries. However, they did lie about the reason for the breakup, which could be seen as inconsiderate. But the main question is whether the breakup itself is wrong. \n\nIn many cases, people break up for various reasons, including not feeling emotionally or physically connected. The author's decision might be seen as valid if they can't accept their partner's orientation, even if it's not a common reason. But some might argue that being judgmental about someone's sexuality, even if not expressed as hatred, is problematic. \n\nHowever, the boyfriend was honest. There's no deceit here. The author's issue is about their own comfort and compatibility. So while the breakup might be seen as a personal choice, the question is whether it's \"wrong.\" Since the user is asking from a moral standpoint, and considering that the author isn't attacking the partner's sexuality but is making a personal decision based on their own feelings, it's not inherently wrong. The lie about the reason might be a separate issue, but the breakup itself is their choice. \n\nTherefore, the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong because the decision is based on personal incompatibility and comfort, even if it's a difficult one.\n"
