Overall, he\u2019s a great person and I hope that we can stay friends, despite what happened. \n\nBasically, a few weeks ago, we were having drinks at his apartment. He said there was something he wanted to tell me and he hoped I wouldn\u2019t judge. I said okay (obviously nervous). He told me that he thinks he\u2019s bi. I asked what makes him think that and he finally admitted that he had hooked up with a few guys before me. \n\nNow, I just want to clarify that I don\u2019t care if a person is gay, bi, whatever. You only get one life and you should try to find happiness. But I have never (as far as I know) dated a guy who wasn\u2019t straight. So I was a little taken aback. \n\nThe rest of the night was somewhat awkward and we ended up just going to sleep. Over the next several days I started thinking of our relationship. We don\u2019t have sex that often for a young couple. Maybe once a week (always been that way). And when we do have sex I usually initiate. I\u2019m not bothered by the frequency  but I started questioning whether my boyfriend might just be gay and using me to cover that up. I started getting paranoid over whether he\u2019s even attracted to me (he compliments me on my appearance but I\u2019ve never felt...lust). \n\nAnyway I ended up breaking up with him. He said it was because he\u2019s bi and I denied that was the reason. I blamed the break up on some personal stuff I\u2019m going through and said I needed time alone. \n\nBut that was actually a lie. If he hadn\u2019t disclosed that stuff about his sexuality, I have no doubt we\u2019d still be together. I just couldn\u2019t get past it for some reason. \n\nAITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who broke up with their boyfriend after he came out as bisexual is in the wrong. The scenario is from the \"Am I the Asshole\" (AITA) subreddit, so the user is seeking validation or criticism of their actions.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend came out as bisexual and admitted to having hooked up with other guys before the relationship. The author is 24, male, and the ex is 26, female. They were together for two years. The author says they don't care about the boyfriend's sexuality but were taken aback because they'd never dated someone not straight. The main issues mentioned are the low frequency of sex (once a week) and the author initiating it. The author starts doubting if the boyfriend is even attracted to them, leading to paranoia and ultimately the breakup. The author lied about the reason for breaking up, blaming personal issues instead of the boyfriend's bisexuality.\n\nThe key points to consider: The breakup was based on the boyfriend's sexuality, even though the author claims not to be homophobic. The fact that they broke up after he came out, even though the author had no prior issues with his sexuality, might suggest that the real issue was discomfort with bisexuality. Also, the author's decision to mislead the boyfriend about the reason for the breakup could be seen as dishonest. However, the author is honest about their own feelings in the AITA post, which shows some level of self-awareness.\n\nIn relationships, honesty and compatibility are important. If the author couldn't accept the boyfriend's sexuality, even if they claimed not to care, it's a valid reason for breaking up. On the other hand, the decision to lie about the reason for the breakup and the initial surprise at the boyfriend's bisexuality might indicate some internal conflict or hypocrisy. However, it's also possible that the author needed time to process their feelings and didn't want to confront the boyfriend with their doubts. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit nuanced. The author isn't in the wrong for choosing to end the relationship if they felt that the boyfriend's bisexuality was affecting their own comfort. However, the dishonesty in the breakup might be seen as a flaw. But in AITA contexts, the focus is often on whether the action was justified. Since the author followed through with the breakup for personal reasons and didn't force the issue beyond the initial confession, they might be in the right. The main issue is whether the breakup was based on valid reasons, which it seems it was, even if the author struggled with their feelings.\n"
