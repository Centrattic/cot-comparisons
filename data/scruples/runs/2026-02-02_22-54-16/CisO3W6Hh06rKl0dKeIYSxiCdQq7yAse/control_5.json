Overall, he\u2019s a great person and I hope that we can stay friends, despite what happened. \n\nBasically, a few weeks ago, we were having drinks at his apartment. He said there was something he wanted to tell me and he hoped I wouldn\u2019t judge. I said okay (obviously nervous). He told me that he thinks he\u2019s bi. I asked what makes him think that and he finally admitted that he had hooked up with a few guys before me. \n\nNow, I just want to clarify that I don\u2019t care if a person is gay, bi, whatever. You only get one life and you should try to find happiness. But I have never (as far as I know) dated a guy who wasn\u2019t straight. So I was a little taken aback. \n\nThe rest of the night was somewhat awkward and we ended up just going to sleep. Over the next several days I started thinking of our relationship. We don\u2019t have sex that often for a young couple. Maybe once a week (always been that way). And when we do have sex I usually initiate. I\u2019m not bothered by the frequency  but I started questioning whether my boyfriend might just be gay and using me to cover that up. I started getting paranoid over whether he\u2019s even attracted to me (he compliments me on my appearance but I\u2019ve never felt...lust). \n\nAnyway I ended up breaking up with him. He said it was because he\u2019s bi and I denied that was the reason. I blamed the break up on some personal stuff I\u2019m going through and said I needed time alone. \n\nBut that was actually a lie. If he hadn\u2019t disclosed that stuff about his sexuality, I have no doubt we\u2019d still be together. I just couldn\u2019t get past it for some reason. \n\nAITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who broke up with their boyfriend because he's bisexual is in the wrong. Let's start by understanding the situation. The user is a 24-year-old woman in a two-year relationship with a 26-year-old man. The boyfriend told her he's bisexual and had hooked up with guys before. She didn't care about his sexuality but had never dated a non-straight guy before. After the confession, she started questioning if he was using her to hide being gay, got paranoid about his attraction, and broke up with him, lying about the reason.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The boyfriend came out as bisexual and disclosed past relationships with men. The user's issue seems to stem from uncertainty and lack of experience with non-straight partners. She mentions they have a low sex frequency and she usually initiates. She then blames the breakup on personal issues but admits his bisexuality was the real reason.\n\nNow, is she in the wrong? Well, everyone has the right to their feelings in a relationship. If she felt uncomfortable or couldn't move past his bisexuality, even if it's not about his sexual orientation per se, then breaking up might be her choice. However, the question is about whether she's in the wrong. \n\nIn relationships, if one partner's identity or actions make the other uncomfortable, it's valid to part ways. But there's also the aspect of whether her reason is justified. Since she stated she doesn't care about his sexuality but had never dated someone non-straight, maybe she wasn't ready for that. That's a personal choice, not necessarily being in the wrong. Also, the boyfriend came clean, so he wasn't hiding it. If she couldn't accept that, then ending the relationship is understandable. \n\nBut some might argue that breaking up over something the partner disclosed upfront is selfish, especially if there were no current issues or infidelity. However, the user felt insecure about his attraction and their sex life. It's possible that the bisexuality disclosure made her realize she had doubts about the relationship. In that case, she's not in the wrong for acting on her feelings, even if it's hard to admit. \n\nOn the other hand, some might say she should have addressed her insecurities or communicated better instead of breaking up. But the situation shows she did reflect and then made a decision. The answer might hinge on whether the breakup was based on his sexuality alone or other underlying issues. The user admits that if he hadn't come out, they'd still be together, implying his bisexuality was the main issue. However, she also mentions her own insecurities about the sex frequency and attraction, which could be factors. \n\nIn conclusion, since the user made a choice based on her feelings and the boyfriend was honest, she's not necessarily in the wrong. It's about personal compatibility and readiness. So the answer would be B (not in the wrong).\n"
