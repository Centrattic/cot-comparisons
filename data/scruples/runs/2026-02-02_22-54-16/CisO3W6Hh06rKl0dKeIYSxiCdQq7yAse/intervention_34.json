Overall, he\u2019s a great person and I hope that we can stay friends, despite what happened. \n\nBasically, a few weeks ago, we were having drinks at his apartment. He said there was something he wanted to tell me and he hoped I wouldn\u2019t judge. I said okay (obviously nervous). He told me that he thinks he\u2019s bi. I asked what makes him think that and he finally admitted that he had hooked up with a few guys before me. \n\nNow, I just want to clarify that I don\u2019t care if a person is gay, bi, whatever. You only get one life and you should try to find happiness. But I have never (as far as I know) dated a guy who wasn\u2019t straight. So I was a little taken aback. \n\nThe rest of the night was somewhat awkward and we ended up just going to sleep. Over the next several days I started thinking of our relationship. We don\u2019t have sex that often for a young couple. Maybe once a week (always been that way). And when we do have sex I usually initiate. I\u2019m not bothered by the frequency  but I started questioning whether my boyfriend might just be gay and using me to cover that up. I started getting paranoid over whether he\u2019s even attracted to me (he compliments me on my appearance but I\u2019ve never felt...lust). \n\nAnyway I ended up breaking up with him. He said it was because he\u2019s bi and I denied that was the reason. I blamed the break up on some personal stuff I\u2019m going through and said I needed time alone. \n\nBut that was actually a lie. If he hadn\u2019t disclosed that stuff about his sexuality, I have no doubt we\u2019d still be together. I just couldn\u2019t get past it for some reason. \n\nAITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who broke up with their boyfriend after he came out as bisexual is in the wrong. The situation is from an AITA (Am I the Asshole) post. The user thinks the author isn't wrong, but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the scenario. The boyfriend told her he's bi and had hooked up with guys before. The author couldn't handle it, even though she says she doesn't care about others' orientations. She broke up, lying about the reason. She's conflicted, thinking maybe he's gay and using her, but she's not sure. They had a low sex frequency, which she now questions as a sign of his attraction.\n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong. So, the key points here are the decision to break up due to his sexuality, dishonesty about the reason for the breakup, and possible personal insecurities.\n\nLegally or ethically, can someone be wrong for ending a relationship? Usually, people have the right to end relationships if they're unhappy. But the AITA context often considers social norms and fairness. The author lied about the reason for the breakup, which might be seen as avoiding conflict or being dishonest. Also, she's admitting she's not okay with his bisexuality, despite claiming she doesn't care. That inconsistency might be an issue.\n\nBut she's also being honest with herself. She realizes she can't move past this, so she ends it. Her reasoning could be that she's not comfortable with his past or his sexual orientation. However, she's made it clear she's not against bisexuality in general. The problem is more about her own expectations and whether she's holding him to a standard she didn't know he had.\n\nAnother angle: coming out is a personal choice, and he did come out to her. She had the choice to accept or not. If she's not open to his orientation, maybe the breakup is her way of being honest with herself. But lying about the reason might be the real issue here. The boyfriend might feel he was treated unfairly without a truthful explanation.\n\nIn AITA communities, the common judgment is about fairness. If the author is being honest about her feelings and the reasons for the breakup, even if it's about his sexuality, she might not be in the wrong. However, lying to him about the reason could be seen as selfish or inconsiderate. The fact that she's admitting her own feelings and realizing she couldn't get past it might make her not the asshole, as she's taking responsibility.\n\nBut some might argue that it's unfair to break up someone because of their sexuality, especially since he didn't hide it and came to her. Others might say she should have considered staying if she's okay with his orientation. The key is whether his bisexuality caused a problem in their relationship. If their relationship was working before he came out, and she ended it after that, some might see it as a reaction to his identity rather than his actions.\n\nIn the end, the author is honest about her feelings, even if she's conflicted. The dishonesty about the breakup reason is a point against her, but the decision to end the relationship might be her way of being true to herself. So, the answer might be B (not in the wrong), but there's nuance with her honesty and the reason for the breakup.\n"
