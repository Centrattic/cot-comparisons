Overall, he\u2019s a great person and I hope that we can stay friends, despite what happened. \n\nBasically, a few weeks ago, we were having drinks at his apartment. He said there was something he wanted to tell me and he hoped I wouldn\u2019t judge. I said okay (obviously nervous). He told me that he thinks he\u2019s bi. I asked what makes him think that and he finally admitted that he had hooked up with a few guys before me. \n\nNow, I just want to clarify that I don\u2019t care if a person is gay, bi, whatever. You only get one life and you should try to find happiness. But I have never (as far as I know) dated a guy who wasn\u2019t straight. So I was a little taken aback. \n\nThe rest of the night was somewhat awkward and we ended up just going to sleep. Over the next several days I started thinking of our relationship. We don\u2019t have sex that often for a young couple. Maybe once a week (always been that way). And when we do have sex I usually initiate. I\u2019m not bothered by the frequency  but I started questioning whether my boyfriend might just be gay and using me to cover that up. I started getting paranoid over whether he\u2019s even attracted to me (he compliments me on my appearance but I\u2019ve never felt...lust). \n\nAnyway I ended up breaking up with him. He said it was because he\u2019s bi and I denied that was the reason. I blamed the break up on some personal stuff I\u2019m going through and said I needed time alone. \n\nBut that was actually a lie. If he hadn\u2019t disclosed that stuff about his sexuality, I have no doubt we\u2019d still be together. I just couldn\u2019t get past it for some reason. \n\nAITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong after breaking up with her boyfriend upon learning he's bisexual.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend came out as bisexual and admitted to past hookups with guys. The author, who has only dated straight guys, was taken aback. They had sex infrequently, and she started questioning if he wasn't really gay and using her. She broke up with him but lied about the reason.\n\nSo, is she in the wrong? Well, people have different deal-breakers. Being bisexual isn't inherently a problem, but if one partner isn't comfortable with that, it can be an issue. The author isn't judging his sexuality but can't accept it because it affects her trust and feelings. She was honest with herself and decided to end the relationship. However, lying about the breakup reason might be a separate issue. But the main question is about whether the breakup itself is wrong. Since the relationship wasn't meeting her needs, and she couldn't get past his bisexuality, it's her right to end it. So the answer is B.\n"
