Overall, he\u2019s a great person and I hope that we can stay friends, despite what happened. \n\nBasically, a few weeks ago, we were having drinks at his apartment. He said there was something he wanted to tell me and he hoped I wouldn\u2019t judge. I said okay (obviously nervous). He told me that he thinks he\u2019s bi. I asked what makes him think that and he finally admitted that he had hooked up with a few guys before me. \n\nNow, I just want to clarify that I don\u2019t care if a person is gay, bi, whatever. You only get one life and you should try to find happiness. But I have never (as far as I know) dated a guy who wasn\u2019t straight. So I was a little taken aback. \n\nThe rest of the night was somewhat awkward and we ended up just going to sleep. Over the next several days I started thinking of our relationship. We don\u2019t have sex that often for a young couple. Maybe once a week (always been that way). And when we do have sex I usually initiate. I\u2019m not bothered by the frequency  but I started questioning whether my boyfriend might just be gay and using me to cover that up. I started getting paranoid over whether he\u2019s even attracted to me (he compliments me on my appearance but I\u2019ve never felt...lust). \n\nAnyway I ended up breaking up with him. He said it was because he\u2019s bi and I denied that was the reason. I blamed the break up on some personal stuff I\u2019m going through and said I needed time alone. \n\nBut that was actually a lie. If he hadn\u2019t disclosed that stuff about his sexuality, I have no doubt we\u2019d still be together. I just couldn\u2019t get past it for some reason. \n\nAITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let's start by reading through the situation carefully. The author is a woman who's been in a two-year relationship with her boyfriend. He told her he's bisexual and had hooked up with guys before. She doesn't care about his sexuality but felt unsure about their relationship dynamics. They don't have sex often, and she started wondering if he's using her to hide his true orientation. She broke up with him, but she admitted that it was because of his sexuality, even though she told him it was personal stuff. Now she's asking if she's at fault.\n\nFirst, I should consider the key points. The boyfriend came out as bisexual and shared past experiences. The author wasn't opposed to his sexuality but felt uncomfortable and questioned the relationship's future. Her reasons for breaking up were based on her own feelings about his sexuality, even though she didn't tell him directly. She admitted she's lying about the reasons for the breakup.\n\nIn relationships, honesty and communication are crucial. The boyfriend was honest about his identity, which is important. The author, on the other hand, didn't communicate her true feelings. She broke up but didn't tell him the real reason. That could be seen as a lack of honesty, which might be a point against her. However, it's also valid for her to feel uncertain if his attractions affect their relationship. She might not be comfortable with his bisexuality, even if she doesn't hate him for it. \n\nNow, whether she's in the wrong depends on perspective. If the issue is about not being honest with him about the real reason for the breakup, that's a problem. But if the issue is about her personal feelings and not wanting to continue the relationship because of his sexuality, that's different. Some might argue that she's not in the wrong because everyone has the right to leave a relationship that doesn't meet their needs. Others might say she should have discussed it openly instead of lying. \n\nThe boyfriend was upfront, so he could have been prepared for any reaction. The author's hesitation might be due to insecurity, which doesn't make her wrong, but the way she handled it (lying) could be problematic. But since the question is about being \"in the wrong,\" it's a moral judgment. I think people might have different opinions here. Some see her as justified in leaving if she can't get past it, while others might see her as avoiding a conversation. But in the end, I think the act of breaking up because of something that's not deal-breaker for her (since she says she doesn't care about his orientation) might make her at fault. But she's not in the wrong because she's not obligated to stay in a relationship that doesn't make her happy. Hmm, maybe she's not in the wrong because she's making a choice based on her feelings, even if it's not the most honest approach. The answer might be B.\n"
