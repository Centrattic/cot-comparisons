Overall, he\u2019s a great person and I hope that we can stay friends, despite what happened. \n\nBasically, a few weeks ago, we were having drinks at his apartment. He said there was something he wanted to tell me and he hoped I wouldn\u2019t judge. I said okay (obviously nervous). He told me that he thinks he\u2019s bi. I asked what makes him think that and he finally admitted that he had hooked up with a few guys before me. \n\nNow, I just want to clarify that I don\u2019t care if a person is gay, bi, whatever. You only get one life and you should try to find happiness. But I have never (as far as I know) dated a guy who wasn\u2019t straight. So I was a little taken aback. \n\nThe rest of the night was somewhat awkward and we ended up just going to sleep. Over the next several days I started thinking of our relationship. We don\u2019t have sex that often for a young couple. Maybe once a week (always been that way). And when we do have sex I usually initiate. I\u2019m not bothered by the frequency  but I started questioning whether my boyfriend might just be gay and using me to cover that up. I started getting paranoid over whether he\u2019s even attracted to me (he compliments me on my appearance but I\u2019ve never felt...lust). \n\nAnyway I ended up breaking up with him. He said it was because he\u2019s bi and I denied that was the reason. I blamed the break up on some personal stuff I\u2019m going through and said I needed time alone. \n\nBut that was actually a lie. If he hadn\u2019t disclosed that stuff about his sexuality, I have no doubt we\u2019d still be together. I just couldn\u2019t get past it for some reason. \n\nAITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for breaking up with her boyfriend after he confessed he's bisexual. First, I need to understand the situation from both sides.\n\nThe boyfriend is bisexual and had hooked up with men before. The author is a woman who's never dated a non-straight guy. She says she doesn't care about his orientation but ends up breaking up because of it. The key points here are her reasons for the breakup. She mentions that she started doubting if he's even attracted to her, leading to paranoia. But she admits that the real reason was his bisexuality. She lied about the reason for the breakup, saying it was personal stuff instead.\n\nNow, bisexuality means being attracted to both genders. The boyfriend's actions (hooking up with guys) were in the past, before the relationship. The author might feel uncomfortable with his attraction to men, even if she doesn't care about his orientation. But is that a valid reason? Relationships are about mutual respect and compatibility. If she's uncomfortable with his past or his orientation, that's a personal issue. However, he didn't do anything wrong by being honest about his identity. \n\nShe broke up with him because of his bisexuality, even though she claims to accept people's choices. The act of ending a relationship because of something that doesn't directly affect the relationship's dynamics (like past hookups) might be seen as the author's issue. The boyfriend was honest, and she couldn't get past it. In that case, she might be in the wrong because she's ending the relationship over something that's not a betrayal or dishonesty.\n\nBut wait, maybe she's not in the wrong because relationships require both partners to be comfortable. If she can't accept his bisexuality, even if it's not affecting their current relationship, then maybe it's a deal-breaker for her. However, the problem is that she lied about the reason, which might add to the complexity. The key here is whether her decision is based on a valid reason or not. Since bisexuality doesn't inherently harm the relationship, and he's honest, the author's discomfort is her personal issue. So she might be in the wrong for breaking up based on that. But others might argue that if it's a deal-breaker for her, then it's her right to leave.\n"
