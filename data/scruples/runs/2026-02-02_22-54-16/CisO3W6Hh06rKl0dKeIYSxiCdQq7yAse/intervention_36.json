Overall, he\u2019s a great person and I hope that we can stay friends, despite what happened. \n\nBasically, a few weeks ago, we were having drinks at his apartment. He said there was something he wanted to tell me and he hoped I wouldn\u2019t judge. I said okay (obviously nervous). He told me that he thinks he\u2019s bi. I asked what makes him think that and he finally admitted that he had hooked up with a few guys before me. \n\nNow, I just want to clarify that I don\u2019t care if a person is gay, bi, whatever. You only get one life and you should try to find happiness. But I have never (as far as I know) dated a guy who wasn\u2019t straight. So I was a little taken aback. \n\nThe rest of the night was somewhat awkward and we ended up just going to sleep. Over the next several days I started thinking of our relationship. We don\u2019t have sex that often for a young couple. Maybe once a week (always been that way). And when we do have sex I usually initiate. I\u2019m not bothered by the frequency  but I started questioning whether my boyfriend might just be gay and using me to cover that up. I started getting paranoid over whether he\u2019s even attracted to me (he compliments me on my appearance but I\u2019ve never felt...lust). \n\nAnyway I ended up breaking up with him. He said it was because he\u2019s bi and I denied that was the reason. I blamed the break up on some personal stuff I\u2019m going through and said I needed time alone. \n\nBut that was actually a lie. If he hadn\u2019t disclosed that stuff about his sexuality, I have no doubt we\u2019d still be together. I just couldn\u2019t get past it for some reason. \n\nAITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who broke up with their boyfriend after he came out as bisexual is in the wrong. The situation is that the boyfriend confessed he's bisexual and had hooked up with guys before. The author says they don't care about sexuality but felt the relationship wasn't fulfilling in terms of sex, and they couldn't get past his bisexuality.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The boyfriend was honest about his bisexuality. The author had never dated a gay or bi guy before and felt uncertain about the relationship's future. They had a low sexual frequency and the author initiated most of the time, which led to doubts about attraction. The breakup was due to discomfort with his sexuality, even though the author admitted it wasn't the reason they gave.\n\nIn relationships, honesty is key. The boyfriend came clean, which is commendable. The author, however, ended the relationship because they couldn't accept his bisexuality, even though they stated they don't have an issue with it. This is conflicting. On one hand, the author's feelings are valid; they should be comfortable with their partner's past and current orientation. On the other hand, choosing to break up over something that the person claims they don't care about might be problematic. The author's actions could be seen as hypocritical since they said they support others but acted against it.\n\nAlso, the author's justification for the breakup being a lie adds another layer. If the real reason is unaddressed, it might be unfair to the partner. The core issue is whether the author's decision was based on genuine incompatibility or prejudice. Since the author admitted they couldn't get past it, even though they don't harbor ill will towards being bi, it could indicate underlying issues like insecurity or societal stigma affecting their judgment. \n\nIn such cases, it's important to acknowledge that people have the right to end relationships if they feel something is a deal-breaker, even if it's not malicious. However, if the reason is based on a misunderstanding or personal biases, it might be seen as unjust. Here, the author's hesitation might stem from their own inexperience rather than the partner's actions. So, whether the author is in the wrong depends on perspective. Some might say they're justified in ending the relationship if they feel uncomfortable, while others might argue they should have worked through the issue instead of letting it lead to a breakup.\n"
