Overall, he\u2019s a great person and I hope that we can stay friends, despite what happened. \n\nBasically, a few weeks ago, we were having drinks at his apartment. He said there was something he wanted to tell me and he hoped I wouldn\u2019t judge. I said okay (obviously nervous). He told me that he thinks he\u2019s bi. I asked what makes him think that and he finally admitted that he had hooked up with a few guys before me. \n\nNow, I just want to clarify that I don\u2019t care if a person is gay, bi, whatever. You only get one life and you should try to find happiness. But I have never (as far as I know) dated a guy who wasn\u2019t straight. So I was a little taken aback. \n\nThe rest of the night was somewhat awkward and we ended up just going to sleep. Over the next several days I started thinking of our relationship. We don\u2019t have sex that often for a young couple. Maybe once a week (always been that way). And when we do have sex I usually initiate. I\u2019m not bothered by the frequency  but I started questioning whether my boyfriend might just be gay and using me to cover that up. I started getting paranoid over whether he\u2019s even attracted to me (he compliments me on my appearance but I\u2019ve never felt...lust). \n\nAnyway I ended up breaking up with him. He said it was because he\u2019s bi and I denied that was the reason. I blamed the break up on some personal stuff I\u2019m going through and said I needed time alone. \n\nBut that was actually a lie. If he hadn\u2019t disclosed that stuff about his sexuality, I have no doubt we\u2019d still be together. I just couldn\u2019t get past it for some reason. \n\nAITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the person who broke up with their boyfriend because he's bisexual is in the wrong. Let's start by understanding the situation. The user is the woman in the relationship, and the ex-boyfriend is a 24-year-old who confessed he's bisexual. They were together for two years. The key points here are about whether it's acceptable to break up because of the partner's bisexuality.\n\nFirst, I should consider if being bisexual is a valid reason to end a relationship. Bisexuality means being attracted to more than one gender, so it's not inherently about cheating or not being committed. The woman says she's okay with people being gay or bi but that she's never dated someone not straight. Maybe she's not comfortable with the idea that her partner is also attracted to other genders, even if he's not acting on it. That could lead to insecurity or distrust, which she mentions, like questioning if he's gay and using her as a cover. \n\nShe also mentions that their sex life wasn't frequent, and she initiated most of the time. Maybe she felt insecure about his attraction to her because of his bisexuality. However, it's important to note that the breakup was her decision, and she admitted the bisexuality was the real reason. \n\nNow, the question is whether she's in the wrong. If the relationship was monogamous and he wasn't cheating, then his bisexuality itself isn't a reason to break up. People can be bisexual and committed. However, if the woman felt uncomfortable and couldn't move past it, even if she knows it's not about cheating, then it's about her own feelings and boundaries. \n\nBut is it fair to break up someone because of their sexuality? That could be seen as discriminatory if there's no other issue. However, in relationships, personal compatibility is crucial. If someone's core values or comfort zones are violated, they might have the right to end things. \n\nThe ex-boyfriend might feel wronged because he came clean and it led to the breakup despite being truthful. On the other hand, the woman might feel she made the right choice for herself. The answer could depend on cultural or personal beliefs. In some views, it's okay to end a relationship if you can't accept your partner's sexuality. Others might see it as discrimination. \n\nI need to check if there's any indication that the bisexuality led to infidelity or broken trust. The story doesn't mention cheating; he just admitted past hookups with guys before the relationship. So, the breakup isn't due to cheating but rather her inability to accept his orientation. \n\nSo, whether the woman is in the wrong depends on perspective. If you believe that sexuality shouldn't affect monogamous relationships, then she's wrong. If you believe people have the right to end relationships based on personal incompatibility, then she's not. \n\nBut in many discussions, breaking up because someone is bisexual without other issues is seen as AITA (Am I the Asshole). The woman's reasoning might be considered being in the wrong because she's ending the relationship based on something he can't change. However, the other side says relationships are about mutual compatibility, and if she can't accept his sexuality, it's valid for her to leave. \n\nI think the answer might be a nuanced B (not in the wrong) because the decision is based on her personal incompatibility, even though it's a sensitive issue. But some might argue A because it's about his identity. It's a tough call, but given that the story shows she's thoughtful and acknowledges her own feelings, maybe B is the answer here.\n"
