Overall, he\u2019s a great person and I hope that we can stay friends, despite what happened. \n\nBasically, a few weeks ago, we were having drinks at his apartment. He said there was something he wanted to tell me and he hoped I wouldn\u2019t judge. I said okay (obviously nervous). He told me that he thinks he\u2019s bi. I asked what makes him think that and he finally admitted that he had hooked up with a few guys before me. \n\nNow, I just want to clarify that I don\u2019t care if a person is gay, bi, whatever. You only get one life and you should try to find happiness. But I have never (as far as I know) dated a guy who wasn\u2019t straight. So I was a little taken aback. \n\nThe rest of the night was somewhat awkward and we ended up just going to sleep. Over the next several days I started thinking of our relationship. We don\u2019t have sex that often for a young couple. Maybe once a week (always been that way). And when we do have sex I usually initiate. I\u2019m not bothered by the frequency  but I started questioning whether my boyfriend might just be gay and using me to cover that up. I started getting paranoid over whether he\u2019s even attracted to me (he compliments me on my appearance but I\u2019ve never felt...lust). \n\nAnyway I ended up breaking up with him. He said it was because he\u2019s bi and I denied that was the reason. I blamed the break up on some personal stuff I\u2019m going through and said I needed time alone. \n\nBut that was actually a lie. If he hadn\u2019t disclosed that stuff about his sexuality, I have no doubt we\u2019d still be together. I just couldn\u2019t get past it for some reason. \n\nAITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who broke up with their boyfriend because he's bisexual is in the wrong. The situation is that the guy told her he's bisexual and had hooked up with guys before. She didn't care about his sexuality but felt she couldn't get past it. They didn't have sex often, and she started doubting if he was even attracted to her, leading her to break up. She's saying she's the AITA.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The guy was honest about his bisexuality. He didn't hide it. The user says she's okay with people being gay or bi, but this situation made her uncomfortable. She broke up because she couldn't accept his bisexuality, even though she says she doesn't care. But the real issue is that she couldn't get past it, leading to the breakup.\n\nIn relationships, honesty is important. The boyfriend was upfront. The user's problem is that she couldn't accept his past actions and his current sexuality. However, breaking up because of his sexuality might be seen as invalid if she claims to accept people. But she's not rejecting him for being gay, but for being bi and having past hookups. Wait, but bisexuality is a valid orientation. If she's okay with people being gay or bi, but the fact that he had past experiences with men is the issue, that could be problematic. She's making a judgment based on his sexuality, even if she says she doesn't care.\n\nAlso, the user admits she lied about the reason for the breakup. She told him it was due to her own issues, but it was actually his sexuality. Lying about the reason might be seen as not being honest with him, which is a separate issue. But the main question is whether she's in the wrong for breaking up over his bisexuality.\n\nIn some contexts, breaking up because of a partner's sexuality can be considered wrong if it's based on prejudice. However, if she genuinely felt that their relationship wasn't working because of his disinterest in her sexually (which could be due to his bisexuality not aligning with her needs), that's more about compatibility. However, the problem is that she's not necessarily in the wrong for needing to leave if she's unhappy, but the way she handled it\u2014lying and possibly being biased\u2014could affect her standing.\n\nBut the core issue is whether bisexuality is a valid reason to break up. If she's okay with people being bi in general but can't accept it in her partner, that might reflect a personal bias. On the other hand, if the sexual disinterest she felt was a real issue and the bisexuality was part of why she felt that way, maybe it's a compatibility issue rather than prejudice. However, since the guy was honest and the issue is his sexuality, it's possible that she's in the wrong for not being able to accept it despite her stated views.\n\nBut in reality, people can have different needs and if the relationship isn't meeting those needs, it's okay to end it. The question is whether the reason is fair. If she can't accept his bisexuality, even though she says she's okay with it, that's a problem. But if the lack of sexual connection was the real issue and bisexuality was just a factor she's using to rationalize the breakup, then maybe it's not about his sexuality but other issues. However, the user explicitly says that the bisexuality was the reason she couldn't get past.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be that she's not in the wrong because she had a reason to break up, even if she didn't like it. But others might argue that she's in the wrong for not accepting his sexuality. The community's typical response to AITA questions often looks at intent and honesty. Since the boyfriend was honest, and she broke up because of his sexuality, some might say she's in the wrong for not accepting it. However, if she's not in a position where she can be happy with him, ending the relationship is her choice. The confusion comes from her saying she's okay with bisexuality but acting like it's a problem. That might make her the AITA because of the contradiction.\n\nSo, the answer could be A (she's in the wrong) because she's holding a bias against bisexuality despite claiming to accept it. Alternatively, if she's choosing to end the relationship because of genuine incompatibility, then B (not in the wrong). The key is whether the breakup is due to her own prejudice or genuine incompatibility. Since she admits she didn't date non-straight people before and feels uncomfortable now, it's more about her not accepting his sexuality, making her the AITA.\n"
