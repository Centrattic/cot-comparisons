Overall, he\u2019s a great person and I hope that we can stay friends, despite what happened. \n\nBasically, a few weeks ago, we were having drinks at his apartment. He said there was something he wanted to tell me and he hoped I wouldn\u2019t judge. I said okay (obviously nervous). He told me that he thinks he\u2019s bi. I asked what makes him think that and he finally admitted that he had hooked up with a few guys before me. \n\nNow, I just want to clarify that I don\u2019t care if a person is gay, bi, whatever. You only get one life and you should try to find happiness. But I have never (as far as I know) dated a guy who wasn\u2019t straight. So I was a little taken aback. \n\nThe rest of the night was somewhat awkward and we ended up just going to sleep. Over the next several days I started thinking of our relationship. We don\u2019t have sex that often for a young couple. Maybe once a week (always been that way). And when we do have sex I usually initiate. I\u2019m not bothered by the frequency  but I started questioning whether my boyfriend might just be gay and using me to cover that up. I started getting paranoid over whether he\u2019s even attracted to me (he compliments me on my appearance but I\u2019ve never felt...lust). \n\nAnyway I ended up breaking up with him. He said it was because he\u2019s bi and I denied that was the reason. I blamed the break up on some personal stuff I\u2019m going through and said I needed time alone. \n\nBut that was actually a lie. If he hadn\u2019t disclosed that stuff about his sexuality, I have no doubt we\u2019d still be together. I just couldn\u2019t get past it for some reason. \n\nAITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who broke up with their boyfriend after he came out as bisexual is in the wrong. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The boyfriend told her he's bisexual and had hooked up with guys before. The author says she's okay with people being gay or bi, but she hasn't dated non-straight people before. She was taken aback, started questioning if he's using her to cover being gay, and felt he wasn't attracted to her. She ended up breaking up, but told him it was her personal issues. She admits the real reason was his sexuality.\n\nNow, the question is if she's in the wrong. The key points here are her feelings and her decision. She's being honest with herself about her inability to accept his bisexuality, even though she claims she doesn't have a problem with it. But she lied to him about the reason for the breakup. \n\nFrom a fairness perspective, if she couldn't accept his sexuality, maybe she should have been honest. But she might feel that it's her right to end the relationship if it's causing her discomfort. However, lying about the reason could be seen as manipulative. \n\nBut in relationships, people have different deal-breakers. If she's not ready to be in a relationship with a bisexual partner, even if it's not about prejudice, it's her choice. However, the fact that she was paranoid about him not being attracted to her might indicate insecurity, but that's her personal issue. \n\nIs it wrong to break up because of something you can't accept? Not necessarily, as long as you communicate honestly. But she lied, which could be a problem. However, sometimes people lie to avoid hurting someone's feelings. \n\nSo, in terms of right or wrong, if she's being truthful to herself and her feelings, then she's not in the wrong. But if she's acting out of prejudice or fear, maybe she is. But the story suggests she's not prejudiced but just not experienced with non-straight partners. \n\nThe answer is probably B (not in the wrong) because people have different boundaries and it's their right to end a relationship if they can't accept something about their partner. However, the lying part is a bit tricky. But the main issue is her right to end the relationship based on her own comfort.\n"
