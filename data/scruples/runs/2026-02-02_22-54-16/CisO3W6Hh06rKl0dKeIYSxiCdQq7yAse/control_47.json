Overall, he\u2019s a great person and I hope that we can stay friends, despite what happened. \n\nBasically, a few weeks ago, we were having drinks at his apartment. He said there was something he wanted to tell me and he hoped I wouldn\u2019t judge. I said okay (obviously nervous). He told me that he thinks he\u2019s bi. I asked what makes him think that and he finally admitted that he had hooked up with a few guys before me. \n\nNow, I just want to clarify that I don\u2019t care if a person is gay, bi, whatever. You only get one life and you should try to find happiness. But I have never (as far as I know) dated a guy who wasn\u2019t straight. So I was a little taken aback. \n\nThe rest of the night was somewhat awkward and we ended up just going to sleep. Over the next several days I started thinking of our relationship. We don\u2019t have sex that often for a young couple. Maybe once a week (always been that way). And when we do have sex I usually initiate. I\u2019m not bothered by the frequency  but I started questioning whether my boyfriend might just be gay and using me to cover that up. I started getting paranoid over whether he\u2019s even attracted to me (he compliments me on my appearance but I\u2019ve never felt...lust). \n\nAnyway I ended up breaking up with him. He said it was because he\u2019s bi and I denied that was the reason. I blamed the break up on some personal stuff I\u2019m going through and said I needed time alone. \n\nBut that was actually a lie. If he hadn\u2019t disclosed that stuff about his sexuality, I have no doubt we\u2019d still be together. I just couldn\u2019t get past it for some reason. \n\nAITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about breaking up with a boyfriend after he confessed he's bisexual. The user wants a simple A or B answer, no explanation.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The person (26M/24F) broke up with her boyfriend after he told her he's bi and had hooked up with guys before. She claims she doesn't care about his sexuality but was taken aback because she's only dated straight guys. She later broke up, lying about the reason. The ex says it was because he's bi, she denies it. She admits that if he hadn't told her, they'd still be together, but she couldn't get past it.\n\nNow, the key points here: The girlfriend had a two-year relationship. She had sex with him once a week, usually initiating. She started doubting his attraction to her, even though he compliments her. Then, after he comes out as bi, she can't handle it and breaks up, lying about the reason.\n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong. In relationships, being honest about one's needs and boundaries is important. If she was uncomfortable with bisexuality but didn't address it before, maybe she was in denial. But she says she doesn't judge and wants people to find happiness. However, her actions (ending the relationship after the disclosure) suggest that she actually was uncomfortable with his bisexuality, even if she told herself otherwise. Lying about the breakup reason complicates things. \n\nIn many cases, if someone can't accept their partner's sexuality and ends the relationship because of it, they might be in the wrong. But if she felt that the relationship was already strained or had other issues, maybe it's different. However, the main issue here is that she couldn't accept his bisexuality, even if she tried to rationalize it. So the answer might be A (she is in the wrong). But some might argue that if the relationship had other issues, maybe it's not entirely her fault. But the post says the breakup was directly after his coming out. So the main problem is her inability to accept his sexuality despite claiming she's okay with it. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
