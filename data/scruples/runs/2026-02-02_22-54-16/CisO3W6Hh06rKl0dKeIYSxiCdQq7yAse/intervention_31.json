Overall, he\u2019s a great person and I hope that we can stay friends, despite what happened. \n\nBasically, a few weeks ago, we were having drinks at his apartment. He said there was something he wanted to tell me and he hoped I wouldn\u2019t judge. I said okay (obviously nervous). He told me that he thinks he\u2019s bi. I asked what makes him think that and he finally admitted that he had hooked up with a few guys before me. \n\nNow, I just want to clarify that I don\u2019t care if a person is gay, bi, whatever. You only get one life and you should try to find happiness. But I have never (as far as I know) dated a guy who wasn\u2019t straight. So I was a little taken aback. \n\nThe rest of the night was somewhat awkward and we ended up just going to sleep. Over the next several days I started thinking of our relationship. We don\u2019t have sex that often for a young couple. Maybe once a week (always been that way). And when we do have sex I usually initiate. I\u2019m not bothered by the frequency  but I started questioning whether my boyfriend might just be gay and using me to cover that up. I started getting paranoid over whether he\u2019s even attracted to me (he compliments me on my appearance but I\u2019ve never felt...lust). \n\nAnyway I ended up breaking up with him. He said it was because he\u2019s bi and I denied that was the reason. I blamed the break up on some personal stuff I\u2019m going through and said I needed time alone. \n\nBut that was actually a lie. If he hadn\u2019t disclosed that stuff about his sexuality, I have no doubt we\u2019d still be together. I just couldn\u2019t get past it for some reason. \n\nAITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who broke up with their boyfriend after he confessed to being bisexual is in the wrong. The situation is a bit complex, so I need to break it down carefully.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend came out as bisexual and admitted to hooking up with guys before the relationship. The author says they don't judge based on sexuality, but they had never dated a non-straight person. The breakup was because the author had doubts about the relationship, possibly thinking the boyfriend was using her to cover being gay. However, the frequency of sex and the author usually initiating it might be part of their dynamic, not necessarily tied to his sexuality. The author lied about the reason for the breakup, saying it was personal issues instead.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. Legally, there's nothing against them for ending a relationship. Emotionally, the issue is whether the breakup was justified. The boyfriend's bisexuality isn't a dealbreaker by itself, but the author felt it affected their relationship. The key points are: the author's comfort with the boyfriend's sexuality, the actual reasons for the breakup, and the dishonesty about the cause.\n\nThe author might be in the wrong if they acted on unfounded suspicions or if they broke up solely because of his bisexuality, which could be a form of bias. However, if the author felt that the relationship wasn't fulfilling despite his honesty, and they couldn't overcome the emotional impact of his disclosure, it's a personal choice. The lie might be problematic, but the main question is about the breakup itself.\n\nAnother angle: healthy relationships require trust and communication. The author might have felt insecure and didn't address it properly, leading to a rushed decision. But people have different dealbreakers. Some can't handle the idea of a partner being interested in others, even if they're not acting on it. Since the boyfriend had past hookups, maybe the author felt it was a red flag for potential future issues.\n\nHowever, the boyfriend was upfront, and the author's issue might be more about personal incompatibility rather than his sexuality. If the author was already having issues in the relationship (like low sexual frequency) and the disclosure just became the catalyst, it's more about the underlying problems. The lie complicates things, but the core question is whether the reason for breaking up was valid.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If they broke up because they couldn't accept his bisexuality, that's a problem. But if they broke up because they felt the relationship wasn't meeting their needs, even though the guy was honest, it's a different story. The community often looks at AITA questions by considering if the person did something unethical or if their feelings are natural. In this case, the author might not be in the wrong because they felt it was the right choice for their personal reasons, even if those reasons were influenced by his sexuality. But the dishonesty about the breakup reason could be considered a flaw in their approach.\n\nI think the answer is B (No), because the author is not in the wrong for ending the relationship if they felt it wasn't working, even if the boyfriend's sexuality played a role. However, there's a caveat about the dishonesty. But the main question is about being in the wrong, not about the lie. The AITA subreddit often says that people aren't in the wrong for having different needs or dealbreakers, especially if the other person was honest.\n"
