Overall, he\u2019s a great person and I hope that we can stay friends, despite what happened. \n\nBasically, a few weeks ago, we were having drinks at his apartment. He said there was something he wanted to tell me and he hoped I wouldn\u2019t judge. I said okay (obviously nervous). He told me that he thinks he\u2019s bi. I asked what makes him think that and he finally admitted that he had hooked up with a few guys before me. \n\nNow, I just want to clarify that I don\u2019t care if a person is gay, bi, whatever. You only get one life and you should try to find happiness. But I have never (as far as I know) dated a guy who wasn\u2019t straight. So I was a little taken aback. \n\nThe rest of the night was somewhat awkward and we ended up just going to sleep. Over the next several days I started thinking of our relationship. We don\u2019t have sex that often for a young couple. Maybe once a week (always been that way). And when we do have sex I usually initiate. I\u2019m not bothered by the frequency  but I started questioning whether my boyfriend might just be gay and using me to cover that up. I started getting paranoid over whether he\u2019s even attracted to me (he compliments me on my appearance but I\u2019ve never felt...lust). \n\nAnyway I ended up breaking up with him. He said it was because he\u2019s bi and I denied that was the reason. I blamed the break up on some personal stuff I\u2019m going through and said I needed time alone. \n\nBut that was actually a lie. If he hadn\u2019t disclosed that stuff about his sexuality, I have no doubt we\u2019d still be together. I just couldn\u2019t get past it for some reason. \n\nAITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who broke up with their boyfriend after he came out as bisexual is in the wrong. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The ex-boyfriend came out as bisexual, admitting he had hooked up with guys before. The author was okay with his sexuality but felt uneasy because they had a low sex frequency and she initiated most of it. She started doubting if he was really into her and eventually broke up, but lied about the reason.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics. The key point here is that the author broke up because of his sexuality, even though she claims not to care about that. She didn't like that he was bisexual and it made her question his attraction to her. But the boyfriend didn't hide his bisexuality; he came out to her. She knew about his past, but maybe the issue was about future relationships or her discomfort with his sexuality affecting their current relationship.\n\nIn relationships, both partners need to feel comfortable and accepted. If one partner's identity or actions make the other uncomfortable, it's a problem. The author admitted that if he hadn't come out as bi, they'd still be together. That suggests her issue was specifically with his sexuality, not other factors. \n\nHowever, it's also valid for someone to come to terms with their identity and share it with a partner. The boyfriend did disclose his sexuality, and it's the author who had the issue with it. In that case, the author might have a right to end the relationship if she feels it's impacting their bond. But the way she handled it\u2014lying about the reason\u2014could be problematic. She didn't address the real issue and instead blamed herself or other things, which might be dishonest.\n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong. Some might argue that she's not in the wrong because relationships require mutual acceptance. If she couldn't accept his bisexuality even after he was honest with her, then she has the right to leave. Others might say she's being unfair because bisexuality isn't a deal-breaker, and her insecurities led to the breakup instead of addressing them. \n\nBut the main point is that he was honest, and she made a choice based on her feelings. Since she admitted the reason was his sexuality, which she couldn't accept, the answer might depend on societal views. However, in terms of right and wrong, it's more about mutual compatibility. If the person can't accept their partner's identity, that's a personal issue. So the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for breaking up but might have lacked honesty with herself and her partner.\n"
