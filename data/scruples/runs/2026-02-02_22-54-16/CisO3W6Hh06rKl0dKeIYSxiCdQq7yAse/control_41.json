Overall, he\u2019s a great person and I hope that we can stay friends, despite what happened. \n\nBasically, a few weeks ago, we were having drinks at his apartment. He said there was something he wanted to tell me and he hoped I wouldn\u2019t judge. I said okay (obviously nervous). He told me that he thinks he\u2019s bi. I asked what makes him think that and he finally admitted that he had hooked up with a few guys before me. \n\nNow, I just want to clarify that I don\u2019t care if a person is gay, bi, whatever. You only get one life and you should try to find happiness. But I have never (as far as I know) dated a guy who wasn\u2019t straight. So I was a little taken aback. \n\nThe rest of the night was somewhat awkward and we ended up just going to sleep. Over the next several days I started thinking of our relationship. We don\u2019t have sex that often for a young couple. Maybe once a week (always been that way). And when we do have sex I usually initiate. I\u2019m not bothered by the frequency  but I started questioning whether my boyfriend might just be gay and using me to cover that up. I started getting paranoid over whether he\u2019s even attracted to me (he compliments me on my appearance but I\u2019ve never felt...lust). \n\nAnyway I ended up breaking up with him. He said it was because he\u2019s bi and I denied that was the reason. I blamed the break up on some personal stuff I\u2019m going through and said I needed time alone. \n\nBut that was actually a lie. If he hadn\u2019t disclosed that stuff about his sexuality, I have no doubt we\u2019d still be together. I just couldn\u2019t get past it for some reason. \n\nAITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through their situation again carefully.\n\nThey're a woman in a two-year relationship with a man who is now 26 and she's 24. He told her he's bisexual and admitted to hooking up with guys before. The woman says she doesn't care about someone's sexuality, but she's never dated a guy who wasn't straight. She was taken aback but not because of his orientation. She ended the relationship, but she lied about the reason, blaming it on personal issues instead of his bisexuality. She mentions that their sex life is infrequent and she usually initiates. She started thinking maybe he's gay and using her to cover it up, leading to paranoia about his attraction to her. She broke up with him, but he said it was because of his bisexuality, which she denied. She's asking if she's in the wrong (AITA).\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The man came out as bisexual and disclosed his past with men. The woman ended the relationship because she couldn't get past his bisexuality, even though she claims she doesn't judge people for their sexuality. However, her past experience only includes straight men, so this is new to her. She felt uncomfortable and started questioning if he's actually gay and using her, which led to the breakup.\n\nNow, in terms of ethics, is she in the wrong? Well, in relationships, honesty is crucial. The man was honest about his sexuality, which he had the right to do. The woman, however, ended the relationship not because of something he did wrong but because she couldn't accept his bisexuality. Even though she says she doesn't judge, her actions suggest otherwise. She couldn't get past his orientation, which is a personal issue on her part. She also lied about the reason for the breakup, which could be seen as dishonest. \n\nBut, it's also important to consider that people have the right to end relationships if they feel incompatible. The woman might not have realized that her discomfort was due to his bisexuality. However, the fact that she's breaking up over something she claims not to care about might indicate that she is in the wrong. Also, the way she lied about the reason could be seen as avoiding confrontation or not being truthful about her feelings.\n\nAnother angle: the woman's feelings are valid. She's never been in a relationship with a non-straight man before, so this was a new experience. Maybe she needed time to process, but instead, she reacted by ending the relationship. However, if her issue was with his bisexuality, even though she says she's okay with it, then she might be in the wrong for letting that affect the relationship negatively.\n\nAlso, the man's behavior\u2014hooking up with guys before the relationship\u2014was past behavior. It doesn't necessarily affect the current relationship if he's monogamous with her now. The woman's paranoia about his attraction could be a red flag about her insecurity, not the man's bisexuality. But the main issue is that she broke up with him because of his sexuality, which she claims not to care about, leading to potential hypocrisy.\n\nIn conclusion, the woman broke up with her boyfriend because she couldn't accept his bisexuality, despite stating she doesn't judge people for it. Her actions conflicted with her stated beliefs. While relationships are personal, the fact that she lied about the reason and ended the relationship because of something she claims not to care about might place her in the wrong. Therefore, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
