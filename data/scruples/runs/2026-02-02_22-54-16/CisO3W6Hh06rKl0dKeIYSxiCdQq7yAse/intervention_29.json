Overall, he\u2019s a great person and I hope that we can stay friends, despite what happened. \n\nBasically, a few weeks ago, we were having drinks at his apartment. He said there was something he wanted to tell me and he hoped I wouldn\u2019t judge. I said okay (obviously nervous). He told me that he thinks he\u2019s bi. I asked what makes him think that and he finally admitted that he had hooked up with a few guys before me. \n\nNow, I just want to clarify that I don\u2019t care if a person is gay, bi, whatever. You only get one life and you should try to find happiness. But I have never (as far as I know) dated a guy who wasn\u2019t straight. So I was a little taken aback. \n\nThe rest of the night was somewhat awkward and we ended up just going to sleep. Over the next several days I started thinking of our relationship. We don\u2019t have sex that often for a young couple. Maybe once a week (always been that way). And when we do have sex I usually initiate. I\u2019m not bothered by the frequency  but I started questioning whether my boyfriend might just be gay and using me to cover that up. I started getting paranoid over whether he\u2019s even attracted to me (he compliments me on my appearance but I\u2019ve never felt...lust). \n\nAnyway I ended up breaking up with him. He said it was because he\u2019s bi and I denied that was the reason. I blamed the break up on some personal stuff I\u2019m going through and said I needed time alone. \n\nBut that was actually a lie. If he hadn\u2019t disclosed that stuff about his sexuality, I have no doubt we\u2019d still be together. I just couldn\u2019t get past it for some reason. \n\nAITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let's start by breaking down the situation. The user is a woman who's been in a two-year relationship with her boyfriend. He comes out as bisexual and admits he's had relationships with men before. She then breaks up with him, but claims it's not directly because of his bisexuality, even though she later admits that's the real reason.\n\nFirst, I should consider the ethics of the breakup. The boyfriend was honest with her about his sexuality. Bisexuality is a valid sexual orientation, and it's not something that should automatically be a deal-breaker. The user says she doesn't have a problem with people being gay or bi, but she's never dated a non-straight person before. She was surprised and a bit uncomfortable, which is understandable, but she ended up using that as the reason to break up.\n\nNow, the boyfriend didn't hide his past. He came clean, which is important in relationships. The user then started questioning the relationship, perhaps due to her own insecurities. She mentions they don't have sex often, and she initiates it. Maybe she felt that he wasn't as attracted to her because he's bi, but that's a projection on her part. She couldn't move past his sexuality, even though she claims she's accepting. That inconsistency might make her the asshole here.\n\nOn the other hand, people have different deal-breakers. If she can't accept someone's bisexuality, even if she says she's okay with it, maybe it's her own issue. Ending the relationship because of his sexual orientation, even if she's not in a monogamous arrangement, could be seen as unfair. But if the relationship was already having issues (low sex frequency, her initiating), maybe those were underlying problems. However, she admits that if he hadn't come out, they'd still be together, so the disclosure was the main reason for the breakup.\n\nSo, is she in the wrong? If she can't accept his bisexuality, even if it's valid, and it's the main reason for the breakup, that could be on her. But if she was honest with herself and felt that it was incompatible, maybe it's not wrong. But the key is that he was honest, and she's using his truth as a reason to break up, which could be seen as being in the wrong. The boyfriend didn't do anything wrong, so if she broke up because of that, she's the one at fault. Hence, the answer might be A.\n"
