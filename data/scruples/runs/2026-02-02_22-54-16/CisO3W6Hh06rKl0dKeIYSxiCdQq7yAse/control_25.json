Overall, he\u2019s a great person and I hope that we can stay friends, despite what happened. \n\nBasically, a few weeks ago, we were having drinks at his apartment. He said there was something he wanted to tell me and he hoped I wouldn\u2019t judge. I said okay (obviously nervous). He told me that he thinks he\u2019s bi. I asked what makes him think that and he finally admitted that he had hooked up with a few guys before me. \n\nNow, I just want to clarify that I don\u2019t care if a person is gay, bi, whatever. You only get one life and you should try to find happiness. But I have never (as far as I know) dated a guy who wasn\u2019t straight. So I was a little taken aback. \n\nThe rest of the night was somewhat awkward and we ended up just going to sleep. Over the next several days I started thinking of our relationship. We don\u2019t have sex that often for a young couple. Maybe once a week (always been that way). And when we do have sex I usually initiate. I\u2019m not bothered by the frequency  but I started questioning whether my boyfriend might just be gay and using me to cover that up. I started getting paranoid over whether he\u2019s even attracted to me (he compliments me on my appearance but I\u2019ve never felt...lust). \n\nAnyway I ended up breaking up with him. He said it was because he\u2019s bi and I denied that was the reason. I blamed the break up on some personal stuff I\u2019m going through and said I needed time alone. \n\nBut that was actually a lie. If he hadn\u2019t disclosed that stuff about his sexuality, I have no doubt we\u2019d still be together. I just couldn\u2019t get past it for some reason. \n\nAITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author broke up with her boyfriend after he told her he's bisexual and had previously hooked up with guys. She says she doesn't care about people's sexuality, but she was taken aback because she's only dated straight guys before. The boyfriend didn't hide his bisexuality; he came out to her. The author breaks up, blames it on personal issues, but later admits it was because of his bisexuality.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The boyfriend was honest about his sexuality. Bisexuality is about attraction to multiple genders, and having past hookups with guys doesn't mean he isn't interested in women. The author's issue isn't with him being bi per se, but maybe with his past actions or her own insecurities about attraction. She mentions they have sex infrequently and she initiates it, but she's unsure if he's even attracted to her. However, he compliments her, so maybe he does find her attractive.\n\nThe author lied about the reason for the breakup. She said it was her personal stuff, but it was actually his sexuality. Breaking up with someone because of their bisexuality, even if you don't hate it, could be problematic. Bisexuality is a valid orientation, and using that as a reason to end a relationship without addressing it openly might be seen as the author's choice based on personal discomfort rather than the boyfriend's wrongdoing.\n\nAlso, the boyfriend didn't hide his identity. He came out to her, which is a positive step. The author's reaction might be based on her own biases or unspoken expectations about what a partner should be. She mentions she's never dated a non-straight guy before, so maybe she wasn't prepared for this. However, that doesn't make her wrong, but it does highlight that the breakup was her decision based on her inability to accept his sexuality, even if she claims she's okay with it.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the boyfriend did the right thing by being honest. The author had the choice to stay or leave. Since she couldn't accept his bisexuality despite her initial statement, some might argue she's in the wrong for ending the relationship on that basis. Others might say it's her right to leave if she's uncomfortable, even if the issue isn't malicious. But the fact that she lied about the reason and felt the need to deflect the real cause might indicate she's aware it's not a valid reason and thus in the wrong.\n"
