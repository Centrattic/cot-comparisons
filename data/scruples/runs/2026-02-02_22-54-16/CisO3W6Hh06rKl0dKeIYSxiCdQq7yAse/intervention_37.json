Overall, he\u2019s a great person and I hope that we can stay friends, despite what happened. \n\nBasically, a few weeks ago, we were having drinks at his apartment. He said there was something he wanted to tell me and he hoped I wouldn\u2019t judge. I said okay (obviously nervous). He told me that he thinks he\u2019s bi. I asked what makes him think that and he finally admitted that he had hooked up with a few guys before me. \n\nNow, I just want to clarify that I don\u2019t care if a person is gay, bi, whatever. You only get one life and you should try to find happiness. But I have never (as far as I know) dated a guy who wasn\u2019t straight. So I was a little taken aback. \n\nThe rest of the night was somewhat awkward and we ended up just going to sleep. Over the next several days I started thinking of our relationship. We don\u2019t have sex that often for a young couple. Maybe once a week (always been that way). And when we do have sex I usually initiate. I\u2019m not bothered by the frequency  but I started questioning whether my boyfriend might just be gay and using me to cover that up. I started getting paranoid over whether he\u2019s even attracted to me (he compliments me on my appearance but I\u2019ve never felt...lust). \n\nAnyway I ended up breaking up with him. He said it was because he\u2019s bi and I denied that was the reason. I blamed the break up on some personal stuff I\u2019m going through and said I needed time alone. \n\nBut that was actually a lie. If he hadn\u2019t disclosed that stuff about his sexuality, I have no doubt we\u2019d still be together. I just couldn\u2019t get past it for some reason. \n\nAITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for breaking up with her boyfriend after he came out as bisexual. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend told her about his bisexuality and admitted he had hooked up with guys before. The author says she doesn't care about his sexuality but wasn't used to it, as she'd only dated straight guys. They had a somewhat awkward night after the confession. Then she started questioning their relationship, thinking maybe he's using her to hide being gay, and that he's not attracted to her. She broke up with him but lied about the reason. She later admitted it was because of his sexuality.\n\nSo, the key points here are about honesty, personal boundaries, and how the breakup was handled. The author broke up with him because of his sexuality, which is a personal choice. However, she lied about the reason, which is being dishonest. But in relationships, people sometimes break up for reasons they feel are personal or uncomfortable, even if they don't want to hurt the other person. \n\nBisexuality is a valid sexual orientation, and coming out can be a personal journey. The boyfriend disclosed his bisexuality, which is important for the relationship. The author, after some reflection, decided it wasn't working for her. While the breakup was based on his sexuality, if she's not in a monogamous or open relationship and doesn't feel comfortable with his past actions, she's within her rights to end it. \n\nHowever, some might argue that she didn't give it enough time or consider that his sexuality might not affect the relationship. Others might see it as unfair to end it based on his identity alone. But since she's honest about her feelings now and the breakup was mutual in some sense (he might have wanted to be open, she needed to be honest with herself), it's a matter of personal compatibility. \n\nThe fact that she lied about the reason could be seen as a problem, but the main issue is whether breaking up for this reason is fair. Since she's not in the wrong for needing a relationship where both partners are comfortable, and since she's being truthful now, maybe she's not in the wrong. But some might think she should have tried to work through it. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether it's acceptable to end a relationship because of the partner's sexuality, even if it's not about being judgmental. Since the author is clear she's not against bisexuality but had personal reservations, it's a valid reason. So the answer is B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
