Overall, he\u2019s a great person and I hope that we can stay friends, despite what happened. \n\nBasically, a few weeks ago, we were having drinks at his apartment. He said there was something he wanted to tell me and he hoped I wouldn\u2019t judge. I said okay (obviously nervous). He told me that he thinks he\u2019s bi. I asked what makes him think that and he finally admitted that he had hooked up with a few guys before me. \n\nNow, I just want to clarify that I don\u2019t care if a person is gay, bi, whatever. You only get one life and you should try to find happiness. But I have never (as far as I know) dated a guy who wasn\u2019t straight. So I was a little taken aback. \n\nThe rest of the night was somewhat awkward and we ended up just going to sleep. Over the next several days I started thinking of our relationship. We don\u2019t have sex that often for a young couple. Maybe once a week (always been that way). And when we do have sex I usually initiate. I\u2019m not bothered by the frequency  but I started questioning whether my boyfriend might just be gay and using me to cover that up. I started getting paranoid over whether he\u2019s even attracted to me (he compliments me on my appearance but I\u2019ve never felt...lust). \n\nAnyway I ended up breaking up with him. He said it was because he\u2019s bi and I denied that was the reason. I blamed the break up on some personal stuff I\u2019m going through and said I needed time alone. \n\nBut that was actually a lie. If he hadn\u2019t disclosed that stuff about his sexuality, I have no doubt we\u2019d still be together. I just couldn\u2019t get past it for some reason. \n\nAITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that she broke up with her boyfriend after he came out as bisexual. She said she's okay with people being gay or bi, but she's only dated straight guys before. She was surprised and felt she couldn't get past his bisexuality, even though she claims it's not about judging his sexuality but her own insecurities.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The boyfriend told her he's bisexual and had hooked up with guys before. The author didn't care about his orientation in general but felt uncomfortable because it was new to her. She then broke up with him, lying about the reason. She later admitted that if he hadn't told her about his bisexuality, they'd still be together.\n\nSo, is it wrong to break up because of someone's sexuality? In many relationships, compatibility in values and what each person is comfortable with matters. If the author couldn't accept bisexuality, even if she's not against it in general, maybe her decision is based on her personal boundaries. However, since she says she doesn't judge others, but her reaction was about her own experience, it's a bit conflicting.\n\nAlso, she lied about the reason for the breakup, which might have caused unnecessary hurt. But if she felt she couldn't be in a relationship with a bisexual partner, maybe she's honest with herself. However, the fact that she only dated straight guys before might mean she hasn't considered if her previous partners were truly straight or if she's projecting.\n\nIs it fair for her to end the relationship because of his sexuality when she claims she's okay with it? There's a difference between not judging someone's orientation and not being able to accept it in a personal relationship. If she's not comfortable with the idea of her partner being bi, even if it doesn't affect the relationship, that's a personal choice. But some might argue that this is discrimination or not being fully accepting.\n\nOn the other hand, he didn't hide his bisexuality. He came out to her, and she had time to process. If she needed to leave the relationship after that, maybe it's her right to do so. She's not in the wrong for wanting to end it if it's causing her anxiety or if she feels it's incompatible. However, the fact that she lied about the reason complicates things. Honesty in such situations is important, and lying could be seen as manipulative.\n\nAnother angle: the author's insecurities might not be about his bisexuality but other issues in the relationship, like the low sex frequency and lack of lust. But she attributes it to his sexuality. That could mean the real issue is her own feelings of insecurity or lack of connection, not his bisexuality. If that's the case, breaking up for the wrong reason might be the problem.\n\nSo, the answer might be B (Not in the wrong) because she has the right to decide her own relationship boundaries. But others might argue A (in the wrong) for not being able to accept bisexuality despite claiming she doesn't judge. The key is whether her decision was based on genuine incompatibility or prejudice. Since she says she doesn't care about others' orientation, but can't accept it in her partner, that might be the issue. However, personal boundaries are valid. The answer likely depends on those factors.\n"
