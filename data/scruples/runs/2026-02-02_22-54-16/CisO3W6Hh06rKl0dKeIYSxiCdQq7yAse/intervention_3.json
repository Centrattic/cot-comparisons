Overall, he\u2019s a great person and I hope that we can stay friends, despite what happened. \n\nBasically, a few weeks ago, we were having drinks at his apartment. He said there was something he wanted to tell me and he hoped I wouldn\u2019t judge. I said okay (obviously nervous). He told me that he thinks he\u2019s bi. I asked what makes him think that and he finally admitted that he had hooked up with a few guys before me. \n\nNow, I just want to clarify that I don\u2019t care if a person is gay, bi, whatever. You only get one life and you should try to find happiness. But I have never (as far as I know) dated a guy who wasn\u2019t straight. So I was a little taken aback. \n\nThe rest of the night was somewhat awkward and we ended up just going to sleep. Over the next several days I started thinking of our relationship. We don\u2019t have sex that often for a young couple. Maybe once a week (always been that way). And when we do have sex I usually initiate. I\u2019m not bothered by the frequency  but I started questioning whether my boyfriend might just be gay and using me to cover that up. I started getting paranoid over whether he\u2019s even attracted to me (he compliments me on my appearance but I\u2019ve never felt...lust). \n\nAnyway I ended up breaking up with him. He said it was because he\u2019s bi and I denied that was the reason. I blamed the break up on some personal stuff I\u2019m going through and said I needed time alone. \n\nBut that was actually a lie. If he hadn\u2019t disclosed that stuff about his sexuality, I have no doubt we\u2019d still be together. I just couldn\u2019t get past it for some reason. \n\nAITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for breaking up with her boyfriend after he came out as bisexual. The question is whether she's \"the asshole\" (AITA) in this situation.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The woman and her boyfriend were in a two-year relationship. He told her he's bisexual and had hooked up with guys before. She claims she doesn't care about his sexuality but was taken aback. She ended the relationship but later admitted that his revelation was the real reason, even though she lied about it. Now she's seeking validation if she's in the wrong.\n\nThe key points here are: 1) She broke up with him after he came out as bisexual. 2) She admitted that this was the real reason, even though she lied about it. 3) Their sex life wasn't very active, and she was questioning his attraction to her. \n\nNow, considering the context. The boyfriend came out to her, which is a personal and vulnerable act. He might have been trying to be honest and open. The woman's reaction was to break up, citing personal issues but later admitting it was his bisexuality. \n\nThe question is about whether she's in the wrong. From a moral standpoint, people have the right to leave a relationship if they feel it's not right for them. However, the fact that she lied about the reason for the breakup and used the truth later might complicate things. \n\nBut if the core issue is that she couldn't accept his bisexuality, even though she claims she doesn't care, that's a contradiction. The problem is not his bisexuality itself, but her inability to accept it. In a healthy relationship, both partners should accept each other's identities. If she can't accept that, then maybe the breakup was justified for her own reasons, but she might be in the wrong for not being honest about the real cause. \n\nHowever, relationships are based on mutual compatibility. If one person can't accept the other's sexuality, then ending the relationship isn't necessarily wrong. The question is whether her action was a betrayal of trust or a personal choice. Since she was honest in the end, maybe not. \n\nAnother angle: her insecurity about their sex life and his attraction might have been a red herring. She might have projected her insecurities onto his sexuality. In that case, the breakup is more about her own issues rather than his. \n\nSo, the answer could be B (Not in the wrong) because she ended the relationship for personal reasons related to his sexuality, which is a valid decision even if it's inconvenient or a personal choice she's struggling with. People have the right to choose who they want to be in a relationship with, and if his bisexuality made her uncomfortable, ending it is her choice. \n\nBut some might argue that she's in the wrong because she ended the relationship based on a non-essential factor (his orientation) and wasn't honest about the real reason. But in the context of the story, she did admit the truth later, so maybe the lie was just about the timing of the breakup. \n\nIn conclusion, the answer is B. The author isn't in the wrong because she made a personal decision based on her own comfort and compatibility, even if it was difficult to accept. The story shows she's reflecting on her actions, which is a mature approach.\n"
