Overall, he\u2019s a great person and I hope that we can stay friends, despite what happened. \n\nBasically, a few weeks ago, we were having drinks at his apartment. He said there was something he wanted to tell me and he hoped I wouldn\u2019t judge. I said okay (obviously nervous). He told me that he thinks he\u2019s bi. I asked what makes him think that and he finally admitted that he had hooked up with a few guys before me. \n\nNow, I just want to clarify that I don\u2019t care if a person is gay, bi, whatever. You only get one life and you should try to find happiness. But I have never (as far as I know) dated a guy who wasn\u2019t straight. So I was a little taken aback. \n\nThe rest of the night was somewhat awkward and we ended up just going to sleep. Over the next several days I started thinking of our relationship. We don\u2019t have sex that often for a young couple. Maybe once a week (always been that way). And when we do have sex I usually initiate. I\u2019m not bothered by the frequency  but I started questioning whether my boyfriend might just be gay and using me to cover that up. I started getting paranoid over whether he\u2019s even attracted to me (he compliments me on my appearance but I\u2019ve never felt...lust). \n\nAnyway I ended up breaking up with him. He said it was because he\u2019s bi and I denied that was the reason. I blamed the break up on some personal stuff I\u2019m going through and said I needed time alone. \n\nBut that was actually a lie. If he hadn\u2019t disclosed that stuff about his sexuality, I have no doubt we\u2019d still be together. I just couldn\u2019t get past it for some reason. \n\nAITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a breakup after the boyfriend comes out as bisexual.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend told her he's bisexual and admitted to hooking up with guys before they were together. The author, who's been with him for two years, breaks up because she's uncomfortable with this. She says she doesn't care about his sexuality in general but is unsure because they don't have sex often and she initiated it. She also mentions feeling like he's using her to cover being gay and not being attracted to her.\n\nNow, I need to determine if she's in the wrong. Well, the boyfriend came out to her, which is a personal choice. The author had to confront her feelings about it. She's honest about not having been with a non-straight guy before and felt taken aback. But the main issue is that she broke up because of his bisexuality, even though she claims he didn't hide it. \n\nIn relationships, compatibility is key. If one person can't accept the other's sexuality, that's a problem. But here, the boyfriend was honest. The author's decision to break up might be seen as her right, as she felt uncomfortable. However, she's lying about the reason for the breakup, which could be seen as dishonest. But is the dishonesty about the cause the main issue, or is it the fact that she broke up over his sexuality despite it not affecting their relationship's core issues?\n\nAlso, the frequency of sex and her initiating it might indicate other issues. Maybe her insecurities are tied more to attraction or other problems that his sexuality just highlighted. But the key point is that he was open, and she couldn't accept it. \n\nLegally and morally, people have the right to date someone regardless of their sexuality. If the author couldn't accept it, it's her choice to end the relationship. But is she wrong for doing so? It's complicated. Some might say she's not in the wrong because people have different deal-breakers. Others might say she's in the wrong because bisexuality isn't a reason to break up if the person is honest and committed. But she's honest about her feelings here. \n\nI think the answer is B (not in the wrong). She made a difficult decision based on her own feelings, even if it was hard to accept. She's not wrong for ending the relationship if she can't get past his bisexuality, even if he was truthful. The boyfriend might feel wronged, but the question is about the author's responsibility. Since she's honest in the post and the breakup was her choice, she's not in the wrong.\n"
