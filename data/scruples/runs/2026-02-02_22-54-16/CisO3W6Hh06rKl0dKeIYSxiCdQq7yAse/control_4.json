Overall, he\u2019s a great person and I hope that we can stay friends, despite what happened. \n\nBasically, a few weeks ago, we were having drinks at his apartment. He said there was something he wanted to tell me and he hoped I wouldn\u2019t judge. I said okay (obviously nervous). He told me that he thinks he\u2019s bi. I asked what makes him think that and he finally admitted that he had hooked up with a few guys before me. \n\nNow, I just want to clarify that I don\u2019t care if a person is gay, bi, whatever. You only get one life and you should try to find happiness. But I have never (as far as I know) dated a guy who wasn\u2019t straight. So I was a little taken aback. \n\nThe rest of the night was somewhat awkward and we ended up just going to sleep. Over the next several days I started thinking of our relationship. We don\u2019t have sex that often for a young couple. Maybe once a week (always been that way). And when we do have sex I usually initiate. I\u2019m not bothered by the frequency  but I started questioning whether my boyfriend might just be gay and using me to cover that up. I started getting paranoid over whether he\u2019s even attracted to me (he compliments me on my appearance but I\u2019ve never felt...lust). \n\nAnyway I ended up breaking up with him. He said it was because he\u2019s bi and I denied that was the reason. I blamed the break up on some personal stuff I\u2019m going through and said I needed time alone. \n\nBut that was actually a lie. If he hadn\u2019t disclosed that stuff about his sexuality, I have no doubt we\u2019d still be together. I just couldn\u2019t get past it for some reason. \n\nAITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who broke up with her boyfriend because he's bisexual is in the wrong. So first, I need to analyze the situation from both sides.\n\nThe main points from the story: The couple has been together for two years. The boyfriend is 24, and he told her he's bisexual and had hooked up with guys before. The author (26M/24F) doesn't care about his sexuality but breaks up because she's worried he's not really into her, given the low sex frequency and her initiating most of the time. She feels conflicted, breaks up, and lies about the reason. Now she's asking if she's at fault.\n\nSo, the key here is whether it's the author's fault. In relationships, compatibility is crucial. The author mentions that she's never dated a non-straight guy before, which might not be a problem in itself. However, the fact that she couldn't handle this new information and broke up because of it might be seen as an issue. But then again, she's allowed to have her own feelings and comfort levels. \n\nBut wait, the breakup was because of his bisexuality, even though she claims she's okay with it. But maybe her underlying issues were that she felt he wasn't really into her, and his bisexuality made her question things. However, the root cause might be the lack of sexual connection rather than his sexuality. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, breaking up because of someone's sexual orientation isn't typically considered the right move, especially if the person is comfortable with it. However, if the relationship wasn't fulfilling for her due to other factors, maybe it's more about compatibility. But the fact that she didn't want to be in a relationship with a bisexual person, even if she says she's okay, suggests that she might have personal issues with it. \n\nAlso, she lied about the reason for the breakup. That adds another layer of dishonesty. If he felt he had to come out to her and then she ended it, maybe he felt betrayed. But she might have felt that her own needs weren't met, so she couldn't continue. \n\nIn many cases, breaking up due to someone's sexuality isn't seen as justified unless there's a fundamental incompatibility. Since she's okay with the concept but couldn't handle the reality, it's more about personal discomfort. Therefore, the author might be at fault for ending the relationship based on the partner's bisexuality, even if it's wrapped in other issues.\n"
