Overall, he\u2019s a great person and I hope that we can stay friends, despite what happened. \n\nBasically, a few weeks ago, we were having drinks at his apartment. He said there was something he wanted to tell me and he hoped I wouldn\u2019t judge. I said okay (obviously nervous). He told me that he thinks he\u2019s bi. I asked what makes him think that and he finally admitted that he had hooked up with a few guys before me. \n\nNow, I just want to clarify that I don\u2019t care if a person is gay, bi, whatever. You only get one life and you should try to find happiness. But I have never (as far as I know) dated a guy who wasn\u2019t straight. So I was a little taken aback. \n\nThe rest of the night was somewhat awkward and we ended up just going to sleep. Over the next several days I started thinking of our relationship. We don\u2019t have sex that often for a young couple. Maybe once a week (always been that way). And when we do have sex I usually initiate. I\u2019m not bothered by the frequency  but I started questioning whether my boyfriend might just be gay and using me to cover that up. I started getting paranoid over whether he\u2019s even attracted to me (he compliments me on my appearance but I\u2019ve never felt...lust). \n\nAnyway I ended up breaking up with him. He said it was because he\u2019s bi and I denied that was the reason. I blamed the break up on some personal stuff I\u2019m going through and said I needed time alone. \n\nBut that was actually a lie. If he hadn\u2019t disclosed that stuff about his sexuality, I have no doubt we\u2019d still be together. I just couldn\u2019t get past it for some reason. \n\nAITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who broke up with their boyfriend after he came out as bisexual is in the wrong. The situation is complicated because the boyfriend had cheated in the past with guys before the relationship, and the author felt uncomfortable, leading to the breakup.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The boyfriend came out as bisexual and admitted to past hookups with men. The author mentions that they aren't judgmental about sexuality in general but had never dated a non-straight person before. The breakup was partly due to the author's discomfort with the boyfriend's bisexuality and possible underlying feelings of being used as a straight cover. \n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, people have different dealbreakers. The author felt they couldn't get past the fact that their partner wasn't straight, even though they claim not to judge. It's possible they realized that their own values or emotional needs weren't being met if the boyfriend wasn't exclusively attracted to women. However, the author lied about the reason for the breakup, which might complicate things. But lying during a breakup can be common if someone doesn't want to hurt the other person's feelings directly.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, if the author's comfort and emotional well-being depend on their partner being exclusively attracted to them, then it's not necessarily wrong to end the relationship. However, the fact that they didn't consider the possibility of an open or non-monogamous relationship might be seen as an issue. But the question is about being in the \"wrong,\" which is subjective. If being with someone who is bisexual makes them uncomfortable, they aren't obligated to stay in the relationship. The boyfriend's past actions (hooking up with guys before) might have already been a red flag for the author, even if they weren't aware of it at first.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would likely be B (the author is not in the wrong). They made a decision based on their own feelings and what they can accept in a relationship. It's a personal choice, and as long as they weren't malicious or deceitful beyond the breakup explanation (which is common), they aren't in the wrong.\n"
