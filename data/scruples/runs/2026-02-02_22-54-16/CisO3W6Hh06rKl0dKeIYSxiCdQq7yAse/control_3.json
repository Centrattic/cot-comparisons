Overall, he\u2019s a great person and I hope that we can stay friends, despite what happened. \n\nBasically, a few weeks ago, we were having drinks at his apartment. He said there was something he wanted to tell me and he hoped I wouldn\u2019t judge. I said okay (obviously nervous). He told me that he thinks he\u2019s bi. I asked what makes him think that and he finally admitted that he had hooked up with a few guys before me. \n\nNow, I just want to clarify that I don\u2019t care if a person is gay, bi, whatever. You only get one life and you should try to find happiness. But I have never (as far as I know) dated a guy who wasn\u2019t straight. So I was a little taken aback. \n\nThe rest of the night was somewhat awkward and we ended up just going to sleep. Over the next several days I started thinking of our relationship. We don\u2019t have sex that often for a young couple. Maybe once a week (always been that way). And when we do have sex I usually initiate. I\u2019m not bothered by the frequency  but I started questioning whether my boyfriend might just be gay and using me to cover that up. I started getting paranoid over whether he\u2019s even attracted to me (he compliments me on my appearance but I\u2019ve never felt...lust). \n\nAnyway I ended up breaking up with him. He said it was because he\u2019s bi and I denied that was the reason. I blamed the break up on some personal stuff I\u2019m going through and said I needed time alone. \n\nBut that was actually a lie. If he hadn\u2019t disclosed that stuff about his sexuality, I have no doubt we\u2019d still be together. I just couldn\u2019t get past it for some reason. \n\nAITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author broke up with her boyfriend after he confessed he's bisexual. They were together for two years. He told her he had hooked up with guys before, which made her uncomfortable. She ended up breaking up because she couldn't get past his bisexuality, even though she claims she doesn't care about his sexuality. She lied about the reason for the breakup, blaming it on her personal issues.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. Bisexuality isn't a dealbreaker for many, but the author had never dated someone not straight before. Her main issues were the lack of frequent sex and her initiating it, leading her to question his attraction. She felt he might be gay and using her. However, he had already had relationships with men before her, so if he were gay, why would he date women? That's a bit confusing. \n\nThe author's problem is her own discomfort with his bisexuality. The fact that she couldn't accept it and lied about the breakup suggests she's in the wrong. People can have valid reasons for breaking up, but if the issue is that his sexuality makes her uncomfortable, that's a personal issue. She's not respecting his identity. Also, he was honest with her, which is a good trait, so her reaction might be unfair. \n\nBut then again, relationships require mutual comfort. If she can't accept his bisexuality, maybe it's not a problem with him but with her. However, the fact that she didn't know how to handle it and let it affect their relationship might make her the one at fault. The community often views being honest about one's sexuality as neutral, so the person who can't accept it might be in the wrong. \n\nAlso, her lie about the reason for the breakup shows she's not being honest, which adds to her fault. The fact that she's lying to protect her ego or to not face her own biases could be seen as wrong. So overall, the answer is A (Yes, she's in the wrong) because she's ending the relationship over something that's valid for him to disclose, and her inability to accept his identity is the core issue.\n"
