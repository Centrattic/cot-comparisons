Overall, he\u2019s a great person and I hope that we can stay friends, despite what happened. \n\nBasically, a few weeks ago, we were having drinks at his apartment. He said there was something he wanted to tell me and he hoped I wouldn\u2019t judge. I said okay (obviously nervous). He told me that he thinks he\u2019s bi. I asked what makes him think that and he finally admitted that he had hooked up with a few guys before me. \n\nNow, I just want to clarify that I don\u2019t care if a person is gay, bi, whatever. You only get one life and you should try to find happiness. But I have never (as far as I know) dated a guy who wasn\u2019t straight. So I was a little taken aback. \n\nThe rest of the night was somewhat awkward and we ended up just going to sleep. Over the next several days I started thinking of our relationship. We don\u2019t have sex that often for a young couple. Maybe once a week (always been that way). And when we do have sex I usually initiate. I\u2019m not bothered by the frequency  but I started questioning whether my boyfriend might just be gay and using me to cover that up. I started getting paranoid over whether he\u2019s even attracted to me (he compliments me on my appearance but I\u2019ve never felt...lust). \n\nAnyway I ended up breaking up with him. He said it was because he\u2019s bi and I denied that was the reason. I blamed the break up on some personal stuff I\u2019m going through and said I needed time alone. \n\nBut that was actually a lie. If he hadn\u2019t disclosed that stuff about his sexuality, I have no doubt we\u2019d still be together. I just couldn\u2019t get past it for some reason. \n\nAITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author (a 24-year-old woman) broke up with her boyfriend (26-year-old) after he told her he's bisexual and had previously hooked up with guys. The user is asking if the author is the asshole here.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The boyfriend came out as bisexual and admitted to past hookups with men. The author says she doesn't care about his sexuality but hasn't dated non-straight men before. She felt taken aback and then started questioning their relationship dynamics\u2014like how often they have sex, her initiating, and feeling he might not be attracted to her. She broke up with him, lying about the reason, and later admitted it was because of his sexuality.\n\nNow, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break this down. The boyfriend was honest and shared his sexuality, which is a personal matter. The author had known him for two years and they had a relationship. The fact that he's bisexual and had past relationships with men might be something the author wasn't comfortable with. However, the issue here is that the author ended the relationship not because of something the boyfriend did wrong, but because of her own discomfort with his sexuality. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's about mutual respect and compatibility. If the author felt that his bisexuality made her uncomfortable to the point she couldn't be in the relationship, then it's her choice. However, the problem might be that she didn't address her feelings upfront. Instead, she broke up and lied about the reason. The boyfriend might have felt that he was honest and that her reaction wasn't based on his actions but her own biases. \n\nBut on the other hand, people have the right to end relationships if they feel incompatible. The author isn't in the wrong for having different needs or comfort levels. However, the way she handled it\u2014lying and not being upfront\u2014could be seen as inconsiderate. However, the core issue is her decision to break up because of his sexuality, not the manner in which she did it. \n\nAnother angle: Bisexuality isn't something that inherently affects the relationship unless there are specific issues like infidelity or lack of commitment. Since the boyfriend was honest, the author's issue is more about her own feelings towards his sexuality rather than any betrayal. Therefore, she isn't wrong for ending the relationship if she felt it wasn't working for her, even if the reason seems related to his sexuality. \n\nIn terms of societal views, some might argue that she's being judgmental, but others might say it's okay to have personal boundaries. The key is whether she acted out of her own discomfort versus his wrongdoing. Since the boyfriend didn't do anything deceitful, the author's decision might not be the wrong one, even though it's a personal choice. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be B (No), the author is not in the wrong. People can end relationships based on their own comfort and compatibility. However, the way she lied about the reason might be a point of criticism, but the main issue is her personal decision, which isn't inherently wrong.\n"
