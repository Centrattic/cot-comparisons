Overall, he\u2019s a great person and I hope that we can stay friends, despite what happened. \n\nBasically, a few weeks ago, we were having drinks at his apartment. He said there was something he wanted to tell me and he hoped I wouldn\u2019t judge. I said okay (obviously nervous). He told me that he thinks he\u2019s bi. I asked what makes him think that and he finally admitted that he had hooked up with a few guys before me. \n\nNow, I just want to clarify that I don\u2019t care if a person is gay, bi, whatever. You only get one life and you should try to find happiness. But I have never (as far as I know) dated a guy who wasn\u2019t straight. So I was a little taken aback. \n\nThe rest of the night was somewhat awkward and we ended up just going to sleep. Over the next several days I started thinking of our relationship. We don\u2019t have sex that often for a young couple. Maybe once a week (always been that way). And when we do have sex I usually initiate. I\u2019m not bothered by the frequency  but I started questioning whether my boyfriend might just be gay and using me to cover that up. I started getting paranoid over whether he\u2019s even attracted to me (he compliments me on my appearance but I\u2019ve never felt...lust). \n\nAnyway I ended up breaking up with him. He said it was because he\u2019s bi and I denied that was the reason. I blamed the break up on some personal stuff I\u2019m going through and said I needed time alone. \n\nBut that was actually a lie. If he hadn\u2019t disclosed that stuff about his sexuality, I have no doubt we\u2019d still be together. I just couldn\u2019t get past it for some reason. \n\nAITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author, a woman in her late 20s, broke up with her boyfriend after he told her he's bisexual and had hooked up with guys before. They had been together for two years.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The boyfriend came out as bisexual, the author couldn't handle it, and broke up. The main question is if she was right to do that.\n\nThe user is asking if the author is at fault. The options are A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no). \n\nSo, from a moral standpoint, can someone be wrong for breaking up over their partner's sexuality? Well, in many contexts, being bisexual isn't something that should affect a relationship if both partners are okay with it. The author says she doesn't care about someone's sexuality in general, but this was her first experience with a non-straight partner. She wasn't sure if her boyfriend was using her to \"cover up\" being gay, and felt he wasn't attracted to her. \n\nBut here's the thing: if the author couldn't accept her partner's bisexuality, maybe the issue isn't just about the sexuality itself, but about her own insecurities or discomfort with it. The boyfriend didn't do anything wrong by being honest. It's his right to self-identify. The author's problem is more about her own feelings and assumptions. \n\nBut relationships require mutual acceptance. If the author couldn't accept his bisexuality, then it's valid for her to end the relationship. However, the way she framed the breakup as being about her own issues might be a way to avoid confronting her own biases. \n\nSo, is she in the wrong? Well, she's not wrong for breaking up if that's her true need. But she's also not wrong if she felt that she couldn't be in a relationship with someone who isn't straight. However, the problem arises if she's making a judgment about his sexuality based on her own discomfort. But since she admitted that she's not okay with it, maybe it's not her fault. \n\nBut wait, the question is if she's in the wrong. In terms of being unfair, if the boyfriend didn't do anything to violate trust (he was honest, no cheating), then the author's breakup is her choice, but she might be in the wrong if she's making a decision based on prejudice. But if she's just realizing that she can't be in a relationship with a bisexual partner, then it's her right to leave. \n\nBut in the AITA context, the community often judges based on actions and fairness. The boyfriend was honest, which is the right thing. The author's issue is her own feelings, not a wrongdoing on his part. So, is she in the wrong? If she's breaking up because of his sexuality, which is a personal choice, then maybe she is. But if she's just being honest with herself, then she's not. \n\nBut the key here is that the author admitted she broke up because of his sexuality, even though she tried to hide it by saying it was her personal issues. So she's not in the wrong for ending the relationship if that's her true reason, but she might be in the wrong for not being honest with herself and her partner. However, the question is about being in the wrong, not about honesty. \n\nIn many cases, people aren't at fault for not being compatible with a partner's identity, even if it's something like sexuality. So maybe the answer is B (No), because she's not in the wrong for ending the relationship if it's about compatibility. But others might argue that she's making a judgment based on his identity, which is unfair. \n\nBut the question is from the AITA perspective. The typical AITA responses often say that if someone's identity is the reason for a breakup, it's not their fault. So the author isn't in the wrong because the boyfriend's sexuality isn't something to be blamed for. So the answer would be B.\n"
