Overall, he\u2019s a great person and I hope that we can stay friends, despite what happened. \n\nBasically, a few weeks ago, we were having drinks at his apartment. He said there was something he wanted to tell me and he hoped I wouldn\u2019t judge. I said okay (obviously nervous). He told me that he thinks he\u2019s bi. I asked what makes him think that and he finally admitted that he had hooked up with a few guys before me. \n\nNow, I just want to clarify that I don\u2019t care if a person is gay, bi, whatever. You only get one life and you should try to find happiness. But I have never (as far as I know) dated a guy who wasn\u2019t straight. So I was a little taken aback. \n\nThe rest of the night was somewhat awkward and we ended up just going to sleep. Over the next several days I started thinking of our relationship. We don\u2019t have sex that often for a young couple. Maybe once a week (always been that way). And when we do have sex I usually initiate. I\u2019m not bothered by the frequency  but I started questioning whether my boyfriend might just be gay and using me to cover that up. I started getting paranoid over whether he\u2019s even attracted to me (he compliments me on my appearance but I\u2019ve never felt...lust). \n\nAnyway I ended up breaking up with him. He said it was because he\u2019s bi and I denied that was the reason. I blamed the break up on some personal stuff I\u2019m going through and said I needed time alone. \n\nBut that was actually a lie. If he hadn\u2019t disclosed that stuff about his sexuality, I have no doubt we\u2019d still be together. I just couldn\u2019t get past it for some reason. \n\nAITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who broke up with her boyfriend after he came out as bisexual is in the wrong. The situation is that the boyfriend told her he's bisexual and had hooked up with guys before. She doesn't care about his sexuality in general but was taken aback because she's only dated straight guys. They had a low sex frequency, with her usually initiating. She started doubting if he was using her to hide being gay and ended up breaking up, lying about the reason.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if her actions were justified. She admitted that his bisexuality was the real reason for the breakup, but she lied and blamed herself. So, is she at fault? Well, she had the right to her feelings. If she felt uncomfortable with his bisexuality and couldn't move past it, breaking up might be her way of protecting herself. However, maybe there's an expectation that she should accept his sexuality without it affecting the relationship. On the other hand, he had been with her for two years without disclosing this, which might have contributed to her paranoia. Did he come out to her at the right time, or was it a shock? Also, the fact that she lied about the breakup reason could be seen as avoiding confrontation, but she felt it was necessary to protect their friendship. \n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, she's honest about her feelings. She might not be in the wrong because she can't force herself to be in a relationship that makes her uncomfortable. However, maybe she could have addressed her concerns more openly. But given the scenario, she made a decision based on her own needs. So, answer B (No) seems appropriate.\n"
