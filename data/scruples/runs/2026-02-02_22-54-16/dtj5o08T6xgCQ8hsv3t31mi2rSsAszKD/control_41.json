A little backstory first, my ex (Rose) and I were together for 5 years, from the ages 18-23. She was my first everything and I was young and stupid. Rose is also the most toxic, self-absorbed and spiteful person I have ever met. I made so many sacrifices for her during our relationship like dropping out of college my sophomore year because she had threatened to leave me for someone who would spend more time with her. Now our break up was messy, she left me for my best friend/ our roommate and they kicked me out of the house we lived in. I ended up having to live out of my car for a few weeks because she had spread lies about to our group of friends saying I had been violent towards and no one would let me stay with them when I had no where to go. During this time of living out of my car she would call me almost every screaming at me to get my stuff out of the house. When I finally found a place to live, I went to the house to get my stuff they called the cops on me saying that I had broken in. which was a huge ordeal where I had to show them messages from her telling me to come over at any time to get my stuff and the lease that I was still on. After 6 months of being alienated and isolated from everyone I had been close to for the last 5 years I moved back in with my mom 3 states away and went back to school.\n\tI am 32 now and, in that time, I graduated college, met an amazing woman, got married and had a kid. I have had no contact Rose since I moved away. From what I\u2019ve gathered through people I know she and the roommate she left me for got really into drugs and partying and broke up less than a year after they started seeing each other. The roommate was never able to quit the drugs and ended up overdosing a few years ago. A few of my old friends eventually apologized for the way they treated me after realizing what type of person Rose really was. She just uses people until they of are no use to her and then she moves on. Last year they even warned me when Rose\u2019s new boyfriend got a job in the city I live in and they were going to move here. I didn\u2019t really worry too much its a huge city and the chances of running into her were very low. \n\ta couple days ago a received a phone from Rose, I have no idea who would give my number to her. In the phone call she was hysterical saying her boyfriend was abusive and she was scared she had no one here and she knows that I hate her but I\u2019m the only person she knows that lives here. I told her she need to call the police or woman\u2019s shelter and to never contact me again, then I blocked the number she called me from. I had decided a long time ago that I would never let this person back into my life. I also haven\u2019t told my wife about this because she is a such a kind and caring person that she would insist that help her and I don\u2019t want Rose anywhere near my family. So am I the asshole for not helping my ex when she had an emergency?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about whether it's okay not to help an ex in an emergency. The user provided a detailed backstory.\n\nFirst, the author and his ex Rose had a toxic 5-year relationship. He dropped out of college because she threatened to leave. Then she left him for his best friend, and the breakup was really messy. He ended up homeless for a while, and she spread lies about him. The cops were called when he tried to get his stuff. After that, he moved back with his mom, got his life together, married, and has a kid now. He's been in contact with her since moving away. \n\nRecently, Rose called him in a panic, saying her boyfriend was abusive and she needed help. He told her to call the police or a shelter and blocked her. He didn't want his wife or family involved because he knows his wife would help her, and he doesn't want Rose near them. \n\nSo, the question is, is the author the asshole for not helping? \n\nI need to consider a few things. First, the history between them. The author has a valid reason to be cautious. Rose has a pattern of toxicity, using people, and betraying him. She's been manipulative and destructive in the past. \n\nIn the situation, Rose is in an abusive relationship. The author didn't ignore her entirely; he gave her advice to contact official help. He didn't provide direct help, but he directed her to the appropriate resources. The issue here is whether he's obligated to help despite their history. \n\nOn one hand, someone in an abusive situation might need support, and cutting off contact entirely could be seen as uncaring. But on the other hand, the author has a history of being harmed by Rose. Trusting her again might risk his family's safety. He's already taken steps to protect his current life, which is understandable. \n\nAdditionally, the author is in a new life with a family. His priority is to protect them from Rose's toxic influence. If he helps her, she might exploit his kindness again, leading to more problems. The advice he gave (calling police/shelter) is the right course of action for someone in danger. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. He made a judgment based on his past experiences to protect himself and his family. He didn't ignore the emergency but directed her to the proper help. The key is that he acted in a way that prevents endangering his current life, which is reasonable given Rose's history.\n"
