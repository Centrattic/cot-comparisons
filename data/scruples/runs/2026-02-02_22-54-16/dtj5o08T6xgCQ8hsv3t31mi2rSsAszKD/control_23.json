A little backstory first, my ex (Rose) and I were together for 5 years, from the ages 18-23. She was my first everything and I was young and stupid. Rose is also the most toxic, self-absorbed and spiteful person I have ever met. I made so many sacrifices for her during our relationship like dropping out of college my sophomore year because she had threatened to leave me for someone who would spend more time with her. Now our break up was messy, she left me for my best friend/ our roommate and they kicked me out of the house we lived in. I ended up having to live out of my car for a few weeks because she had spread lies about to our group of friends saying I had been violent towards and no one would let me stay with them when I had no where to go. During this time of living out of my car she would call me almost every screaming at me to get my stuff out of the house. When I finally found a place to live, I went to the house to get my stuff they called the cops on me saying that I had broken in. which was a huge ordeal where I had to show them messages from her telling me to come over at any time to get my stuff and the lease that I was still on. After 6 months of being alienated and isolated from everyone I had been close to for the last 5 years I moved back in with my mom 3 states away and went back to school.\n\tI am 32 now and, in that time, I graduated college, met an amazing woman, got married and had a kid. I have had no contact Rose since I moved away. From what I\u2019ve gathered through people I know she and the roommate she left me for got really into drugs and partying and broke up less than a year after they started seeing each other. The roommate was never able to quit the drugs and ended up overdosing a few years ago. A few of my old friends eventually apologized for the way they treated me after realizing what type of person Rose really was. She just uses people until they of are no use to her and then she moves on. Last year they even warned me when Rose\u2019s new boyfriend got a job in the city I live in and they were going to move here. I didn\u2019t really worry too much its a huge city and the chances of running into her were very low. \n\ta couple days ago a received a phone from Rose, I have no idea who would give my number to her. In the phone call she was hysterical saying her boyfriend was abusive and she was scared she had no one here and she knows that I hate her but I\u2019m the only person she knows that lives here. I told her she need to call the police or woman\u2019s shelter and to never contact me again, then I blocked the number she called me from. I had decided a long time ago that I would never let this person back into my life. I also haven\u2019t told my wife about this because she is a such a kind and caring person that she would insist that help her and I don\u2019t want Rose anywhere near my family. So am I the asshole for not helping my ex when she had an emergency?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for not helping their ex during an emergency. The situation is complicated, so I need to break it down carefully.\n\nFirst, the background: The author and their ex, Rose, were in a 5-year relationship. The ex was described as toxic, self-absorbed, and spiteful. The breakup was messy, with the ex leaving the author for their best friend and roommate. The author faced a lot of hardship after the breakup, including living out of their car, being called by the police when retrieving belongings, and eventually moving away. Now, the author is 32, married with a kid, and has had no contact with Rose for years.\n\nRecently, Rose called the author in a hysterical state, claiming her boyfriend was abusive and she had no one else. The author told her to call the police or a women's shelter and blocked her number. The author hasn't told their wife about this because they don't want Rose involved in their family life.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong for not helping. Let's consider the factors. \n\nOn one hand, Rose was in what she described as an emergency. If she was genuinely in danger, the author might feel conflicted. However, the author's past experiences with Rose were extremely negative. Rose had a history of manipulation, spreading lies, and using people. The author had decided long ago to cut off contact and protect their new life, especially their family. \n\nThe author's response was to direct Rose to appropriate emergency services (police, shelters) which are the right steps for someone in an abusive situation. The author didn't ignore the situation but instead provided the correct resources. Additionally, the author blocked the number to prevent further contact, which seems like a boundary they needed to set for their own well-being and their family's safety.\n\nIt's also important to note that the author's decision not to inform their wife protects the wife from being dragged into the drama. The wife is described as kind and might feel compelled to help, but the author is prioritizing the safety of their family from someone who has been harmful in the past.\n\nHowever, there's a possible counterpoint: what if Rose wasn't being truthful about the abuse? The author can't verify the legitimacy of her claim. But in an emergency situation, people often reach out to anyone they know, even if it's someone they've been in conflict with. Still, the author's responsibility isn't to validate the claim but to direct her to the right authorities. \n\nConsidering all this, the author acted responsibly by not engaging further and directing Rose to professional help. They also set necessary boundaries to protect themselves and their family. So, the answer would be B (author is not in the wrong).\n"
