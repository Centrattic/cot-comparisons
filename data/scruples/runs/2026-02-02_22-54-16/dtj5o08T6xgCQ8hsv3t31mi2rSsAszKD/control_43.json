A little backstory first, my ex (Rose) and I were together for 5 years, from the ages 18-23. She was my first everything and I was young and stupid. Rose is also the most toxic, self-absorbed and spiteful person I have ever met. I made so many sacrifices for her during our relationship like dropping out of college my sophomore year because she had threatened to leave me for someone who would spend more time with her. Now our break up was messy, she left me for my best friend/ our roommate and they kicked me out of the house we lived in. I ended up having to live out of my car for a few weeks because she had spread lies about to our group of friends saying I had been violent towards and no one would let me stay with them when I had no where to go. During this time of living out of my car she would call me almost every screaming at me to get my stuff out of the house. When I finally found a place to live, I went to the house to get my stuff they called the cops on me saying that I had broken in. which was a huge ordeal where I had to show them messages from her telling me to come over at any time to get my stuff and the lease that I was still on. After 6 months of being alienated and isolated from everyone I had been close to for the last 5 years I moved back in with my mom 3 states away and went back to school.\n\tI am 32 now and, in that time, I graduated college, met an amazing woman, got married and had a kid. I have had no contact Rose since I moved away. From what I\u2019ve gathered through people I know she and the roommate she left me for got really into drugs and partying and broke up less than a year after they started seeing each other. The roommate was never able to quit the drugs and ended up overdosing a few years ago. A few of my old friends eventually apologized for the way they treated me after realizing what type of person Rose really was. She just uses people until they of are no use to her and then she moves on. Last year they even warned me when Rose\u2019s new boyfriend got a job in the city I live in and they were going to move here. I didn\u2019t really worry too much its a huge city and the chances of running into her were very low. \n\ta couple days ago a received a phone from Rose, I have no idea who would give my number to her. In the phone call she was hysterical saying her boyfriend was abusive and she was scared she had no one here and she knows that I hate her but I\u2019m the only person she knows that lives here. I told her she need to call the police or woman\u2019s shelter and to never contact me again, then I blocked the number she called me from. I had decided a long time ago that I would never let this person back into my life. I also haven\u2019t told my wife about this because she is a such a kind and caring person that she would insist that help her and I don\u2019t want Rose anywhere near my family. So am I the asshole for not helping my ex when she had an emergency?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for not helping their ex during an emergency. Let's start by breaking down the situation.\n\nFirst, the backstory: The author had a five-year relationship with Rose, who's described as toxic, self-absorbed, and spiteful. The breakup was messy, and Rose left the author for his best friend. The author faced a lot of hardship, including being isolated, living out of his car, and being called by the police. Eventually, he moved away, started a new life, got married, and has a kid now.\n\nNow, the current situation: Rose calls the author in an emergency, claiming her boyfriend is abusive and she's scared. The author tells her to contact the police or a shelter and blocks her number. He's worried about involving his wife and family, as she might take advantage again.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Let's consider a few points. \n\n1. **Responsibility vs. Personal Boundaries**: The author has moved on with his life and has a family now. He's been through a lot with Rose in the past, including her manipulative behavior. It's reasonable for him to set boundaries to protect himself and his family. \n\n2. **Emergency Response**: Rose's situation is serious\u2014domestic abuse is a critical issue. However, the author is not in a position to provide the necessary support. The right course of action is to direct her to official help services, which he did. He didn't ignore her entirely but advised her to seek professional assistance.\n\n3. **History of Toxic Behavior**: Rose has a pattern of using people and then discarding them. Given this history, the author is justified in not wanting to engage further. Trust is broken, and there's a risk she might exploit his kindness again.\n\n4. **Legal and Ethical Considerations**: The author didn't advise her to stay in danger. He encouraged her to contact authorities, which is the correct step. Legally, he isn't responsible for her actions or outcomes after that.\n\n5. **Emotional Well-being**: The author's mental health and family's safety are priorities. Opening up to Rose could disrupt their lives, especially since she's in a new city. Prioritizing their well-being is reasonable.\n\nPotential counterarguments: Some might say he should have offered more help, like connecting her to local shelters or ensuring she actually got help. However, considering their history and the potential for manipulation, it's safer for him to maintain distance. Also, he didn't have a current relationship or responsibility towards her.\n\nIn conclusion, the author acted within his rights to set boundaries. He provided the necessary advice and blocked her to protect himself and his family. His actions align with protecting his well-being without enabling past harmful behavior.\n"
