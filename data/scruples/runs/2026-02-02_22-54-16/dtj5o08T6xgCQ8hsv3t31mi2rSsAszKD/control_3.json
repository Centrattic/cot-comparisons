A little backstory first, my ex (Rose) and I were together for 5 years, from the ages 18-23. She was my first everything and I was young and stupid. Rose is also the most toxic, self-absorbed and spiteful person I have ever met. I made so many sacrifices for her during our relationship like dropping out of college my sophomore year because she had threatened to leave me for someone who would spend more time with her. Now our break up was messy, she left me for my best friend/ our roommate and they kicked me out of the house we lived in. I ended up having to live out of my car for a few weeks because she had spread lies about to our group of friends saying I had been violent towards and no one would let me stay with them when I had no where to go. During this time of living out of my car she would call me almost every screaming at me to get my stuff out of the house. When I finally found a place to live, I went to the house to get my stuff they called the cops on me saying that I had broken in. which was a huge ordeal where I had to show them messages from her telling me to come over at any time to get my stuff and the lease that I was still on. After 6 months of being alienated and isolated from everyone I had been close to for the last 5 years I moved back in with my mom 3 states away and went back to school.\n\tI am 32 now and, in that time, I graduated college, met an amazing woman, got married and had a kid. I have had no contact Rose since I moved away. From what I\u2019ve gathered through people I know she and the roommate she left me for got really into drugs and partying and broke up less than a year after they started seeing each other. The roommate was never able to quit the drugs and ended up overdosing a few years ago. A few of my old friends eventually apologized for the way they treated me after realizing what type of person Rose really was. She just uses people until they of are no use to her and then she moves on. Last year they even warned me when Rose\u2019s new boyfriend got a job in the city I live in and they were going to move here. I didn\u2019t really worry too much its a huge city and the chances of running into her were very low. \n\ta couple days ago a received a phone from Rose, I have no idea who would give my number to her. In the phone call she was hysterical saying her boyfriend was abusive and she was scared she had no one here and she knows that I hate her but I\u2019m the only person she knows that lives here. I told her she need to call the police or woman\u2019s shelter and to never contact me again, then I blocked the number she called me from. I had decided a long time ago that I would never let this person back into my life. I also haven\u2019t told my wife about this because she is a such a kind and caring person that she would insist that help her and I don\u2019t want Rose anywhere near my family. So am I the asshole for not helping my ex when she had an emergency?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not helping their ex during an emergency. The story is pretty detailed. The author and their ex, Rose, were in a 5-year relationship from 18-23. The author mentions that Rose was toxic, self-absorbed, and spiteful. They dropped out of college because she threatened to leave them, and the breakup was messy. Rose left the author for their roommate/best friend, spread lies about them leading to being kicked out and living in their car. The ex kept calling to yell at them to get their stuff out, then called the cops when the author tried to retrieve it. After 6 months, the author moved back in with their mom and eventually moved on, getting married and having a kid.\n\nNow, Rose contacts them again, out of the blue, saying her new boyfriend is abusive and she needs help. The author tells her to call the police or a shelter and blocks her. They haven't told their wife about this because they don't want Rose near their family. The user is asking if the author is the asshole here.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the situation. The key points are the toxic past, the history of abuse from the ex (including emotional, maybe even legal harassment), and the current emergency. The author is in a good place now, with a family, and wants to cut ties.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit tricky. The author is not obligated to help someone who has been so harmful to them. But when someone is in an emergency, like a domestic abuse situation, it's generally considered important to ensure they get help. The author did direct her to appropriate services (police, shelter) and didn't ignore it. They also have a valid reason for not wanting contact\u2014past trauma and the risk to their family.\n\nHowever, some might argue that even if the ex was toxic, if there's a genuine emergency, you should offer help. But the author is concerned about safety, both their own and their family's. Also, the ex has a history of manipulation, so the author is cautious about being drawn back in. The author's response was to provide the necessary resources and set a boundary, which is a reasonable approach given the history.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. They handled it by ensuring the ex knew where to get help without compromising their own well-being. The answer should be B.\n"
