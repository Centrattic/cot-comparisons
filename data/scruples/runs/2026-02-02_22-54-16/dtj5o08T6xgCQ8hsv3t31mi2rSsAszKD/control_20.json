A little backstory first, my ex (Rose) and I were together for 5 years, from the ages 18-23. She was my first everything and I was young and stupid. Rose is also the most toxic, self-absorbed and spiteful person I have ever met. I made so many sacrifices for her during our relationship like dropping out of college my sophomore year because she had threatened to leave me for someone who would spend more time with her. Now our break up was messy, she left me for my best friend/ our roommate and they kicked me out of the house we lived in. I ended up having to live out of my car for a few weeks because she had spread lies about to our group of friends saying I had been violent towards and no one would let me stay with them when I had no where to go. During this time of living out of my car she would call me almost every screaming at me to get my stuff out of the house. When I finally found a place to live, I went to the house to get my stuff they called the cops on me saying that I had broken in. which was a huge ordeal where I had to show them messages from her telling me to come over at any time to get my stuff and the lease that I was still on. After 6 months of being alienated and isolated from everyone I had been close to for the last 5 years I moved back in with my mom 3 states away and went back to school.\n\tI am 32 now and, in that time, I graduated college, met an amazing woman, got married and had a kid. I have had no contact Rose since I moved away. From what I\u2019ve gathered through people I know she and the roommate she left me for got really into drugs and partying and broke up less than a year after they started seeing each other. The roommate was never able to quit the drugs and ended up overdosing a few years ago. A few of my old friends eventually apologized for the way they treated me after realizing what type of person Rose really was. She just uses people until they of are no use to her and then she moves on. Last year they even warned me when Rose\u2019s new boyfriend got a job in the city I live in and they were going to move here. I didn\u2019t really worry too much its a huge city and the chances of running into her were very low. \n\ta couple days ago a received a phone from Rose, I have no idea who would give my number to her. In the phone call she was hysterical saying her boyfriend was abusive and she was scared she had no one here and she knows that I hate her but I\u2019m the only person she knows that lives here. I told her she need to call the police or woman\u2019s shelter and to never contact me again, then I blocked the number she called me from. I had decided a long time ago that I would never let this person back into my life. I also haven\u2019t told my wife about this because she is a such a kind and caring person that she would insist that help her and I don\u2019t want Rose anywhere near my family. So am I the asshole for not helping my ex when she had an emergency?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for not helping their ex during an emergency. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the background: the author and his ex, Rose, were in a 5-year relationship that ended messily. Rose was described as toxic, self-absorbed, and spiteful. When they broke up, she left him for his best friend and roommate, which led to him being homeless for a while. She spread lies about him, causing friends to turn against him. There was even a confrontation where the police were called. He eventually moved back in with his mom, graduated college, married, had a kid, and is now in a better place.\n\nNow, Rose contacts him out of the blue, saying her boyfriend is abusive and she's scared. He tells her to call the police or a shelter and then blocks her. He hasn't told his wife about this because he's worried she'd insist on helping, and he wants to protect his family from Rose.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for not helping. Let me consider the points. Rose's past behavior was extremely toxic and manipulative. She used people, lied, and caused him a lot of harm. The author has moved on, built a new life, and has a family now. Helping her could expose his family to someone who has a history of causing trouble. He directed her to appropriate resources (police, shelters) which are the right steps for emergencies like domestic abuse. \n\nHowever, some might argue that even if someone has a bad past, if they're in immediate danger, you should help regardless. But given the history here, it's understandable that the author is cautious. He's protecting himself and his family from potential manipulation or further harm. \n\nThe key factors here are the history of abuse and toxicity from Rose, the author's valid concerns for his family's safety, and the fact that he did suggest professional help. The author isn't ignoring an emergency but redirecting her to the right channels. So, he's not in the wrong for prioritizing his safety and that of his family over engaging with someone who has a history of being harmful.\n"
