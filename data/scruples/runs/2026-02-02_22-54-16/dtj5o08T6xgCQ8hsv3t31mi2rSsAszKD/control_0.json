A little backstory first, my ex (Rose) and I were together for 5 years, from the ages 18-23. She was my first everything and I was young and stupid. Rose is also the most toxic, self-absorbed and spiteful person I have ever met. I made so many sacrifices for her during our relationship like dropping out of college my sophomore year because she had threatened to leave me for someone who would spend more time with her. Now our break up was messy, she left me for my best friend/ our roommate and they kicked me out of the house we lived in. I ended up having to live out of my car for a few weeks because she had spread lies about to our group of friends saying I had been violent towards and no one would let me stay with them when I had no where to go. During this time of living out of my car she would call me almost every screaming at me to get my stuff out of the house. When I finally found a place to live, I went to the house to get my stuff they called the cops on me saying that I had broken in. which was a huge ordeal where I had to show them messages from her telling me to come over at any time to get my stuff and the lease that I was still on. After 6 months of being alienated and isolated from everyone I had been close to for the last 5 years I moved back in with my mom 3 states away and went back to school.\n\tI am 32 now and, in that time, I graduated college, met an amazing woman, got married and had a kid. I have had no contact Rose since I moved away. From what I\u2019ve gathered through people I know she and the roommate she left me for got really into drugs and partying and broke up less than a year after they started seeing each other. The roommate was never able to quit the drugs and ended up overdosing a few years ago. A few of my old friends eventually apologized for the way they treated me after realizing what type of person Rose really was. She just uses people until they of are no use to her and then she moves on. Last year they even warned me when Rose\u2019s new boyfriend got a job in the city I live in and they were going to move here. I didn\u2019t really worry too much its a huge city and the chances of running into her were very low. \n\ta couple days ago a received a phone from Rose, I have no idea who would give my number to her. In the phone call she was hysterical saying her boyfriend was abusive and she was scared she had no one here and she knows that I hate her but I\u2019m the only person she knows that lives here. I told her she need to call the police or woman\u2019s shelter and to never contact me again, then I blocked the number she called me from. I had decided a long time ago that I would never let this person back into my life. I also haven\u2019t told my wife about this because she is a such a kind and caring person that she would insist that help her and I don\u2019t want Rose anywhere near my family. So am I the asshole for not helping my ex when she had an emergency?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the ex-girlfriend, Rose, called him in an emergency, claiming her new boyfriend was abusive and she had no one to turn to. He told her to contact the police or a shelter and then blocked her. The question is whether he's an a**hole for not helping.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The relationship history is really important here. The author describes Rose as toxic, self-absorbed, and spiteful. During their 5-year relationship, she was manipulative, caused him to drop out of college, and after the breakup, she spread lies about him, leading to him being isolated and even living out of his car. The breakup was messy, with her taking his stuff and calling the cops when he tried to retrieve his belongings. He eventually moved away, started a new life, got married, and has a kid now.\n\nSo, when Rose reaches out in this emergency, he's had a lot of negative experiences with her. He's made a conscious decision to cut her out of his life to protect his current family. He didn't help directly, directing her to authorities instead. The key points here are his past trauma and the fact that he's protecting his new life.\n\nBut the counterargument might be that even if she was toxic, she was in an emergency. Should he have helped her regardless? However, he did offer the appropriate resources (police, shelters), which are the right avenues for emergencies. He didn't ignore her entirely but gave her the necessary information. Plus, considering her history of manipulation and his need to protect his family, it's understandable he doesn't want her involved.\n\nAnother angle is the potential for her to be in genuine danger. But the author didn't confirm if she actually was in danger; he only got her side. Without verification, getting involved could be risky, especially given her past behavior. Also, contacting him was probably through old connections, and he had the right to set boundaries.\n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, while it's good to help others, it's also okay to prioritize one's own well-being and family's safety, especially after a history of abuse. The author isn't ignoring the situation entirely but is directing her to professional help. So, he's taking responsible action without engaging in a way that could jeopardize his current life.\n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong. His actions are justified given the context of his past with Rose and his need to protect his family.\n"
