A little backstory first, my ex (Rose) and I were together for 5 years, from the ages 18-23. She was my first everything and I was young and stupid. Rose is also the most toxic, self-absorbed and spiteful person I have ever met. I made so many sacrifices for her during our relationship like dropping out of college my sophomore year because she had threatened to leave me for someone who would spend more time with her. Now our break up was messy, she left me for my best friend/ our roommate and they kicked me out of the house we lived in. I ended up having to live out of my car for a few weeks because she had spread lies about to our group of friends saying I had been violent towards and no one would let me stay with them when I had no where to go. During this time of living out of my car she would call me almost every screaming at me to get my stuff out of the house. When I finally found a place to live, I went to the house to get my stuff they called the cops on me saying that I had broken in. which was a huge ordeal where I had to show them messages from her telling me to come over at any time to get my stuff and the lease that I was still on. After 6 months of being alienated and isolated from everyone I had been close to for the last 5 years I moved back in with my mom 3 states away and went back to school.\n\tI am 32 now and, in that time, I graduated college, met an amazing woman, got married and had a kid. I have had no contact Rose since I moved away. From what I\u2019ve gathered through people I know she and the roommate she left me for got really into drugs and partying and broke up less than a year after they started seeing each other. The roommate was never able to quit the drugs and ended up overdosing a few years ago. A few of my old friends eventually apologized for the way they treated me after realizing what type of person Rose really was. She just uses people until they of are no use to her and then she moves on. Last year they even warned me when Rose\u2019s new boyfriend got a job in the city I live in and they were going to move here. I didn\u2019t really worry too much its a huge city and the chances of running into her were very low. \n\ta couple days ago a received a phone from Rose, I have no idea who would give my number to her. In the phone call she was hysterical saying her boyfriend was abusive and she was scared she had no one here and she knows that I hate her but I\u2019m the only person she knows that lives here. I told her she need to call the police or woman\u2019s shelter and to never contact me again, then I blocked the number she called me from. I had decided a long time ago that I would never let this person back into my life. I also haven\u2019t told my wife about this because she is a such a kind and caring person that she would insist that help her and I don\u2019t want Rose anywhere near my family. So am I the asshole for not helping my ex when she had an emergency?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not helping their ex during an emergency. The situation is complex, with a history of abuse and toxicity.\n\nFirst, the author and his ex had a five-year relationship ending messily. The ex was described as toxic and self-absorbed. The breakup involved betrayal, lies, and even legal issues. The author ended up homeless for a while and had to move back in with his mom. He's now 32, married, and has a kid. He's completely cut off contact with the ex, who he knows uses people and then discards them. \n\nNow, the ex contacts him out of the blue, claiming her new boyfriend is abusive. He tells her to contact the police or a shelter and blocks her. He didn't involve his wife because he knows she'd be kind and might help, but he doesn't want the ex near his family. The question is whether he's in the wrong for not helping.\n\nI need to consider a few factors. First, the ex's history of manipulation and using people. The author has a valid reason to be cautious. Helping her might put him and his family at risk, especially given her past behavior. Also, the proper authorities (police, shelters) are the correct resources for an emergency like domestic abuse. The author directed her there, which is responsible. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that even if there's a history of issues, someone in an emergency might need immediate help. But the author didn't have a direct way to help and chose to not engage, which could be seen as cutting off someone who might need support. However, given the ex's history, the author's decision to protect himself and his family is understandable. \n\nThe key points are the ex's toxic behavior, the author's justified trauma and need to protect his current family, and the fact that he directed her to appropriate resources. So, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
