A little backstory first, my ex (Rose) and I were together for 5 years, from the ages 18-23. She was my first everything and I was young and stupid. Rose is also the most toxic, self-absorbed and spiteful person I have ever met. I made so many sacrifices for her during our relationship like dropping out of college my sophomore year because she had threatened to leave me for someone who would spend more time with her. Now our break up was messy, she left me for my best friend/ our roommate and they kicked me out of the house we lived in. I ended up having to live out of my car for a few weeks because she had spread lies about to our group of friends saying I had been violent towards and no one would let me stay with them when I had no where to go. During this time of living out of my car she would call me almost every screaming at me to get my stuff out of the house. When I finally found a place to live, I went to the house to get my stuff they called the cops on me saying that I had broken in. which was a huge ordeal where I had to show them messages from her telling me to come over at any time to get my stuff and the lease that I was still on. After 6 months of being alienated and isolated from everyone I had been close to for the last 5 years I moved back in with my mom 3 states away and went back to school.\n\tI am 32 now and, in that time, I graduated college, met an amazing woman, got married and had a kid. I have had no contact Rose since I moved away. From what I\u2019ve gathered through people I know she and the roommate she left me for got really into drugs and partying and broke up less than a year after they started seeing each other. The roommate was never able to quit the drugs and ended up overdosing a few years ago. A few of my old friends eventually apologized for the way they treated me after realizing what type of person Rose really was. She just uses people until they of are no use to her and then she moves on. Last year they even warned me when Rose\u2019s new boyfriend got a job in the city I live in and they were going to move here. I didn\u2019t really worry too much its a huge city and the chances of running into her were very low. \n\ta couple days ago a received a phone from Rose, I have no idea who would give my number to her. In the phone call she was hysterical saying her boyfriend was abusive and she was scared she had no one here and she knows that I hate her but I\u2019m the only person she knows that lives here. I told her she need to call the police or woman\u2019s shelter and to never contact me again, then I blocked the number she called me from. I had decided a long time ago that I would never let this person back into my life. I also haven\u2019t told my wife about this because she is a such a kind and caring person that she would insist that help her and I don\u2019t want Rose anywhere near my family. So am I the asshole for not helping my ex when she had an emergency?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not helping their ex during an emergency. The situation is pretty complex.\n\nFirst, the backstory: the ex, Rose, was described as toxic, self-absorbed, and spiteful. The author had a very toxic relationship, making sacrifices like dropping out of college. The breakup was messy; Rose left for the author's best friend, spread lies about the author being violent, leading to him living in his car and being alienated. The author eventually moved away, started a new life, got married, and has a kid. \n\nNow, Rose calls him out of the blue, saying her boyfriend is abusive, and asks for help. The author tells her to contact the police or shelters and blocks her number. He's worried about involving his wife, who might insist on helping, and doesn't want Rose near his family. The question is whether he's an asshole for not helping.\n\nFrom the information given, the author has a history of being wronged by Rose. She's shown manipulative and harmful behavior, using people until they're no longer useful. The author has made a conscious decision to cut her out of his life for his own well-being and his family's. By advising her to contact the police and shelters, he's directing her to the appropriate resources, which is a responsible action. \n\nThe author isn't ignoring the emergency entirely; he's not saying she doesn't exist or that her situation isn't real. Instead, he's pointing her to the correct channels for help. Considering his past experiences and the potential for Rose to exploit him again, his decision to block her and not involve his family is understandable. \n\nIt's also important to note that the author is protecting his new life and family from someone who has caused significant harm before. The wife's kindness is a factor here, but the author's judgment about Rose's character might be valid. The main ethical point is whether the author should help someone who has been toxic and manipulative, especially when there's a risk of reopening old wounds or being taken advantage of again.\n\nIn terms of accountability, the author isn't refusing help without offering any support. He's directing her to professional resources, which is the right approach. The key here is that he's not in a position to provide the help she needs, especially considering their history. The author's actions are self-protective and responsible given the circumstances. Therefore, the answer would be B, he's not in the wrong.\n"
