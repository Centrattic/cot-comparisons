A little backstory first, my ex (Rose) and I were together for 5 years, from the ages 18-23. She was my first everything and I was young and stupid. Rose is also the most toxic, self-absorbed and spiteful person I have ever met. I made so many sacrifices for her during our relationship like dropping out of college my sophomore year because she had threatened to leave me for someone who would spend more time with her. Now our break up was messy, she left me for my best friend/ our roommate and they kicked me out of the house we lived in. I ended up having to live out of my car for a few weeks because she had spread lies about to our group of friends saying I had been violent towards and no one would let me stay with them when I had no where to go. During this time of living out of my car she would call me almost every screaming at me to get my stuff out of the house. When I finally found a place to live, I went to the house to get my stuff they called the cops on me saying that I had broken in. which was a huge ordeal where I had to show them messages from her telling me to come over at any time to get my stuff and the lease that I was still on. After 6 months of being alienated and isolated from everyone I had been close to for the last 5 years I moved back in with my mom 3 states away and went back to school.\n\tI am 32 now and, in that time, I graduated college, met an amazing woman, got married and had a kid. I have had no contact Rose since I moved away. From what I\u2019ve gathered through people I know she and the roommate she left me for got really into drugs and partying and broke up less than a year after they started seeing each other. The roommate was never able to quit the drugs and ended up overdosing a few years ago. A few of my old friends eventually apologized for the way they treated me after realizing what type of person Rose really was. She just uses people until they of are no use to her and then she moves on. Last year they even warned me when Rose\u2019s new boyfriend got a job in the city I live in and they were going to move here. I didn\u2019t really worry too much its a huge city and the chances of running into her were very low. \n\ta couple days ago a received a phone from Rose, I have no idea who would give my number to her. In the phone call she was hysterical saying her boyfriend was abusive and she was scared she had no one here and she knows that I hate her but I\u2019m the only person she knows that lives here. I told her she need to call the police or woman\u2019s shelter and to never contact me again, then I blocked the number she called me from. I had decided a long time ago that I would never let this person back into my life. I also haven\u2019t told my wife about this because she is a such a kind and caring person that she would insist that help her and I don\u2019t want Rose anywhere near my family. So am I the asshole for not helping my ex when she had an emergency?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this situation. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not helping their ex during an emergency. The key points here are the history between the two. The author and Rose were in a 5-year relationship that ended very messily. Rose was described as toxic, self-absorbed, and spiteful. The author made significant sacrifices, like dropping out of college, and after the breakup, faced a lot of isolation and even ended up homeless for a while. Rose was a big part of causing that hardship by spreading lies and calling the police.\n\nNow, years later, the author has moved on, got married, and has a kid. They've had no contact with Rose since moving away. Recently, Rose calls out of nowhere, in a state of panic, claiming her new boyfriend is abusive and she needs help. The author tells her to contact the police or a shelter and then blocks her number.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context of their past. The author has a valid reason to be wary of Rose given the history of manipulation and abuse they experienced. Rose's behavior has been harmful and self-serving, using people until they're of no use. The author's decision to cut off contact is a form of self-protection, especially after the trauma they went through.\n\nNext, the emergency situation. Rose is in a potentially dangerous situation, but the author is cautious. The question is whether the author has a moral obligation to help despite their past. On one hand, emergency situations usually require people to come together. But on the other hand, the author has a right to protect their own safety and well-being, especially with their new family. They don't want their wife and child involved with someone who has a history of causing harm.\n\nThe author advised Rose to call the police or a shelter, which are the appropriate authorities for such emergencies. That's a responsible action. Blocking her number after that is a way to prevent further contact, which is understandable given Rose's manipulative tendencies. The author isn't ignoring the situation entirely; they're directing her to the right resources.\n\nAnother angle is the potential risk of helping someone who has a history of being toxic. If Rose's claims are genuine, then the police or shelters are better equipped to handle it. If she's lying, the author could be setting themselves up for another manipulative ploy. The author's past experiences justify their skepticism.\n\nAlso, considering the emotional impact on the author's new family. The author is protecting their current life from the chaos of their past. The wife's kind nature could make her a target for manipulation if Rose were to get involved, so the author is acting in their family's best interest by not involving them.\n\nIn terms of societal expectations, there's a balance between helping others in need and protecting oneself from toxic relationships. The author isn't refusing to help entirely\u2014they\u2019re pointing her to the right resources. They\u2019re not in a position where they have to personally intervene, especially given the history. The key here is that the author is prioritizing their own well-being and safety, which is a valid choice.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. Their actions are a form of self-preservation and protecting their current family from the negative influence of their past. They\u2019re also directing the ex to the appropriate help, which is the responsible thing to do without overstepping into personal involvement.\n"
