A little backstory first, my ex (Rose) and I were together for 5 years, from the ages 18-23. She was my first everything and I was young and stupid. Rose is also the most toxic, self-absorbed and spiteful person I have ever met. I made so many sacrifices for her during our relationship like dropping out of college my sophomore year because she had threatened to leave me for someone who would spend more time with her. Now our break up was messy, she left me for my best friend/ our roommate and they kicked me out of the house we lived in. I ended up having to live out of my car for a few weeks because she had spread lies about to our group of friends saying I had been violent towards and no one would let me stay with them when I had no where to go. During this time of living out of my car she would call me almost every screaming at me to get my stuff out of the house. When I finally found a place to live, I went to the house to get my stuff they called the cops on me saying that I had broken in. which was a huge ordeal where I had to show them messages from her telling me to come over at any time to get my stuff and the lease that I was still on. After 6 months of being alienated and isolated from everyone I had been close to for the last 5 years I moved back in with my mom 3 states away and went back to school.\n\tI am 32 now and, in that time, I graduated college, met an amazing woman, got married and had a kid. I have had no contact Rose since I moved away. From what I\u2019ve gathered through people I know she and the roommate she left me for got really into drugs and partying and broke up less than a year after they started seeing each other. The roommate was never able to quit the drugs and ended up overdosing a few years ago. A few of my old friends eventually apologized for the way they treated me after realizing what type of person Rose really was. She just uses people until they of are no use to her and then she moves on. Last year they even warned me when Rose\u2019s new boyfriend got a job in the city I live in and they were going to move here. I didn\u2019t really worry too much its a huge city and the chances of running into her were very low. \n\ta couple days ago a received a phone from Rose, I have no idea who would give my number to her. In the phone call she was hysterical saying her boyfriend was abusive and she was scared she had no one here and she knows that I hate her but I\u2019m the only person she knows that lives here. I told her she need to call the police or woman\u2019s shelter and to never contact me again, then I blocked the number she called me from. I had decided a long time ago that I would never let this person back into my life. I also haven\u2019t told my wife about this because she is a such a kind and caring person that she would insist that help her and I don\u2019t want Rose anywhere near my family. So am I the asshole for not helping my ex when she had an emergency?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the person (AITA) didn't help their ex-girlfriend, Rose, who called them in a state of emergency, claiming her boyfriend is abusive and she has no one to turn to. The AITA is conflicted because they have a history of a very toxic relationship, and they've been estranged for a long time. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the background. The user and Rose were together for five years, but the relationship was toxic. The user dropped out of college because Rose threatened to leave. The breakup was really messy\u2014Rose left the author for the best friend, who then kicked the author out of their shared house, leading to the author living in their car. The ex also spread lies, causing the author to be isolated. The author had a hard time, moving back with their mom and then eventually moving on with life, getting married and having a kid.\n\nNow, Rose calls the author, who hasn't heard from her in years, in a panic about an abusive situation. The author tells her to call the police or a shelter and blocks her number. The author is concerned that helping Rose might involve their wife and family, which they don't want because of Rose's toxic history. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for not helping. \n\nOn one hand, people might argue that in an emergency, you should help regardless of past issues. But on the other hand, the author has a valid reason to be cautious. Rose has a history of manipulation and using people. The author has been burned before, and there's a risk that Rose might not genuinely need help but is using the situation to get attention or manipulate the author again. \n\nAlso, the author is protecting their current family, which is important. The wife is kind and might not see the danger, so the author's decision to not involve her makes sense. \n\nHowever, the ethical aspect is that if someone is in a true emergency, like domestic abuse, the right thing would be to encourage them to contact authorities or shelters, which the author did. The author didn't ignore the situation entirely but directed Rose to the right resources. So maybe they are not in the wrong because they did the responsible thing without getting involved personally. \n\nBut some might say that the author could have done more, like contacting a shelter on her behalf or ensuring she actually got help. However, without knowing if Rose followed through, the author can't force her to take action. \n\nGiven the history, I think the author is justified in not wanting to help directly, especially given Rose's past behavior. The author's actions were appropriate given the circumstances. So the answer is B (not in the wrong).\n"
