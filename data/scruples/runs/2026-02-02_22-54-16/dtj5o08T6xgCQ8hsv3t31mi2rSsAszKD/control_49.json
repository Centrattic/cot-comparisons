A little backstory first, my ex (Rose) and I were together for 5 years, from the ages 18-23. She was my first everything and I was young and stupid. Rose is also the most toxic, self-absorbed and spiteful person I have ever met. I made so many sacrifices for her during our relationship like dropping out of college my sophomore year because she had threatened to leave me for someone who would spend more time with her. Now our break up was messy, she left me for my best friend/ our roommate and they kicked me out of the house we lived in. I ended up having to live out of my car for a few weeks because she had spread lies about to our group of friends saying I had been violent towards and no one would let me stay with them when I had no where to go. During this time of living out of my car she would call me almost every screaming at me to get my stuff out of the house. When I finally found a place to live, I went to the house to get my stuff they called the cops on me saying that I had broken in. which was a huge ordeal where I had to show them messages from her telling me to come over at any time to get my stuff and the lease that I was still on. After 6 months of being alienated and isolated from everyone I had been close to for the last 5 years I moved back in with my mom 3 states away and went back to school.\n\tI am 32 now and, in that time, I graduated college, met an amazing woman, got married and had a kid. I have had no contact Rose since I moved away. From what I\u2019ve gathered through people I know she and the roommate she left me for got really into drugs and partying and broke up less than a year after they started seeing each other. The roommate was never able to quit the drugs and ended up overdosing a few years ago. A few of my old friends eventually apologized for the way they treated me after realizing what type of person Rose really was. She just uses people until they of are no use to her and then she moves on. Last year they even warned me when Rose\u2019s new boyfriend got a job in the city I live in and they were going to move here. I didn\u2019t really worry too much its a huge city and the chances of running into her were very low. \n\ta couple days ago a received a phone from Rose, I have no idea who would give my number to her. In the phone call she was hysterical saying her boyfriend was abusive and she was scared she had no one here and she knows that I hate her but I\u2019m the only person she knows that lives here. I told her she need to call the police or woman\u2019s shelter and to never contact me again, then I blocked the number she called me from. I had decided a long time ago that I would never let this person back into my life. I also haven\u2019t told my wife about this because she is a such a kind and caring person that she would insist that help her and I don\u2019t want Rose anywhere near my family. So am I the asshole for not helping my ex when she had an emergency?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not helping their ex during an emergency. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nFirst, the backstory: The ex, Rose, was described as toxic, self-absorbed, and spiteful. The author had a five-year relationship where they made significant sacrifices, like dropping out of college. The breakup was messy, with Rose leaving the author for the best friend and spreading lies about them, leading to the author living in their car and being called into a police situation. The author eventually moved away, started a new life, married, and has a kid. They've had no contact with Rose since.\n\nNow, Rose calls the author, saying her new boyfriend is abusive and she needs help. The author tells her to contact the police or a shelter and blocks her number. The author is worried that if their wife knows, she'd insist on helping, so they kept it secret.\n\nThe key points here are the nature of the relationship, the history of abuse and toxicity from Rose's side, and the author's decision to cut off contact. The user is asking if the author is the asshole for not helping.\n\nI need to consider if the author has a moral obligation to help someone who has been so hurtful. The author has already been through a lot with Rose, and she has a pattern of using people and then moving on. The author's decision to block her number and not get involved could be seen as self-preservation, especially given the history of manipulation and lies.\n\nHowever, one could argue that if someone is in an emergency, the right thing to do is help regardless of past issues. But Rose was the one contacting the author, and the author directed her to proper authorities. The author didn't ignore the emergency but suggested official resources. Also, the author is protecting their new family from a potentially harmful person.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author's actions seem justified given the context. They've already taken steps to protect themselves and their new life. The fact that Rose has a history of causing trouble and the author is trying to avoid that cycle again supports the author's decision. The author isn't ignoring the emergency but is instead guiding her to the right help without getting personally involved, which is reasonable considering the past.\n\nSo, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong). They have a valid reason to cut off contact, especially with the history provided. Helping someone in an emergency is important, but it's also about personal boundaries and safety, which the author is maintaining here.\n"
