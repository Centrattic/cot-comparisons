A little backstory first, my ex (Rose) and I were together for 5 years, from the ages 18-23. She was my first everything and I was young and stupid. Rose is also the most toxic, self-absorbed and spiteful person I have ever met. I made so many sacrifices for her during our relationship like dropping out of college my sophomore year because she had threatened to leave me for someone who would spend more time with her. Now our break up was messy, she left me for my best friend/ our roommate and they kicked me out of the house we lived in. I ended up having to live out of my car for a few weeks because she had spread lies about to our group of friends saying I had been violent towards and no one would let me stay with them when I had no where to go. During this time of living out of my car she would call me almost every screaming at me to get my stuff out of the house. When I finally found a place to live, I went to the house to get my stuff they called the cops on me saying that I had broken in. which was a huge ordeal where I had to show them messages from her telling me to come over at any time to get my stuff and the lease that I was still on. After 6 months of being alienated and isolated from everyone I had been close to for the last 5 years I moved back in with my mom 3 states away and went back to school.\n\tI am 32 now and, in that time, I graduated college, met an amazing woman, got married and had a kid. I have had no contact Rose since I moved away. From what I\u2019ve gathered through people I know she and the roommate she left me for got really into drugs and partying and broke up less than a year after they started seeing each other. The roommate was never able to quit the drugs and ended up overdosing a few years ago. A few of my old friends eventually apologized for the way they treated me after realizing what type of person Rose really was. She just uses people until they of are no use to her and then she moves on. Last year they even warned me when Rose\u2019s new boyfriend got a job in the city I live in and they were going to move here. I didn\u2019t really worry too much its a huge city and the chances of running into her were very low. \n\ta couple days ago a received a phone from Rose, I have no idea who would give my number to her. In the phone call she was hysterical saying her boyfriend was abusive and she was scared she had no one here and she knows that I hate her but I\u2019m the only person she knows that lives here. I told her she need to call the police or woman\u2019s shelter and to never contact me again, then I blocked the number she called me from. I had decided a long time ago that I would never let this person back into my life. I also haven\u2019t told my wife about this because she is a such a kind and caring person that she would insist that help her and I don\u2019t want Rose anywhere near my family. So am I the asshole for not helping my ex when she had an emergency?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not helping his ex during an emergency. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the backstory: They were in a 5-year relationship that ended messily. The ex was described as toxic, self-absorbed, and spiteful. The author dropped out of college because she threatened to leave him. Then she left him for his roommate, who kicked him out, leading to him living in his car. She spread lies, causing him to be isolated. There was a legal issue when he tried to retrieve his stuff. He eventually moved back in with his mom, got his life together, married, and has a kid. He's been cutting off contact with her for years. \n\nNow, she contacts him out of the blue, saying her boyfriend is abusive and she needs help. He tells her to contact police or a shelter and blocks her. He didn't tell his wife, fearing she'd want to help and that he doesn't want Rose near his family.\n\nThe question is whether he's the asshole. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the author has a history of being mistreated by Rose. She used people and then discarded them. He's protected himself and his new family from her negative influence. His actions were to prioritize his safety and his family's well-being. While it's true that in an emergency, ideally someone would help, the context here is crucial. Rose has a history of manipulation and causing harm. The author is also taking steps to prevent further entanglement, which is reasonable given past experiences. \n\nHe advised her to contact authorities, which are the appropriate resources. Blocking her number is a way to cut off contact, which he had resolved to do. Not involving his wife makes sense to protect her from potential conflict or Rose's manipulative behavior. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. He's protecting himself and his family from someone who has historically been harmful. The answer should be B.\n"
