A little backstory first, my ex (Rose) and I were together for 5 years, from the ages 18-23. She was my first everything and I was young and stupid. Rose is also the most toxic, self-absorbed and spiteful person I have ever met. I made so many sacrifices for her during our relationship like dropping out of college my sophomore year because she had threatened to leave me for someone who would spend more time with her. Now our break up was messy, she left me for my best friend/ our roommate and they kicked me out of the house we lived in. I ended up having to live out of my car for a few weeks because she had spread lies about to our group of friends saying I had been violent towards and no one would let me stay with them when I had no where to go. During this time of living out of my car she would call me almost every screaming at me to get my stuff out of the house. When I finally found a place to live, I went to the house to get my stuff they called the cops on me saying that I had broken in. which was a huge ordeal where I had to show them messages from her telling me to come over at any time to get my stuff and the lease that I was still on. After 6 months of being alienated and isolated from everyone I had been close to for the last 5 years I moved back in with my mom 3 states away and went back to school.\n\tI am 32 now and, in that time, I graduated college, met an amazing woman, got married and had a kid. I have had no contact Rose since I moved away. From what I\u2019ve gathered through people I know she and the roommate she left me for got really into drugs and partying and broke up less than a year after they started seeing each other. The roommate was never able to quit the drugs and ended up overdosing a few years ago. A few of my old friends eventually apologized for the way they treated me after realizing what type of person Rose really was. She just uses people until they of are no use to her and then she moves on. Last year they even warned me when Rose\u2019s new boyfriend got a job in the city I live in and they were going to move here. I didn\u2019t really worry too much its a huge city and the chances of running into her were very low. \n\ta couple days ago a received a phone from Rose, I have no idea who would give my number to her. In the phone call she was hysterical saying her boyfriend was abusive and she was scared she had no one here and she knows that I hate her but I\u2019m the only person she knows that lives here. I told her she need to call the police or woman\u2019s shelter and to never contact me again, then I blocked the number she called me from. I had decided a long time ago that I would never let this person back into my life. I also haven\u2019t told my wife about this because she is a such a kind and caring person that she would insist that help her and I don\u2019t want Rose anywhere near my family. So am I the asshole for not helping my ex when she had an emergency?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not helping their ex during an emergency. The situation is pretty complex. The author had a toxic 5-year relationship with Rose, who was very self-absorbed and manipulative. After the breakup, Rose spread lies, led to the author living in their car, and there were legal issues when the author tried to get their stuff back. The author managed to move on, get married, have a kid, and is now in a good place. \n\nThen, Rose contacts the author, saying her new boyfriend is abusive and she needs help. The author directs her to call the police or a shelter and blocks her number. The author is concerned that their wife, who's kind, would want to help, but they don't want Rose near their family.\n\nSo, the key points here: The author has a history of being harmed by Rose's manipulative and toxic behavior. They've made a conscious decision to cut off contact. Rose's current situation is an emergency, but the author didn't directly help, instead suggesting she contact the authorities.\n\nI need to consider if there's an obligation to help someone in an emergency, even if they're a former toxic partner. In many places, the Good Samaritan laws don't require you to help unless you're a professional caregiver or have a specific duty. So, the author isn't legally obligated. Ethically, it's tricky. The author has no duty to help, especially given the history. They also have their own family to protect. The author did suggest she contact the police or shelter, which are appropriate resources. Blocking the number after that is a way to prevent future contact, which makes sense given the past.\n\nRose's claims need to be taken seriously as a possible domestic abuse situation, but the author isn't in a position to intervene directly. They can't be held responsible for Rose's actions afterward. The author's main wrong would be if they ignored a direct threat to someone's safety, but since they provided resources, they did their part. So, the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
