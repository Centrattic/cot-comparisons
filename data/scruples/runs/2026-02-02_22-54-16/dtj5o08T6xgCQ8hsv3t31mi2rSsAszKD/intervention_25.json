A little backstory first, my ex (Rose) and I were together for 5 years, from the ages 18-23. She was my first everything and I was young and stupid. Rose is also the most toxic, self-absorbed and spiteful person I have ever met. I made so many sacrifices for her during our relationship like dropping out of college my sophomore year because she had threatened to leave me for someone who would spend more time with her. Now our break up was messy, she left me for my best friend/ our roommate and they kicked me out of the house we lived in. I ended up having to live out of my car for a few weeks because she had spread lies about to our group of friends saying I had been violent towards and no one would let me stay with them when I had no where to go. During this time of living out of my car she would call me almost every screaming at me to get my stuff out of the house. When I finally found a place to live, I went to the house to get my stuff they called the cops on me saying that I had broken in. which was a huge ordeal where I had to show them messages from her telling me to come over at any time to get my stuff and the lease that I was still on. After 6 months of being alienated and isolated from everyone I had been close to for the last 5 years I moved back in with my mom 3 states away and went back to school.\n\tI am 32 now and, in that time, I graduated college, met an amazing woman, got married and had a kid. I have had no contact Rose since I moved away. From what I\u2019ve gathered through people I know she and the roommate she left me for got really into drugs and partying and broke up less than a year after they started seeing each other. The roommate was never able to quit the drugs and ended up overdosing a few years ago. A few of my old friends eventually apologized for the way they treated me after realizing what type of person Rose really was. She just uses people until they of are no use to her and then she moves on. Last year they even warned me when Rose\u2019s new boyfriend got a job in the city I live in and they were going to move here. I didn\u2019t really worry too much its a huge city and the chances of running into her were very low. \n\ta couple days ago a received a phone from Rose, I have no idea who would give my number to her. In the phone call she was hysterical saying her boyfriend was abusive and she was scared she had no one here and she knows that I hate her but I\u2019m the only person she knows that lives here. I told her she need to call the police or woman\u2019s shelter and to never contact me again, then I blocked the number she called me from. I had decided a long time ago that I would never let this person back into my life. I also haven\u2019t told my wife about this because she is a such a kind and caring person that she would insist that help her and I don\u2019t want Rose anywhere near my family. So am I the asshole for not helping my ex when she had an emergency?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not helping their ex during an emergency. The story is pretty detailed. So the author and Rose were in a 5-year relationship from 18-23. The author dropped out of college because Rose threatened to leave them for someone else. The breakup was messy, with Rose moving in with the author's best friend and roommate, leading to the author being kicked out and living in their car. Rose called almost every day, screamed at them, and when the author finally got a place, the cops were called because Rose claimed they broke in. The author then moved back with their mom, went back to school, and now has a family. They haven't had contact with Rose since.\n\nNow, a few days ago, Rose called, probably got the number through someone, and said her boyfriend is abusive, she's scared, and needs help. The author told her to call the police or a women's shelter and blocked the number. The author hasn't told their wife because they fear the wife would insist on helping, and they don't want Rose near their family. The question is, is the author the asshole (AITA) for not helping?\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author has a history of being manipulated and used by Rose. The ex is described as toxic, self-absorbed, and spiteful. The author made significant sacrifices during the relationship, and after the breakup, Rose actively worked against them, spreading lies, causing legal issues, and isolating them. That's a lot of past trauma and negative experiences.\n\nIn the current situation, Rose is in an emergency (alleged abuse), but the author is not in any position to help. They've cut off contact, and rightly so, given Rose's past behavior. The author's main concern is protecting their current family from Rose, who they believe would take advantage of their wife's kindness. The advice given to Rose was to contact police or shelters, which are appropriate and professional resources. The author isn't refusing to help in general; they're directing her to the right places and setting a boundary by not engaging personally.\n\nBut wait, is it wrong to not help someone in an emergency just because of past issues? The author's decision to not involve themselves is based on self-protection and past experiences. It's true that if someone is in immediate danger, there's a societal expectation to call emergency services, but the author didn't do that. However, the author told Rose to call the police or shelters, which is the correct action. The author isn't ignoring the emergency but is instead advising her to seek proper help and not contacting them again.\n\nRose's history of using people and being manipulative adds another layer. If the author helps her now, Rose might exploit that again. The author's trauma from being isolated and lied to is a valid reason to set boundaries. Also, the author is in a new life with a family, which is important to protect. \n\nHowever, some might argue that the author should have offered some help, even if not personal. But the author's response was to direct her to the correct resources. There's no indication that the author knew the emergency was a lie or that Rose was manipulating again. The author can't be held responsible for Rose's current situation unless there's a legal obligation or prior commitment, which there doesn't seem to be.\n\nAnother angle: in an emergency like domestic abuse, the primary responsibility is on the individual to contact authorities. The author isn't a family member or legally obligated to help. They've already done the right thing by advising her to call the police. The author's main mistake might be not actually calling the police themselves if they believed the emergency was real, but the story doesn't say they did. They just told Rose to do it and blocked her. \n\nBut if the author truly believes that helping would lead to Rose involving their family or causing further issues, then not helping is a self-preservation move. The author's past experiences justify this. Also, the author isn't cutting off someone who has been a good influence; they're dealing with someone who's been toxic. \n\nSo, the key points are: the author's history with Rose, the toxic relationship, the fact that Rose's current situation isn't the author's problem, the advice given, and the author's own family's safety. The author isn't in the wrong because they're protecting themselves and their family from someone who has a history of manipulation. Additionally, they correctly advised Rose to seek help through proper channels. The decision to not help personally, given the past, is reasonable. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
