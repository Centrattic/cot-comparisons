A little backstory first, my ex (Rose) and I were together for 5 years, from the ages 18-23. She was my first everything and I was young and stupid. Rose is also the most toxic, self-absorbed and spiteful person I have ever met. I made so many sacrifices for her during our relationship like dropping out of college my sophomore year because she had threatened to leave me for someone who would spend more time with her. Now our break up was messy, she left me for my best friend/ our roommate and they kicked me out of the house we lived in. I ended up having to live out of my car for a few weeks because she had spread lies about to our group of friends saying I had been violent towards and no one would let me stay with them when I had no where to go. During this time of living out of my car she would call me almost every screaming at me to get my stuff out of the house. When I finally found a place to live, I went to the house to get my stuff they called the cops on me saying that I had broken in. which was a huge ordeal where I had to show them messages from her telling me to come over at any time to get my stuff and the lease that I was still on. After 6 months of being alienated and isolated from everyone I had been close to for the last 5 years I moved back in with my mom 3 states away and went back to school.\n\tI am 32 now and, in that time, I graduated college, met an amazing woman, got married and had a kid. I have had no contact Rose since I moved away. From what I\u2019ve gathered through people I know she and the roommate she left me for got really into drugs and partying and broke up less than a year after they started seeing each other. The roommate was never able to quit the drugs and ended up overdosing a few years ago. A few of my old friends eventually apologized for the way they treated me after realizing what type of person Rose really was. She just uses people until they of are no use to her and then she moves on. Last year they even warned me when Rose\u2019s new boyfriend got a job in the city I live in and they were going to move here. I didn\u2019t really worry too much its a huge city and the chances of running into her were very low. \n\ta couple days ago a received a phone from Rose, I have no idea who would give my number to her. In the phone call she was hysterical saying her boyfriend was abusive and she was scared she had no one here and she knows that I hate her but I\u2019m the only person she knows that lives here. I told her she need to call the police or woman\u2019s shelter and to never contact me again, then I blocked the number she called me from. I had decided a long time ago that I would never let this person back into my life. I also haven\u2019t told my wife about this because she is a such a kind and caring person that she would insist that help her and I don\u2019t want Rose anywhere near my family. So am I the asshole for not helping my ex when she had an emergency?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not helping their ex during an emergency. The situation is pretty complex.\n\nFirst, the backstory: The author and their ex, Rose, were in a 5-year relationship from 18-23. The author dropped out of college because Rose threatened to leave. That's a big sacrifice. Then the breakup was messy\u2014Rose left the author for the best friend, who then kicked them out. The author ended up living in their car, and Rose spread lies about them to friends, leading to being called the cops on. After 6 months isolated, the author moved back with their mom, went back to school, graduated, married, and had a kid. They cut off contact with Rose entirely since then.\n\nNow, Rose calls the author, saying her boyfriend is abusive and she's in an emergency. The author tells her to call the police or a shelter and blocks her number. The author hasn't told their wife because they fear she'd want to help, and they don't want Rose near their family. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nSo, the author is in a position where they've been deeply hurt by Rose. She was toxic and manipulative, used people, and caused a lot of harm. The author decided to cut her out of their life for good, which is understandable given the history. When Rose reaches out in an emergency, the author's response is to direct her to appropriate help and not to get involved. The author is protecting their current family from a person who's been harmful in the past.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that even if Rose is a bad person, she's in a crisis and might need support. But considering the history of abuse and manipulation, the author isn't responsible for helping her. They did suggest she seek help through the right channels. Also, the author didn't have a way to know if it was a real emergency, and Rose might be trying to manipulate again. The author's boundaries are important here, especially after such a traumatic experience. Not helping doesn't make them an asshole; they're prioritizing their own well-being and family's safety. So, answer B (No).\n"
