A little backstory first, my ex (Rose) and I were together for 5 years, from the ages 18-23. She was my first everything and I was young and stupid. Rose is also the most toxic, self-absorbed and spiteful person I have ever met. I made so many sacrifices for her during our relationship like dropping out of college my sophomore year because she had threatened to leave me for someone who would spend more time with her. Now our break up was messy, she left me for my best friend/ our roommate and they kicked me out of the house we lived in. I ended up having to live out of my car for a few weeks because she had spread lies about to our group of friends saying I had been violent towards and no one would let me stay with them when I had no where to go. During this time of living out of my car she would call me almost every screaming at me to get my stuff out of the house. When I finally found a place to live, I went to the house to get my stuff they called the cops on me saying that I had broken in. which was a huge ordeal where I had to show them messages from her telling me to come over at any time to get my stuff and the lease that I was still on. After 6 months of being alienated and isolated from everyone I had been close to for the last 5 years I moved back in with my mom 3 states away and went back to school.\n\tI am 32 now and, in that time, I graduated college, met an amazing woman, got married and had a kid. I have had no contact Rose since I moved away. From what I\u2019ve gathered through people I know she and the roommate she left me for got really into drugs and partying and broke up less than a year after they started seeing each other. The roommate was never able to quit the drugs and ended up overdosing a few years ago. A few of my old friends eventually apologized for the way they treated me after realizing what type of person Rose really was. She just uses people until they of are no use to her and then she moves on. Last year they even warned me when Rose\u2019s new boyfriend got a job in the city I live in and they were going to move here. I didn\u2019t really worry too much its a huge city and the chances of running into her were very low. \n\ta couple days ago a received a phone from Rose, I have no idea who would give my number to her. In the phone call she was hysterical saying her boyfriend was abusive and she was scared she had no one here and she knows that I hate her but I\u2019m the only person she knows that lives here. I told her she need to call the police or woman\u2019s shelter and to never contact me again, then I blocked the number she called me from. I had decided a long time ago that I would never let this person back into my life. I also haven\u2019t told my wife about this because she is a such a kind and caring person that she would insist that help her and I don\u2019t want Rose anywhere near my family. So am I the asshole for not helping my ex when she had an emergency?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not helping their ex during an emergency. The situation is pretty complex.\n\nFirst, the backstory: the author and his ex, Rose, were in a toxic 5-year relationship. He dropped out of college to accommodate her, and their breakup was really messy. She cheated with his best friend, spread lies about him, leading to him living in his car and being isolated. There were legal issues when he tried to retrieve his stuff. He moved away, rebuilt his life, got married, and is now happy with a child. \n\nNow, Rose contacts him out of the blue, says her boyfriend is abusive, and he tells her to call the police or a shelter. He blocks her number immediately. He doesn't want to involve his wife or family because he knows she's manipulative. The question is whether he's the asshole for not helping.\n\nI need to consider if he's in the wrong. On one hand, she was in an emergency situation. But on the other hand, their history is full of manipulation, abuse, and betrayal. He's made a conscious decision to cut her out of his life for his own well-being and that of his family. By telling her to contact proper authorities, he's not ignoring her; he's directing her to the right help. \n\nThe key points here are the history of abuse and the fact that he's already taken steps to protect himself and his new family. He's not refusing to help in a general sense, but specifically refusing to let her re-enter his life because he knows her tendencies. The authorities (police, shelters) are the appropriate resources for such emergencies. \n\nHe did the right thing by not engaging further and instead encouraging her to use the correct support systems. His actions were self-preservation after a history of being used and harmed. Therefore, he's not in the wrong.\n"
