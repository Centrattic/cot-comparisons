A little backstory first, my ex (Rose) and I were together for 5 years, from the ages 18-23. She was my first everything and I was young and stupid. Rose is also the most toxic, self-absorbed and spiteful person I have ever met. I made so many sacrifices for her during our relationship like dropping out of college my sophomore year because she had threatened to leave me for someone who would spend more time with her. Now our break up was messy, she left me for my best friend/ our roommate and they kicked me out of the house we lived in. I ended up having to live out of my car for a few weeks because she had spread lies about to our group of friends saying I had been violent towards and no one would let me stay with them when I had no where to go. During this time of living out of my car she would call me almost every screaming at me to get my stuff out of the house. When I finally found a place to live, I went to the house to get my stuff they called the cops on me saying that I had broken in. which was a huge ordeal where I had to show them messages from her telling me to come over at any time to get my stuff and the lease that I was still on. After 6 months of being alienated and isolated from everyone I had been close to for the last 5 years I moved back in with my mom 3 states away and went back to school.\n\tI am 32 now and, in that time, I graduated college, met an amazing woman, got married and had a kid. I have had no contact Rose since I moved away. From what I\u2019ve gathered through people I know she and the roommate she left me for got really into drugs and partying and broke up less than a year after they started seeing each other. The roommate was never able to quit the drugs and ended up overdosing a few years ago. A few of my old friends eventually apologized for the way they treated me after realizing what type of person Rose really was. She just uses people until they of are no use to her and then she moves on. Last year they even warned me when Rose\u2019s new boyfriend got a job in the city I live in and they were going to move here. I didn\u2019t really worry too much its a huge city and the chances of running into her were very low. \n\ta couple days ago a received a phone from Rose, I have no idea who would give my number to her. In the phone call she was hysterical saying her boyfriend was abusive and she was scared she had no one here and she knows that I hate her but I\u2019m the only person she knows that lives here. I told her she need to call the police or woman\u2019s shelter and to never contact me again, then I blocked the number she called me from. I had decided a long time ago that I would never let this person back into my life. I also haven\u2019t told my wife about this because she is a such a kind and caring person that she would insist that help her and I don\u2019t want Rose anywhere near my family. So am I the asshole for not helping my ex when she had an emergency?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author did the right thing here. So, the situation is that his ex, Rose, called him in an emergency\u2014she said her boyfriend was abusive and she had no one. He told her to call the police or a shelter and then blocked her. He hasn't spoken to her in years and has a new family now. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the history between them. The user mentioned that Rose was toxic, self-absorbed, and spiteful. He had a really hard time after the breakup, living out of his car, being alienated by friends, and even had the cops called on him. He's moved on, has a new life with a wife and kid. He's been in contact with others who warned him about Rose's new boyfriend moving to the area. \n\nSo, when she calls him in an emergency, he's in a position where he doesn't want to be involved anymore. He's made a conscious decision to cut her out of his life for his own well-being and his family's. He advised her to contact the appropriate authorities, which is the correct course of action for someone in a domestic emergency. \n\nBut some might argue that he could have offered more help, like offering a safe place or supporting her. However, given the history, it's understandable that he doesn't want to help her. He's protecting himself and his new family from someone who's caused him so much harm. Also, Rose had a tendency to use people until they were no longer useful, which suggests she might not have been a reliable or trustworthy person. \n\nThe key points here are the history of abuse and toxicity, the author's own history of being used and mistreated by Rose, and the fact that he directed her to the right emergency services. Helping someone in an abusive situation can be tricky, especially if there's a history of harmful behavior. The author didn't ignore her entirely; he gave her the necessary resources and then set boundaries by blocking her. \n\nConsidering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. He's prioritizing his safety and family's safety, which is a valid and responsible choice given the circumstances.\n"
