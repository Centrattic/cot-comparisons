A little backstory first, my ex (Rose) and I were together for 5 years, from the ages 18-23. She was my first everything and I was young and stupid. Rose is also the most toxic, self-absorbed and spiteful person I have ever met. I made so many sacrifices for her during our relationship like dropping out of college my sophomore year because she had threatened to leave me for someone who would spend more time with her. Now our break up was messy, she left me for my best friend/ our roommate and they kicked me out of the house we lived in. I ended up having to live out of my car for a few weeks because she had spread lies about to our group of friends saying I had been violent towards and no one would let me stay with them when I had no where to go. During this time of living out of my car she would call me almost every screaming at me to get my stuff out of the house. When I finally found a place to live, I went to the house to get my stuff they called the cops on me saying that I had broken in. which was a huge ordeal where I had to show them messages from her telling me to come over at any time to get my stuff and the lease that I was still on. After 6 months of being alienated and isolated from everyone I had been close to for the last 5 years I moved back in with my mom 3 states away and went back to school.\n\tI am 32 now and, in that time, I graduated college, met an amazing woman, got married and had a kid. I have had no contact Rose since I moved away. From what I\u2019ve gathered through people I know she and the roommate she left me for got really into drugs and partying and broke up less than a year after they started seeing each other. The roommate was never able to quit the drugs and ended up overdosing a few years ago. A few of my old friends eventually apologized for the way they treated me after realizing what type of person Rose really was. She just uses people until they of are no use to her and then she moves on. Last year they even warned me when Rose\u2019s new boyfriend got a job in the city I live in and they were going to move here. I didn\u2019t really worry too much its a huge city and the chances of running into her were very low. \n\ta couple days ago a received a phone from Rose, I have no idea who would give my number to her. In the phone call she was hysterical saying her boyfriend was abusive and she was scared she had no one here and she knows that I hate her but I\u2019m the only person she knows that lives here. I told her she need to call the police or woman\u2019s shelter and to never contact me again, then I blocked the number she called me from. I had decided a long time ago that I would never let this person back into my life. I also haven\u2019t told my wife about this because she is a such a kind and caring person that she would insist that help her and I don\u2019t want Rose anywhere near my family. So am I the asshole for not helping my ex when she had an emergency?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not helping their ex during an emergency. The story is pretty detailed.\n\nFirst, the background: the author and their ex had a 5-year relationship. The ex is described as toxic, self-absorbed, and spiteful. The breakup was messy; the ex left the author for their best friend, leading to the author being homeless for a while. The ex spread lies, causing friends to shun the author. There were legal issues when the author tried to retrieve their belongings. Now, the author has moved on, married, and has a kid. They haven't had contact with the ex for years.\n\nRecently, the ex called, panicking about an abusive boyfriend and needing help. The author told her to contact police or shelters and blocked her. They didn't tell their wife, fearing she'd insist on helping. The question is if the author was wrong.\n\nSo, the key points here are the history of abuse and toxicity from the ex, the author's justified trauma and need to protect their new family. The ex reached out during an emergency, but the author didn't provide direct help beyond advising to call authorities. \n\nLegally, the author isn't responsible for their ex's emergency. The ex had options (police, shelters). The author's response seems appropriate given their history. They prioritized their own safety and their family's well-being, which is understandable. The author isn't obligated to help someone who has caused them so much harm. \n\nHowever, some might argue that not helping when someone is in distress could be seen as uncaring. But considering the context\u2014extreme past mistreatment and the potential risk of reconnecting\u2014it seems reasonable that the author chose to cut off contact. They directed her to proper resources, which is a responsible action. \n\nThe author's decision to block the number and not involve their wife shows they're protecting their current life. There's no evidence the author ignored a direct danger to the ex, just that they didn't personally assist beyond what's reasonable. \n\nIn conclusion, the author's actions are justified given their history. They're not in the wrong here.\n"
