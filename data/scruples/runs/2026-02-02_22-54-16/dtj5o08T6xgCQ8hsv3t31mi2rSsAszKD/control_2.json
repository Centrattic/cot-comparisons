A little backstory first, my ex (Rose) and I were together for 5 years, from the ages 18-23. She was my first everything and I was young and stupid. Rose is also the most toxic, self-absorbed and spiteful person I have ever met. I made so many sacrifices for her during our relationship like dropping out of college my sophomore year because she had threatened to leave me for someone who would spend more time with her. Now our break up was messy, she left me for my best friend/ our roommate and they kicked me out of the house we lived in. I ended up having to live out of my car for a few weeks because she had spread lies about to our group of friends saying I had been violent towards and no one would let me stay with them when I had no where to go. During this time of living out of my car she would call me almost every screaming at me to get my stuff out of the house. When I finally found a place to live, I went to the house to get my stuff they called the cops on me saying that I had broken in. which was a huge ordeal where I had to show them messages from her telling me to come over at any time to get my stuff and the lease that I was still on. After 6 months of being alienated and isolated from everyone I had been close to for the last 5 years I moved back in with my mom 3 states away and went back to school.\n\tI am 32 now and, in that time, I graduated college, met an amazing woman, got married and had a kid. I have had no contact Rose since I moved away. From what I\u2019ve gathered through people I know she and the roommate she left me for got really into drugs and partying and broke up less than a year after they started seeing each other. The roommate was never able to quit the drugs and ended up overdosing a few years ago. A few of my old friends eventually apologized for the way they treated me after realizing what type of person Rose really was. She just uses people until they of are no use to her and then she moves on. Last year they even warned me when Rose\u2019s new boyfriend got a job in the city I live in and they were going to move here. I didn\u2019t really worry too much its a huge city and the chances of running into her were very low. \n\ta couple days ago a received a phone from Rose, I have no idea who would give my number to her. In the phone call she was hysterical saying her boyfriend was abusive and she was scared she had no one here and she knows that I hate her but I\u2019m the only person she knows that lives here. I told her she need to call the police or woman\u2019s shelter and to never contact me again, then I blocked the number she called me from. I had decided a long time ago that I would never let this person back into my life. I also haven\u2019t told my wife about this because she is a such a kind and caring person that she would insist that help her and I don\u2019t want Rose anywhere near my family. So am I the asshole for not helping my ex when she had an emergency?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not helping their ex-girlfriend during an emergency. The scenario is pretty detailed. \n\nFirst, the ex, Rose, is described as toxic, self-absorbed, and spiteful. The author had a five-year relationship where they made significant sacrifices, like dropping out of college because she threatened to leave him. The breakup was messy, with her taking his best friend, spreading lies, and causing him to live in his car and face legal issues. He eventually moved away, rebuilt his life, got married, and has a kid now.\n\nNow, Rose contacts him after years of no contact, saying her new boyfriend is abusive and she's scared. The author tells her to call the police or a shelter and then blocks her. He's worried about involving his wife since she's kind and might help, but he doesn't want Rose near his family.\n\nThe question is whether he's the asshole for not helping. \n\nI need to consider the dynamics here. The author has a history of being wronged by Rose. She manipulated, lied, and caused him a lot of harm. The current call is an emergency claim, but given her past behavior, it's possible she might be manipulating again. The author's response is to direct her to official help, which is the appropriate action. Helping her directly could expose his family to her again, which he's justified in wanting to avoid given her history.\n\nBut on the other hand, if she's in genuine distress, there's an argument that he should have offered some support. However, the right course of action is to rely on established emergency services rather than personal intervention, especially with a history of toxicity. The author's main responsibility is to his current family and his own well-being, not to someone who has caused him so much harm.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. He took the right steps by advising her to contact authorities and shelters, which are the proper resources. He's protecting his family and not engaging with someone who has a history of manipulation. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
