A little backstory first, my ex (Rose) and I were together for 5 years, from the ages 18-23. She was my first everything and I was young and stupid. Rose is also the most toxic, self-absorbed and spiteful person I have ever met. I made so many sacrifices for her during our relationship like dropping out of college my sophomore year because she had threatened to leave me for someone who would spend more time with her. Now our break up was messy, she left me for my best friend/ our roommate and they kicked me out of the house we lived in. I ended up having to live out of my car for a few weeks because she had spread lies about to our group of friends saying I had been violent towards and no one would let me stay with them when I had no where to go. During this time of living out of my car she would call me almost every screaming at me to get my stuff out of the house. When I finally found a place to live, I went to the house to get my stuff they called the cops on me saying that I had broken in. which was a huge ordeal where I had to show them messages from her telling me to come over at any time to get my stuff and the lease that I was still on. After 6 months of being alienated and isolated from everyone I had been close to for the last 5 years I moved back in with my mom 3 states away and went back to school.\n\tI am 32 now and, in that time, I graduated college, met an amazing woman, got married and had a kid. I have had no contact Rose since I moved away. From what I\u2019ve gathered through people I know she and the roommate she left me for got really into drugs and partying and broke up less than a year after they started seeing each other. The roommate was never able to quit the drugs and ended up overdosing a few years ago. A few of my old friends eventually apologized for the way they treated me after realizing what type of person Rose really was. She just uses people until they of are no use to her and then she moves on. Last year they even warned me when Rose\u2019s new boyfriend got a job in the city I live in and they were going to move here. I didn\u2019t really worry too much its a huge city and the chances of running into her were very low. \n\ta couple days ago a received a phone from Rose, I have no idea who would give my number to her. In the phone call she was hysterical saying her boyfriend was abusive and she was scared she had no one here and she knows that I hate her but I\u2019m the only person she knows that lives here. I told her she need to call the police or woman\u2019s shelter and to never contact me again, then I blocked the number she called me from. I had decided a long time ago that I would never let this person back into my life. I also haven\u2019t told my wife about this because she is a such a kind and caring person that she would insist that help her and I don\u2019t want Rose anywhere near my family. So am I the asshole for not helping my ex when she had an emergency?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not helping his ex during an emergency. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the backstory: They were in a 5-year relationship, but it sounds toxic. The ex, Rose, was described as toxic, self-absorbed, and spiteful. The author had to drop out of college because she threatened to leave him. The breakup was messy, leading to him being kicked out, living in his car, and facing isolation. There's history of her lying about him and causing legal issues when he tried to get his stuff back. After that, he moved away, started a new life, got married, had a kid. No contact for years. Now, she contacts him in a panic about an abusive boyfriend, asking for help. He tells her to call police or a shelter and blocks her.\n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong. The user wants a yes or no based on the situation.\n\nI need to consider several angles. Legally, is there any obligation to help someone in an emergency? Probably not unless there's a specific duty, like a parent-child relationship or if you created the emergency. Here, the author isn't responsible for her current situation. Emotionally and ethically, should he help? Well, she's in an abusive situation, which is serious. But given their history, helping could put him and his family at risk. The author also mentions that Rose has a pattern of using people and moving on, which suggests she might not truly need help or might be manipulating. \n\nThe author did direct her to appropriate resources, which is the right step. Blocking her after that is a boundary, especially considering past experiences. The user's wife's reaction is a concern too\u2014he doesn't want to involve her, which is understandable given Rose's past. \n\nPotential counterarguments: Some might say he should have helped despite the history. But others would argue that he's justified in protecting himself from a toxic person who's caused him harm. Also, the fact that she got his number through someone else might imply she's reaching out in a way that could reopen old issues. \n\nSo, considering all factors, the author isn't in the wrong. He's set boundaries and directed her to proper help. The key is that he didn't ignore the emergency entirely but redirected her to the right channels. His decision to not engage further is about self-protection and family safety.\n"
