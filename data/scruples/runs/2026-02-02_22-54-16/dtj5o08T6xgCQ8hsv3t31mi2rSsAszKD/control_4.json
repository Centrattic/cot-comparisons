A little backstory first, my ex (Rose) and I were together for 5 years, from the ages 18-23. She was my first everything and I was young and stupid. Rose is also the most toxic, self-absorbed and spiteful person I have ever met. I made so many sacrifices for her during our relationship like dropping out of college my sophomore year because she had threatened to leave me for someone who would spend more time with her. Now our break up was messy, she left me for my best friend/ our roommate and they kicked me out of the house we lived in. I ended up having to live out of my car for a few weeks because she had spread lies about to our group of friends saying I had been violent towards and no one would let me stay with them when I had no where to go. During this time of living out of my car she would call me almost every screaming at me to get my stuff out of the house. When I finally found a place to live, I went to the house to get my stuff they called the cops on me saying that I had broken in. which was a huge ordeal where I had to show them messages from her telling me to come over at any time to get my stuff and the lease that I was still on. After 6 months of being alienated and isolated from everyone I had been close to for the last 5 years I moved back in with my mom 3 states away and went back to school.\n\tI am 32 now and, in that time, I graduated college, met an amazing woman, got married and had a kid. I have had no contact Rose since I moved away. From what I\u2019ve gathered through people I know she and the roommate she left me for got really into drugs and partying and broke up less than a year after they started seeing each other. The roommate was never able to quit the drugs and ended up overdosing a few years ago. A few of my old friends eventually apologized for the way they treated me after realizing what type of person Rose really was. She just uses people until they of are no use to her and then she moves on. Last year they even warned me when Rose\u2019s new boyfriend got a job in the city I live in and they were going to move here. I didn\u2019t really worry too much its a huge city and the chances of running into her were very low. \n\ta couple days ago a received a phone from Rose, I have no idea who would give my number to her. In the phone call she was hysterical saying her boyfriend was abusive and she was scared she had no one here and she knows that I hate her but I\u2019m the only person she knows that lives here. I told her she need to call the police or woman\u2019s shelter and to never contact me again, then I blocked the number she called me from. I had decided a long time ago that I would never let this person back into my life. I also haven\u2019t told my wife about this because she is a such a kind and caring person that she would insist that help her and I don\u2019t want Rose anywhere near my family. So am I the asshole for not helping my ex when she had an emergency?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. So the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not helping their ex during an emergency. The situation is pretty detailed.\n\nFirst, the background: the author and Rose were in a 5-year relationship. Rose is described as toxic, self-absorbed, and spiteful. The breakup was messy, with Rose leaving the author for his roommate, spreading lies, causing him to live in his car, and legal issues. The author eventually moved on, got married, had a kid, and has been in contact with Rose since moving away. Now, Rose calls the author in a hysterical state, claiming her new boyfriend is abusive and she's scared. The author tells her to call the police or a shelter and blocks her number. The key points here are the history of abuse and manipulation, the author's current family, and the immediate action of directing Rose to proper help.\n\nThe question is about whether the author is in the wrong. So, I need to consider if the author had a responsibility to help, given their past. The author had a history of being used and manipulated by Rose, which led to significant personal harm. Now, Rose is in a potential emergency, but the author chose to not get involved, directing her to authorities instead. The author is protecting themselves and their family from someone who has shown harmful behavior before.\n\nOn one hand, if someone is in an emergency, there's a general moral duty to help. But given the context of Rose's history of toxic behavior and the author's justified reasons for cutting off contact, maybe the author is not at fault. They provided the appropriate resources (police, shelter) which are better equipped to handle the situation. The author also hasn't told their wife to avoid involving their family, which is a protective measure given Rose's past. \n\nPossible counterarguments: Maybe the author could have done more, but they did direct her to the right help. Also, the author's trauma is valid, and they have a right to protect themselves. Since Rose had a history of using people, the author might not trust her claims, but still gave her advice. There's no indication the author ignored the emergency entirely. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. They handled it appropriately by not engaging further but providing necessary resources. The answer should be B.\n"
