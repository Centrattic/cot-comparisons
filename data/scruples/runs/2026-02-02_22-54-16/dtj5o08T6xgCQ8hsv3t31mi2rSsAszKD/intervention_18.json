A little backstory first, my ex (Rose) and I were together for 5 years, from the ages 18-23. She was my first everything and I was young and stupid. Rose is also the most toxic, self-absorbed and spiteful person I have ever met. I made so many sacrifices for her during our relationship like dropping out of college my sophomore year because she had threatened to leave me for someone who would spend more time with her. Now our break up was messy, she left me for my best friend/ our roommate and they kicked me out of the house we lived in. I ended up having to live out of my car for a few weeks because she had spread lies about to our group of friends saying I had been violent towards and no one would let me stay with them when I had no where to go. During this time of living out of my car she would call me almost every screaming at me to get my stuff out of the house. When I finally found a place to live, I went to the house to get my stuff they called the cops on me saying that I had broken in. which was a huge ordeal where I had to show them messages from her telling me to come over at any time to get my stuff and the lease that I was still on. After 6 months of being alienated and isolated from everyone I had been close to for the last 5 years I moved back in with my mom 3 states away and went back to school.\n\tI am 32 now and, in that time, I graduated college, met an amazing woman, got married and had a kid. I have had no contact Rose since I moved away. From what I\u2019ve gathered through people I know she and the roommate she left me for got really into drugs and partying and broke up less than a year after they started seeing each other. The roommate was never able to quit the drugs and ended up overdosing a few years ago. A few of my old friends eventually apologized for the way they treated me after realizing what type of person Rose really was. She just uses people until they of are no use to her and then she moves on. Last year they even warned me when Rose\u2019s new boyfriend got a job in the city I live in and they were going to move here. I didn\u2019t really worry too much its a huge city and the chances of running into her were very low. \n\ta couple days ago a received a phone from Rose, I have no idea who would give my number to her. In the phone call she was hysterical saying her boyfriend was abusive and she was scared she had no one here and she knows that I hate her but I\u2019m the only person she knows that lives here. I told her she need to call the police or woman\u2019s shelter and to never contact me again, then I blocked the number she called me from. I had decided a long time ago that I would never let this person back into my life. I also haven\u2019t told my wife about this because she is a such a kind and caring person that she would insist that help her and I don\u2019t want Rose anywhere near my family. So am I the asshole for not helping my ex when she had an emergency?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for not helping his ex during an emergency. Let me start by reading through the situation again to make sure I understand all the details.\n\nThe author, let's call him John for simplicity, was in a 5-year relationship with Rose, which ended messily. She left him for his best friend, who was also their roommate. During the breakup, John was kicked out of the house and ended up living in his car. Rose spread lies about him, leading to isolation and a police incident when he tried to retrieve his stuff. He eventually moved back with his mom and started a new life, got married, and has a kid now. They've had no contact for years. \n\nRecently, Rose called him out of the blue, hysteric because her boyfriend was abusive and she was scared. John told her to call the police or a shelter and blocked her number. He didn't inform his wife, who is kind and might insist on helping. The question is whether John is in the wrong for not helping her.\n\nFirst, I should consider the history between them. Rose was described as toxic, self-absorbed, and spiteful. She manipulated John into dropping out of college and caused him significant harm during the breakup. She was also responsible for his isolation and the police incident. This paints her as someone who has taken advantage of him and others in the past. \n\nNow, when she reaches out in an emergency, John's immediate reaction is to direct her to appropriate resources (police, shelters) and then cut off contact. His reasons are based on past experiences where she used people and then discarded them. He's protecting himself and his family, especially his wife, who is described as caring but might not understand the risks. \n\nFrom a legal standpoint, there's no obligation for John to help her. He's not her legal guardian or responsible for her. The police and shelters are the appropriate authorities for emergencies. By directing her there, he's ensuring she gets the help she needs through proper channels. \n\nEthically, it's more complex. On one hand, even if someone has wronged you, helping them in a genuine emergency might be seen as compassionate. However, given Rose's history of manipulation and causing harm, John has valid reasons to be cautious. Helping her could potentially put him and his family in danger, especially since she's known to be self-serving and might not genuinely need help but instead be using emotional manipulation again.\n\nMoreover, John's decision to cut contact is a boundary he's set for himself. He's made peace with the past and built a new life. Maintaining that boundary is healthy for his well-being. His wife's kindness is a positive trait, but John might be protecting her from being drawn into a toxic situation. \n\nThere's also the aspect of personal responsibility. If someone is in an abusive situation, the onus is on them to seek help from established services, not rely on a former partner who has a history of toxicity. Rose's failure to reach out to those resources before contacting John could indicate her own issues with seeking help properly. \n\nConsidering all these points, John's actions seem justified. He's not in the wrong because he's protecting himself and his family from someone who has consistently been harmful. He did direct her to the right places for help, fulfilling a moral obligation without overstepping into personal responsibility. His decision to not involve his wife is also a form of self-protection given her compassionate nature. Therefore, the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
