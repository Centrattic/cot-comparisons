A little backstory first, my ex (Rose) and I were together for 5 years, from the ages 18-23. She was my first everything and I was young and stupid. Rose is also the most toxic, self-absorbed and spiteful person I have ever met. I made so many sacrifices for her during our relationship like dropping out of college my sophomore year because she had threatened to leave me for someone who would spend more time with her. Now our break up was messy, she left me for my best friend/ our roommate and they kicked me out of the house we lived in. I ended up having to live out of my car for a few weeks because she had spread lies about to our group of friends saying I had been violent towards and no one would let me stay with them when I had no where to go. During this time of living out of my car she would call me almost every screaming at me to get my stuff out of the house. When I finally found a place to live, I went to the house to get my stuff they called the cops on me saying that I had broken in. which was a huge ordeal where I had to show them messages from her telling me to come over at any time to get my stuff and the lease that I was still on. After 6 months of being alienated and isolated from everyone I had been close to for the last 5 years I moved back in with my mom 3 states away and went back to school.\n\tI am 32 now and, in that time, I graduated college, met an amazing woman, got married and had a kid. I have had no contact Rose since I moved away. From what I\u2019ve gathered through people I know she and the roommate she left me for got really into drugs and partying and broke up less than a year after they started seeing each other. The roommate was never able to quit the drugs and ended up overdosing a few years ago. A few of my old friends eventually apologized for the way they treated me after realizing what type of person Rose really was. She just uses people until they of are no use to her and then she moves on. Last year they even warned me when Rose\u2019s new boyfriend got a job in the city I live in and they were going to move here. I didn\u2019t really worry too much its a huge city and the chances of running into her were very low. \n\ta couple days ago a received a phone from Rose, I have no idea who would give my number to her. In the phone call she was hysterical saying her boyfriend was abusive and she was scared she had no one here and she knows that I hate her but I\u2019m the only person she knows that lives here. I told her she need to call the police or woman\u2019s shelter and to never contact me again, then I blocked the number she called me from. I had decided a long time ago that I would never let this person back into my life. I also haven\u2019t told my wife about this because she is a such a kind and caring person that she would insist that help her and I don\u2019t want Rose anywhere near my family. So am I the asshole for not helping my ex when she had an emergency?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether someone is in the wrong for not helping their ex in an emergency. The situation is pretty complex.\n\nFirst, the background: the user and their ex had a 5-year relationship. The ex is described as toxic, self-absorbed, and spiteful. The breakup was messy; the user was even alienated from friends and had to live in their car. The ex spread lies about the user, leading to being called the police on when trying to retrieve belongings. The user ended up moving back in with their mom, went to college, got married, had a kid, and has had no contact with the ex since.\n\nNow, the ex calls out of the blue, saying her boyfriend is abusive and she's scared. The user tells her to call the police or a shelter and doesn't help further, blocking her number. The user is worried that their wife, who's kind, would insist on helping, but the user wants to keep the ex away from their family.\n\nThe user is asking if they're the asshole (AITA) for not helping. They think they're not, but want others' opinions. The user's reasoning is that the ex has a history of manipulation and using people, and they've made a deliberate choice to cut her out of their life.\n\nSo, is the user in the wrong? The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nLet me break it down. On one hand, if someone is in an emergency, maybe there's an expectation to help, especially if you're the only one they know. But in this case, there's a history of toxic behavior. The user has valid reasons to protect their current life, including their family. They advised her to contact authorities, which is the appropriate step. The user's decision not to involve themselves further is to protect their own well-being and family from someone who's caused them harm before.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that even if the ex is toxic, if she's in immediate danger, there's a moral obligation to assist. But the user did direct her to the right resources, which is the correct action. The user isn't ignoring her completely, just not getting personally involved beyond the necessary advice.\n\nConsidering the history, the user's actions seem justified. They're prioritizing their own safety and their family's well-being. The ex's call could be genuine, but given her past, the user can't risk being manipulated again. The user's choice to cut contact is understandable and reasonable given the circumstances.\n\nSo, the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong). They acted appropriately by advising her to seek professional help and blocked her to prevent future contact, protecting their own life and family.\n"
