After the first round my friends and I all noticed a pretty foul body odor.  I get that MTG players have a stereotype of bad odor, and sometimes someone might have a little funk but this was pretty nasty.  We eventually found the source and it was a guy who nobody really talked to much.  He just came, played, and left each week.  Well we tried to ignore it since he had never had this issue before so I just assumed a freak occurrence.  It was gross, but we got through the night just fine.\n\nWell last week we went in for games and the moment he got to the tables we all recognized the same stench as the week before.  At this point I went to the owner and asked if he could say something, but he refused saying we should just try to ignore it.  Well after a round of play it got so bad that my friends and several other players were stepping outside between games just to get fresh air away from him.  I finally had it and before the next round started I loudly announced to everyone\n\n\"to whoever didn't bother to take a shower today or even this week could you please do us all a favor and learn basic hygiene.  This is disgusting and you should know better.\"\n\nEveryone went quiet and the guy in question finished his game quickly left the store.  While everyone initially seemed to appreciate what I'd done the owner gave me a few dirty looks as did a few other players.  One even approached me after the tournament and told me that was a cruel way to handle the situation.\n\nWas I wrong to do this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again.\n\nThe author is part of a Magic: The Gathering group at a card shop. The problem started when someone had a really bad body odor during the event. The first time, they assumed it was a one-off, but it happened again. The owner didn't want to address it, so the author spoke up loudly in front of everyone, shaming the person for their hygiene. The person left quickly after, and while some people appreciated it, the owner and others were upset.\n\nHmm, the question is whether the author was wrong. Let's break it down. The key points here are the public shaming and the method used. The author wanted to address a hygiene issue that was affecting others' comfort. They tried to get the owner to handle it first, but he refused. Then, they took matters into their own hands by publicly calling out the person.\n\nNow, from a social standpoint, public shaming can be harsh. Even if the intent was good, the method might have been too direct. The person being shamed probably felt embarrassed and might have had a valid reason they didn't share. Maybe they were going through a tough time, had a medical issue, or couldn't shower that day for some reason. By announcing it in front of everyone, the author didn't give the person a chance to respond or address it privately.\n\nOn the other hand, the author was trying to protect the comfort of the group. The owner didn't act, so they stepped in. But maybe a better approach would have been to talk to the person privately, offer help, or find a quieter way to address the issue. Publicly shaming someone can lead to hurt feelings and damage relationships, even if the issue is about hygiene.\n\nAlso, considering the owner's reaction, maybe the shop has policies against such confrontations. The author might have overstepped by taking it public. Even if the person deserved it, the approach was confrontational and unkind. The other players stepping outside shows how uncomfortable the situation was, but the method to resolve it might not have been the best.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's intention was to solve a problem that others were facing, but the method of loud public shaming was probably not the right approach. It's possible they were in the wrong because they didn't handle it privately and chose a harsh public confrontation instead. Even if the issue was valid, the way they handled it could be seen as cruel or inconsiderate.\n"
