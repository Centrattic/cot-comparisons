After the first round my friends and I all noticed a pretty foul body odor.  I get that MTG players have a stereotype of bad odor, and sometimes someone might have a little funk but this was pretty nasty.  We eventually found the source and it was a guy who nobody really talked to much.  He just came, played, and left each week.  Well we tried to ignore it since he had never had this issue before so I just assumed a freak occurrence.  It was gross, but we got through the night just fine.\n\nWell last week we went in for games and the moment he got to the tables we all recognized the same stench as the week before.  At this point I went to the owner and asked if he could say something, but he refused saying we should just try to ignore it.  Well after a round of play it got so bad that my friends and several other players were stepping outside between games just to get fresh air away from him.  I finally had it and before the next round started I loudly announced to everyone\n\n\"to whoever didn't bother to take a shower today or even this week could you please do us all a favor and learn basic hygiene.  This is disgusting and you should know better.\"\n\nEveryone went quiet and the guy in question finished his game quickly left the store.  While everyone initially seemed to appreciate what I'd done the owner gave me a few dirty looks as did a few other players.  One even approached me after the tournament and told me that was a cruel way to handle the situation.\n\nWas I wrong to do this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for shaming someone for poor hygiene during an MTG event. Let me look at the details.\n\nSo, the author and friends noticed a foul odor at the first event. They assumed it was a one-time thing, maybe the guy had a bad day. The second week, the smell was back, and the owner said to ignore it. People were stepping outside for fresh air. The author then loudly shamed the person, causing everyone to go quiet and the guy left quickly. The owner and some others were upset, called it cruel.\n\nHmm. Hygiene is a personal issue, and public shaming is a strong reaction. The author's intent was probably to address the problem, but the method was confrontational. The owner didn't want to handle it, maybe to avoid conflict. The author took it upon themselves to address it publicly. \n\nIs public shaming justified here? It's a private event in a store. The author's action might have embarrassed the person, which could have social consequences beyond the situation. The alternative could have been private confrontation or suggesting to the owner again in a different way. \n\nAlso, the person might have a valid reason (like health issues or financial inability to buy soap) that others aren't aware of. The author made an assumption and acted without considering that. \n\nSo, while the smell was a problem, the approach taken was harsh. There might be better ways to handle it without public shaming. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong.\n"
