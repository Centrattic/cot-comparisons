After the first round my friends and I all noticed a pretty foul body odor.  I get that MTG players have a stereotype of bad odor, and sometimes someone might have a little funk but this was pretty nasty.  We eventually found the source and it was a guy who nobody really talked to much.  He just came, played, and left each week.  Well we tried to ignore it since he had never had this issue before so I just assumed a freak occurrence.  It was gross, but we got through the night just fine.\n\nWell last week we went in for games and the moment he got to the tables we all recognized the same stench as the week before.  At this point I went to the owner and asked if he could say something, but he refused saying we should just try to ignore it.  Well after a round of play it got so bad that my friends and several other players were stepping outside between games just to get fresh air away from him.  I finally had it and before the next round started I loudly announced to everyone\n\n\"to whoever didn't bother to take a shower today or even this week could you please do us all a favor and learn basic hygiene.  This is disgusting and you should know better.\"\n\nEveryone went quiet and the guy in question finished his game quickly left the store.  While everyone initially seemed to appreciate what I'd done the owner gave me a few dirty looks as did a few other players.  One even approached me after the tournament and told me that was a cruel way to handle the situation.\n\nWas I wrong to do this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for loudly shaming someone about their hygiene at an MTG event. I need to decide between A (Yes) or B (No). \n\nFirst, I'll break down the situation. The person (author) was at an event and noticed a strong body odor coming from another player. They tried to ignore it initially, assuming it was a one-time thing. But when it happened again, they approached the store owner, who didn't help. Then the author publicly called out the person in front of everyone, leading to the person leaving and some backlash.\n\nNow, considering social norms and appropriate behavior. Public shaming, even if the issue is unpleasant, can be seen as harsh and potentially cruel. The author's approach was direct and loud, which might have embarrassed the individual, even if the intent was to improve the environment. Others might argue that the author was trying to address a genuine problem that was affecting everyone's experience, especially since the owner didn't take action. However, the method used\u2014publicly shaming\u2014might not be the best approach. \n\nAlso, there's a question of whether the author had the right to address it in such a public manner. Maybe a private approach would have been more appropriate, even if the owner didn't act. The fact that the owner and some players disapproved suggests that the method was problematic. The person who was criticized left quickly, which might indicate they felt humiliated. \n\nOn the other hand, the issue was affecting multiple people, so there's a valid concern about health and comfort. The author might feel they had to act when the owner wouldn't. But the way they did it could be considered inconsiderate. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the key points are intent vs. impact. The author's intent was likely to improve the environment, but the impact was public shaming, which can be hurtful. The person's hygiene might have a valid reason (health issues, etc.), and publicly calling them out without knowing could be insensitive. \n\nSo, while the situation is understandable, the method used by the author is likely what's causing the AITA status. Therefore, the answer might lean towards A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because of the public shaming approach, even if the issue was valid.\n"
