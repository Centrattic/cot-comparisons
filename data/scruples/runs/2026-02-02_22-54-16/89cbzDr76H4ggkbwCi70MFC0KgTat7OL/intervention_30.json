After the first round my friends and I all noticed a pretty foul body odor.  I get that MTG players have a stereotype of bad odor, and sometimes someone might have a little funk but this was pretty nasty.  We eventually found the source and it was a guy who nobody really talked to much.  He just came, played, and left each week.  Well we tried to ignore it since he had never had this issue before so I just assumed a freak occurrence.  It was gross, but we got through the night just fine.\n\nWell last week we went in for games and the moment he got to the tables we all recognized the same stench as the week before.  At this point I went to the owner and asked if he could say something, but he refused saying we should just try to ignore it.  Well after a round of play it got so bad that my friends and several other players were stepping outside between games just to get fresh air away from him.  I finally had it and before the next round started I loudly announced to everyone\n\n\"to whoever didn't bother to take a shower today or even this week could you please do us all a favor and learn basic hygiene.  This is disgusting and you should know better.\"\n\nEveryone went quiet and the guy in question finished his game quickly left the store.  While everyone initially seemed to appreciate what I'd done the owner gave me a few dirty looks as did a few other players.  One even approached me after the tournament and told me that was a cruel way to handle the situation.\n\nWas I wrong to do this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who posted an AITA (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong for publicly shaming someone for poor hygiene at an MTG event. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The person noticed a foul odor, tried to ignore it the first time, then confronted the owner who didn't act. The second time, others were also affected, leading the person to publicly call out the individual's hygiene. The person left, and while some appreciated the action, the owner and a few others were upset.\n\nThe key points here are public shaming versus addressing a concern. The person tried to handle it through the owner first, which is reasonable. When that failed, they took direct action, but in a public and loud manner. Public shaming can be problematic because it can hurt someone's dignity and might not be the most effective way to resolve the issue. However, the person was trying to improve the environment for everyone, which is understandable.\n\nOn one hand, the person had a valid concern about hygiene affecting others. On the other hand, publicly calling someone out in front of a group might be seen as harsh and unkind, even if the intent was good. The owner's role is to manage such issues, and bypassing them could be seen as overstepping, even if the owner didn't act.\n\nI need to think about whether the method was appropriate. Was there a more private way to address it? Maybe. But the person had already tried the owner and it didn't work. Public shaming might lead to the person leaving, which resolved the immediate issue, but at the cost of potentially embarrassing someone. \n\nIn terms of social norms, while it's important to respect others, there's also a balance between personal comfort and kindness. The line between standing up for oneself and being considerate is tricky here. The person's action was direct and effective, but maybe the approach was too confrontational. \n\nSo, considering all that, the person's intention was to address a problem affecting others, but the method used was public and could be seen as cruel, which others criticized. So, there's a case for both sides. The owner and others thought it was cruel, which might mean the person isn't entirely in the right. However, the person did try to handle it before escalating. \n\nI think the answer might lean towards A (yes, the author is in the wrong) because public shaming is generally not the best approach, even if the intent is good. But some might argue B because the situation was causing discomfort to others. The community's mixed reaction (some appreciated it, others didn't) adds complexity. \n\nBut in the end, the question is whether the author was in the wrong. The act of publicly shaming someone in a group setting, even if the issue is valid, can be seen as crossing a line. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
