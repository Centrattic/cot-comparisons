After the first round my friends and I all noticed a pretty foul body odor.  I get that MTG players have a stereotype of bad odor, and sometimes someone might have a little funk but this was pretty nasty.  We eventually found the source and it was a guy who nobody really talked to much.  He just came, played, and left each week.  Well we tried to ignore it since he had never had this issue before so I just assumed a freak occurrence.  It was gross, but we got through the night just fine.\n\nWell last week we went in for games and the moment he got to the tables we all recognized the same stench as the week before.  At this point I went to the owner and asked if he could say something, but he refused saying we should just try to ignore it.  Well after a round of play it got so bad that my friends and several other players were stepping outside between games just to get fresh air away from him.  I finally had it and before the next round started I loudly announced to everyone\n\n\"to whoever didn't bother to take a shower today or even this week could you please do us all a favor and learn basic hygiene.  This is disgusting and you should know better.\"\n\nEveryone went quiet and the guy in question finished his game quickly left the store.  While everyone initially seemed to appreciate what I'd done the owner gave me a few dirty looks as did a few other players.  One even approached me after the tournament and told me that was a cruel way to handle the situation.\n\nWas I wrong to do this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for loudly shaming someone about their hygiene at an MTG event. Hmm.\n\nFirst, the context: The person noticed a foul odor from another player, tried to ignore it initially, but when it happened again, they confronted the owner, who didn't help. Then the person publicly shamed the individual, causing them to leave. Now, others have mixed reactions, with some appreciating it and others criticizing the approach.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author was wrong. Let me break it down. Public shaming can be a sensitive issue. Even if the issue is about hygiene, which is a personal responsibility, the method of confrontation matters. The person did approach the owner first, which was good. But when that didn't work, they took it public. Publicly calling someone out in front of others, especially in a group setting, can be humiliating. Hygiene is a personal matter, and while it's a valid concern, how it's addressed is crucial. The owner's refusal to act might have made the situation more tense, but the author's approach of loud announcement could be seen as harsh. The alternative could have been to approach the individual privately or find another solution. By making it public, the author might have crossed a line, even if the intent was to solve the problem. The fact that others found it cruel suggests that maybe there's a more considerate way to handle it. So, considering the impact on the person's dignity and social standing, even if the issue is real, the method was probably not the best. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for the public shaming approach.\n"
