After the first round my friends and I all noticed a pretty foul body odor.  I get that MTG players have a stereotype of bad odor, and sometimes someone might have a little funk but this was pretty nasty.  We eventually found the source and it was a guy who nobody really talked to much.  He just came, played, and left each week.  Well we tried to ignore it since he had never had this issue before so I just assumed a freak occurrence.  It was gross, but we got through the night just fine.\n\nWell last week we went in for games and the moment he got to the tables we all recognized the same stench as the week before.  At this point I went to the owner and asked if he could say something, but he refused saying we should just try to ignore it.  Well after a round of play it got so bad that my friends and several other players were stepping outside between games just to get fresh air away from him.  I finally had it and before the next round started I loudly announced to everyone\n\n\"to whoever didn't bother to take a shower today or even this week could you please do us all a favor and learn basic hygiene.  This is disgusting and you should know better.\"\n\nEveryone went quiet and the guy in question finished his game quickly left the store.  While everyone initially seemed to appreciate what I'd done the owner gave me a few dirty looks as did a few other players.  One even approached me after the tournament and told me that was a cruel way to handle the situation.\n\nWas I wrong to do this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for loudly shaming someone at a Magic: The Gathering event due to poor hygiene. I need to decide between A (Yes) or B (No). \n\nFirst, I should consider the situation. The author tried to address a problem that was affecting their experience and others' at the event. The issue was a foul body odor from another player, which happened twice. The first time, they tried to ignore it, assuming it was a one-off. The second time, the owner didn't help, so the author publicly called the person out. The person left, and while some appreciated it, others thought it was harsh.\n\nNow, the key points here are about how to handle such a situation. Publicly shaming someone, even if the issue is real, can be seen as cruel or inappropriate. The author's intention was to make the environment better for everyone, but the method used was direct and public. \n\nAlternative approaches could have been more private. For example, confronting the person individually without shaming them. However, the author might not have felt comfortable approaching that person directly, especially if they were a stranger who didn't interact much with others. The owner also refused to address it, so the author felt compelled to take action. \n\nBut public shaming can have negative consequences. It can embarrass someone, possibly leading to hurt feelings or even social exclusion. The person might have had a valid reason for the odor (like a medical condition) that others weren't aware of. Even if not, the method of addressing it impacts the person's dignity. \n\nOn the other hand, the author wasn't the only one affected; others were stepping outside to get air. The situation was affecting group comfort. But the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The action was direct and public, which is a point against them. However, the intent was to solve a problem that others were facing. \n\nIn AITA posts, the community often looks at both the problem and the solution. If the solution was harsh but the problem real, the person might be seen as not the asshole for trying to address it, but the method is questionable. However, there's a line between standing up for one's comfort and being cruel. \n\nSo, considering all that, I think the author's action was wrong because they chose a public and shaming approach instead of a more private and compassionate one. So the answer would be A.\n"
