After the first round my friends and I all noticed a pretty foul body odor.  I get that MTG players have a stereotype of bad odor, and sometimes someone might have a little funk but this was pretty nasty.  We eventually found the source and it was a guy who nobody really talked to much.  He just came, played, and left each week.  Well we tried to ignore it since he had never had this issue before so I just assumed a freak occurrence.  It was gross, but we got through the night just fine.\n\nWell last week we went in for games and the moment he got to the tables we all recognized the same stench as the week before.  At this point I went to the owner and asked if he could say something, but he refused saying we should just try to ignore it.  Well after a round of play it got so bad that my friends and several other players were stepping outside between games just to get fresh air away from him.  I finally had it and before the next round started I loudly announced to everyone\n\n\"to whoever didn't bother to take a shower today or even this week could you please do us all a favor and learn basic hygiene.  This is disgusting and you should know better.\"\n\nEveryone went quiet and the guy in question finished his game quickly left the store.  While everyone initially seemed to appreciate what I'd done the owner gave me a few dirty looks as did a few other players.  One even approached me after the tournament and told me that was a cruel way to handle the situation.\n\nWas I wrong to do this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit-style question is in the wrong for shaming someone about their hygiene at an MTG event. So the situation is that the person noticed someone's bad body odor twice, tried to ignore it the first time, approached the owner who didn't act, then publicly called out the person, leading to some backlash. The question is whether they were wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The person was in a shared space where hygiene is a common concern. Bad body odor can affect others' comfort and health. The author tried to handle it by talking to the owner first, which is a reasonable step. But when that didn't work, they took direct action. However, doing it publicly and loudly might have been harsh. \n\nOn one hand, the person had a right to a comfortable environment. Public shaming, though, can be seen as inconsiderate and potentially humiliating, even if the issue is valid. The guy in question left quickly after, which suggests the message was received, but the method might have been inappropriate. The owner and others disapproved, so maybe there's a social norm against direct confrontation in that setting. \n\nAlso, the person didn't know the reason for the bad odor. It could have been a medical issue, a personal hardship, or something else. Publicly shaming could be cruel without understanding the context. The alternative might have been to approach the person privately, but the author felt that wasn't effective after the first time.\n\nIn terms of social etiquette, calling someone out in front of others is often seen as harsh. Even if the intention was to improve the environment, the method might have been too confrontational. The owner's refusal to act doesn't absolve the author of responsibility to handle it respectfully. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because the approach was too public and harsh, even if the issue was valid. Alternatively, B (not in the wrong) if the situation justified the action. But usually, public shaming is frowned upon unless it's a severe issue. Since hygiene is a personal matter, the method was probably too direct.\n"
