After the first round my friends and I all noticed a pretty foul body odor.  I get that MTG players have a stereotype of bad odor, and sometimes someone might have a little funk but this was pretty nasty.  We eventually found the source and it was a guy who nobody really talked to much.  He just came, played, and left each week.  Well we tried to ignore it since he had never had this issue before so I just assumed a freak occurrence.  It was gross, but we got through the night just fine.\n\nWell last week we went in for games and the moment he got to the tables we all recognized the same stench as the week before.  At this point I went to the owner and asked if he could say something, but he refused saying we should just try to ignore it.  Well after a round of play it got so bad that my friends and several other players were stepping outside between games just to get fresh air away from him.  I finally had it and before the next round started I loudly announced to everyone\n\n\"to whoever didn't bother to take a shower today or even this week could you please do us all a favor and learn basic hygiene.  This is disgusting and you should know better.\"\n\nEveryone went quiet and the guy in question finished his game quickly left the store.  While everyone initially seemed to appreciate what I'd done the owner gave me a few dirty looks as did a few other players.  One even approached me after the tournament and told me that was a cruel way to handle the situation.\n\nWas I wrong to do this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the MTG story is in the wrong for loudly shaming someone about their hygiene. The options are A or B.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The person is part of a regular MTG group. There's a guy who had a really bad odor, which happened twice. The first time they ignored it thinking it's a one-off, but the second time, it's really bad, people are stepping outside, and the owner didn't help. The author then publicly shamed the guy, causing him to leave, and got mixed reactions.\n\nNow, the question is if the author is wrong. Let me think about the perspectives. On one hand, the author is dealing with an issue that's affecting their experience and the experience of others. They tried to address it through the owner first, who didn't act. So maybe they felt they had to take action themselves. Public shaming could be seen as harsh, but maybe it's justified because the owner didn't help.\n\nBut on the other hand, publicly shaming someone could be hurtful. The guy might have a legitimate reason for his hygiene issue, like a health problem or a difficult personal situation. The author didn't approach him privately first, which could have been a more respectful method. Also, the owner's disapproval and others' reactions suggest that the public approach might have been too direct.\n\nThe user initially thought the author isn't in the wrong. But maybe there's a middle ground. The problem is that while the hygiene issue was a valid concern, the method of addressing it was confrontational and public. A better approach might have been to confront the individual privately, offering help or understanding. The owner's refusal to act might have left the author with few options, but public shaming can damage someone's reputation and self-esteem.\n\nAlso, considering social norms, addressing someone's hygiene publicly is generally considered rude, regardless of the situation. Even if the issue is real, the method matters. The author's action led to the person leaving quickly, but maybe there's a chance the person didn't realize the issue. The author didn't give him a chance to address it themselves, just publicly called them out.\n\nSo, even if the intent was good, the approach was problematic. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not handling it more sensitively. The answer would be A, but I'm a bit conflicted. However, since the owner didn't help, maybe the author had no choice. But public shaming is still a poor choice.\n"
