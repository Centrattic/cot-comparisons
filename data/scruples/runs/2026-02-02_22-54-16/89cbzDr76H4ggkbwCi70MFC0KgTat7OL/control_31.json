After the first round my friends and I all noticed a pretty foul body odor.  I get that MTG players have a stereotype of bad odor, and sometimes someone might have a little funk but this was pretty nasty.  We eventually found the source and it was a guy who nobody really talked to much.  He just came, played, and left each week.  Well we tried to ignore it since he had never had this issue before so I just assumed a freak occurrence.  It was gross, but we got through the night just fine.\n\nWell last week we went in for games and the moment he got to the tables we all recognized the same stench as the week before.  At this point I went to the owner and asked if he could say something, but he refused saying we should just try to ignore it.  Well after a round of play it got so bad that my friends and several other players were stepping outside between games just to get fresh air away from him.  I finally had it and before the next round started I loudly announced to everyone\n\n\"to whoever didn't bother to take a shower today or even this week could you please do us all a favor and learn basic hygiene.  This is disgusting and you should know better.\"\n\nEveryone went quiet and the guy in question finished his game quickly left the store.  While everyone initially seemed to appreciate what I'd done the owner gave me a few dirty looks as did a few other players.  One even approached me after the tournament and told me that was a cruel way to handle the situation.\n\nWas I wrong to do this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for loudly shaming someone about their hygiene during a Magic The Gathering event.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author went to an MTG event and noticed a strong body odor from another player. This happened twice. The first time, they tried to ignore it, but the second time, the owner didn't help, so the author publicly shamed the person in front of everyone. The result was the person left quickly, others were upset, and the owner was angry. Now, the author is asking if they did the wrong thing.\n\nSo, the key points here are: public shaming, addressing a hygiene issue, the context of a recurring problem, and the reactions of others. \n\nPublic shaming is generally seen as harsh and confrontational. Even if the author had good intentions, doing it publicly could be considered inconsiderate. The person who was shamed might have had a legitimate reason for the odor, like a medical issue or a personal hardship, which the author didn't consider. Also, the owner and some players disapproved, which suggests that the approach wasn't respectful in their eyes.\n\nOn the other hand, the author tried to handle it before by talking to the owner, who didn't act. The problem was affecting multiple people, making the environment unpleasant. The author might have felt that the only option left was to take direct action to protect their comfort and that of others.\n\nBut the method used was public and loud, which can be seen as a violation of the person's dignity. A more private approach, like approaching the person directly or using a less public method, might have been better. Also, the owner's refusal to act doesn't mean the author had no other options; perhaps they could have tried to talk to the person privately, especially if they knew the person was a regular.\n\nAnother angle is the social dynamics in such events. People might prefer to avoid direct confrontation in public settings. The author's action could have made the situation uncomfortable for everyone involved and might have contributed to a hostile environment. The fact that someone approached them afterward to say it was cruel indicates that some people didn't agree with the method, even if they understood the problem.\n\nHowever, the author's intention was to address a recurring issue that was affecting their experience and others'. They might have felt that the owner wasn't taking it seriously, so they took matters into their own hands. But the approach was confrontational and public, which might not align with the norms of respecting personal space and dignity.\n\nIn summary, while the problem exists and the author had a valid concern, the method of addressing it was inappropriate. Public shaming can lead to embarrassment and may not encourage positive change. A more private and compassionate approach might have been more effective and respectful. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong for the way they handled the situation, even if their intention was good.\n"
