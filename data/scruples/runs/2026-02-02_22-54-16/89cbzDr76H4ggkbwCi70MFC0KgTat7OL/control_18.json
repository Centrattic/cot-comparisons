After the first round my friends and I all noticed a pretty foul body odor.  I get that MTG players have a stereotype of bad odor, and sometimes someone might have a little funk but this was pretty nasty.  We eventually found the source and it was a guy who nobody really talked to much.  He just came, played, and left each week.  Well we tried to ignore it since he had never had this issue before so I just assumed a freak occurrence.  It was gross, but we got through the night just fine.\n\nWell last week we went in for games and the moment he got to the tables we all recognized the same stench as the week before.  At this point I went to the owner and asked if he could say something, but he refused saying we should just try to ignore it.  Well after a round of play it got so bad that my friends and several other players were stepping outside between games just to get fresh air away from him.  I finally had it and before the next round started I loudly announced to everyone\n\n\"to whoever didn't bother to take a shower today or even this week could you please do us all a favor and learn basic hygiene.  This is disgusting and you should know better.\"\n\nEveryone went quiet and the guy in question finished his game quickly left the store.  While everyone initially seemed to appreciate what I'd done the owner gave me a few dirty looks as did a few other players.  One even approached me after the tournament and told me that was a cruel way to handle the situation.\n\nWas I wrong to do this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for shaming someone about their hygiene during an MTG event.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The person noticed a foul odor from another attendee twice. The first time, they tried to ignore it, thinking it was a one-off. The second time, others were also affected, so they confronted the person publicly. The owner didn't help, so they decided to address it themselves. They made a loud announcement, which caused the person to leave, and some people disapproved.\n\nNow, the key points here. Public shaming is a strong action. Even if the issue is real, the method of confrontation matters. The author chose to address it in front of everyone, which can be embarrassing and hurtful. Hygiene is a sensitive topic, and public criticism can be seen as cruel, even if the intent was to help. The user's friends appreciated it, but the owner and others didn't. Also, the person in question left quickly, so maybe they were unaware of the issue. The owner's refusal to act might have been a way to avoid conflict or protect the customer, but that's part of the store's policy.\n\nOn the other hand, the author was trying to improve the environment for everyone. They didn't approach the person directly first, which might have been a better approach. Direct communication (like a private talk) could resolve the issue without public embarrassment. Since the owner didn't act, the author felt they had to take matters into their own hands. However, the method used was confrontational and public, which can be inappropriate.\n\nHygiene issues can have various reasons, including financial constraints, medical conditions, or simply a lack of awareness. Public shaming might not solve the problem and could lead to social exclusion. The intent here was to \"teach basic hygiene,\" which is a moral stance, but the approach was harsh. The after-effect, like the owner's disapproval and others calling it cruel, suggests that the method was not well-received.\n\nSo, considering the approach, the public nature of the shaming, and the potential for hurting someone without a private approach first, the author might be in the wrong. The right approach would have been to speak to the person privately, perhaps with the owner's help, or find a kinder way to address the issue without causing public humiliation.\n"
