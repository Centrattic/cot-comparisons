After the first round my friends and I all noticed a pretty foul body odor.  I get that MTG players have a stereotype of bad odor, and sometimes someone might have a little funk but this was pretty nasty.  We eventually found the source and it was a guy who nobody really talked to much.  He just came, played, and left each week.  Well we tried to ignore it since he had never had this issue before so I just assumed a freak occurrence.  It was gross, but we got through the night just fine.\n\nWell last week we went in for games and the moment he got to the tables we all recognized the same stench as the week before.  At this point I went to the owner and asked if he could say something, but he refused saying we should just try to ignore it.  Well after a round of play it got so bad that my friends and several other players were stepping outside between games just to get fresh air away from him.  I finally had it and before the next round started I loudly announced to everyone\n\n\"to whoever didn't bother to take a shower today or even this week could you please do us all a favor and learn basic hygiene.  This is disgusting and you should know better.\"\n\nEveryone went quiet and the guy in question finished his game quickly left the store.  While everyone initially seemed to appreciate what I'd done the owner gave me a few dirty looks as did a few other players.  One even approached me after the tournament and told me that was a cruel way to handle the situation.\n\nWas I wrong to do this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong for publicly shaming someone about their body odor during a Magic The Gathering event. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author and their friends noticed a foul smell at the MTG event, identified the source as a regular player who had never had this issue before. They tried to ignore it the first time, but the second time, even the owner didn't want to address it. The situation got so bad that people were stepping outside for fresh air. Finally, the author loudly called out the person for poor hygiene, causing the person to leave and some backlash from the owner and other players.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. Let me consider both sides.\n\nOn one hand, the author was trying to address a real issue that was affecting their experience and others'. They approached the owner first, who didn't act. Then they tried to solve it themselves by making a public announcement. The person did leave, so the immediate problem was resolved. The group's health and comfort might be a legitimate concern, especially if the odor is severe and causing others to avoid the area.\n\nOn the other hand, publicly shaming someone in front of a group can be harsh. Even if the author's intention was to help, the method was confrontational and personal. It might have been perceived as cruel or embarrassing, which could explain why the owner and some players were upset. There's a possibility of misunderstanding, like the person had a medical condition or some unavoidable reason. Also, the author's approach could have made the person feel attacked rather than supported, potentially driving them away instead of offering a solution.\n\nAlternative approaches could have been more private. Maybe talking to the person individually, offering a polite suggestion, or using a non-confrontational method like a note. Public shaming, even with good intentions, might not be the best way to handle sensitive issues like personal hygiene. It's possible that the author's actions, while well-meaning, crossed a line into public humiliation.\n\nBut then again, the owner didn't help, and the situation was affecting multiple people. The author might have felt it was necessary to act to protect their own and others' well-being. However, the loud announcement caused a scene and might have escalated the situation. Hygiene issues can be sensitive, and public confrontation isn't usually the best approach here.\n\nSo, the key points are: Did the author have a right to address the issue publicly? Was there a more appropriate way to handle it? The answer likely hinges on the method used rather than the intent. Even if the problem was real, the public shaming could be seen as the wrong approach. The author might be in the wrong because they chose a confrontational method without first trying a more private solution. But others might argue that they were justified given the owner's inaction and the impact on the group.\n"
