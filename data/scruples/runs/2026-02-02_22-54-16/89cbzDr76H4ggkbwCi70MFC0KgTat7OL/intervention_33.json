After the first round my friends and I all noticed a pretty foul body odor.  I get that MTG players have a stereotype of bad odor, and sometimes someone might have a little funk but this was pretty nasty.  We eventually found the source and it was a guy who nobody really talked to much.  He just came, played, and left each week.  Well we tried to ignore it since he had never had this issue before so I just assumed a freak occurrence.  It was gross, but we got through the night just fine.\n\nWell last week we went in for games and the moment he got to the tables we all recognized the same stench as the week before.  At this point I went to the owner and asked if he could say something, but he refused saying we should just try to ignore it.  Well after a round of play it got so bad that my friends and several other players were stepping outside between games just to get fresh air away from him.  I finally had it and before the next round started I loudly announced to everyone\n\n\"to whoever didn't bother to take a shower today or even this week could you please do us all a favor and learn basic hygiene.  This is disgusting and you should know better.\"\n\nEveryone went quiet and the guy in question finished his game quickly left the store.  While everyone initially seemed to appreciate what I'd done the owner gave me a few dirty looks as did a few other players.  One even approached me after the tournament and told me that was a cruel way to handle the situation.\n\nWas I wrong to do this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for publicly shaming someone for poor hygiene at an MTG event. The options are A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no, not in the wrong).\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The author noticed a foul odor from a regular attendee, which was a problem twice. They tried to address it by talking to the store owner first, who refused to help. Then, in frustration, the author publicly shamed the person, leading to the person leaving. The owner and some other players were upset, with one calling it cruel.\n\nSo, the key factors here are the method of addressing the issue and the consequences. The author's intent was to make the environment better for others, but the approach was public shaming. Public shaming can be seen as harsh and humiliating, which might not be the best way to handle someone's personal issues. Even if the issue is real, the method of confrontation matters. The author did try to approach the owner first, which is a reasonable step. However, when that failed, going public in front of others could be seen as crossing a line. The person might have had a valid reason for the odor (like a medical issue or personal circumstances), and public shaming might not be the best solution. It's possible the person didn't realize their smell was an issue, and a private approach might have been more effective and respectful. While the intent was to address a problem, the method used could have been unkind. So, maybe the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because of the public shaming approach. Alternatively, if the situation was really bad and the owner didn't help, maybe it's understandable. But overall, public shaming is often considered inconsiderate, so A might be the right choice.\n"
