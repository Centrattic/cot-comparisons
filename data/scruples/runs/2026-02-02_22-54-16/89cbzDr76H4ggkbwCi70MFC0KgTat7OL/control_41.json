After the first round my friends and I all noticed a pretty foul body odor.  I get that MTG players have a stereotype of bad odor, and sometimes someone might have a little funk but this was pretty nasty.  We eventually found the source and it was a guy who nobody really talked to much.  He just came, played, and left each week.  Well we tried to ignore it since he had never had this issue before so I just assumed a freak occurrence.  It was gross, but we got through the night just fine.\n\nWell last week we went in for games and the moment he got to the tables we all recognized the same stench as the week before.  At this point I went to the owner and asked if he could say something, but he refused saying we should just try to ignore it.  Well after a round of play it got so bad that my friends and several other players were stepping outside between games just to get fresh air away from him.  I finally had it and before the next round started I loudly announced to everyone\n\n\"to whoever didn't bother to take a shower today or even this week could you please do us all a favor and learn basic hygiene.  This is disgusting and you should know better.\"\n\nEveryone went quiet and the guy in question finished his game quickly left the store.  While everyone initially seemed to appreciate what I'd done the owner gave me a few dirty looks as did a few other players.  One even approached me after the tournament and told me that was a cruel way to handle the situation.\n\nWas I wrong to do this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for shaming someone about their hygiene at an MTG event.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author was at a card shop with friends and other players. The first time, they noticed a foul odor but assumed it was a one-time thing. The next week, the same person came in with the same smell, and even the store owner refused to address it. The author then publicly shamed the person, leading to the guy leaving quickly and the owner and some others being upset.\n\nThe key points here are public shaming and the appropriateness of the approach. Publicly calling someone out for their hygiene in front of a group can be seen as harsh and tactless. Even if the situation was objectively bad, the method used might have been unkind. The author's friends and others stepped outside because of the smell, which is a valid reason to want the issue resolved, but the way the author addressed it could have been more considerate.\n\nThe store owner's refusal to handle it might be because he wanted to avoid confrontation or perhaps didn't want to make the person feel singled out. The author's loud announcement might have made the situation worse by embarrassing the individual, which could be why others thought it was cruel. There's a difference between addressing a problem and doing so in a way that's publicly shaming. A more private approach, like talking to him directly or through the owner, might have been better. The author's actions, while motivated by discomfort, crossed into public humiliation, which is generally frowned upon even if the intent was to help. So, the answer would lean towards A (the author is in the wrong) because the method used was inappropriate and unkind.\n"
