After the first round my friends and I all noticed a pretty foul body odor.  I get that MTG players have a stereotype of bad odor, and sometimes someone might have a little funk but this was pretty nasty.  We eventually found the source and it was a guy who nobody really talked to much.  He just came, played, and left each week.  Well we tried to ignore it since he had never had this issue before so I just assumed a freak occurrence.  It was gross, but we got through the night just fine.\n\nWell last week we went in for games and the moment he got to the tables we all recognized the same stench as the week before.  At this point I went to the owner and asked if he could say something, but he refused saying we should just try to ignore it.  Well after a round of play it got so bad that my friends and several other players were stepping outside between games just to get fresh air away from him.  I finally had it and before the next round started I loudly announced to everyone\n\n\"to whoever didn't bother to take a shower today or even this week could you please do us all a favor and learn basic hygiene.  This is disgusting and you should know better.\"\n\nEveryone went quiet and the guy in question finished his game quickly left the store.  While everyone initially seemed to appreciate what I'd done the owner gave me a few dirty looks as did a few other players.  One even approached me after the tournament and told me that was a cruel way to handle the situation.\n\nWas I wrong to do this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who posted this situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a Magic: The Gathering event where the author publicly shamed someone for their body odor.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author tried to address a hygiene issue that was affecting others. Initially, they tried to ignore it, but it happened again. They approached the shop owner, who didn't help. Then, the author decided to publicly call out the person, leading to the person leaving. The owner and some players were upset, and someone called it cruel.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author was wrong. Let's break it down. Public shaming can be a sensitive issue. While the problem (bad odor) is valid, the method of addressing it matters. The person might have a valid reason for not showering, like a health issue or limited resources. Publicly humiliating them might not be the best approach. There are more respectful ways to handle it, like speaking to the person privately. The author's approach led to immediate results but at the cost of social backlash and possible harm to the person's dignity. \n\nOn the other hand, the author was trying to protect the comfort of others and the owner didn't help. But public shaming can be seen as aggressive and lacking empathy. The right answer here would likely lean towards the author being in the wrong because they chose a confrontational and public method instead of a more compassionate approach. So the answer is A."
