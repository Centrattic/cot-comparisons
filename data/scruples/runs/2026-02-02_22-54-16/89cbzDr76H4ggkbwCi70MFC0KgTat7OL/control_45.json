After the first round my friends and I all noticed a pretty foul body odor.  I get that MTG players have a stereotype of bad odor, and sometimes someone might have a little funk but this was pretty nasty.  We eventually found the source and it was a guy who nobody really talked to much.  He just came, played, and left each week.  Well we tried to ignore it since he had never had this issue before so I just assumed a freak occurrence.  It was gross, but we got through the night just fine.\n\nWell last week we went in for games and the moment he got to the tables we all recognized the same stench as the week before.  At this point I went to the owner and asked if he could say something, but he refused saying we should just try to ignore it.  Well after a round of play it got so bad that my friends and several other players were stepping outside between games just to get fresh air away from him.  I finally had it and before the next round started I loudly announced to everyone\n\n\"to whoever didn't bother to take a shower today or even this week could you please do us all a favor and learn basic hygiene.  This is disgusting and you should know better.\"\n\nEveryone went quiet and the guy in question finished his game quickly left the store.  While everyone initially seemed to appreciate what I'd done the owner gave me a few dirty looks as did a few other players.  One even approached me after the tournament and told me that was a cruel way to handle the situation.\n\nWas I wrong to do this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for loudly shaming someone about their hygiene at a Magic The Gathering event. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nFirst, the person noticed bad body odor from another attendee. They mentioned that this person had never had the issue before, so maybe it was a one-off, but then it happened again. The owner didn't want to address it, so the author decided to publicly call out the person. The response was mixed: some appreciated it, the owner was upset, and someone said it was cruel.\n\nHmm. The key points here are the method the author used to address the problem. Public shaming can be harsh, even if the intent is good. The question is whether the public confrontation was the right approach. Hygiene is a personal issue, and while it's important to be respectful, publicly humiliating someone might not be the best way to handle it. The author could have approached the person privately, maybe offered help or a suggestion without making them feel attacked. \n\nAlso, the fact that the person was a regular who didn't interact much with others might mean they didn't have a close relationship. Publicly calling them out might have been especially hurtful. The owner's refusal to address it could have been because he wanted to avoid confrontation or protect the customer. The author's action led to the person leaving quickly, which might have been their intention, but the method was confrontational and loud.\n\nOn the other hand, the author was trying to address a problem that was affecting others. The situation was uncomfortable for multiple people, and they felt ignored by the owner. The author might have felt that public shaming was the only way to get the message across, but that's a risky approach. There's a balance between standing up for your comfort and respecting others' dignity.\n\nI think the main issue is the public nature of the shaming. Even if the hygiene issue is valid, the way it was handled was probably too harsh. The author could have tried a different approach, like talking to the person privately or working with the owner in a more discreet manner. Publicly humiliating someone, even with good intentions, can be seen as cruel and unkind. So, the answer is likely A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
