After the first round my friends and I all noticed a pretty foul body odor.  I get that MTG players have a stereotype of bad odor, and sometimes someone might have a little funk but this was pretty nasty.  We eventually found the source and it was a guy who nobody really talked to much.  He just came, played, and left each week.  Well we tried to ignore it since he had never had this issue before so I just assumed a freak occurrence.  It was gross, but we got through the night just fine.\n\nWell last week we went in for games and the moment he got to the tables we all recognized the same stench as the week before.  At this point I went to the owner and asked if he could say something, but he refused saying we should just try to ignore it.  Well after a round of play it got so bad that my friends and several other players were stepping outside between games just to get fresh air away from him.  I finally had it and before the next round started I loudly announced to everyone\n\n\"to whoever didn't bother to take a shower today or even this week could you please do us all a favor and learn basic hygiene.  This is disgusting and you should know better.\"\n\nEveryone went quiet and the guy in question finished his game quickly left the store.  While everyone initially seemed to appreciate what I'd done the owner gave me a few dirty looks as did a few other players.  One even approached me after the tournament and told me that was a cruel way to handle the situation.\n\nWas I wrong to do this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the person who posted this on the AITA subreddit is in the wrong. Let me think through this.\n\nFirst, the situation: The person is part of a Magic: The Gathering group. Another person at the event had a very bad body odor, which was noticed by others. The first time, they tried to ignore it, assuming it was a one-off. The second time, it happened again, leading to people stepping outside for fresh air. The author went to the store owner, who refused to address it. Then, the author publicly shamed the person by loudly announcing a comment about their hygiene, leading the person to leave quickly and causing mixed reactions from others.\n\nNow, the main question is whether the author was wrong. Let's break it down.\n\nOn one hand, the author was trying to address a problem that was affecting their and others' experience. The body odor was so bad that people were leaving the store. The author took it upon themselves to speak up after the store owner didn't act. Publicly shaming someone, however, might be seen as harsh, especially if it was done in a confrontational way. The person who was shamed left quickly, which might indicate they were embarrassed or upset. The owner and some players disapproved, with one calling it cruel.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's intention was to improve the environment for everyone. They tried the more private route first by talking to the owner, but when that failed, they took direct action. The issue was affecting multiple people, so it wasn't just the author's problem. However, the public shaming could have been handled more sensitively. Maybe a private approach, like directly talking to the person without shaming them, would have been better. But given that the owner refused to act, the author might have felt that public confrontation was the only option.\n\nFactors to consider: Intent vs. Impact. The author's intent was to help, but the impact was public humiliation. Social etiquette often suggests addressing issues privately unless there's a health or safety issue. Body odor, while unpleasant, is a personal hygiene issue, not a health emergency. However, it's affecting others' comfort. The key here is how the author chose to address it. Public shaming might not be the best method, even if the issue is valid.\n\nAlso, the fact that the person in question didn't engage much with others might mean they were unaware of their odor. A kinder approach might have been more effective. Publicly calling them out could have led to embarrassment and maybe even a defensive reaction, rather than a constructive solution.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author took initiative when the store owner didn't, which is commendable, but the method might have been inappropriate. The owner's refusal to act could imply that the responsibility wasn't on the author to handle it, but they stepped in anyway. However, the public shaming might have crossed a line, even if the problem was real.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The author was addressing a legitimate issue that was affecting others, but the approach taken was arguably too harsh and public. While their intention was good, the method of loudly shaming the person might have been inappropriate. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for how they handled it, even if the issue itself was valid.\n"
