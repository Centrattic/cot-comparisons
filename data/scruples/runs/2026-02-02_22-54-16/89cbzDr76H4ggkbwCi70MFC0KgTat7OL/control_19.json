After the first round my friends and I all noticed a pretty foul body odor.  I get that MTG players have a stereotype of bad odor, and sometimes someone might have a little funk but this was pretty nasty.  We eventually found the source and it was a guy who nobody really talked to much.  He just came, played, and left each week.  Well we tried to ignore it since he had never had this issue before so I just assumed a freak occurrence.  It was gross, but we got through the night just fine.\n\nWell last week we went in for games and the moment he got to the tables we all recognized the same stench as the week before.  At this point I went to the owner and asked if he could say something, but he refused saying we should just try to ignore it.  Well after a round of play it got so bad that my friends and several other players were stepping outside between games just to get fresh air away from him.  I finally had it and before the next round started I loudly announced to everyone\n\n\"to whoever didn't bother to take a shower today or even this week could you please do us all a favor and learn basic hygiene.  This is disgusting and you should know better.\"\n\nEveryone went quiet and the guy in question finished his game quickly left the store.  While everyone initially seemed to appreciate what I'd done the owner gave me a few dirty looks as did a few other players.  One even approached me after the tournament and told me that was a cruel way to handle the situation.\n\nWas I wrong to do this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who posted this story is in the wrong. The situation is about loudly shaming someone for bad hygiene at an MTG event. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The person mentions that the odor was really bad, happened two weeks in a row, and others were also affected. They tried to ignore it at first, then asked the owner, who didn't help. So the person took it upon themselves to address it publicly.\n\nNow, thinking about the possible wrongs here. Public shaming is generally frowned upon because it can be hurtful and might not lead to a solution. The person didn't approach the individual privately first, which could have been a more respectful way. Also, the owner didn't want to get involved, so maybe there's a reason, like the person's personal issues or not wanting to create conflict.\n\nOn the other hand, the person was trying to address a genuine problem that affected others. The hygiene issue was causing discomfort, and they felt ignored by the owner. Their intent might have been to help, but the method was harsh. \n\nBut the fact that others left the store to get fresh air shows it's a real issue. However, the public confrontation might have been the wrong approach. Maybe a better way would be to talk to the person privately, offer support, or find another way without shaming. The owner's reaction and others' disapproval also suggest that the approach was considered too harsh.\n\nSo, while the problem exists, the way the person handled it could have been more considerate. Public shaming is often seen as inconsiderate, even if the intent is good. So the answer might be A, that the author is in the wrong for the method used, even if the situation is problematic.\n"
