After the first round my friends and I all noticed a pretty foul body odor.  I get that MTG players have a stereotype of bad odor, and sometimes someone might have a little funk but this was pretty nasty.  We eventually found the source and it was a guy who nobody really talked to much.  He just came, played, and left each week.  Well we tried to ignore it since he had never had this issue before so I just assumed a freak occurrence.  It was gross, but we got through the night just fine.\n\nWell last week we went in for games and the moment he got to the tables we all recognized the same stench as the week before.  At this point I went to the owner and asked if he could say something, but he refused saying we should just try to ignore it.  Well after a round of play it got so bad that my friends and several other players were stepping outside between games just to get fresh air away from him.  I finally had it and before the next round started I loudly announced to everyone\n\n\"to whoever didn't bother to take a shower today or even this week could you please do us all a favor and learn basic hygiene.  This is disgusting and you should know better.\"\n\nEveryone went quiet and the guy in question finished his game quickly left the store.  While everyone initially seemed to appreciate what I'd done the owner gave me a few dirty looks as did a few other players.  One even approached me after the tournament and told me that was a cruel way to handle the situation.\n\nWas I wrong to do this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for loudly shaming someone over their hygiene at an MTG event.\n\nFirst, the situation: the person noticed a foul odor in a card shop during an event. The first time, they tried to ignore it, assuming it was a one-off. The second time, the same guy had the same smell, others were stepping outside, the owner didn't help. Then the author publicly called out the guy, leading to him leaving quickly. The owner and some others disapproved.\n\nSo, the author's action was a public shaming. Even if the intention was to make a point about hygiene, doing it \"loudly\" in front of everyone might have been harsh. The person who approached them called it cruel, which is a key point. Public shaming can be hurtful and might not be the best approach. The owner not wanting to address it privately could be due to not wanting to embarrass the person or avoid conflict. The author's method might have been inconsiderate, even if the issue was valid. There might be more tactful ways to handle it, like approaching the person privately or using a kinder tone. Since the owner and others were upset, the author's approach likely had negative consequences beyond the immediate problem. So, the answer is probably A (they're in the wrong), but I need to make sure. Alternatively, if the action was justified because the owner refused to help and the smell was affecting others, maybe not. But the method of handling it seems to be the problem here.\n"
