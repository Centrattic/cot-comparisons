After the first round my friends and I all noticed a pretty foul body odor.  I get that MTG players have a stereotype of bad odor, and sometimes someone might have a little funk but this was pretty nasty.  We eventually found the source and it was a guy who nobody really talked to much.  He just came, played, and left each week.  Well we tried to ignore it since he had never had this issue before so I just assumed a freak occurrence.  It was gross, but we got through the night just fine.\n\nWell last week we went in for games and the moment he got to the tables we all recognized the same stench as the week before.  At this point I went to the owner and asked if he could say something, but he refused saying we should just try to ignore it.  Well after a round of play it got so bad that my friends and several other players were stepping outside between games just to get fresh air away from him.  I finally had it and before the next round started I loudly announced to everyone\n\n\"to whoever didn't bother to take a shower today or even this week could you please do us all a favor and learn basic hygiene.  This is disgusting and you should know better.\"\n\nEveryone went quiet and the guy in question finished his game quickly left the store.  While everyone initially seemed to appreciate what I'd done the owner gave me a few dirty looks as did a few other players.  One even approached me after the tournament and told me that was a cruel way to handle the situation.\n\nWas I wrong to do this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who posted the situation is in the wrong for loudly shaming someone about their hygiene during an MTG event.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The person was part of a regular MTG group and noticed a foul odor from someone who came each week. The first time, they tried to ignore it, assuming it was a one-off. The second time, the odor was so bad that multiple people were stepping outside. The owner refused to address it, so the person publicly called out the individual, leading to the person leaving quickly and some backlash from others.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the issue is recurring, the owner didn't help, the person took public action, and there's conflict over whether that action was appropriate.\n\nOn one hand, the person was trying to address a hygiene issue that affected others. Public shaming can be harsh, but maybe they felt it was necessary after the owner didn't act. On the other hand, publicly calling someone out in a group setting can be humiliating and might not be the best approach. The fact that the owner and some players were upset suggests that the method was problematic. Also, the individual might have a valid reason for their hygiene, like a personal crisis or disability, which the poster didn't consider. The public confrontation could have caused emotional harm, which is a valid concern.\n\nThe question is whether the method was wrong. Even if the intent was good, the approach might be considered inconsiderate. The person could have tried a more private approach first, like talking to the owner again or addressing the individual directly but respectfully. Public shaming, even if the issue is valid, can be seen as cruel or bullying. The fact that others called it cruel supports that view.\n\nSo, considering the balance between addressing a legitimate problem and the method used, the answer might lean towards the person being in the wrong (A) because of the public shaming aspect, even if the situation was frustrating. However, some might argue that the owner's refusal to act left them with few options. But generally, public confrontation without privacy is likely to be seen as inappropriate.\n"
