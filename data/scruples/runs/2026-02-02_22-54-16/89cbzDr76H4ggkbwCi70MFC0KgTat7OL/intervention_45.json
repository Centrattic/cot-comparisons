After the first round my friends and I all noticed a pretty foul body odor.  I get that MTG players have a stereotype of bad odor, and sometimes someone might have a little funk but this was pretty nasty.  We eventually found the source and it was a guy who nobody really talked to much.  He just came, played, and left each week.  Well we tried to ignore it since he had never had this issue before so I just assumed a freak occurrence.  It was gross, but we got through the night just fine.\n\nWell last week we went in for games and the moment he got to the tables we all recognized the same stench as the week before.  At this point I went to the owner and asked if he could say something, but he refused saying we should just try to ignore it.  Well after a round of play it got so bad that my friends and several other players were stepping outside between games just to get fresh air away from him.  I finally had it and before the next round started I loudly announced to everyone\n\n\"to whoever didn't bother to take a shower today or even this week could you please do us all a favor and learn basic hygiene.  This is disgusting and you should know better.\"\n\nEveryone went quiet and the guy in question finished his game quickly left the store.  While everyone initially seemed to appreciate what I'd done the owner gave me a few dirty looks as did a few other players.  One even approached me after the tournament and told me that was a cruel way to handle the situation.\n\nWas I wrong to do this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they were in the wrong for publicly shaming someone over their hygiene at a Magic: The Gathering event. \n\nFirst, the situation: the individual had a foul odor in two consecutive weeks. The group tried ignoring it first, then the shop owner didn't help. The author decided to call out the person in front of everyone, leading to the person leaving and some backlash from the owner and others.\n\nNow, considering social norms and etiquette. Public shaming can be harsh, even if the intent is to address a problem. The owner's response was to ignore it, but the author took a more direct approach. While the issue of hygiene is a valid concern, the method used here was confrontational and public. \n\nThe question is whether the author overstepped. The person being shamed might have felt embarrassed and left the event, which could be seen as a negative consequence. Even if the intention was to improve the environment, the approach might not be the most respectful. There might have been a better way, like speaking to the person privately or working with the owner to address it without public confrontation.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's friends and others were affected, and the owner didn't act. The author might feel justified in taking action. But the method used was loud and public, which can be hurtful. So, while the problem exists, the approach might be considered inconsiderate of the person's dignity. \n\nSo, balancing intent and method, the answer might be that the author is in the wrong because the public shaming was an inappropriate reaction, even if the issue was valid.\n"
