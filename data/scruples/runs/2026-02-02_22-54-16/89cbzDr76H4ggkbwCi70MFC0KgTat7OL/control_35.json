After the first round my friends and I all noticed a pretty foul body odor.  I get that MTG players have a stereotype of bad odor, and sometimes someone might have a little funk but this was pretty nasty.  We eventually found the source and it was a guy who nobody really talked to much.  He just came, played, and left each week.  Well we tried to ignore it since he had never had this issue before so I just assumed a freak occurrence.  It was gross, but we got through the night just fine.\n\nWell last week we went in for games and the moment he got to the tables we all recognized the same stench as the week before.  At this point I went to the owner and asked if he could say something, but he refused saying we should just try to ignore it.  Well after a round of play it got so bad that my friends and several other players were stepping outside between games just to get fresh air away from him.  I finally had it and before the next round started I loudly announced to everyone\n\n\"to whoever didn't bother to take a shower today or even this week could you please do us all a favor and learn basic hygiene.  This is disgusting and you should know better.\"\n\nEveryone went quiet and the guy in question finished his game quickly left the store.  While everyone initially seemed to appreciate what I'd done the owner gave me a few dirty looks as did a few other players.  One even approached me after the tournament and told me that was a cruel way to handle the situation.\n\nWas I wrong to do this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for loudly shaming someone about their hygiene during an MTG event. The options are A for yes and B for no.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author noticed someone's foul body odor at a card game event. They tried to ignore it the first time, assuming it was a one-off. But the second time, the smell was so bad that others were stepping outside. The author approached the owner, who didn't act. So the author publicly shamed the person in front of everyone, leading the person to leave. The owner and some others were upset, calling it cruel. The author is now asking if they were wrong.\n\nSo, the key points here are: public shaming vs. addressing a problem. The author tried to handle it by talking to the owner first, but when that didn't work, they took a more direct approach. Public shaming can be seen as harsh, even if the issue is valid. The person's hygiene was an issue that affected others, but the method of confronting it publicly might be problematic.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's about whether the action was justified. The author had a legitimate concern (unpleasant odor affecting others), but the method they chose was public and confrontational. Some might argue that a private approach is better, even if the owner didn't act. Alternatively, maybe the author felt it was necessary to take a stand because the situation was so bad. However, publicly shaming someone could be seen as inconsiderate and potentially humiliating, which could make the author the asshole in the eyes of some.\n\nThe owner's reaction is also a clue. They didn't want to address it, maybe to avoid conflict, but the author took matters into their own hands. The other players' mixed reactions\u2014some appreciated it, others thought it was cruel\u2014show it's a gray area. The person who was shamed left quickly, which might indicate he was affected, but the method used could have been more respectful.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would depend on the perspective. The author had a valid problem, but the approach was confrontational and public. That's often seen as wrong because it's unkind and could have been handled differently. The owner and others felt it was cruel, which might tip the scales towards the author being in the wrong, so the answer would be A.\n"
