After the first round my friends and I all noticed a pretty foul body odor.  I get that MTG players have a stereotype of bad odor, and sometimes someone might have a little funk but this was pretty nasty.  We eventually found the source and it was a guy who nobody really talked to much.  He just came, played, and left each week.  Well we tried to ignore it since he had never had this issue before so I just assumed a freak occurrence.  It was gross, but we got through the night just fine.\n\nWell last week we went in for games and the moment he got to the tables we all recognized the same stench as the week before.  At this point I went to the owner and asked if he could say something, but he refused saying we should just try to ignore it.  Well after a round of play it got so bad that my friends and several other players were stepping outside between games just to get fresh air away from him.  I finally had it and before the next round started I loudly announced to everyone\n\n\"to whoever didn't bother to take a shower today or even this week could you please do us all a favor and learn basic hygiene.  This is disgusting and you should know better.\"\n\nEveryone went quiet and the guy in question finished his game quickly left the store.  While everyone initially seemed to appreciate what I'd done the owner gave me a few dirty looks as did a few other players.  One even approached me after the tournament and told me that was a cruel way to handle the situation.\n\nWas I wrong to do this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong for loudly shaming someone about their hygiene during an MTG event. The options are A or B.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author and their friends noticed someone with a really bad body odor at the card shop. The person is a regular who usually doesn't have this problem. The first time, they tried to ignore it, thinking it was a one-off. But when it happened again, the author went to the owner, who didn't want to address it. Then the author publicly called out the person, leading to the guy leaving and some mixed reactions.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about public shaming versus addressing a problem. The user thinks the author isn't wrong, but I need to evaluate both sides. On one hand, the smell was affecting others to the point they were stepping outside, so it's a health and comfort issue. The owner didn't help, so maybe the author felt they had to act. But on the other hand, publicly shaming someone can be harsh and might not be the most considerate approach. It's possible the guy had a valid reason, like a medical issue or a bad day, that wasn't obvious. Also, the method of addressing it in front of everyone could have been unkind, even if the intent was to help.\n\nThe question is about whether the author was in the wrong. The tone of the post is defensive, so maybe the user is looking for validation. But the ethics here are tricky. While the intention was to improve the environment, the approach was confrontational and public. There might have been more private ways to handle it, like approaching the person directly or continuing to talk to the owner. Public shaming can lead to embarrassment and doesn't give the person a chance to respond or explain. It's also possible the person didn't realize their smell was an issue.\n\nThe owner and some players thought it was cruel, so the social repercussions are a factor. The author's action might have been justified in terms of personal discomfort, but the method could be considered harsh. So, the answer depends on balancing the negative impact of the odor against the negative impact of the public shaming. In many social situations, it's better to address issues privately to maintain dignity. Therefore, the author's public approach might be seen as wrong, even if the problem was real. So the answer might be A.\n"
