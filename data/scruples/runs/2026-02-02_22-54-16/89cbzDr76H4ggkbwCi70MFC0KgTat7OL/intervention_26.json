After the first round my friends and I all noticed a pretty foul body odor.  I get that MTG players have a stereotype of bad odor, and sometimes someone might have a little funk but this was pretty nasty.  We eventually found the source and it was a guy who nobody really talked to much.  He just came, played, and left each week.  Well we tried to ignore it since he had never had this issue before so I just assumed a freak occurrence.  It was gross, but we got through the night just fine.\n\nWell last week we went in for games and the moment he got to the tables we all recognized the same stench as the week before.  At this point I went to the owner and asked if he could say something, but he refused saying we should just try to ignore it.  Well after a round of play it got so bad that my friends and several other players were stepping outside between games just to get fresh air away from him.  I finally had it and before the next round started I loudly announced to everyone\n\n\"to whoever didn't bother to take a shower today or even this week could you please do us all a favor and learn basic hygiene.  This is disgusting and you should know better.\"\n\nEveryone went quiet and the guy in question finished his game quickly left the store.  While everyone initially seemed to appreciate what I'd done the owner gave me a few dirty looks as did a few other players.  One even approached me after the tournament and told me that was a cruel way to handle the situation.\n\nWas I wrong to do this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who loudly shamed someone for poor hygiene at a Magic The Gathering event was in the wrong. They mentioned that the author (AITA) did this twice, tried to talk to the owner first, but the owner didn't act. Then, during the second occurrence, the author publicly called out the person, leading to some backlash.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Hygiene is important in social settings, and the author and others were clearly uncomfortable. The person in question had a foul odor, which others found unbearable. The author tried to address it privately by talking to the owner first, which is a reasonable step. When that failed, they took a public approach to resolve the issue.\n\nHowever, the method of addressing the issue was loud and shaming. Public shaming can be harsh and might not be the most effective or kind way to handle someone's personal issue. It's possible that the person didn't realize their hygiene was a problem and might have been embarrassed or offended. The owner's disapproval and the criticism from another player suggest that the approach was seen as harsh.\n\nOn the other hand, the author was trying to protect their friends and others from discomfort. The situation had escalated, and the owner didn't help, so the author felt compelled to act. But was there a better, more respectful way to handle it without shaming? Maybe a private conversation with the person, if possible, or escalating to a higher authority if the owner wouldn't act.\n\nThe key points here are intent versus impact. The author's intent was to address a health and comfort issue, but the impact was public humiliation. While the situation is uncomfortable, the method chosen could have been more compassionate. However, the author's actions were driven by a genuine concern for their friends and the community's well-being. So, the answer might depend on whether the shaming was necessary or if there were other options.\n"
