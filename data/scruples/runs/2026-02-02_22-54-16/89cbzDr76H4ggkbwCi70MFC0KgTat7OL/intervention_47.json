After the first round my friends and I all noticed a pretty foul body odor.  I get that MTG players have a stereotype of bad odor, and sometimes someone might have a little funk but this was pretty nasty.  We eventually found the source and it was a guy who nobody really talked to much.  He just came, played, and left each week.  Well we tried to ignore it since he had never had this issue before so I just assumed a freak occurrence.  It was gross, but we got through the night just fine.\n\nWell last week we went in for games and the moment he got to the tables we all recognized the same stench as the week before.  At this point I went to the owner and asked if he could say something, but he refused saying we should just try to ignore it.  Well after a round of play it got so bad that my friends and several other players were stepping outside between games just to get fresh air away from him.  I finally had it and before the next round started I loudly announced to everyone\n\n\"to whoever didn't bother to take a shower today or even this week could you please do us all a favor and learn basic hygiene.  This is disgusting and you should know better.\"\n\nEveryone went quiet and the guy in question finished his game quickly left the store.  While everyone initially seemed to appreciate what I'd done the owner gave me a few dirty looks as did a few other players.  One even approached me after the tournament and told me that was a cruel way to handle the situation.\n\nWas I wrong to do this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for loudly shaming someone over poor hygiene during an MTG event. The situation is described where the person had a foul odor, and the author confronted them publicly in front of others, causing the person to leave.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author tried to handle the issue by talking to the owner first, who didn't help. Then, when the problem persisted, the author publicly called out the person. The friends and others were affected, stepping outside for fresh air. The author's intention was to stop the situation, but the method was public shaming.\n\nNow, the ethics here. Public shaming, even if the issue is valid, can be considered harsh. The person might have had a legitimate reason for the odor, like a medical issue or a bad day. The author's approach was direct and loud, which could be seen as embarrassing the person publicly. Even though the intention was good, the method might have been too harsh.\n\nBut on the other hand, the owner didn't act, and the others were also affected. The author might feel that it was necessary to protect their own comfort and that of others. However, the appropriate way might have been to address it privately, not in front of a crowd. Public shaming can lead to humiliation, which is why some people might say the author was wrong.\n\nThe person being shamed left quickly, so maybe they were unaware of the issue. The owner and some players didn't approve, which could indicate that the method was problematic. The user's friends appreciated it, but others thought it was cruel. So, there's a balance between standing up for one's comfort and respecting others' dignity.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author had a valid concern, the method of public confrontation might have been too harsh. The appropriate action might have been to address it privately or find another solution before shaming. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for the way they handled it.\n"
