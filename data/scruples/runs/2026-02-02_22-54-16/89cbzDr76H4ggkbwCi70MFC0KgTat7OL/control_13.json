After the first round my friends and I all noticed a pretty foul body odor.  I get that MTG players have a stereotype of bad odor, and sometimes someone might have a little funk but this was pretty nasty.  We eventually found the source and it was a guy who nobody really talked to much.  He just came, played, and left each week.  Well we tried to ignore it since he had never had this issue before so I just assumed a freak occurrence.  It was gross, but we got through the night just fine.\n\nWell last week we went in for games and the moment he got to the tables we all recognized the same stench as the week before.  At this point I went to the owner and asked if he could say something, but he refused saying we should just try to ignore it.  Well after a round of play it got so bad that my friends and several other players were stepping outside between games just to get fresh air away from him.  I finally had it and before the next round started I loudly announced to everyone\n\n\"to whoever didn't bother to take a shower today or even this week could you please do us all a favor and learn basic hygiene.  This is disgusting and you should know better.\"\n\nEveryone went quiet and the guy in question finished his game quickly left the store.  While everyone initially seemed to appreciate what I'd done the owner gave me a few dirty looks as did a few other players.  One even approached me after the tournament and told me that was a cruel way to handle the situation.\n\nWas I wrong to do this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for loudly shaming someone about their hygiene at a Magic: The Gathering event. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author goes to a card shop regularly with friends and others. In the first incident, they noticed a foul body odor, which was a problem. The assumption was that it was a one-time thing, maybe the guy had a bad day. Then, the same smell happened again, and people started stepping outside to get fresh air. The owner told them to ignore it, which they tried, but eventually, the author couldn't take it anymore and publicly called out the person for not showering, leading to the guy leaving and some backlash from the owner and others.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let me think about the possible angles. Public shaming is generally frowned upon because it can be harsh and embarrassing. The author chose to address the issue loudly in front of everyone, which might have made the situation uncomfortable for the person involved. Even if the problem is real, the approach could be considered inappropriate. The owner's refusal to handle it might mean they don't want such issues to be escalated publicly, perhaps to avoid conflicts or to maintain a welcoming environment where people feel comfortable.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might feel that the hygiene issue was affecting their experience and that of others, and they tried to inform the owner first. When the owner didn't act, the author might have felt compelled to take action themselves. However, the method of addressing it\u2014publicly shaming someone\u2014can have negative consequences. The person might have a valid reason for their odor, like a medical issue or financial hardship, which the author didn't consider. Public shaming can also lead to social isolation and might not encourage the person to improve but instead make them feel attacked.\n\nThe fact that the owner and some players gave dirty looks suggests that the author's approach was not well-received. The alternative suggestion from another player was to handle it more kindly, perhaps in private. The author's intention was to address a genuine issue, but the method was harsh and public. In most social and professional settings, addressing someone's hygiene should be done with tact and privacy, not in a public shaming manner. Even if the other people were also uncomfortable, the author's loud announcement could be seen as crossing a line from being a concerned individual to being confrontational and potentially cruel.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author might have been right to want the issue addressed but chose a method that was inappropriate. Therefore, they could be in the wrong for how they handled it, even if the problem existed. The correct approach would have been to talk to the person privately or involve the owner in a more constructive way, perhaps offering help or understanding rather than public criticism.\n"
