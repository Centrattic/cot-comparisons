After the first round my friends and I all noticed a pretty foul body odor.  I get that MTG players have a stereotype of bad odor, and sometimes someone might have a little funk but this was pretty nasty.  We eventually found the source and it was a guy who nobody really talked to much.  He just came, played, and left each week.  Well we tried to ignore it since he had never had this issue before so I just assumed a freak occurrence.  It was gross, but we got through the night just fine.\n\nWell last week we went in for games and the moment he got to the tables we all recognized the same stench as the week before.  At this point I went to the owner and asked if he could say something, but he refused saying we should just try to ignore it.  Well after a round of play it got so bad that my friends and several other players were stepping outside between games just to get fresh air away from him.  I finally had it and before the next round started I loudly announced to everyone\n\n\"to whoever didn't bother to take a shower today or even this week could you please do us all a favor and learn basic hygiene.  This is disgusting and you should know better.\"\n\nEveryone went quiet and the guy in question finished his game quickly left the store.  While everyone initially seemed to appreciate what I'd done the owner gave me a few dirty looks as did a few other players.  One even approached me after the tournament and told me that was a cruel way to handle the situation.\n\nWas I wrong to do this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is at fault for publicly shaming someone for bad hygiene during an MTG event. The situation started with a foul odor, which the group noticed. The first time, they tried to ignore it, maybe out of courtesy. The second time, it happened again, and the owner didn't want to address it. The author then spoke up loudly in front of everyone, leading to the person leaving.\n\nSo, the key points here are public shaming versus addressing a real issue. The author's intention was to improve the environment for everyone, which is understandable. But the method used was confrontational and public. The person in question might have had a valid reason for the odor, like a medical issue or financial hardship, and being called out in front of others could be hurtful and dehumanizing. The store owner's refusal to handle it privately might be due to policies or wanting to avoid conflict. The author's action, while perhaps well-meaning, bypassed any private approach and escalated it publicly, which can be seen as cruel or insensitive. The alternative would be to approach the person discreetly, maybe ask the owner to do so again, or find a less confrontational method. Since the author chose a public reprimand, it's likely they're in the wrong, so answer A.\n"
