After the first round my friends and I all noticed a pretty foul body odor.  I get that MTG players have a stereotype of bad odor, and sometimes someone might have a little funk but this was pretty nasty.  We eventually found the source and it was a guy who nobody really talked to much.  He just came, played, and left each week.  Well we tried to ignore it since he had never had this issue before so I just assumed a freak occurrence.  It was gross, but we got through the night just fine.\n\nWell last week we went in for games and the moment he got to the tables we all recognized the same stench as the week before.  At this point I went to the owner and asked if he could say something, but he refused saying we should just try to ignore it.  Well after a round of play it got so bad that my friends and several other players were stepping outside between games just to get fresh air away from him.  I finally had it and before the next round started I loudly announced to everyone\n\n\"to whoever didn't bother to take a shower today or even this week could you please do us all a favor and learn basic hygiene.  This is disgusting and you should know better.\"\n\nEveryone went quiet and the guy in question finished his game quickly left the store.  While everyone initially seemed to appreciate what I'd done the owner gave me a few dirty looks as did a few other players.  One even approached me after the tournament and told me that was a cruel way to handle the situation.\n\nWas I wrong to do this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for shaming someone over hygiene during an MTG event. Let's break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: the writer and friends noticed a foul body odor from another player. It happened twice. The first time, they tried ignoring it. The second time, they approached the owner, who didn't help. Then the writer publicly called out the person, leading to backlash.\n\nSo, the key points here. The writer's intention was to address a hygiene issue that was affecting others. But the method chosen was public shaming, which can be problematic. Public shaming can be harsh and may not consider the other person's circumstances. Maybe the person had a valid reason they couldn't shower, like a medical issue or lack of resources. The writer didn't give them a chance to address it privately first. Also, the owner and some players disapproved, suggesting that the approach was not the best. While the writer might have felt justified, the method used could have been more compassionate. The alternative would be to address it directly with the person or involve the owner in a more constructive way. So, the answer is likely A, the author is in the wrong because of the public shaming approach without considering the other person's privacy or potential reasons.\n"
