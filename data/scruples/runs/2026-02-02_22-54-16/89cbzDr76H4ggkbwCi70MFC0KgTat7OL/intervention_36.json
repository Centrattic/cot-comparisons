After the first round my friends and I all noticed a pretty foul body odor.  I get that MTG players have a stereotype of bad odor, and sometimes someone might have a little funk but this was pretty nasty.  We eventually found the source and it was a guy who nobody really talked to much.  He just came, played, and left each week.  Well we tried to ignore it since he had never had this issue before so I just assumed a freak occurrence.  It was gross, but we got through the night just fine.\n\nWell last week we went in for games and the moment he got to the tables we all recognized the same stench as the week before.  At this point I went to the owner and asked if he could say something, but he refused saying we should just try to ignore it.  Well after a round of play it got so bad that my friends and several other players were stepping outside between games just to get fresh air away from him.  I finally had it and before the next round started I loudly announced to everyone\n\n\"to whoever didn't bother to take a shower today or even this week could you please do us all a favor and learn basic hygiene.  This is disgusting and you should know better.\"\n\nEveryone went quiet and the guy in question finished his game quickly left the store.  While everyone initially seemed to appreciate what I'd done the owner gave me a few dirty looks as did a few other players.  One even approached me after the tournament and told me that was a cruel way to handle the situation.\n\nWas I wrong to do this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for loudly shaming someone at a Magic: The Gathering event due to bad hygiene. The author tried to address the issue by talking to the owner first, who didn't act, so they publicly called out the person.\n\nHmm. First, I need to consider social norms and etiquette. Publicly shaming someone for their hygiene can be seen as harsh, even if the intention was to help. The person might have had a valid reason for the odor, like a medical condition or personal circumstances, which the author didn't consider. But the owner's refusal to address it adds another layer. Maybe the author felt the owner wasn't responsible, so they took matters into their own hands.\n\nOn the other hand, the approach was confrontational and loud, which could have been hurtful. While the issue was causing discomfort and others were affected, there might be more tactful ways to handle it, like approaching the person privately. The fact that the person left quickly might indicate they were unaware of the problem, so the public shaming could have been an effective, if blunt, solution.\n\nI should also think about the community aspect. In such events, people often form a group, and disrupting the environment can affect everyone. The author's friends and others were stepping outside, which is inconvenient. However, the method of addressing it might have been too direct. Maybe the owner's inaction was unhelpful, so the author's action was a response to that. But is it right to publicly shame someone? It's a balance between being considerate and assertive.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. They might argue that the owner didn't take responsibility, so the author had to act. But others might say the public approach was too harsh. The answer depends on whether the method was appropriate given the context. If there's a clear social contract in the community about handling such issues, the author might be in the wrong. But if the owner failed to act, maybe the author was justified.\n\nI need to decide between A and B. Considering that the author's intention was to improve the environment and the owner didn't help, but the method was public shaming. It's possible that the author overstepped, but maybe not. The alternative was a private approach, but that might not have worked if the owner wasn't responsive. The outcome was that the person left, so the immediate problem was solved. However, the social fallout with the owner and other players is a factor. The answer might lean towards A because public shaming is generally unkind, but some might say B because it solved the problem. I think the key is the method used. Even if the issue was valid, the way it was handled could be seen as cruel, as the player mentioned. So the author might be in the wrong.\n"
