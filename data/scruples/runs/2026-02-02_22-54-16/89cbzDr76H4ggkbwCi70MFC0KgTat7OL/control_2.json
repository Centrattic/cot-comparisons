After the first round my friends and I all noticed a pretty foul body odor.  I get that MTG players have a stereotype of bad odor, and sometimes someone might have a little funk but this was pretty nasty.  We eventually found the source and it was a guy who nobody really talked to much.  He just came, played, and left each week.  Well we tried to ignore it since he had never had this issue before so I just assumed a freak occurrence.  It was gross, but we got through the night just fine.\n\nWell last week we went in for games and the moment he got to the tables we all recognized the same stench as the week before.  At this point I went to the owner and asked if he could say something, but he refused saying we should just try to ignore it.  Well after a round of play it got so bad that my friends and several other players were stepping outside between games just to get fresh air away from him.  I finally had it and before the next round started I loudly announced to everyone\n\n\"to whoever didn't bother to take a shower today or even this week could you please do us all a favor and learn basic hygiene.  This is disgusting and you should know better.\"\n\nEveryone went quiet and the guy in question finished his game quickly left the store.  While everyone initially seemed to appreciate what I'd done the owner gave me a few dirty looks as did a few other players.  One even approached me after the tournament and told me that was a cruel way to handle the situation.\n\nWas I wrong to do this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for loudly shaming someone about their hygiene at an MTG event. Let's start by looking at the key points in the situation.\n\nFirst, the person noticed a foul body odor in the card shop during an event. They tried to ignore it the first time, assuming it was a one-time thing. But the next week, the same person was there and the smell was even worse. The store owner didn't want to address it, and the author felt compelled to speak out in front of everyone. They made a loud announcement, which led the person to leave, and while some people appreciated it, the owner and others were upset. The question is whether the author was wrong.\n\nHmm. So, the main issue here is public shaming versus addressing a hygiene problem. The author's intention was to make the environment more comfortable for everyone. Hygiene is a personal matter, but in a public setting like a card shop, it can affect others. However, the method of addressing it\u2014publicly calling someone out in a loud and direct manner\u2014might be problematic.\n\nLet's break it down. On one hand, the author was trying to solve a problem that was affecting multiple people. They approached the owner first, who refused to act. So, they took it upon themselves. Publicly shaming someone can lead to embarrassment and possibly hurt feelings, which might not be the best approach. The person in question left quickly, so maybe the author's message was effective in stopping the issue.\n\nBut on the other hand, the way the author chose to address it was confrontational. Instead of approaching the person privately or finding a more diplomatic solution, they made a public announcement. This could be seen as harsh and unkind, even if the intent was to help. The owner's disapproval and the feedback from others suggest that the approach was too aggressive.\n\nThere's also the aspect of respecting others' privacy. The author made a general accusation without directly addressing the individual, which might have been more tactful if done in private. The comment about \"basic hygiene\" and implying the person didn't shower could be perceived as a personal attack rather than a constructive solution.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author's action was well-intentioned but poorly executed. They could have used a more discreet and respectful method, like approaching the person directly or working with the owner to find a private solution. Public shaming, even for a valid reason, can be seen as inconsiderate and potentially bullying. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for the manner in which they addressed the issue.\n"
