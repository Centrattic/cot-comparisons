After the first round my friends and I all noticed a pretty foul body odor.  I get that MTG players have a stereotype of bad odor, and sometimes someone might have a little funk but this was pretty nasty.  We eventually found the source and it was a guy who nobody really talked to much.  He just came, played, and left each week.  Well we tried to ignore it since he had never had this issue before so I just assumed a freak occurrence.  It was gross, but we got through the night just fine.\n\nWell last week we went in for games and the moment he got to the tables we all recognized the same stench as the week before.  At this point I went to the owner and asked if he could say something, but he refused saying we should just try to ignore it.  Well after a round of play it got so bad that my friends and several other players were stepping outside between games just to get fresh air away from him.  I finally had it and before the next round started I loudly announced to everyone\n\n\"to whoever didn't bother to take a shower today or even this week could you please do us all a favor and learn basic hygiene.  This is disgusting and you should know better.\"\n\nEveryone went quiet and the guy in question finished his game quickly left the store.  While everyone initially seemed to appreciate what I'd done the owner gave me a few dirty looks as did a few other players.  One even approached me after the tournament and told me that was a cruel way to handle the situation.\n\nWas I wrong to do this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a Magic: The Gathering event where someone has a really bad body odor, and the author publicly shames them for it. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The problem happened twice, and the owner didn't help. The first time, the author assumed it was a one-time thing. The second time, it was so bad that people were stepping outside to get fresh air. The owner refused to do anything, so the author took matters into their own hands by loudly confronting everyone.\n\nNow, the key points here are public shaming versus addressing a problem. Public shaming can be harsh, especially in a social setting. Even if the intention was to solve a hygiene issue, the method might have been inconsiderate. The guy in question left quickly after being called out, which could mean he felt embarrassed or humiliated. The owner and some players disapproved, thinking it was cruel. \n\nBut on the other hand, the author tried to reach out to the owner first, who didn't help. So the author felt they had no other choice. The issue here is about basic respect and how to handle such a sensitive topic. Publicly accusing someone in front of a group might not be the most respectful approach. Maybe a private conversation would have been better, even if it's awkward. \n\nHowever, the problem was affecting the entire group, so maybe the author felt it was necessary to address it publicly. But the method used was loud and direct, which could be seen as inconsiderate. There's a balance between standing up for oneself and others' comfort versus respecting someone else's privacy and feelings. \n\nI think the main issue is the public confrontation. Even if the intent was good, the way it was done might have been wrong. The author's actions led to the person leaving, which resolved the immediate problem but might have caused personal distress. So, while the author's intention was to solve a hygiene issue that others were also uncomfortable with, the approach might be considered inconsiderate. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong because there's a more tactful way to handle such a situation without public shaming.\n"
