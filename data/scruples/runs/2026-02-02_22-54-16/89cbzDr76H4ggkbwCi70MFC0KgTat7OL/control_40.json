After the first round my friends and I all noticed a pretty foul body odor.  I get that MTG players have a stereotype of bad odor, and sometimes someone might have a little funk but this was pretty nasty.  We eventually found the source and it was a guy who nobody really talked to much.  He just came, played, and left each week.  Well we tried to ignore it since he had never had this issue before so I just assumed a freak occurrence.  It was gross, but we got through the night just fine.\n\nWell last week we went in for games and the moment he got to the tables we all recognized the same stench as the week before.  At this point I went to the owner and asked if he could say something, but he refused saying we should just try to ignore it.  Well after a round of play it got so bad that my friends and several other players were stepping outside between games just to get fresh air away from him.  I finally had it and before the next round started I loudly announced to everyone\n\n\"to whoever didn't bother to take a shower today or even this week could you please do us all a favor and learn basic hygiene.  This is disgusting and you should know better.\"\n\nEveryone went quiet and the guy in question finished his game quickly left the store.  While everyone initially seemed to appreciate what I'd done the owner gave me a few dirty looks as did a few other players.  One even approached me after the tournament and told me that was a cruel way to handle the situation.\n\nWas I wrong to do this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for loudly shaming someone at a Magic The Gathering event because of their poor hygiene. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The writer and their friends noticed a foul smell from a regular player who had never had this issue before. They tried to ignore it the first time, but when it happened again, even the store owner refused to address it. Then the writer publicly called out the person, leading to the person leaving and some backlash from others.\n\nSo, the core issue here is public shaming versus addressing a problem. The writer's intention was to stop the bad odor, which affected others. But they did it in a loud and direct way, which might have been harsh. The person involved was a regular but not someone they knew well, and the owner didn't want to intervene. \n\nI should consider social norms and appropriate ways to handle such situations. Publicly shaming someone, even if the issue is legitimate, can be seen as inconsiderate or hurtful. It's possible that the person had a valid reason for the odor, like a medical issue or financial problem, that the writer didn't know about. \n\nThe store owner's reaction suggests that handling it privately might have been better. The other players stepping outside shows the problem was real, but the writer's approach may not have been the most compassionate or effective. The one person who called it cruel might support that the method was too harsh. \n\nSo, while the writer had a grievance, the way they addressed it was confrontational and public. Alternatives like approaching the person privately, using a more respectful tone, or working with the owner might have been better. Therefore, the answer might be that the writer is in the wrong (A) because their method was inappropriate even if the issue was valid.\n"
