After the first round my friends and I all noticed a pretty foul body odor.  I get that MTG players have a stereotype of bad odor, and sometimes someone might have a little funk but this was pretty nasty.  We eventually found the source and it was a guy who nobody really talked to much.  He just came, played, and left each week.  Well we tried to ignore it since he had never had this issue before so I just assumed a freak occurrence.  It was gross, but we got through the night just fine.\n\nWell last week we went in for games and the moment he got to the tables we all recognized the same stench as the week before.  At this point I went to the owner and asked if he could say something, but he refused saying we should just try to ignore it.  Well after a round of play it got so bad that my friends and several other players were stepping outside between games just to get fresh air away from him.  I finally had it and before the next round started I loudly announced to everyone\n\n\"to whoever didn't bother to take a shower today or even this week could you please do us all a favor and learn basic hygiene.  This is disgusting and you should know better.\"\n\nEveryone went quiet and the guy in question finished his game quickly left the store.  While everyone initially seemed to appreciate what I'd done the owner gave me a few dirty looks as did a few other players.  One even approached me after the tournament and told me that was a cruel way to handle the situation.\n\nWas I wrong to do this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author was wrong to publicly shame someone for bad hygiene during an MTG event. The key points here are the public shaming, the context of the situation, and the reactions from others.\n\nFirst, the author noticed a foul odor in previous weeks. The first time, they tried to ignore it, assuming it was a one-off. The second time, even after approaching the owner, who didn't act, the author decided to speak out. They made a loud announcement in front of everyone, which led to the person leaving quickly and some backlash from others.\n\nNow, considering social norms and etiquette, public shaming is generally frowned upon because it can be harsh and humiliating. Even if the issue is valid, the method of addressing it matters. The author's approach was direct and confrontational in front of a group, which might have been seen as cruel, even if the intent was to solve a problem. The owner and others disapproved, suggesting that the approach was too aggressive.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's friends and others were affected, stepping outside for fresh air. The hygiene issue was significant enough to disrupt the event. The owner's refusal to address it left the author with fewer options. However, there might have been more private ways to handle it, like approaching the person directly or suggesting a meeting with the owner.\n\nThe key here is the method of confrontation. Public shaming vs. private discussion. While the issue was real, the loud public announcement might have crossed into being inconsiderate of the person's dignity. The author's action, while perhaps well-intentioned, led to immediate backlash, indicating that the community might value discretion more than direct confrontation.\n\nSo, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because the method used was inappropriate, even if the concern was valid. More tactful approaches could have been taken to address the hygiene issue without public shaming.\n"
