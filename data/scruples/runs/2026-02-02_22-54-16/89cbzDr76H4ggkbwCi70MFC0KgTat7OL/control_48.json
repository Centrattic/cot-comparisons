After the first round my friends and I all noticed a pretty foul body odor.  I get that MTG players have a stereotype of bad odor, and sometimes someone might have a little funk but this was pretty nasty.  We eventually found the source and it was a guy who nobody really talked to much.  He just came, played, and left each week.  Well we tried to ignore it since he had never had this issue before so I just assumed a freak occurrence.  It was gross, but we got through the night just fine.\n\nWell last week we went in for games and the moment he got to the tables we all recognized the same stench as the week before.  At this point I went to the owner and asked if he could say something, but he refused saying we should just try to ignore it.  Well after a round of play it got so bad that my friends and several other players were stepping outside between games just to get fresh air away from him.  I finally had it and before the next round started I loudly announced to everyone\n\n\"to whoever didn't bother to take a shower today or even this week could you please do us all a favor and learn basic hygiene.  This is disgusting and you should know better.\"\n\nEveryone went quiet and the guy in question finished his game quickly left the store.  While everyone initially seemed to appreciate what I'd done the owner gave me a few dirty looks as did a few other players.  One even approached me after the tournament and told me that was a cruel way to handle the situation.\n\nWas I wrong to do this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who posted the story is in the wrong for loudly shaming someone about their hygiene during an MTG event.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The person noticed a foul odor during two different gatherings, tried to ignore it initially, approached the owner who didn't help, and then publicly shamed the individual, leading to immediate consequences. The owner and some players disapproved, so the question is whether the author is wrong.\n\nThe key points here are public shaming and how to address hygiene issues. Hygiene is a personal matter, and while it's understandable that the smell was uncomfortable, the method of addressing it was confrontational and public. Publicly calling someone out in front of others can be seen as harsh and potentially humiliating, even if the intent was to correct a problem. The person might not have had control over their hygiene due to various reasons, and the public shaming could have been hurtful.\n\nHowever, the author tried to address the issue through the owner first, which is a responsible step. But when that didn't work, they took matters into their own hands. The question is about the appropriateness of the method. Public shaming, even if well-intentioned, can cross a line. It's possible that a more private approach, like directly confronting the individual without the crowd, might have been more respectful. But the situation escalated because the smell affected others, and the owner didn't act.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might have felt that their discomfort and the discomfort of others was justified in needing immediate action. The problem is that the method used was public and loud, which can be considered inconsiderate towards the person's dignity. While the intent was to stop the unpleasant situation, the approach might have been misguided. There's a balance between addressing a problem and respecting someone's privacy and feelings.\n\nAnother angle is social norms and etiquette. In a community setting like a card shop, people might have different expectations about how to handle such issues. The owner's refusal to address it could have contributed to the author's decision to act. However, the public nature of the shaming might have been the main issue here. It's possible that the author's action, while based on frustration, wasn't the most appropriate way to handle the situation.\n\nConsidering all these factors, the answer hinges on whether the public shaming was the right approach. Since the author's action led to the person leaving quickly and others having mixed reactions, it's a judgment call. But in terms of social etiquette, publicly shaming someone for hygiene, even if true, is usually considered inconsiderate and inappropriate. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong because the method used was too harsh and public, even if the intent was good.\n"
