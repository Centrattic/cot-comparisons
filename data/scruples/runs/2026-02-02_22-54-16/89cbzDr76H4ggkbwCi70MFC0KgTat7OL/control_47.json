After the first round my friends and I all noticed a pretty foul body odor.  I get that MTG players have a stereotype of bad odor, and sometimes someone might have a little funk but this was pretty nasty.  We eventually found the source and it was a guy who nobody really talked to much.  He just came, played, and left each week.  Well we tried to ignore it since he had never had this issue before so I just assumed a freak occurrence.  It was gross, but we got through the night just fine.\n\nWell last week we went in for games and the moment he got to the tables we all recognized the same stench as the week before.  At this point I went to the owner and asked if he could say something, but he refused saying we should just try to ignore it.  Well after a round of play it got so bad that my friends and several other players were stepping outside between games just to get fresh air away from him.  I finally had it and before the next round started I loudly announced to everyone\n\n\"to whoever didn't bother to take a shower today or even this week could you please do us all a favor and learn basic hygiene.  This is disgusting and you should know better.\"\n\nEveryone went quiet and the guy in question finished his game quickly left the store.  While everyone initially seemed to appreciate what I'd done the owner gave me a few dirty looks as did a few other players.  One even approached me after the tournament and told me that was a cruel way to handle the situation.\n\nWas I wrong to do this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for loudly shaming someone about their hygiene during an MTG event. The question is whether the author (AITA) made the right choice.\n\nFirst, the situation: the author and their friends noticed a foul odor from a regular player who usually doesn't have that. They tried to ignore it the first time, but the second time, the owner refused to address it. The author then publicly confronted the person, leading to the guy leaving and some backlash from the owner and other players.\n\nSo, the key points here are about handling a hygiene issue in a public setting, especially in a social group like a card shop where people interact regularly. The author's approach was to loudly shame the individual, which is a direct and public method. The other people were also uncomfortable, but the owner didn't help, so the author took matters into their own hands.\n\nNow, considering right and wrong. Public shaming can be seen as harsh and may cause embarrassment. Even if the intention was to help, the method might have been inappropriate. The alternative could have been a more private approach, like speaking directly to the person or using a different method to address it without humiliating them. \n\nThe fact that others were also leaving, and the owner didn't act, might support the idea that the situation was serious. But the author's action led to the person leaving immediately, which might have been the desired outcome, but the manner of confrontation is questionable. \n\nIn terms of social norms, many would argue that addressing someone in a private and respectful way is better. Public shaming can damage relationships and make someone feel attacked, which isn't constructive. The owner's dirty looks and others' reactions suggest that the community values discretion and kindness. \n\nSo, even if the author's intention was good, the method of loud public shaming is likely considered wrong. The correct approach would have been to handle it privately, perhaps with a gentle nudge or through the owner more respectfully. Therefore, the author's action is in the wrong.\n"
