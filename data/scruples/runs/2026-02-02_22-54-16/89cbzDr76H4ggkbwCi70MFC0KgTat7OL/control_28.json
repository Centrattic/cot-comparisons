After the first round my friends and I all noticed a pretty foul body odor.  I get that MTG players have a stereotype of bad odor, and sometimes someone might have a little funk but this was pretty nasty.  We eventually found the source and it was a guy who nobody really talked to much.  He just came, played, and left each week.  Well we tried to ignore it since he had never had this issue before so I just assumed a freak occurrence.  It was gross, but we got through the night just fine.\n\nWell last week we went in for games and the moment he got to the tables we all recognized the same stench as the week before.  At this point I went to the owner and asked if he could say something, but he refused saying we should just try to ignore it.  Well after a round of play it got so bad that my friends and several other players were stepping outside between games just to get fresh air away from him.  I finally had it and before the next round started I loudly announced to everyone\n\n\"to whoever didn't bother to take a shower today or even this week could you please do us all a favor and learn basic hygiene.  This is disgusting and you should know better.\"\n\nEveryone went quiet and the guy in question finished his game quickly left the store.  While everyone initially seemed to appreciate what I'd done the owner gave me a few dirty looks as did a few other players.  One even approached me after the tournament and told me that was a cruel way to handle the situation.\n\nWas I wrong to do this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they were in the wrong for publicly shaming someone about their hygiene during an MTG event. The situation started when a player had a bad odor, which happened twice. The first time, they tried to ignore it, but the second time, the owner didn't help, so the person publicly called out the individual, leading the person to leave quickly. Now, others are upset, including the owner and some players.\n\nSo, the main points are: public shaming, addressing a personal issue in front of others, and the consequences. The key here is whether the method used was appropriate. Public shaming can be harsh and might not be the best approach for sensitive issues like hygiene, which can have personal reasons (like medical issues, financial constraints, or just not realizing the smell). The person might not have had intent to be offensive, but the public nature of the comment could have made it feel cruel, as one person mentioned. The owner's refusal to address it privately might have been a better route. However, the person was trying to address a problem that others were also uncomfortable with, so there's a balancing act between being respectful and addressing a genuine issue. The answer likely depends on cultural or social norms, but generally, public shaming is considered harsh. So, the person might be in the wrong for not handling it more privately and kindly.\n"
