After the first round my friends and I all noticed a pretty foul body odor.  I get that MTG players have a stereotype of bad odor, and sometimes someone might have a little funk but this was pretty nasty.  We eventually found the source and it was a guy who nobody really talked to much.  He just came, played, and left each week.  Well we tried to ignore it since he had never had this issue before so I just assumed a freak occurrence.  It was gross, but we got through the night just fine.\n\nWell last week we went in for games and the moment he got to the tables we all recognized the same stench as the week before.  At this point I went to the owner and asked if he could say something, but he refused saying we should just try to ignore it.  Well after a round of play it got so bad that my friends and several other players were stepping outside between games just to get fresh air away from him.  I finally had it and before the next round started I loudly announced to everyone\n\n\"to whoever didn't bother to take a shower today or even this week could you please do us all a favor and learn basic hygiene.  This is disgusting and you should know better.\"\n\nEveryone went quiet and the guy in question finished his game quickly left the store.  While everyone initially seemed to appreciate what I'd done the owner gave me a few dirty looks as did a few other players.  One even approached me after the tournament and told me that was a cruel way to handle the situation.\n\nWas I wrong to do this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for publicly shaming someone for their hygiene during an MTG event. The situation is that the writer and their friends noticed a foul odor from a regular but quiet attendee for two weeks. The first time, they just ignored it, but the second time, the writer confronted the issue by addressing the person in front of everyone, causing him to leave and getting some backlash.\n\nHmm, so the main question is whether the writer's action was appropriate. The user thinks the writer isn't in the wrong, but wants my opinion. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, the writer's intention was to address a problem that was affecting their experience and others'. The owner didn't want to take action, so they took it upon themselves. That shows initiative, but the method might be questionable. Public shaming can be harsh, even if done with good intentions. The guy might have had a valid reason\u2014like a health issue or financial hardship\u2014for not being able to maintain hygiene, which the writer didn't consider.\n\nOn the other hand, the writer might not have known the man's circumstances. But the approach of loudly announcing it in front of everyone without a private conversation could be seen as inconsiderate. The store owner's reaction and others' criticism suggest that the method was too direct. Even if the writer felt justified, the way they handled it might have been unkind. \n\nHygiene is a sensitive topic because it can touch on personal issues. The writer's solution was effective in that the person left, but the manner could have been more compassionate. Maybe approaching the person individually or suggesting a gentler method, like a note or discreet comment, would have been better. Public shaming might lead to embarrassment and could have been avoided. \n\nSo while the problem was real and the owner didn't act, the writer's choice of public confrontation might be where they went wrong. The answer is likely A, yes, the writer is in the wrong for the method used, even if the issue itself was valid.\n"
