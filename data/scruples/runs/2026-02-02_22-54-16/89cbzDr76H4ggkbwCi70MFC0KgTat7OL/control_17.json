After the first round my friends and I all noticed a pretty foul body odor.  I get that MTG players have a stereotype of bad odor, and sometimes someone might have a little funk but this was pretty nasty.  We eventually found the source and it was a guy who nobody really talked to much.  He just came, played, and left each week.  Well we tried to ignore it since he had never had this issue before so I just assumed a freak occurrence.  It was gross, but we got through the night just fine.\n\nWell last week we went in for games and the moment he got to the tables we all recognized the same stench as the week before.  At this point I went to the owner and asked if he could say something, but he refused saying we should just try to ignore it.  Well after a round of play it got so bad that my friends and several other players were stepping outside between games just to get fresh air away from him.  I finally had it and before the next round started I loudly announced to everyone\n\n\"to whoever didn't bother to take a shower today or even this week could you please do us all a favor and learn basic hygiene.  This is disgusting and you should know better.\"\n\nEveryone went quiet and the guy in question finished his game quickly left the store.  While everyone initially seemed to appreciate what I'd done the owner gave me a few dirty looks as did a few other players.  One even approached me after the tournament and told me that was a cruel way to handle the situation.\n\nWas I wrong to do this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about someone shaming a fellow MTG player for bad hygiene. The user is asking if that's their fault.\n\nFirst, the context: the person smelled bad, and it happened twice. The first time, they tried to ignore it, but the second time, the owner didn't help. The author then publicly called the person out in front of others, leading to the person leaving quickly. Some people appreciated it, others thought it was cruel.\n\nSo the key points here are: the author's actions were public shaming, which can be hurtful. Even if the issue was a problem, the way they addressed it might have been harsh. Publicly calling someone out like that could be considered unkind, even if the intention was to solve a hygiene issue. The owner didn't want to intervene, maybe because it's a sensitive topic. The author took it upon themselves, but maybe there's a better way, like a private conversation. \n\nBut then, the person was affecting others' experience, making them step outside for fresh air. So there's a valid concern about their comfort. However, the method used was loud and public. So maybe the right approach would have been to talk to the person privately or find another solution without humiliating them.\n\nIn terms of social norms, shaming someone in public is often seen as wrong because it's unkind and can lead to embarrassment. Even if the issue is real, the approach matters. The author might be in the wrong for the method, even if the problem exists. So I think the answer is A (author is in the wrong). But I need to be careful here. Some might argue that the author was justified because the smell was affecting others. But the way they handled it was inappropriate. So the answer is A.\n"
