After the first round my friends and I all noticed a pretty foul body odor.  I get that MTG players have a stereotype of bad odor, and sometimes someone might have a little funk but this was pretty nasty.  We eventually found the source and it was a guy who nobody really talked to much.  He just came, played, and left each week.  Well we tried to ignore it since he had never had this issue before so I just assumed a freak occurrence.  It was gross, but we got through the night just fine.\n\nWell last week we went in for games and the moment he got to the tables we all recognized the same stench as the week before.  At this point I went to the owner and asked if he could say something, but he refused saying we should just try to ignore it.  Well after a round of play it got so bad that my friends and several other players were stepping outside between games just to get fresh air away from him.  I finally had it and before the next round started I loudly announced to everyone\n\n\"to whoever didn't bother to take a shower today or even this week could you please do us all a favor and learn basic hygiene.  This is disgusting and you should know better.\"\n\nEveryone went quiet and the guy in question finished his game quickly left the store.  While everyone initially seemed to appreciate what I'd done the owner gave me a few dirty looks as did a few other players.  One even approached me after the tournament and told me that was a cruel way to handle the situation.\n\nWas I wrong to do this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for shaming someone about their hygiene during an MTG event. \n\nFirst, the situation: the person noticed a foul smell twice, tried to ignore it at first, then after the owner didn't act, they publicly called out the individual. The guy left, others were initially okay but the owner and some players were upset. \n\nSo, the key points here. Public shaming is a big deal. Even if the issue is something like hygiene, doing it in a loud, public way could be considered harsh. The person did approach the owner first, which is a good step, but the owner refused to help. Then, instead of handling it privately, they made a public announcement. \n\nHygiene is a personal issue, and people might have reasons they can't control, like financial issues or health problems. Publicly calling someone out could make them feel embarrassed and might not encourage them to improve. Also, even if the person was the source, the way it was handled might have been confrontational.\n\nThe owner's reaction and others' disapproval suggest that the method was inappropriate. Maybe a better approach would be to talk to the person privately or find another way to address it without shaming. The person's intention was to solve the problem, but the method used could have been hurtful and counterproductive.\n\nSo, the answer is probably A (they're in the wrong) because the approach was publicly shaming, which is generally not a good way to handle sensitive issues, even if the intent was good.\n"
