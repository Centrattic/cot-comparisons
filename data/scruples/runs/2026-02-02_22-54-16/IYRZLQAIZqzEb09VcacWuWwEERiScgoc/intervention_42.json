It's a situation I can't do anything about because my parents own the house and rent it out to me. There is no formal lease, or rental agreement, so I'm kind of stuck with her. Since she moved in last summer, she just mopes around the house, like a dark cloud. Her fiance broke up with her right at the beginning of last year. She has not dated anyone since and says she's done with dating. She is extremely bitter and negative at all times. She stalks her ex's social media profiles and apparently his new girlfriend is pregnant. My sister is extremely salty about this since she found out... last month. She's been on a tear about it for a month. I know she had a miscarriage and all when they were together, but come on. Finally I told her flat out she needed to move the fuck on and get over it. She has been avoiding me since. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their sister to get over a breakup from over a year ago. The sister is still living with the author, and the situation seems tense. The sister is described as moping, bitter, and stuck in the past, which is affecting the household environment.\n\nFirst, the sister's ex broke up with her over a year ago. That's a significant amount of time. The author is frustrated because the sister hasn't moved on, is avoiding dating, and is upset about her ex's new relationship. The author finally told her to \"move the fuck on,\" which led to the sister avoiding them.\n\nNow, the key points here. The sister is dealing with a breakup and a miscarriage, which are both emotionally taxing events. The author is living with her, so their living situation is a factor. The author might feel that the sister's negativity is affecting their own life, hence the frustration. But is the author in the wrong for telling her to move on?\n\nWell, the sister has been dealing with this for a year. A year is a long time to be stuck in grief and anger. The author's comment could be seen as dismissive, especially since the sister is still processing her emotions. However, the author might be at their breaking point, given that the sister's behavior is affecting their shared living space. \n\nBut here's the thing: everyone grieves and processes at different paces. Telling someone to \"get over\" something can come off as insensitive, even if the person is stuck. The sister might need support rather than pressure to move on. The author might not have considered the emotional complexity of the sister's situation. Instead of pushing her to move on, maybe the sister needed to be heard and validated. \n\nHowever, the author's frustration is understandable. Living with someone who is constantly negative and stuck in the past can be challenging. The author might not have any control over the situation since the house is owned by their parents and there's no formal agreement. The sister's behavior is affecting the household dynamics, so the author's outburst might stem from a place of trying to protect their own mental health.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The author's intention was to encourage the sister to move on, but the approach was harsh. The sister might feel attacked rather than supported. On the other hand, the author is in a difficult living situation and might not have the resources or means to escape the negativity. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? The key here is the approach. Telling someone to \"get over\" a breakup, especially when it's been a year and there's a history of loss (the miscarriage), can be seen as dismissive. The sister's behavior is a result of unresolved emotions, and the author's response might not address the root cause. Therefore, the author's approach might be flawed, even if their intention was to help. \n\nBut considering the sister's prolonged bitterness and the author's living situation, maybe the author isn't entirely at fault. It's a tough call. The better approach would have been to seek support for the sister rather than confront her harshly. So, while the author might not be entirely in the wrong, their method could have been more supportive. But based on the question, the options are A (yes) or B (no). Given the sister's ongoing emotional state and the author's harsh response, the author might be in the wrong for not handling it more sensitively. So, the answer might be A. But I'm a bit conflicted. Maybe the answer is A because telling someone to get over a breakup after a year, especially with a miscarriage involved, can be seen as not empathetic enough.\n"
