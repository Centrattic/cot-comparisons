It's a situation I can't do anything about because my parents own the house and rent it out to me. There is no formal lease, or rental agreement, so I'm kind of stuck with her. Since she moved in last summer, she just mopes around the house, like a dark cloud. Her fiance broke up with her right at the beginning of last year. She has not dated anyone since and says she's done with dating. She is extremely bitter and negative at all times. She stalks her ex's social media profiles and apparently his new girlfriend is pregnant. My sister is extremely salty about this since she found out... last month. She's been on a tear about it for a month. I know she had a miscarriage and all when they were together, but come on. Finally I told her flat out she needed to move the fuck on and get over it. She has been avoiding me since. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who told their sister to move on from a year-old breakup is in the wrong. The sister is still upset, acting out, and the author feels stuck living with her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The breakup happened over a year ago. The sister is still moping, which is affecting the household. The author is living in a situation where they can't move out because their parents own the house. The sister is bitter, stalking her ex, and acting negatively. The author's frustration led them to tell their sister to \"get over it.\"\n\nNow, I should think about emotional support. Everyone processes grief differently. A year is a long time, but maybe the sister is still dealing with the emotional aftermath, especially with the miscarriage mentioned. The author's direct approach might have been harsh, even if their intention was to help. The sister's reaction of avoiding the author suggests it might have been hurtful.\n\nHowever, the sister's behavior is impacting the author's life negatively. The author might feel they're being neglected or that the sister isn't contributing positively. But pushing someone to move on can sometimes backfire, especially if they're not ready. The author could have approached it with more empathy, maybe offering support instead of demanding change.\n\nThe key here is whether the author's approach was compassionate. Insulting or demanding someone to move on without understanding their feelings can be hurtful. But the sister's behavior is also affecting the household, so the author isn't entirely at fault either. It's a complex situation where both parties might have valid points.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's intent was to help, the method might have been too abrupt and lacking in empathy. So the answer might be that the author is in the wrong. But I need to check if that's the case.\n"
