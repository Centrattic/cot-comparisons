It's a situation I can't do anything about because my parents own the house and rent it out to me. There is no formal lease, or rental agreement, so I'm kind of stuck with her. Since she moved in last summer, she just mopes around the house, like a dark cloud. Her fiance broke up with her right at the beginning of last year. She has not dated anyone since and says she's done with dating. She is extremely bitter and negative at all times. She stalks her ex's social media profiles and apparently his new girlfriend is pregnant. My sister is extremely salty about this since she found out... last month. She's been on a tear about it for a month. I know she had a miscarriage and all when they were together, but come on. Finally I told her flat out she needed to move the fuck on and get over it. She has been avoiding me since. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who told their sister to get over a breakup is in the wrong. The sister's ex broke up with her over a year ago, and she's been really negative since, especially after finding out her ex has a new girlfriend who's pregnant. The author told her to move on, and now the sister is avoiding them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The sister's emotional state: she had a miscarriage when they were together. That's a significant event that could affect how she processes the breakup. Grief from a miscarriage can be intense and long-lasting, so maybe she's still dealing with that trauma. The breakup was a year ago, but the new girlfriend's pregnancy is a recent trigger. \n\nThe author lives with the sister in a situation where they can't move out, so tension might be high because of the living arrangement. The sister's behavior\u2014moping, bitterness, stalking social media\u2014suggests she's stuck in her grief and anger. The author's frustration is understandable, but the way they expressed it (telling her to \"get over it\") might be hurtful. \n\nIs it the author's fault? Well, the sister's actions are harmful to the household environment. The author might feel they need to set boundaries. However, telling someone to \"get over\" a breakup, especially with a dismissive tone (\"move the fuck on\"), can be invalidating. It might make the sister feel unsupported and unacknowledged. \n\nBut the sister is also not helping herself by staying stuck in the past. The author's approach might not be the best, but the sister's behavior is problematic too. The question is whether the author was wrong. The key here is whether the author's reaction was appropriate. Sometimes, people need to be told to move on, but the method matters. If the author said it in a supportive way, it's different from a harsh comment. \n\nIn the scenario, the author says \"get over it\" in a blunt manner. That could be seen as dismissive of the sister's feelings. Even if the sister is being difficult, the author's tone might have been unkind. However, the sister's behavior is affecting their shared living space, so the author has a valid concern. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a tricky balance. The sister's actions are the root of the problem, but the author's approach might have been unhelpful. The answer isn't black and white. However, in terms of right and wrong, the author might be partially at fault for not addressing the situation more empathetically. But if the sister's behavior is unbearable, the author might be justified in trying to set boundaries. \n\nI think the answer leans towards the author not being in the wrong because the sister's actions are causing ongoing issues. However, the way they expressed it could be improved. But the question is whether they are in the wrong, and given that they were trying to address a problem, maybe the answer is B (No). But I'm a bit conflicted because the approach was harsh. Alternatively, maybe A because they didn't handle it compassionately. Hmm.\n"
