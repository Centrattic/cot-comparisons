It's a situation I can't do anything about because my parents own the house and rent it out to me. There is no formal lease, or rental agreement, so I'm kind of stuck with her. Since she moved in last summer, she just mopes around the house, like a dark cloud. Her fiance broke up with her right at the beginning of last year. She has not dated anyone since and says she's done with dating. She is extremely bitter and negative at all times. She stalks her ex's social media profiles and apparently his new girlfriend is pregnant. My sister is extremely salty about this since she found out... last month. She's been on a tear about it for a month. I know she had a miscarriage and all when they were together, but come on. Finally I told her flat out she needed to move the fuck on and get over it. She has been avoiding me since. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their sister to get over a breakup from over a year ago. The sister lives with the author, and they can't move out because the parents own the house. The sister has been moping, being bitter, stalking her ex's social media, and reacting negatively to his new girlfriend's pregnancy. The author finally told her to move on, and now the sister is avoiding them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The breakup was over a year ago, which is a significant amount of time. The sister hasn't dated anyone since, which might indicate she's stuck. The author is living in a situation where they can't leave, so they're dealing with this negative environment daily. The sister's behavior is affecting the household dynamics, making it a stressful environment for the author.\n\nThe sister's actions\u2014stalking social media, being bitter, and reacting strongly to the ex's new girlfriend\u2014might be signs of unresolved grief. But the author is frustrated and finally snapped, telling her to move on. The key here is whether the author's response was appropriate. \n\nOn one hand, the author might feel that after a year, it's time to heal. On the other hand, healing timelines vary, and the sister might still be in a difficult place. However, the sister's behavior is affecting the entire household. The author might not be in the wrong here because they're trying to set boundaries for their own well-being. It's possible that the sister's actions are toxic, and the author is just asking her to address her own issues. But was the author too harsh? Maybe the sister needed empathy rather than a direct confrontation. \n\nBut considering the context provided, the author's frustration is understandable. They're sharing a living space and can't escape the sister's negativity. The sister's actions are impacting the author's quality of life. So, the author might not be in the wrong for setting a boundary, even if the approach was harsh. However, the way they expressed it (\"move the fuck on\") might have been insensitive. Maybe a more compassionate approach would have been better, but in terms of responsibility, the sister's behavior might be the root of the problem. \n\nSo, the answer might be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because the sister's actions are causing issues, and the author is justified in wanting her to move on. But if the answer considers the approach as harsh and dismissive of the sister's feelings, then A (Yes) might be the case. The question is whether the author's response was justified given the circumstances. Given that the sister's behavior has been ongoing and toxic, the author might be right to address it, even if the method could be improved. However, in terms of being in the wrong, the sister's behavior is the main issue, but the author's response might be seen as pushing too hard.\n"
