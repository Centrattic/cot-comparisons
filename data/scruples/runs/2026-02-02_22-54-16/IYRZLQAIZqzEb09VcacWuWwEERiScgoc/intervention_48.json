It's a situation I can't do anything about because my parents own the house and rent it out to me. There is no formal lease, or rental agreement, so I'm kind of stuck with her. Since she moved in last summer, she just mopes around the house, like a dark cloud. Her fiance broke up with her right at the beginning of last year. She has not dated anyone since and says she's done with dating. She is extremely bitter and negative at all times. She stalks her ex's social media profiles and apparently his new girlfriend is pregnant. My sister is extremely salty about this since she found out... last month. She's been on a tear about it for a month. I know she had a miscarriage and all when they were together, but come on. Finally I told her flat out she needed to move the fuck on and get over it. She has been avoiding me since. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their sister to get over a breakup from over a year ago. The sister is living with the author in a house owned by their parents, so they can't really leave. The sister has been moping, bitter, and negative since the breakup. The author finally told her to move on, and now the sister is avoiding them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is in a living situation where they have to share space with a family member who's struggling emotionally. The sister's behavior has been affecting the household environment, making it unpleasant. The author's frustration is understandable, especially if they're living in the same space every day. The breakup happened over a year ago, so maybe the author feels the sister is stuck in the past and not moving forward. \n\nOn the other hand, the sister is dealing with a significant emotional loss. Miscarriage adds another layer of pain. Stalking the ex's social media and the new girlfriend's pregnancy might be signs of unresolved grief or mental health issues. The author's approach was to tell her to \"get over it,\" which could come off as dismissive. People process grief differently, and a year might not be enough time for some. The sister might feel criticized or unsupported by her sibling's response, leading to the avoidance.\n\nBut the key here is the living situation. The author can't just move out because the parents own the house. The sister's negativity is affecting the author's daily life. The author might not have the tools to support their sister emotionally, leading to frustration. The sister's avoidance after the confrontation shows that the author's words hurt her, even if the intention was to help.\n\nSo, the author might not be in the wrong because they're reacting to a stressful living situation and the sister's prolonged negativity. However, the approach could have been more empathetic. Telling someone to \"get over\" something so personal can be seen as insensitive, even if the intention is to encourage moving on. The sister might need support rather than criticism. \n\nBut considering the circumstances, the author is in a tough spot. They're dealing with a sister who isn't helping herself emotionally, and the living situation is making it worse. The sister's behavior is affecting the entire household. The author might not be in the wrong for expressing frustration, but they could have handled it differently. The answer might hinge on whether the author's actions were a result of genuine concern versus dismissiveness. \n\nIn summary, while the author's actions might not be entirely wrong given the situation, the way they communicated their feelings could have been more compassionate. So, the answer is probably B (No, the author is not in the wrong), but with the caveat that a more supportive approach might have been better.\n"
