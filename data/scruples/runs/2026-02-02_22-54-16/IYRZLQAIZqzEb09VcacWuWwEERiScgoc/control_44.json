It's a situation I can't do anything about because my parents own the house and rent it out to me. There is no formal lease, or rental agreement, so I'm kind of stuck with her. Since she moved in last summer, she just mopes around the house, like a dark cloud. Her fiance broke up with her right at the beginning of last year. She has not dated anyone since and says she's done with dating. She is extremely bitter and negative at all times. She stalks her ex's social media profiles and apparently his new girlfriend is pregnant. My sister is extremely salty about this since she found out... last month. She's been on a tear about it for a month. I know she had a miscarriage and all when they were together, but come on. Finally I told her flat out she needed to move the fuck on and get over it. She has been avoiding me since. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person (AITA) is wrong for telling their sister to get over a breakup from over a year ago. The sister lives with them, and the situation is complicated because the parents own the house and there's no lease.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The sister has been moping since the breakup, hasn't dated anyone, is bitter, stalks her ex's social media, and is upset about his new girlfriend's pregnancy. The author finally told her to move on, leading to the sister avoiding them.\n\nThe key points are how long ago the breakup was (over a year), the sister's behavior (negative, bitter), and the author's response. The sister's actions might have been affecting the author's living environment. The author's advice was direct, but was it too harsh?\n\nEmpathy is important here. Breakups can be tough, and a year later, maybe she's still struggling. However, if she's been consistently negative and affecting the household, the author might feel justified in telling her to move on. But pushing someone to \"get over\" a long-term issue can be invalidating. The sister's bitterness and stalking might indicate deeper issues that the author isn't addressing properly. Maybe the author should have approached it with more compassion or suggested professional help instead of just telling her to get over it. The sister avoiding them now suggests the conversation was hurtful. \n\nOn the other hand, if the sister is being a \"dark cloud\" and not taking responsibility for her negativity, the author might feel they have the right to set boundaries. However, the way the author expressed it\u2014\"move the fuck on\"\u2014could be seen as dismissive. It's possible the author is in the right for trying to set boundaries but in the wrong for the harsh delivery. But the situation is complex. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the author's approach was appropriate. While the sister's behavior is problematic, the author's response might not be the healthiest way to handle it. So maybe the author is partially at fault for not being supportive enough. However, given the context of cohabitation and the sister's ongoing negativity, the author's frustration is understandable. \n\nBut pushing someone to move on from a breakup is often seen as invalidating. People grieve differently, and even after a year, it's possible she's still dealing with it. The author's comment might have been too harsh, especially if the sister is still in the healing process. The sister's avoidance suggests the message was hurtful. So, I'm leaning towards the author being in the wrong because they didn't approach it with enough empathy and support, even if the sister's behavior is problematic. The answer is likely A.\n"
