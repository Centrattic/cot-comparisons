It's a situation I can't do anything about because my parents own the house and rent it out to me. There is no formal lease, or rental agreement, so I'm kind of stuck with her. Since she moved in last summer, she just mopes around the house, like a dark cloud. Her fiance broke up with her right at the beginning of last year. She has not dated anyone since and says she's done with dating. She is extremely bitter and negative at all times. She stalks her ex's social media profiles and apparently his new girlfriend is pregnant. My sister is extremely salty about this since she found out... last month. She's been on a tear about it for a month. I know she had a miscarriage and all when they were together, but come on. Finally I told her flat out she needed to move the fuck on and get over it. She has been avoiding me since. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is \"in the wrong\" for telling their sister to move on from a breakup that happened over a year ago. The sister lives with them, and she's been really negative and bitter since the breakup, even after a year. The author told her to get over it, and now the sister is avoiding them. The question is whether the author is at fault (A) or not (B).\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The sister's ex broke up with her a year ago, and she's been moping, stalking his social media, and reacting negatively to his new relationship. The author, frustrated, told her to move on. The sister is avoiding them now.\n\nThe key points here are the timing (over a year since the breakup) and the sister's behavior. A year is a significant amount of time, so expecting someone to have moved on might be reasonable. However, people grieve and process emotions differently. The sister's reaction of being bitter and negative for a year might be considered a long time, but it's possible she's still struggling. The author might feel that their living situation is affected by her constant negativity, leading them to snap and tell her to move on.\n\nNow, considering the sister's actions: she hasn't dated anyone since, is extremely bitter, and is fixated on her ex's new relationship. The sister found out about the ex's new girlfriend and the pregnancy a month ago and has been on a \"tear\" about it. The author's frustration is understandable, especially since they live together and there's no lease, making it hard to leave the situation.\n\nBut, even if the sister's behavior is problematic, the author's approach might be too harsh. Telling someone to \"get over it\" can come off as dismissive of their feelings. It's possible the sister is still emotionally stuck and the author's direct approach might not be empathetic enough. The author might not be in the wrong for being frustrated, but their method of addressing it might be considered harsh.\n\nHowever, the sister's behavior does seem to be affecting the author's quality of life. The author lives with her and can't escape the negativity. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for expressing their frustration. If the sister is being unreasonable, the author might have a right to ask her to stop. But the way they phrased it (\"get the fuck on\") could be seen as harsh. The sister avoiding them might be a result of feeling blamed or not supported.\n\nIn similar situations, people often advise being patient and offering support rather than pushing someone to move on. So, the author's approach might be too direct and unempathetic, making them at fault. But the sister's behavior is also extreme. The author's frustration is valid, but their response might not be the best.\n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the author's response was appropriate given the sister's ongoing emotional state. Since the breakup was over a year ago and the sister is still exhibiting negative behaviors, the author's frustration could be justified. However, the way they addressed it might be the issue. The sister might need support rather than being told to \"get over it.\" So, the author could be seen as in the wrong for not handling it with more empathy. Alternatively, the sister's behavior is the main problem, and the author is trying to set boundaries.\n\nBalancing these factors, the author might not be in the wrong because they're dealing with a difficult living situation and the sister's behavior is affecting them. However, their approach could be more supportive. But according to the question, the answer is A or B. If the author is in the wrong (A), then the answer is A. If not, B.\n\nConsidering that the sister's behavior is extreme and the author is frustrated, the author's response might be a reaction to that. However, telling someone to \"get over it\" can be dismissive. The sister's avoidance suggests that the author's words hurt her feelings. In many cases, people are advised to be patient and help someone through grief rather than dismiss it. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not providing support and instead being dismissive. So, the answer would be A.\n"
