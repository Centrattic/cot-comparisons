It's a situation I can't do anything about because my parents own the house and rent it out to me. There is no formal lease, or rental agreement, so I'm kind of stuck with her. Since she moved in last summer, she just mopes around the house, like a dark cloud. Her fiance broke up with her right at the beginning of last year. She has not dated anyone since and says she's done with dating. She is extremely bitter and negative at all times. She stalks her ex's social media profiles and apparently his new girlfriend is pregnant. My sister is extremely salty about this since she found out... last month. She's been on a tear about it for a month. I know she had a miscarriage and all when they were together, but come on. Finally I told her flat out she needed to move the fuck on and get over it. She has been avoiding me since. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their sister to get over a breakup that happened over a year ago. The sister lives with them, which they can't change because their parents own the house. The sister's ex broke up with her a year ago, and she hasn't moved on, is bitter, and is now upset about the ex's new girlfriend being pregnant. The author told her to get over it, and now the sister is avoiding them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The sister has been dealing with the breakup for over a year, which is a significant amount of time. She's showing signs of not moving on, like constant negativity, stalking, and bitterness. The author is frustrated because they live together and the sister's behavior affects the living environment. The sister's reaction to the ex's new pregnancy is adding to her distress.\n\nThe key points here are the length of time since the breakup, the sister's ongoing emotional state, and the author's direct advice to move on. The author is in a shared living situation, which can be stressful. Telling someone to \"get over\" a breakup can come off as dismissive, especially if the person is still struggling. However, the sister's behavior might be impacting the author's quality of life. \n\nOn one hand, the sister is dealing with grief and loss, which can take time. The author's frustration is understandable because they can't escape the sister's negativity. On the other hand, the author's approach was direct and possibly harsh. Instead of telling her to move on, offering support or suggesting professional help might be more effective. But the sister isn't open to dating again, which complicates things.\n\nThe question is about whether the author is in the wrong. If the sister's behavior is toxic and affecting the household, the author might feel justified. However, the way the author expressed their frustration might have been insensitive. The sister's avoidance suggests the comment hurt her feelings. \n\nConsidering all factors, the author might not be in the wrong because they were trying to address the sister's prolonged grief affecting their shared home. But the approach could have been more compassionate. However, the answer depends on whether the author's intervention was justified. The sister's actions are harmful, and the author's frustration is valid. So the answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong), but there's a nuance. However, in typical AITA scenarios, advising someone to move on without support can be seen as dismissive. But given the sister's ongoing toxic behavior, the author might have a valid point. It's a bit of a toss-up, but I think the author isn't in the wrong because they were trying to set boundaries in a shared living space. So the answer is B.\n"
