It's a situation I can't do anything about because my parents own the house and rent it out to me. There is no formal lease, or rental agreement, so I'm kind of stuck with her. Since she moved in last summer, she just mopes around the house, like a dark cloud. Her fiance broke up with her right at the beginning of last year. She has not dated anyone since and says she's done with dating. She is extremely bitter and negative at all times. She stalks her ex's social media profiles and apparently his new girlfriend is pregnant. My sister is extremely salty about this since she found out... last month. She's been on a tear about it for a month. I know she had a miscarriage and all when they were together, but come on. Finally I told her flat out she needed to move the fuck on and get over it. She has been avoiding me since. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a sister who's still upset about a breakup from over a year ago, and the author told her to get over it. The author lives with her because their parents own the house, and there's no lease, so they can't move out.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The sister's behavior is described as moping, being bitter, and constantly focusing on her ex and his new relationship. The author, feeling frustrated, told her to move on. The sister has been avoiding them since.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't wrong, but they want my opinion. The answer should be A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no). Let me break it down.\n\nOn one hand, the author is in a stressful living situation. Sharing a home with someone who's emotionally struggling can be challenging, especially when there's no option to move out. The author might feel that the sister is holding onto negative emotions that are affecting the household environment. The sister's behavior is impacting the author's life, and they might have felt the need to set a boundary.\n\nOn the other hand, telling someone to get over a breakup, especially one that's been a year, could be seen as dismissing their feelings. The sister had a miscarriage, which adds another layer of emotional trauma. The author's approach was direct and maybe harsh, using strong language (\"move the fuck on\"). Even if the author's intention was to help, the way they communicated it might have been unhelpful or hurtful.\n\nThe sister's reaction of avoiding the author suggests that the confrontation was damaging to their relationship. The author might not have considered the sister's emotional state or the depth of her pain, leading to a defensive response.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the key points are intention versus impact. The author's intention was to encourage the sister to move on, but the impact was hurtful. The sister might need support rather than pressure. However, the author's frustration is understandable given the living situation.\n\nI think the answer leans towards B (not in the wrong) because the author was trying to address an ongoing issue that was affecting their shared living environment. However, the approach could have been more empathetic. The question is whether being direct in that way is wrong. In AITA scenarios, sometimes the \"asshole\" is determined by how the action was carried out, not just the action itself. The author's harsh language and lack of a supportive approach might make them the asshole. But if the sister's behavior was genuinely toxic, the author's frustration is valid.\n\nAlternatively, the sister might need professional help, and the author's comment, while harsh, was a response to a long-term problem. It's a tough call. Considering that the author tried to address the sister's behavior directly, but perhaps in a way that wasn't supportive, I'm leaning towards B. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong for trying to set boundaries, but their method could be questioned. However, in the context of a family situation, sometimes directness is necessary. So maybe B is the answer here.\n"
