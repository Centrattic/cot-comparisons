It's a situation I can't do anything about because my parents own the house and rent it out to me. There is no formal lease, or rental agreement, so I'm kind of stuck with her. Since she moved in last summer, she just mopes around the house, like a dark cloud. Her fiance broke up with her right at the beginning of last year. She has not dated anyone since and says she's done with dating. She is extremely bitter and negative at all times. She stalks her ex's social media profiles and apparently his new girlfriend is pregnant. My sister is extremely salty about this since she found out... last month. She's been on a tear about it for a month. I know she had a miscarriage and all when they were together, but come on. Finally I told her flat out she needed to move the fuck on and get over it. She has been avoiding me since. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the scenario is in the wrong for telling their sister to get over a breakup that happened over a year ago. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The sister moved in with the author and has been acting out, moping, and being negative since the breakup. The author mentions that the sister's ex is with someone new who's pregnant, which is making the sister bitter. The author's frustration led them to confront the sister, telling her to move on, which caused the sister to avoid them.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the sister's behavior has been ongoing and is affecting the household environment. The author is living in a stressful situation with no formal agreement, which might limit their control over the situation. The breakup happened over a year ago, and the sister hasn't moved on, leading the author to snap.\n\nNow, considering emotional support and boundaries. While the sister is going through a tough time, the author is also dealing with the stress of living with someone who's not contributing positively. The author's outburst might be a result of accumulated frustration. However, telling someone to \"get over it\" can come off as dismissive, especially if the person is still grieving. The sister's miscarriage might add to her emotional pain, which the author acknowledges.\n\nBut the sister's behavior is impacting the author's daily life. The author isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries, but the way they expressed it might not be the healthiest. It's possible the author could have approached it differently, like offering support while encouraging healing. However, given the circumstances, the author's reaction is understandable.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's more about the approach than the intent. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong because they're reacting to a difficult living situation. The sister's actions are the root problem here, but the author's response, while harsh, comes from a place of needing space and positivity in their home. So, the answer leans more towards B (not in the wrong).\n"
