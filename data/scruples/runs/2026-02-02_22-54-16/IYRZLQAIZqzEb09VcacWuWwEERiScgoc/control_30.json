It's a situation I can't do anything about because my parents own the house and rent it out to me. There is no formal lease, or rental agreement, so I'm kind of stuck with her. Since she moved in last summer, she just mopes around the house, like a dark cloud. Her fiance broke up with her right at the beginning of last year. She has not dated anyone since and says she's done with dating. She is extremely bitter and negative at all times. She stalks her ex's social media profiles and apparently his new girlfriend is pregnant. My sister is extremely salty about this since she found out... last month. She's been on a tear about it for a month. I know she had a miscarriage and all when they were together, but come on. Finally I told her flat out she needed to move the fuck on and get over it. She has been avoiding me since. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the question is in the wrong for telling their sister to get over a breakup from over a year ago. The sister is living with them, and the situation is complicated because the parents own the house and there's no lease, so they can't just move her out.\n\nThe sister's ex broke up with her a year ago, and she's been moping around, being negative, and now especially bitter since finding out the ex has a new girlfriend who's pregnant. The author told their sister to move on, and now their sister is avoiding them.\n\nHmm. The first thing to consider is the sister's emotional state. A year is a long time, but maybe she's still struggling. The author might be frustrated with the constant negativity, especially since they have to live together. But was it appropriate to tell her to \"get over it\"? That might come off as dismissive. The sister has a history of a miscarriage, which adds to the complexity. The author's comment could be seen as invalidating her feelings.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is in a tough spot because they can't just remove their sister from the home. They might feel like they can't escape the negative environment. But how they express their frustration matters. Telling someone to \"move the fuck on\" is pretty harsh, even if the author is just tired of the negativity. It's possible the sister needs support rather than being told to get over it.\n\nBut wait, the sister has been avoiding the author since. That suggests the author's words might have hurt her. So maybe the author is in the wrong for not being more supportive. However, the author might not know how to handle the situation otherwise. The sister's behavior is affecting the author's living environment, which is a real issue.\n\nBut is it the author's responsibility to make the sister move on? Probably not. The right approach might be to encourage the sister to seek help, like therapy, or to set boundaries for their own well-being, rather than telling the sister she's wrong to feel the way she does. So the author might be right to express frustration but in the wrong way. Therefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because they didn't approach the situation with empathy and instead dismissed the sister's feelings.\n"
