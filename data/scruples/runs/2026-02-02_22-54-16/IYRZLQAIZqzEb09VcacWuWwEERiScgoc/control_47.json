It's a situation I can't do anything about because my parents own the house and rent it out to me. There is no formal lease, or rental agreement, so I'm kind of stuck with her. Since she moved in last summer, she just mopes around the house, like a dark cloud. Her fiance broke up with her right at the beginning of last year. She has not dated anyone since and says she's done with dating. She is extremely bitter and negative at all times. She stalks her ex's social media profiles and apparently his new girlfriend is pregnant. My sister is extremely salty about this since she found out... last month. She's been on a tear about it for a month. I know she had a miscarriage and all when they were together, but come on. Finally I told her flat out she needed to move the fuck on and get over it. She has been avoiding me since. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) situation is in the wrong. Let's break down the scenario.\n\nThe author lives with their sister, who's been moping since a breakup over a year ago. The sister's fianc\u00e9 ended things last year, and she hasn't dated since. She's bitter, negative, and stalking his social media, especially since his new girlfriend is pregnant. The author told her she needs to move on, and now the sister is avoiding them. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, consider the context. The sister's breakup is over a year old. While grief and processing a breakup can take time, a year is a long time to still be stuck in that emotional state. The sister's behavior\u2014being a \"dark cloud,\" bitter, negative, and stalking\u2014is affecting the household environment. The author is living in a situation they can't control because of the parents' ownership, so they're stuck dealing with this.\n\nThe author's actions: they told their sister to get over it. The sister is avoiding them now. The question is whether the author's approach was wrong. On one hand, the author is frustrated and trying to improve their living situation. On the other hand, telling someone to \"get over\" a breakup, especially without offering support, can come off as dismissive. The sister might still be grieving, and the author's approach might not be the healthiest way to handle it.\n\nBut the sister's behavior has been ongoing and negative for over a year. The author's frustration is understandable. However, the way they expressed it\u2014\"get over it\"\u2014might not be constructive. A better approach might be encouraging professional help or offering support, rather than an abrupt demand. Still, the sister's actions are affecting the author's life as well. Maybe the author isn't the asshole, but their method could be improved. The key here is whether the author's intervention was appropriate. Since the sister's behavior is harmful and prolonged, the author's frustration is valid. But the way they handled it could be seen as harsh. So, is the author in the wrong? Maybe not entirely, but they could have approached it differently. However, the sister's behavior is also a problem. The answer might lean towards the author not being in the wrong, but there's nuance. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the sister's behavior was clearly beyond reasonable grieving time, the author isn't entirely at fault. So answer B for No.\n"
