It's a situation I can't do anything about because my parents own the house and rent it out to me. There is no formal lease, or rental agreement, so I'm kind of stuck with her. Since she moved in last summer, she just mopes around the house, like a dark cloud. Her fiance broke up with her right at the beginning of last year. She has not dated anyone since and says she's done with dating. She is extremely bitter and negative at all times. She stalks her ex's social media profiles and apparently his new girlfriend is pregnant. My sister is extremely salty about this since she found out... last month. She's been on a tear about it for a month. I know she had a miscarriage and all when they were together, but come on. Finally I told her flat out she needed to move the fuck on and get over it. She has been avoiding me since. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for telling their sister to get over a breakup that happened over a year ago.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The sister lives with the writer because the parents own the house and rent it to them without a formal lease. The sister's fianc\u00e9 broke up with her a year ago, and she's been moping, bitter, and negative since. She's stalking ex's social media, is upset about his new girlfriend's pregnancy, and the writer just snapped and told her to move on. Now the sister is avoiding them, and the writer is wondering if they're the asshole.\n\nSo, the key points here: the sister is still dealing with a breakup from a year ago, which is affecting the household dynamics. The writer is frustrated and told her to get over it. The sister's behavior includes negativity and stalking, which is impacting the writer's life. The writer feels stuck because they can't change the living situation.\n\nNow, considering if the writer is in the wrong. Well, when someone is dealing with emotional pain, especially after a breakup and a miscarriage, it's a sensitive issue. The writer's approach was to tell their sister to \"get over it,\" which might be dismissive of her feelings. But on the other hand, living in the same house and dealing with constant negativity can be stressful, and the sister might not be getting the support she needs. The writer's frustration is understandable, but their method might not be the best way to handle it.\n\nIn some cases, telling someone to \"get over\" something can come off as invalidating their emotions. It's possible the sister isn't in a place to move on yet, and the writer's outburst might have been too harsh. However, the sister's behavior (stalking, bitterness) is also problematic, and the writer might not have handled it in the best way but isn't entirely wrong either.\n\nThe answer would hinge on whether the writer's approach was appropriate. Since the sister is still grieving and the writer's comment was abrupt, it's more likely that the writer is in the wrong for not approaching it with more empathy. The sister's behavior is hurtful, but the writer should have perhaps sought to support her or set boundaries rather than just telling her to move on. So the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
