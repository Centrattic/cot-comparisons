It's a situation I can't do anything about because my parents own the house and rent it out to me. There is no formal lease, or rental agreement, so I'm kind of stuck with her. Since she moved in last summer, she just mopes around the house, like a dark cloud. Her fiance broke up with her right at the beginning of last year. She has not dated anyone since and says she's done with dating. She is extremely bitter and negative at all times. She stalks her ex's social media profiles and apparently his new girlfriend is pregnant. My sister is extremely salty about this since she found out... last month. She's been on a tear about it for a month. I know she had a miscarriage and all when they were together, but come on. Finally I told her flat out she needed to move the fuck on and get over it. She has been avoiding me since. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong (AITA). The situation is about the author telling their sister to get over a breakup that happened over a year ago. The sister is still moping, bitter, and negative, and the author told her to move on. The sister has been avoiding them since.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The sister moved in last summer, so about a year ago. The breakup was the beginning of last year, so over a year ago. The sister hasn't dated anyone since and is very negative, stalking her ex and his new girlfriend. The author is frustrated and told her to get over it.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is wrong. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but wants confirmation.\n\nI should think about empathy here. Grieving takes time, and the sister might still be in pain. The author, living in the same house, might be feeling the weight of their sister's negativity daily. But is it right to tell her to \"get over it\" so quickly? Maybe the author is frustrated but not inconsiderate. However, telling someone to \"get over\" a breakup can come off as dismissive. The sister's actions (stalking, bitterness) might be part of her grieving process. The author's approach might not be supportive, but maybe they're just at their wits' end.\n\nOn the other hand, the sister has had over a year to process this. The author's intervention could be seen as well-meaning but harsh. The sister might need support rather than a blunt command to move on. But the author isn't a therapist, and maybe they're just tired of the negativity. However, the way the author phrased it (\"get over it\") is a common AITA trigger for being in the wrong because it can be seen as insensitive.\n\nBut wait, the sister is avoiding the author now. Maybe the author's frustration is valid, but the method was wrong. The key is in the approach. If the author had approached it with more empathy, maybe the sister would respond better. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer might lean towards A (yes) because telling someone to \"get over\" a breakup can be hurtful, but some might say B (no) because the sister is over a year into it.\n\nI think the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because they didn't handle it with enough empathy. However, others might argue B because the sister is still being negative for too long. But the common AITA response for telling someone to \"get over it\" tends to lean towards the person being in the wrong, as it's a dismissive statement. So the answer is A.\n"
