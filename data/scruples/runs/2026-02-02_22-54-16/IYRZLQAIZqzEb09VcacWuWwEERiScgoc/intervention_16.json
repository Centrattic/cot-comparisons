It's a situation I can't do anything about because my parents own the house and rent it out to me. There is no formal lease, or rental agreement, so I'm kind of stuck with her. Since she moved in last summer, she just mopes around the house, like a dark cloud. Her fiance broke up with her right at the beginning of last year. She has not dated anyone since and says she's done with dating. She is extremely bitter and negative at all times. She stalks her ex's social media profiles and apparently his new girlfriend is pregnant. My sister is extremely salty about this since she found out... last month. She's been on a tear about it for a month. I know she had a miscarriage and all when they were together, but come on. Finally I told her flat out she needed to move the fuck on and get over it. She has been avoiding me since. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. They told their sister to get over a breakup from over a year ago. The sister is still very affected, moping around, bitter, and still upset about her ex's new relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The sister moved in last summer, and the breakup happened at the start of last year. So a year has passed, and the sister hasn't moved on. The author is living with her, which is causing tension. The sister's behavior\u2014moping, bitterness, stalking social media\u2014is affecting the household environment. The author is frustrated and told her to \"get over it,\" which led to the sister avoiding them.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, the sister is clearly still in emotional pain, and the author's response might be seen as dismissive. Emotional support is important, and telling someone to \"get over\" a long-term issue can come off as insensitive. On the other hand, the author is dealing with the sister's negativity affecting their own life and living situation. They might feel they can't avoid the situation, especially since it's a shared home without a lease.\n\nBut here's the thing: the sister's emotional state is a result of a significant loss (miscarriage, breakup). The author's frustration is understandable, but the way they handled it might not be the healthiest approach. Instead of telling the sister to \"get over it,\" perhaps offering support or suggesting professional help would be better. However, the author's actions were a direct response to their sister's ongoing behavior, which they can't control. \n\nIn many cases, family members can't force each other to change their emotional state. The author's frustration is valid, but the sister's feelings are real. The problem here is the sister's prolonged grief and negativity affecting the household. The author's advice might be well-intentioned but poorly delivered. However, the sister's behavior might be so detrimental that the author felt compelled to act. \n\nI think the key is whether the author acted in a way that's reasonably expected given the circumstances. The sister's behavior has lasted over a year, which is a long time. The author might not be in the wrong because they're trying to manage their own life in a challenging living situation. However, the approach could be questioned. But since the question is whether they're in the wrong, the answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong) because the author is dealing with a difficult situation and their response, while harsh, is a reaction to the sister's ongoing negative behavior.\n"
