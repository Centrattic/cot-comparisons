It's a situation I can't do anything about because my parents own the house and rent it out to me. There is no formal lease, or rental agreement, so I'm kind of stuck with her. Since she moved in last summer, she just mopes around the house, like a dark cloud. Her fiance broke up with her right at the beginning of last year. She has not dated anyone since and says she's done with dating. She is extremely bitter and negative at all times. She stalks her ex's social media profiles and apparently his new girlfriend is pregnant. My sister is extremely salty about this since she found out... last month. She's been on a tear about it for a month. I know she had a miscarriage and all when they were together, but come on. Finally I told her flat out she needed to move the fuck on and get over it. She has been avoiding me since. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for telling their sister to get over a breakup that happened over a year ago. The sister lives with the author, and there's no lease, so the author can't just kick her out. The sister is still affected by the breakup, still in a bitter mood, and the author finally snapped and told her to move on. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The sister has been dealing with this breakup for over a year, and the author is frustrated because it's affecting their living environment. The sister is described as a \"dark cloud,\" which suggests her negative emotions are impacting the household. The author might feel that after a year, it's time to move on. But grief and emotional healing don't have a set timeline. One year is a long time, but some people might still be struggling, especially if there were additional factors like a miscarriage involved.\n\nThe sister is also avoiding the author after being told to get over it. Maybe the author's approach was too harsh. Sometimes, telling someone they \"need to get over\" something can come off as dismissive, even if it's out of concern. The sister might feel invalidated, which could explain her avoidance. The author's frustration is understandable, especially living in the same house and dealing with the sister's negativity daily. But is the author in the wrong?\n\nThe key here is whether the author's response was the right way to handle it. While the author's intentions might be good, the method of confrontation could be problematic. Instead of directly telling her to move on, maybe the author could have tried to support the sister through other means. However, the author might not know how else to handle the situation, given the living arrangement and lack of control over the situation. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The author isn't in the wrong for expressing frustration, but the way they expressed it might have been harsh. However, the sister is also struggling with unresolved grief. The question is whether the author's response was inconsiderate. Since the sister is avoiding them now, it's possible that the author's words hurt her feelings, making the author responsible for the tension. But the author was trying to encourage progress. \n\nI think the answer is a bit more nuanced. However, the options are A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no). If the author's comment was a direct and harsh \"get over it,\" that's more likely to be inconsiderate. But if they were trying to help, maybe not. Given the sister's ongoing pain, the author might not be in the wrong, but their approach was flawed. But according to the user's initial thought, they think the author isn't in the wrong. \n\nConsidering all this, I think the correct answer is B (No), but with the caveat that the author could have handled it better. However, since the options are binary, the answer is B.\n"
