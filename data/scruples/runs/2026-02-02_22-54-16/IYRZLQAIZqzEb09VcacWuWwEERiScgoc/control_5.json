It's a situation I can't do anything about because my parents own the house and rent it out to me. There is no formal lease, or rental agreement, so I'm kind of stuck with her. Since she moved in last summer, she just mopes around the house, like a dark cloud. Her fiance broke up with her right at the beginning of last year. She has not dated anyone since and says she's done with dating. She is extremely bitter and negative at all times. She stalks her ex's social media profiles and apparently his new girlfriend is pregnant. My sister is extremely salty about this since she found out... last month. She's been on a tear about it for a month. I know she had a miscarriage and all when they were together, but come on. Finally I told her flat out she needed to move the fuck on and get over it. She has been avoiding me since. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for telling their sister to get over a breakup that happened over a year ago. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the context they provided. The sister lives with the author, and they can't move out because it's owned by their parents. The sister's fianc\u00e9 broke up with her a year ago, and she's been really negative and bitter ever since. She's even reacting strongly to her ex's new girlfriend being pregnant, which adds to the tension. The author finally told her to move on, and now the sister is avoiding them.\n\nHmm, so the key points here are the timing of the breakup (over a year ago), the sister's ongoing emotional state, and the author's response. The author is frustrated because their sister hasn't moved on and is affecting the household environment. But is telling someone to \"get over it\" the right approach?\n\nWell, people grieve and process breakups differently. A year is a long time, but maybe the sister is still struggling with it. The author's sister also had a miscarriage with the ex, which might complicate her feelings. The author's comment was harsh (\"move the fuck on\"), which might have been confrontational and not empathetic. Even if the sister is being negative, the approach taken by the author could have been insensitive.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is stuck living with a sister who's not moving on, which is affecting their life. They might feel they have no choice but to confront her. But was the confrontation necessary? Maybe there's a more supportive way to handle it. The sister's behavior is affecting the household, so the author has a valid reason to be concerned. However, telling someone to \"get over it\" without support or understanding can be dismissive.\n\nI think the author might be in the wrong because pushing someone to move on without offering support or acknowledging their pain can be hurtful. Even if the sister is moping, the author's response was probably too harsh. It's important to approach such situations with empathy rather than criticism. So the answer might be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
