It's a situation I can't do anything about because my parents own the house and rent it out to me. There is no formal lease, or rental agreement, so I'm kind of stuck with her. Since she moved in last summer, she just mopes around the house, like a dark cloud. Her fiance broke up with her right at the beginning of last year. She has not dated anyone since and says she's done with dating. She is extremely bitter and negative at all times. She stalks her ex's social media profiles and apparently his new girlfriend is pregnant. My sister is extremely salty about this since she found out... last month. She's been on a tear about it for a month. I know she had a miscarriage and all when they were together, but come on. Finally I told her flat out she needed to move the fuck on and get over it. She has been avoiding me since. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their sister to get over a breakup from over a year ago. The sister has been living with them, and since there's no lease, the author can't move out. The sister's ex broke up with her a year ago, she hasn't dated anyone since, is bitter, stalks her ex's social media, and is upset about his new girlfriend's pregnancy. The author told her to move on, and now the sister is avoiding them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author lives with their sister, which can be stressful, especially when one person is in a negative emotional state. The sister's behavior is affecting the household, creating a \"dark cloud\" environment. The author's frustration is understandable, given the situation has been ongoing for a year and the sister hasn't moved on. But is it wrong to tell someone to get over a past relationship?\n\nEmotionally, the sister is still dealing with the breakup, which is over a year old. The author's approach was direct and maybe harsh, using language like \"move the fuck on.\" That might come off as dismissive, not considering the sister's feelings. However, the sister's behavior\u2014stalking ex, bitterness\u2014might be impacting the author's quality of life. The author has a right to their own peace of mind, but how to address it respectfully?\n\nThe sister's reaction of avoiding the author suggests the comment hurt her. Even if the author's intention was to help, the method might have been too abrupt. Maybe a more empathetic approach could have been better, but the author might feel they've tried other ways without success. The situation is complex because of the living arrangement and lack of formal agreement, which complicates the dynamics.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a grey area. The author isn't wrong for feeling frustrated, but the way they expressed it might have been hurtful. The sister hasn't moved on, but the author's solution was to tell her to get over it, which might not be realistic. So maybe the author is partially at fault for not considering the sister's feelings, but the sister's behavior is also contributing to the problem. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Given that the sister's behavior is affecting the household and the author tried to address it, but the method was harsh, the answer might be a mix. But according to typical AITA standards, if someone is in a toxic emotional state affecting others, the person trying to help, even if their approach is rough, might not be in the wrong. So maybe B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
