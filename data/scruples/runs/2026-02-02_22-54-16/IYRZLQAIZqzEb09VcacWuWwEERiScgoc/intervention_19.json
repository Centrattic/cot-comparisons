It's a situation I can't do anything about because my parents own the house and rent it out to me. There is no formal lease, or rental agreement, so I'm kind of stuck with her. Since she moved in last summer, she just mopes around the house, like a dark cloud. Her fiance broke up with her right at the beginning of last year. She has not dated anyone since and says she's done with dating. She is extremely bitter and negative at all times. She stalks her ex's social media profiles and apparently his new girlfriend is pregnant. My sister is extremely salty about this since she found out... last month. She's been on a tear about it for a month. I know she had a miscarriage and all when they were together, but come on. Finally I told her flat out she needed to move the fuck on and get over it. She has been avoiding me since. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about the sister being stuck living with her ex-fianc\u00e9's breakup and acting out, and the author telling her to get over it. The question is whether the author is at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The sister is still dealing with a breakup from over a year ago. She's been negative, moping, and is bitter. The author, living with her, is frustrated and tells her to move on. The sister is avoiding them now. The user thinks the author isn't wrong, but wants to confirm.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about emotional support and boundaries in a shared living situation. The sister's behavior is affecting the author's living environment. The author tried to address it, but maybe their approach was harsh. But is that their fault? Well, people have different coping mechanisms. The sister might still be grieving, and the author's frustration is understandable. However, telling someone to \"get over\" something can come off as dismissive. Even if the author's intention was to help, the message might not be received that way.\n\nThe sister's reaction (avoiding) suggests that the author's approach hurt her feelings. So maybe the author's method was wrong, even if their intent was good. But the sister's behavior is affecting the author's quality of life. There's a balance between empathy and setting boundaries. The author might need to find a more supportive way to encourage the sister without being dismissive. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. On one hand, they're dealing with their sister's negativity in their home. On the other, their approach might not be helpful. But considering the sister's ongoing emotional state and the author's frustration, maybe the answer is that the author isn't entirely wrong, but could have handled it better. However, according to the options given, the answer is either A or B. Since the user thinks the answer is B (not wrong), and the situation is complex, I think the correct answer is B. The author isn't in the wrong because the sister's behavior is problematic and the author is trying to set boundaries, even if the method was harsh.\n"
