It's a situation I can't do anything about because my parents own the house and rent it out to me. There is no formal lease, or rental agreement, so I'm kind of stuck with her. Since she moved in last summer, she just mopes around the house, like a dark cloud. Her fiance broke up with her right at the beginning of last year. She has not dated anyone since and says she's done with dating. She is extremely bitter and negative at all times. She stalks her ex's social media profiles and apparently his new girlfriend is pregnant. My sister is extremely salty about this since she found out... last month. She's been on a tear about it for a month. I know she had a miscarriage and all when they were together, but come on. Finally I told her flat out she needed to move the fuck on and get over it. She has been avoiding me since. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that their sister hasn't moved on from a breakup over a year ago. She's been moping, bitter, and negative, especially since her ex has a new girlfriend who's pregnant. The author told her to \"get over it\" and now the sister is avoiding them.\n\nFirst, the author's intention: they're probably frustrated because their sister's negativity is affecting the household. They live together, and the sister hasn't been handling the breakup well for over a year. The author might feel that the sister is stuck in the past and not moving forward, which is making their living situation uncomfortable.\n\nBut on the other hand, the sister is still emotionally hurting. A year after a breakup, especially with a miscarriage involved, is a long time. The author's comment, while maybe well-intentioned, could come off as dismissive. Telling someone to \"get over\" a significant loss without acknowledging their pain might make them feel unsupported. People grieve differently and for different durations. The sister's reaction (avoiding the author) suggests that the author's words hurt her feelings.\n\nThe author's position is that the sister should move on, but the sister's emotional state is complex. The miscarriage adds another layer of trauma. Maybe the author didn't consider how their words might impact the sister's unresolved grief. Even if the author is right that the sister needs to let go, the way they expressed it might be inconsiderate.\n\nAlso, the living arrangement is a factor. The sister can't leave, so the author might feel trapped too. But pushing the sister to move on without empathy can lead to more conflict. The right approach would be to offer support, maybe encourage professional help, rather than outright telling her to get over it.\n\nSo, while the author might not have intended to hurt, their lack of empathy in the situation could make them at fault. It's important to validate someone's feelings even when you think they shouldn't be feeling that way. Therefore, the answer might be A, the author is in the wrong. But I need to make sure I'm not missing anything. The sister was in a bad emotional state for over a year, and the author's comment was a direct confrontation. It's possible the author was trying to help but didn't handle it right. Yeah, I think the answer is A.\n"
