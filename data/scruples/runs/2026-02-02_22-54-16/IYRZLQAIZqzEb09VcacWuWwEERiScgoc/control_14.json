It's a situation I can't do anything about because my parents own the house and rent it out to me. There is no formal lease, or rental agreement, so I'm kind of stuck with her. Since she moved in last summer, she just mopes around the house, like a dark cloud. Her fiance broke up with her right at the beginning of last year. She has not dated anyone since and says she's done with dating. She is extremely bitter and negative at all times. She stalks her ex's social media profiles and apparently his new girlfriend is pregnant. My sister is extremely salty about this since she found out... last month. She's been on a tear about it for a month. I know she had a miscarriage and all when they were together, but come on. Finally I told her flat out she needed to move the fuck on and get over it. She has been avoiding me since. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who told their sister to move on from a breakup over a year ago is in the wrong. \n\nFirst, the sister's situation: her fianc\u00e9 broke up with her over a year ago. She hasn't dated anyone since, is bitter, negative, and still fixated on her ex's new relationship and his girlfriend's pregnancy. She's been moping around the house they share, which the author can't escape because their parents own the house and rent it to the author. The author finally told her to get over it, and now their sister is avoiding them.\n\nSo, the main points here. The author is living with their sister, which is causing tension. The sister is stuck in a negative emotional state, which is affecting the household. The author feels frustrated and tries to intervene. The question is whether the author's response was wrong.\n\nOn one hand, the author might be seen as dismissive of their sister's feelings. Telling someone to \"get over it\" can come across as invalidating, especially when someone is still dealing with grief or unresolved emotions. It's possible the sister is still in the process of healing, and the author's direct approach might be too harsh, even if the breakup was a year ago.\n\nOn the other hand, the sister has been in a negative state for a long time, which is affecting their shared living situation. The author might feel overwhelmed and have reached a breaking point, so their outburst can be understood as a reaction to the prolonged stress. The sister's behavior includes stalking her ex's social media, which is unhealthy, and the author is concerned about the toxic environment at home.\n\nBut the key here is the sister's duration of emotional struggle. A year is a significant time, and while some people take longer to heal, there's also the aspect of how she's handling it (e.g., stalking, bitterness). The author's frustration is understandable, but the way they expressed it\u2014\"move the fuck on\"\u2014might be the issue. It's possible the author didn't handle it in a supportive way, which could have led to the sister avoiding them.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's not a simple yes or no. However, from the perspective of emotional support, the author might have been too abrupt. However, given the sister's behavior's impact on the household, the author's frustration is valid. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for their reaction. Since the sister's actions have been prolonged and harmful, the author's intervention, though harsh, might be seen as justified. However, the way they communicated it was not ideal. But the answer options are A or B. Considering the situation, the answer might lean towards the author not being in the wrong (B) because the sister's behavior was problematic and the author's frustration is understandable, even if the approach was harsh. But some might argue that the author should have been more supportive. However, given the sister's ongoing negative impact, the author's action might be seen as a necessary but poorly handled intervention. So, the answer is B.\n"
