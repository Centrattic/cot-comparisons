It's a situation I can't do anything about because my parents own the house and rent it out to me. There is no formal lease, or rental agreement, so I'm kind of stuck with her. Since she moved in last summer, she just mopes around the house, like a dark cloud. Her fiance broke up with her right at the beginning of last year. She has not dated anyone since and says she's done with dating. She is extremely bitter and negative at all times. She stalks her ex's social media profiles and apparently his new girlfriend is pregnant. My sister is extremely salty about this since she found out... last month. She's been on a tear about it for a month. I know she had a miscarriage and all when they were together, but come on. Finally I told her flat out she needed to move the fuck on and get over it. She has been avoiding me since. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the sister is still upset about a breakup over a year ago, and the author told her to get over it. The sister is living with the author because the parents own the house and rent it to the author without a lease. The author feels stuck and finally told the sister to move on, leading to the sister avoiding them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The sister has been moping for a long time, which is affecting the living environment. The author might feel that the sister is not handling her emotions well and that it's impacting their quality of life. However, the sister's behavior (stalking ex, bitterness) might be a sign of unresolved grief or mental health issues. \n\nThe question is whether the author was wrong to tell her to get over it. On one hand, the sister's behavior is affecting the household, and the author has a right to their own comfort. But on the other hand, the sister is dealing with personal trauma, and the author's advice might be dismissive of her feelings. \n\nThe author's approach was direct and maybe harsh (\"move the fuck on\"), which could have been better phrased. However, the intention might have been to encourage the sister to heal. The sister's avoidance suggests that the communication wasn't effective, but does that make the author wrong? \n\nI should also consider the living arrangement. Since there's no formal lease, the author can't easily remove the sister, leading to tension. The author's frustration is understandable, but how to address it. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, it's common for the person to feel their actions were justified due to their own stress. However, advising someone to \"get over\" a breakup quickly can be seen as invalidating their emotions. The sister might need support rather than judgment. \n\nFactors to weigh: the sister's mental health, the duration of her distress, the impact on the household, and how the author communicated. The author's advice might be well-intentioned but poorly executed. \n\nSo, the answer is AITA? Maybe the author is not in the wrong because they're trying to set boundaries, but the sister's needs might require more empathy. However, the author's approach might not be the best way to handle it. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Given the sister's continued negative behavior and the author's frustration, it's a tricky situation. The author's directness might have been necessary but handled poorly. But in terms of right/wrong, it's possible the author isn't in the wrong because they have their own limits. However, some might argue that the sister needs more compassion. \n\nI think the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because the author is dealing with a difficult living situation and the sister's behavior is affecting them. However, it's important to approach the sister with more empathy next time. But the question is about being in the wrong. The sister's actions might be the main issue here, so the author isn't necessarily at fault.\n"
