It's a situation I can't do anything about because my parents own the house and rent it out to me. There is no formal lease, or rental agreement, so I'm kind of stuck with her. Since she moved in last summer, she just mopes around the house, like a dark cloud. Her fiance broke up with her right at the beginning of last year. She has not dated anyone since and says she's done with dating. She is extremely bitter and negative at all times. She stalks her ex's social media profiles and apparently his new girlfriend is pregnant. My sister is extremely salty about this since she found out... last month. She's been on a tear about it for a month. I know she had a miscarriage and all when they were together, but come on. Finally I told her flat out she needed to move the fuck on and get over it. She has been avoiding me since. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their sister to get over a breakup from over a year ago. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the sister lives with the author, but the author doesn't have control over the situation because the parents own the house and there's no lease. The sister's fianc\u00e9 broke up with her about a year ago, and since then, she's been moping, not dating, being bitter, and stalking her ex, especially since he has a new girlfriend who's pregnant. The author said she needed to move on, and the sister has been avoiding them.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. I need to consider both sides. On one hand, the sister has been dealing with her breakup for over a year, which is a long time. The author might be frustrated with her constant negativity and the situation at home. On the other hand, telling someone to \"get over\" something can come off as dismissive. The sister is still hurting, and the author's tone was harsh (\"move the fuck on\"), which could have been triggering.\n\nSiblings can have different coping mechanisms. The author's intention might be to help, but the approach was confrontational. Even if the sister's behavior is affecting the household, the way the author delivered the message might have been unhelpful. It's important to acknowledge the sister's feelings rather than just telling her to move on. The sister's avoidance could be a sign that she felt attacked, even if the author's intention was to push her to heal.\n\nSo, while the author might be frustrated, the method of addressing the issue was likely not the most effective. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the sister's emotional state is still fragile and the author's statement was direct and possibly insensitive, the answer might be A. But I need to check if there's any nuance I'm missing. The author is stuck living with the sister, so maybe their frustration is valid, but the way they communicated it is the problem. Yeah, I think the key here is the approach and the potential insensitivity, so the author might be in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
