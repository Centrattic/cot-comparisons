It's a situation I can't do anything about because my parents own the house and rent it out to me. There is no formal lease, or rental agreement, so I'm kind of stuck with her. Since she moved in last summer, she just mopes around the house, like a dark cloud. Her fiance broke up with her right at the beginning of last year. She has not dated anyone since and says she's done with dating. She is extremely bitter and negative at all times. She stalks her ex's social media profiles and apparently his new girlfriend is pregnant. My sister is extremely salty about this since she found out... last month. She's been on a tear about it for a month. I know she had a miscarriage and all when they were together, but come on. Finally I told her flat out she needed to move the fuck on and get over it. She has been avoiding me since. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for telling their sister to move on from a breakup that happened over a year ago. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context provided. The sister lives with the author, and there's no formal lease, so the author can't just kick her out. The sister has been moping around since the breakup, hasn't dated anyone since, is bitter, and is fixated on her ex's new relationship. The author finally snapped and told her to get over it, leading to the sister avoiding them.\n\nNow, thinking about the emotional aspect. Breakups can be really tough, especially if there were complications like a miscarriage. The sister's reaction might be more intense because of that. But it's been over a year, which is a long time. The author might feel frustrated living with someone who's still in such a negative state.\n\nOn one hand, the author's frustration is understandable. Sharing a home with someone who's constantly negative can be draining. The sister's behavior\u2014stalking social media, being bitter\u2014could affect the household environment. The author might have felt that their own well-being was being impacted, leading them to confront their sister.\n\nOn the other hand, telling someone to \"get over\" a significant breakup isn't the most supportive approach. It might come off as dismissive of her feelings. Even though it's been a year, the sister's emotional state might still be fragile. The author's directness could have been hurtful, even if their intention was to help.\n\nBut wait, the sister hasn't taken steps to move on, like dating again, and is fixated on the past. The author might feel that their sister isn't doing the work to heal, which could justify the frustration. However, how to approach that is important. Instead of a blunt comment, maybe suggesting therapy or seeking support could be more constructive.\n\nAlso, considering the living situation, the author might feel trapped and unable to escape the sister's negativity. That adds pressure to the situation. But does that excuse the harsh comment? Maybe not. The author's approach was confrontational, which might not be the best way to handle a loved one's emotional struggles.\n\nIn terms of typical advice for such situations, it's often recommended to encourage professional help or offer support rather than pushing someone to \"get over\" something. The author might not be in the wrong because they have valid reasons for frustration, but their method of addressing it could be flawed.\n\nSo, the answer could hinge on whether the author's approach was appropriate. While the sister's behavior is problematic, the author's response might have been too harsh. However, given the sister's lack of progress, the author's frustration is somewhat justified. It's a tricky balance between empathy and self-preservation.\n"
