It's a situation I can't do anything about because my parents own the house and rent it out to me. There is no formal lease, or rental agreement, so I'm kind of stuck with her. Since she moved in last summer, she just mopes around the house, like a dark cloud. Her fiance broke up with her right at the beginning of last year. She has not dated anyone since and says she's done with dating. She is extremely bitter and negative at all times. She stalks her ex's social media profiles and apparently his new girlfriend is pregnant. My sister is extremely salty about this since she found out... last month. She's been on a tear about it for a month. I know she had a miscarriage and all when they were together, but come on. Finally I told her flat out she needed to move the fuck on and get over it. She has been avoiding me since. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for telling their sister to get over a breakup from over a year ago. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The sister lives with the author, and there's no rental agreement, so she can't leave. The sister's ex broke up with her a year ago, and she hasn't moved on. She's been moping, is bitter, stalks her ex on social media, and is upset because the ex has a new girlfriend who's pregnant. The author told her to move on, and now they're avoiding each other.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author was wrong to tell her sister to get over it. Let's consider the dynamics here. The sister has been dealing with the breakup for over a year, which is a long time. The author is living with her and is probably frustrated by her constant negativity and lack of progress. The sister's behavior is affecting the household environment, making it a \"dark cloud.\" The author's comment might have been a reaction to that ongoing stress.\n\nFrom a psychological standpoint, grief and moving on from a breakup can take time. However, a year is a long time, and if the sister isn't making progress, maybe the author's frustration is understandable. But the way the author expressed it\u2014\"move the fuck on\"\u2014could be seen as dismissive of her sister's feelings. Even if the author is right that the sister should move on, the tone might have been harsh.\n\nAlso, the sister's behavior of stalking and her bitterness might be valid reasons for the author to want her to change. But the author's statement might have come off as insensitive, especially considering the sister's miscarriage. The author might not have considered that the sister is still healing and that the author's advice, while well-intentioned, was delivered in a way that shut down communication.\n\nOn the other hand, the sister's behavior is affecting the author's living situation. The author might feel that the sister isn't taking responsibility for her actions, which could lead to a toxic environment. The author might not have had better options if they couldn't remove the sister from the house.\n\nSo, the key points are: the sister's ongoing suffering, the author's frustration, and the communication style. The author might be in the right in terms of needing the sister to change her behavior but in the wrong in how they expressed it. However, since the question is about being in the wrong, if the author's advice was valid but the delivery was poor, does that make them in the wrong? Or is the content of the message what matters more?\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often considers the intent and the impact. If the author's intent was to help but the method was harsh, it's possible they're not in the wrong. However, if the sister's feelings were dismissed, maybe the author is in the wrong. The sister has been dealing with this for over a year, so expecting her to \"get over it\" might be unrealistic. The author's frustration is valid, but their approach might have been too harsh. \n\nI think the answer would lean towards the author being in the wrong because they didn't handle the situation with enough empathy. Even if the sister's behavior is problematic, telling her to \"move the fuck on\" is dismissive and could worsen the situation. The author should have approached it with more support or sought to understand rather than giving a blunt command. So, Answer A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) might be the correct choice here.\n"
