It's a situation I can't do anything about because my parents own the house and rent it out to me. There is no formal lease, or rental agreement, so I'm kind of stuck with her. Since she moved in last summer, she just mopes around the house, like a dark cloud. Her fiance broke up with her right at the beginning of last year. She has not dated anyone since and says she's done with dating. She is extremely bitter and negative at all times. She stalks her ex's social media profiles and apparently his new girlfriend is pregnant. My sister is extremely salty about this since she found out... last month. She's been on a tear about it for a month. I know she had a miscarriage and all when they were together, but come on. Finally I told her flat out she needed to move the fuck on and get over it. She has been avoiding me since. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves their sister who's been moping about a breakup over a year ago, and the writer told her to get over it. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The sister lives with the author, which is a shared living space. The breakup was over a year ago, and the sister hasn't moved on, showing bitterness and stalking her ex's social media. The author, feeling stuck in the situation because they can't move out, finally told her sister to get over it, leading to the sister avoiding them.\n\nThe key points here are the duration of the breakup and the sister's behavior. A year is a long time, and it's reasonable to expect someone to start moving on, but grief and emotional processing vary. The author might feel frustrated living with someone who's constantly negative. However, telling someone to \"get over\" a breakup can come off as dismissive. The sister's reaction to the new girlfriend's pregnancy and her past miscarriage adds layers of emotional pain.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's a bit nuanced. The author isn't wrong for feeling frustrated, but their approach might be harsh. The sister's behavior is problematic, but the author could have handled it differently, like offering support instead of direct criticism. The AITA community often considers the balance of empathy and responsibility. Here, the author might be seen as justified in their frustration but could have been more compassionate in their approach. So, maybe the answer is B, not in the wrong, but with a note that their method could be improved. However, some might argue that the author is dismissive of their sister's feelings, making them at fault. But given the prolonged situation and the sister's ongoing negative behavior, the author's frustration is understandable. The answer likely leans towards B.\n"
