It's a situation I can't do anything about because my parents own the house and rent it out to me. There is no formal lease, or rental agreement, so I'm kind of stuck with her. Since she moved in last summer, she just mopes around the house, like a dark cloud. Her fiance broke up with her right at the beginning of last year. She has not dated anyone since and says she's done with dating. She is extremely bitter and negative at all times. She stalks her ex's social media profiles and apparently his new girlfriend is pregnant. My sister is extremely salty about this since she found out... last month. She's been on a tear about it for a month. I know she had a miscarriage and all when they were together, but come on. Finally I told her flat out she needed to move the fuck on and get over it. She has been avoiding me since. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for telling their sister to move on from a breakup that happened over a year ago. The context given is that the sister is living with them, and the house situation is complicated because their parents own it. The sister has been acting negatively for a while, and the author finally told her to get over it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The sister has been dealing with the breakup for over a year, and according to the author, she's been moping, being bitter, and is stuck in a negative cycle. The author felt compelled to confront her, which led to the sister avoiding them. The question is whether the author's actions were in the wrong.\n\nOn one hand, the author might feel that their sister is dragging them down and the living situation is uncomfortable. They might have a valid concern about the sister's prolonged negativity affecting their own well-being. The author's advice, while direct, could be seen as coming from a place of wanting their sister to heal and move forward.\n\nOn the other hand, telling someone to \"get over it\" is often seen as dismissive. Grieving and processing a breakup, especially one involving a miscarriage, can take time. The sister might feel that the author is invalidating her feelings. Even if it's been a year, the sister is still dealing with emotional pain, and the author's approach might have been too harsh or impatient. The sister's reaction of avoiding the brother suggests that the confrontation might have been poorly handled, even if the concern was genuine.\n\nAdditionally, the author's tone in the question\u2014\"get over it\"\u2014can come across as insensitive. People often need support and empathy rather than being told to move on. The sister's bitterness and social media stalking might indicate unresolved feelings, and the author's response might have been too abrupt without understanding the deeper issues.\n\nBut then, considering the living arrangement and the author's own frustration, it's a complex family situation. The author isn't in a position to make the sister move out, so they might feel trapped in a toxic environment. The question is whether the author had the right to confront the sister in that way. The answer might depend on cultural norms, family dynamics, and how supportive the author was in the approach. If the author provided support and resources to help the sister heal, it might be more justified. But simply telling someone to \"get over it\" without understanding or offering help can be seen as inconsiderate.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often looks at intent and impact. The author's intent was likely to help their sister, but the impact was hurtful and caused a rift. The sister's behavior might be challenging, but the author's method of addressing it could be considered the wrong approach. So, maybe the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because the approach was dismissive, even if the concern was valid. Alternatively, if the author's frustration was justified due to the living situation, maybe B (not in the wrong). But AITA often sides with empathy and support, so the answer might lean towards A.\n"
