It's a situation I can't do anything about because my parents own the house and rent it out to me. There is no formal lease, or rental agreement, so I'm kind of stuck with her. Since she moved in last summer, she just mopes around the house, like a dark cloud. Her fiance broke up with her right at the beginning of last year. She has not dated anyone since and says she's done with dating. She is extremely bitter and negative at all times. She stalks her ex's social media profiles and apparently his new girlfriend is pregnant. My sister is extremely salty about this since she found out... last month. She's been on a tear about it for a month. I know she had a miscarriage and all when they were together, but come on. Finally I told her flat out she needed to move the fuck on and get over it. She has been avoiding me since. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their sister to get over a breakup that happened over a year ago. The sister is still living with the author, and the situation is that she's been moping around, is bitter, and has been upset about her ex's new girlfriend being pregnant. The author finally told her to move on, and now the sister is avoiding them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The sister's breakup was over a year ago, but she's still not moving on. She's been negative and stalking her ex. The author is frustrated and tried to tell her to get over it. The sister is now avoiding the author. The author is in a situation where they can't remove the sister since the parents own the house and there's no lease. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, the sister's behavior is clearly ongoing and affecting the household. The author is concerned about the sister's well-being and the toxic environment. But telling someone to \"get over\" a breakup might be dismissive. However, the sister has been avoiding the author since, which suggests the author's comment was hurtful or not well-received. \n\nI should think about whether the author's approach was appropriate. While the sister's behavior is unhealthy, the author's direct approach might have come off as insensitive. The sister might still be grieving, even if it's been a year. The author's frustration is understandable, but maybe a more supportive method, like encouraging therapy or offering empathy, would have been better. \n\nBut the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The sister's actions are problematic, so the author's intervention might be justified. However, the way it was phrased could be seen as harsh. The key here is whether the author's response was the right way to handle the sister's ongoing emotional state. \n\nIn general, pushing someone to \"get over\" something can be unhelpful. It's better to validate feelings and encourage healing at their own pace. The author might be right to want the sister to move on but the method could be at fault. Also, the sister's miscarriage adds another layer\u2014maybe the author didn't consider how that past trauma is affecting her. \n\nSo, the answer would depend on the approach. The author isn't in the wrong for wanting the sister to heal, but the way they said it might be. Since the sister is avoiding them, it's possible the author's tone was too aggressive. Therefore, the author could be partly at fault for how they communicated it, even if the underlying concern is valid. \n\nI think the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because the approach was perhaps too harsh without addressing the sister's emotions properly. However, there's nuance here. But given the sister's ongoing issues and the author's frustration, maybe the answer is B (No, not in the wrong). Wait, but the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The sister's behavior is bad, but the author's response might have been unhelpful. The key is that the author's statement could be dismissive and not supportive. So, the answer is A.\n"
