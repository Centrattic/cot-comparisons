It's a situation I can't do anything about because my parents own the house and rent it out to me. There is no formal lease, or rental agreement, so I'm kind of stuck with her. Since she moved in last summer, she just mopes around the house, like a dark cloud. Her fiance broke up with her right at the beginning of last year. She has not dated anyone since and says she's done with dating. She is extremely bitter and negative at all times. She stalks her ex's social media profiles and apparently his new girlfriend is pregnant. My sister is extremely salty about this since she found out... last month. She's been on a tear about it for a month. I know she had a miscarriage and all when they were together, but come on. Finally I told her flat out she needed to move the fuck on and get over it. She has been avoiding me since. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for telling their sister to move on from a breakup that happened over a year ago. The sister has been living with the author since last summer, and the author feels stuck because the parents own the house.\n\nFirst, the sister's ex broke up with her a year ago, and she's been moping, bitter, and negative since. She's stalking ex's social media, which has caused her to be upset when she found out about his new girlfriend's pregnancy. The author finally told her to get over it, and now she's avoiding them.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong but wants my opinion. I need to decide between A (author is wrong) or B (not wrong).\n\nFrom a psychological perspective, grief and heartbreak can linger for a long time. Even a year later, the sister might still be struggling. The author's frustration is understandable, especially living together and dealing with the sister's negativity daily. But is it appropriate to tell someone they need to move on? Maybe the author didn't realize that healing isn't linear and some people take longer. Also, the sister's behavior (stalking, negativity) might be affecting the author's quality of life, making the author feel they need to set boundaries.\n\nOn the other hand, the author could have approached the sister with more empathy. Instead of directly telling her to get over it, maybe expressing concern and offering support would have been better. However, the sister's behavior has been ongoing and impactful, so the author's frustration is valid. The key points are the sister's prolonged negative behavior and the author's attempt to address it.\n\nConsidering all this, the author's intention might be to help, but the approach could be seen as harsh. However, given the sister's unchanging behavior and the living situation, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. So the answer would be B.\n"
