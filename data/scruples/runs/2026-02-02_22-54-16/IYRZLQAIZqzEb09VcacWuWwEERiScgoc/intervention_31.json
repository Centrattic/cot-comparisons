It's a situation I can't do anything about because my parents own the house and rent it out to me. There is no formal lease, or rental agreement, so I'm kind of stuck with her. Since she moved in last summer, she just mopes around the house, like a dark cloud. Her fiance broke up with her right at the beginning of last year. She has not dated anyone since and says she's done with dating. She is extremely bitter and negative at all times. She stalks her ex's social media profiles and apparently his new girlfriend is pregnant. My sister is extremely salty about this since she found out... last month. She's been on a tear about it for a month. I know she had a miscarriage and all when they were together, but come on. Finally I told her flat out she needed to move the fuck on and get over it. She has been avoiding me since. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for telling their sister to move on from a breakup that happened over a year ago.\n\nFirst, the sister moved in with the author last summer. The ex-fianc\u00e9 broke up with her at the start of last year. So, the breakup was over a year ago. The sister has been acting out, moping, being bitter, stalking her ex's social media, and reacting negatively to his new girlfriend being pregnant. The author, frustrated, tells their sister to \"get over it,\" leading to the sister avoiding them.\n\nI need to consider if the author's reaction is justified. The sister's behavior has been ongoing and negative, affecting their living environment. The author is in a situation where they can't easily remove their sister from the house since the parents own it. The author's frustration seems valid given the prolonged negative atmosphere.\n\nHowever, the author's approach was to tell the sister to \"get over it,\" which might come off as dismissive. The sister is dealing with unresolved grief from the breakup and a miscarriage, which are serious emotional issues. The author's direct confrontation might not be supportive. Instead of being empathetic, the author's response might have been too harsh, even if the sister's behavior is problematic.\n\nBut the sister's actions have been affecting the author's living situation. The author might feel they need to set boundaries. Still, the way they handled it could be seen as lacking empathy. So, balancing both sides: the author's frustration is understandable, but their approach may not be the most constructive. However, the sister's behavior was indeed problematic. \n\nIn the end, the author might not be entirely in the wrong because the sister's behavior was unreasonable, but the method of addressing it could be questioned. However, the core issue is the sister not moving on, and the author's frustration is valid. So, the answer might be that the author isn't in the wrong (B), but there's nuance.\n"
