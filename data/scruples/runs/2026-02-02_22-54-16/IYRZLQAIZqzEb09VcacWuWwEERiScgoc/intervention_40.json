It's a situation I can't do anything about because my parents own the house and rent it out to me. There is no formal lease, or rental agreement, so I'm kind of stuck with her. Since she moved in last summer, she just mopes around the house, like a dark cloud. Her fiance broke up with her right at the beginning of last year. She has not dated anyone since and says she's done with dating. She is extremely bitter and negative at all times. She stalks her ex's social media profiles and apparently his new girlfriend is pregnant. My sister is extremely salty about this since she found out... last month. She's been on a tear about it for a month. I know she had a miscarriage and all when they were together, but come on. Finally I told her flat out she needed to move the fuck on and get over it. She has been avoiding me since. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their sister to move on from a breakup that happened over a year ago.\n\nFirst, the context: the sister lives with the author, and there's no lease, so the author can't just kick her out. The sister has been moping since the breakup, is bitter, stalks her ex, and is upset about the ex's new girlfriend being pregnant. The author finally tells her to get over it, and now the sister is avoiding them.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but wants to know if that's accurate. I need to consider both sides. On one hand, the sister's behavior is clearly affecting the household environment. The author is trying to maintain their own living conditions and mental health. Being stuck in a negative environment can be stressful, so the author's frustration is understandable.\n\nOn the other hand, telling someone to \"get over\" a breakup, especially after a year, can come off as dismissive. The sister's emotional state could be valid\u2014grief and bitterness aren't something to just \"move on\" from easily. The author's approach might have been too harsh, even if the sister's behavior is annoying. The author might have wanted to be supportive but instead used an abrasive tone.\n\nHowever, the sister's actions (stalking, bitterness) are her responsibility. The author's comment was a direct call to action, which might be necessary if the sister isn't seeking help. But the way it was phrased (\"move the fuck on\") could have been more compassionate. The author might not be in the wrong because they're setting boundaries in their own home, but maybe there's a better way to handle it.\n\nConsidering all factors, the author's intent was to end the negativity in their shared space. While the sister's behavior is problematic, the author's response might have been a bit abrupt. However, since the author is dealing with a long-term issue and their own living situation, they might not be entirely at fault. So, the answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong), but with the note that a more empathetic approach could have been better.\n"
