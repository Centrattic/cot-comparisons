It's a situation I can't do anything about because my parents own the house and rent it out to me. There is no formal lease, or rental agreement, so I'm kind of stuck with her. Since she moved in last summer, she just mopes around the house, like a dark cloud. Her fiance broke up with her right at the beginning of last year. She has not dated anyone since and says she's done with dating. She is extremely bitter and negative at all times. She stalks her ex's social media profiles and apparently his new girlfriend is pregnant. My sister is extremely salty about this since she found out... last month. She's been on a tear about it for a month. I know she had a miscarriage and all when they were together, but come on. Finally I told her flat out she needed to move the fuck on and get over it. She has been avoiding me since. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the question is in the wrong for telling their sister to move on from a breakup that happened over a year ago. The sister lives with them, and the writer can't move out because it's their parents' house. The sister has been acting really negatively, moping around, stalking her ex's social media, and is bitter. The writer finally told her to get over it, and now the sister is avoiding them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The sister's behavior has been going on for over a year, which is a long time. The writer is frustrated and maybe feels that the sister isn't dealing with her emotions healthily. The sister's actions, like stalking and being negative, might be affecting the household environment negatively. The writer might feel that their own well-being is affected by the sister's constant negativity.\n\nHowever, telling someone to \"get over\" a breakup, especially a year later, can come off as dismissive. Even if the sister's behavior is causing problems, the way the writer approached it might not be the most supportive. It's possible that the sister is still struggling with grief or unresolved issues from the breakup and the miscarriage. The writer might not have considered the emotional complexity behind the sister's behavior.\n\nOn the other hand, the writer might feel that they have a right to a peaceful living environment and that the sister's behavior is toxic. The sister's continued negativity and avoidance of dating could be signs of deeper issues that need professional help, but the writer isn't in a position to force that. The writer's frustration is understandable, but the approach taken might have been too harsh without prior attempts to support or communicate more effectively.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the writer isn't necessarily \"wrong,\" but they could have handled the situation differently. Maybe offering support, encouraging professional counseling, or setting boundaries without being dismissive. The key here is whether the writer's response was compassionate enough. The sister's reaction of avoiding the writer suggests that the approach might have been too abrupt or hurtful.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the answer might lean towards the writer being in the wrong (A) because the approach was dismissive and could have been more empathetic. However, there's also understanding for the writer's frustration. But in terms of right or wrong, the sister's emotional state and the writer's harsh response make the writer at fault.\n"
