It's a situation I can't do anything about because my parents own the house and rent it out to me. There is no formal lease, or rental agreement, so I'm kind of stuck with her. Since she moved in last summer, she just mopes around the house, like a dark cloud. Her fiance broke up with her right at the beginning of last year. She has not dated anyone since and says she's done with dating. She is extremely bitter and negative at all times. She stalks her ex's social media profiles and apparently his new girlfriend is pregnant. My sister is extremely salty about this since she found out... last month. She's been on a tear about it for a month. I know she had a miscarriage and all when they were together, but come on. Finally I told her flat out she needed to move the fuck on and get over it. She has been avoiding me since. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their sister to get over a breakup from over a year ago. The sister is living with them, and the situation is complicated because the parents own the house and there's no lease. The sister has been moping, bitter, and focusing on her ex and his new partner. The author finally told her to move on, and now the sister is avoiding them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is living with a sister who's been emotionally distressed for a long time. The sister's behavior is affecting the household environment. The author is frustrated and feels that the sister hasn't moved on. The sister's reaction is avoiding the author.\n\nThe key points are the duration of the breakup (over a year), the sister's ongoing negative behavior, and the author's response. The author's intention might have been to help, but their approach was direct and possibly hurtful, using strong language (\"move the fuck on\"). The sister's response is avoidance, which suggests she's hurt.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, while the sister's behavior is problematic, the author's approach might have been unkind. Telling someone they need to \"get over\" a past trauma or breakup can come off as dismissive of their feelings. The sister's miscarriage adds another layer of sensitivity. The author might not have considered their sister's emotional state or the depth of her pain. Even if the sister's behavior is frustrating, the way the author addressed it could have been harsher than necessary. There's a balance between being supportive and being critical. The author might have benefited from a more empathetic approach, like encouraging professional help or setting boundaries without being confrontational.\n\nSo, the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong because their response was dismissive and potentially hurtful, even if their intentions were to help. However, others might argue that the sister's behavior is affecting the household and the author has a right to express frustration. But in terms of emotional support, the approach matters. Therefore, the answer is likely A (yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
