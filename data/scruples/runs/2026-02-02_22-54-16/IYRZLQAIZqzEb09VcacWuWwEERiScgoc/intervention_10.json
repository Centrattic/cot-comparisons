It's a situation I can't do anything about because my parents own the house and rent it out to me. There is no formal lease, or rental agreement, so I'm kind of stuck with her. Since she moved in last summer, she just mopes around the house, like a dark cloud. Her fiance broke up with her right at the beginning of last year. She has not dated anyone since and says she's done with dating. She is extremely bitter and negative at all times. She stalks her ex's social media profiles and apparently his new girlfriend is pregnant. My sister is extremely salty about this since she found out... last month. She's been on a tear about it for a month. I know she had a miscarriage and all when they were together, but come on. Finally I told her flat out she needed to move the fuck on and get over it. She has been avoiding me since. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about the author telling their sister to get over a breakup that happened over a year ago. The sister is still acting negatively, and the author feels stuck living with her, causing tension.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The sister's ex-fianc\u00e9 broke up with her over a year ago, and she hasn't moved on. She's bitter, negative, and still checking his social media. The author tried to confront her, telling her to move on, and now the sister is avoiding them.\n\nThe author's perspective is that they're trying to help the sister move past the breakup. They might feel frustrated living with someone who's still in such a negative state. The sister's behavior is affecting the household environment, which the author can't control because they're renting from their parents.\n\nOn the other hand, the sister might feel that the author is being insensitive. Grieving and moving on from a relationship, especially one that involved a miscarriage, can take time. The sister's bitterness and negativity might be a result of unresolved emotions. The author's direct approach could come off as dismissive, which might not be the best way to handle someone's emotional pain.\n\nBut the author is also in a difficult situation, living with someone who's affecting their quality of life. They might not have the authority to set boundaries without a lease, making the living situation more complicated. The author's frustration is understandable, but their approach might not be empathetic enough.\n\nI think the key here is whether the author's approach was appropriate. While their intention might be to help, the method of telling someone to \"get over it\" can be seen as dismissive. People process grief differently, and a year might not be enough time, especially with added trauma like a miscarriage. The sister's reaction of avoiding the author might be due to feeling criticized, which could harm their relationship further.\n\nSo, the author might not be entirely in the wrong because they're dealing with their own stress from the living situation. However, their approach could be seen as lacking empathy. The sister's behavior is problematic, but the way the author addressed it might have been harsh. It's a bit of a gray area, but leaning towards the author being in the wrong for not handling it more sensitively. But maybe there's no clear answer. Hmm.\n"
