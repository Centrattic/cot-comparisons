It's a situation I can't do anything about because my parents own the house and rent it out to me. There is no formal lease, or rental agreement, so I'm kind of stuck with her. Since she moved in last summer, she just mopes around the house, like a dark cloud. Her fiance broke up with her right at the beginning of last year. She has not dated anyone since and says she's done with dating. She is extremely bitter and negative at all times. She stalks her ex's social media profiles and apparently his new girlfriend is pregnant. My sister is extremely salty about this since she found out... last month. She's been on a tear about it for a month. I know she had a miscarriage and all when they were together, but come on. Finally I told her flat out she needed to move the fuck on and get over it. She has been avoiding me since. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is wrong for telling their sister to get over a breakup that happened over a year ago.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The sister lives with the author, and there's no formal lease, so the author can't do anything about her staying. The sister broke up with her fianc\u00e9 over a year ago but is still really affected by it. She's been mooping, bitter, negative, and stalking her ex on social media, especially after finding out he has a new girlfriend who's pregnant. The author finally told her to move on, and now the sister is avoiding them.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nI need to consider the dynamics here. The sister is dealing with unresolved grief and emotional pain from a breakup. A year is a long time, but healing processes vary. However, the sister's behavior is affecting the household environment, making the author's living situation difficult. The author is frustrated and had to respond, but maybe they could have handled it differently.\n\nOn one hand, the sister is dealing with emotional trauma, which is a valid experience. The author might not realize how long it takes to process such a loss, especially with a miscarriage involved. Telling someone to \"get over\" a breakup can come off as dismissive of their feelings, even if the author is frustrated. It's possible the sister needs support rather than criticism.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is also living in the same house and dealing with the sister's negativity. The sister's behavior is affecting their quality of life, so the author might feel they have a right to express their frustration. However, the author's approach was confrontational, which could have been more empathetic. Maybe there's a middle ground where the author could encourage the sister to seek help without being dismissive.\n\nThe key points are the sister's ongoing emotional struggle and the author's frustration. The author might not be in the wrong entirely because the sister's behavior is impacting their life, but the approach taken could have been more compassionate. Alternatively, the sister's behavior is a result of her trauma, and the author didn't validate her feelings, leading to the conflict.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often considers intent and impact. The author's intent was to help the sister move on, but the impact was hurtful. The sister's actions are a result of her emotional state, so the author might have a valid point about the living situation, but their method of addressing it could be seen as harsh. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might lean towards A (the author is in the wrong) because pushing someone to \"get over\" a breakup without understanding their process can be harmful. However, there's also nuance here. The answer might depend on cultural or personal perspectives on handling such situations. But generally, in these threads, advising someone to move on without empathy is often seen as the asshole move.\n"
