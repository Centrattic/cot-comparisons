It's a situation I can't do anything about because my parents own the house and rent it out to me. There is no formal lease, or rental agreement, so I'm kind of stuck with her. Since she moved in last summer, she just mopes around the house, like a dark cloud. Her fiance broke up with her right at the beginning of last year. She has not dated anyone since and says she's done with dating. She is extremely bitter and negative at all times. She stalks her ex's social media profiles and apparently his new girlfriend is pregnant. My sister is extremely salty about this since she found out... last month. She's been on a tear about it for a month. I know she had a miscarriage and all when they were together, but come on. Finally I told her flat out she needed to move the fuck on and get over it. She has been avoiding me since. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The sister is still upset about a breakup from over a year ago, and the author told her to get over it, leading to the sister avoiding them. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The sister has been living with the author, and there's no lease, so the author can't remove her. The sister's behavior is affecting the living environment\u2014moping, bitterness, stalking ex's social media. The breakup was over a year ago, and the sister hasn't moved on. The author's reaction was to tell her to move on, which caused tension.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, emotions can linger, and healing timelines vary. The sister's behavior has been ongoing and negative, so the author might have felt overwhelmed. However, telling someone to \"get over it\" can come off as dismissive, invalidating their feelings. Even if the author's intention was to help, the approach might not be supportive. The sister might need empathy rather than pressure. The author's frustration is understandable, but the method of addressing it might be the issue. So, maybe the author isn't entirely wrong, but their approach could be improved. But the question is whether they are in the wrong. Since the sister's actions are affecting the household, the author might have a right to express frustration, but the way they did it might be unhelpful. The answer might lean towards A (yes, in the wrong) because of the dismissive response, even if the sister's behavior was problematic. Alternatively, the author's intent was to help, so maybe B. Need to decide based on typical advice for such situations. Usually, telling someone to \"get over it\" is seen as invalidating. So the author's approach is problematic, making them at least partially in the wrong. Therefore, answer A."
