It's a situation I can't do anything about because my parents own the house and rent it out to me. There is no formal lease, or rental agreement, so I'm kind of stuck with her. Since she moved in last summer, she just mopes around the house, like a dark cloud. Her fiance broke up with her right at the beginning of last year. She has not dated anyone since and says she's done with dating. She is extremely bitter and negative at all times. She stalks her ex's social media profiles and apparently his new girlfriend is pregnant. My sister is extremely salty about this since she found out... last month. She's been on a tear about it for a month. I know she had a miscarriage and all when they were together, but come on. Finally I told her flat out she needed to move the fuck on and get over it. She has been avoiding me since. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their sister to move on from a breakup that happened over a year ago. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The sister is living with the author because the parents own the house and rent it to them. There's no formal lease, so the author can't really kick her out. The sister has been moping since the breakup a year ago, is bitter, stalks her ex, and is upset about his new girlfriend's pregnancy. The author told her to get over it, and now the sister is avoiding them. \n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. But the question is whether the author did the right thing. Let me break it down.\n\nThe sister's behavior is clearly affecting the household. She's been negative for over a year, which is a long time. The author might feel frustrated. But the sister is dealing with a miscarriage and a breakup. That's a lot to process. Telling someone to \"get over\" a breakup so quickly, especially after a miscarriage, could be seen as dismissive of her feelings. Even though a year has passed, some people take longer to heal. The author's approach might have come off as harsh, especially if it wasn't done with empathy.\n\nOn the other hand, the sister's prolonged negativity is affecting the author's living environment. The author might feel they have a right to address the sister's behavior if it's impacting them. However, the way the author addressed it\u2014telling her to \"move the fuck on\"\u2014could be seen as disrespectful. Maybe a more supportive approach would have been better, like encouraging her to seek help or express her feelings in healthier ways.\n\nSo, the key points are: the sister's emotional state, the author's frustration, and the method used to address the issue. The author's intention might have been to help, but the approach might have been too direct or lacking in compassion. Whether that makes the author in the wrong depends on how one views the balance between personal boundaries and emotional support.\n\nI think the answer here is A (the author is in the wrong) because even if the sister's behavior is problematic, telling someone to \"get over\" a significant life event in a harsh manner isn't helpful. The author might have needed to approach it with more empathy and perhaps seek a different way to support the sister rather than dismiss her feelings.\n"
