It's a situation I can't do anything about because my parents own the house and rent it out to me. There is no formal lease, or rental agreement, so I'm kind of stuck with her. Since she moved in last summer, she just mopes around the house, like a dark cloud. Her fiance broke up with her right at the beginning of last year. She has not dated anyone since and says she's done with dating. She is extremely bitter and negative at all times. She stalks her ex's social media profiles and apparently his new girlfriend is pregnant. My sister is extremely salty about this since she found out... last month. She's been on a tear about it for a month. I know she had a miscarriage and all when they were together, but come on. Finally I told her flat out she needed to move the fuck on and get over it. She has been avoiding me since. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for telling their sister to move on from a breakup over a year ago. The sister lives with them, and the situation is complicated by the fact that the author can't move out because the parents own the house.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The sister's ex broke up with her a year ago, and she's been moping, being bitter, stalking social media, and is especially upset because her ex has a new girlfriend who's pregnant. The author is frustrated and told her to \"get over it.\" Now the sister is avoiding them.\n\nThe key points here are the duration of the breakup (over a year), the sister's behavior (moping, bitterness, stalking), and the author's reaction. The question is whether the author's advice was inappropriate.\n\nFrom a psychological perspective, dealing with a breakup, especially one involving a miscarriage, can be very difficult. Some people take longer to heal. But a year is a significant amount of time. However, the sister's behavior seems to be affecting the entire household, creating a negative environment. The author is living in the same house and is also dealing with their sister's ongoing negativity.\n\nThe author's approach was to tell their sister to \"move the fuck on,\" which might come across as harsh, but given the context, they might feel that their sister is not handling the breakup appropriately and it's affecting their own well-being. The sister's avoidance suggests that the confrontation hurt her feelings, but maybe the author is justified in wanting to address the situation.\n\nHowever, the way it was said could be an issue. Telling someone to \"get over\" something they're still processing might invalidate their emotions. Even if the author is frustrated, approaching it with more empathy might have been better. But the question is about being in the wrong, not just the approach.\n\nThe sister's actions (stalking, bitterness) are problematic. The author might feel they need to set boundaries. Living in the same house without a lease makes it hard to avoid each other, so the author's frustration is understandable.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, it's often about balance. The sister's behavior is affecting the household, so the author has a right to express concern. But the method of confrontation might be too blunt. However, the sister's actions have been ongoing for a year, which could justify the author's reaction.\n\nConsidering all this, the author might not be in the wrong because they're trying to address a situation that's impacting their living environment. However, there's a nuance in how they approached it. But given the sister's behavior and the time elapsed, the author's frustration is valid. The answer would likely be B (Not in the wrong), but maybe with some caveats about approach.\n"
