It's a situation I can't do anything about because my parents own the house and rent it out to me. There is no formal lease, or rental agreement, so I'm kind of stuck with her. Since she moved in last summer, she just mopes around the house, like a dark cloud. Her fiance broke up with her right at the beginning of last year. She has not dated anyone since and says she's done with dating. She is extremely bitter and negative at all times. She stalks her ex's social media profiles and apparently his new girlfriend is pregnant. My sister is extremely salty about this since she found out... last month. She's been on a tear about it for a month. I know she had a miscarriage and all when they were together, but come on. Finally I told her flat out she needed to move the fuck on and get over it. She has been avoiding me since. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who told their sister to get over an old breakup is in the wrong. The sister's ex broke up with her over a year ago, and she's been stuck in this negative, bitter state ever since. The author, living in the same house with no formal lease, feels trapped and finally tells her sister to move on.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The sister's behavior has been affecting the household for months, and the author is frustrated. The sister's actions\u2014moping, being bitter, stalking ex's social media, etc.\u2014have created a tense living environment. The author's outburst was a response to this ongoing issue. \n\nBut then, was the author wrong to tell her sister to \"get over it\"? Well, the sister's emotional state has been prolonged, but suggesting she move on isn't inherently wrong. However, the approach might have been harsh. The key here is whether the author had the right to say that given their living situation. Since they live together but the sister is a tenant, the author might not have the authority to dictate her emotional responses. Also, the sister's mental health could be a factor. Maybe the author should have approached it with more empathy or suggested support instead of direct confrontation.\n\nBut the sister's behavior has been a year-long issue, and the author was fed up. The sister is avoiding the author now, which complicates things. The author might not be in the wrong because they were trying to address a negative environment, but perhaps the method could have been better. However, the sister's reaction is also a result of the author's frustration. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong. They were trying to address a long-standing problem that affected their living conditions. However, there's a case to be made for the author needing to approach it more sensitively. But given the situation, the answer is B (No).\n"
