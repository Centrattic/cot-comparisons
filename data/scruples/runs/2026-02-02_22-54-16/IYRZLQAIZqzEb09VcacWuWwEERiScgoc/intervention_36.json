It's a situation I can't do anything about because my parents own the house and rent it out to me. There is no formal lease, or rental agreement, so I'm kind of stuck with her. Since she moved in last summer, she just mopes around the house, like a dark cloud. Her fiance broke up with her right at the beginning of last year. She has not dated anyone since and says she's done with dating. She is extremely bitter and negative at all times. She stalks her ex's social media profiles and apparently his new girlfriend is pregnant. My sister is extremely salty about this since she found out... last month. She's been on a tear about it for a month. I know she had a miscarriage and all when they were together, but come on. Finally I told her flat out she needed to move the fuck on and get over it. She has been avoiding me since. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again to make sure I understand it correctly.\n\nThe person is living with their sister, who's been moping around since a breakup over a year ago. The sister's fianc\u00e9 broke up with her at the start of last year, and she hasn't dated anyone since. She's bitter, negative, and stalks her ex's social media. Her ex's new girlfriend is pregnant, which makes the sister really upset. The author finally told her to get over it, and now the sister is avoiding them. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I should consider the context. The author lives with their sister because the parents own the house and rent it out. There's no lease, so the author can't just kick her out. The sister has been living there since last summer, so it's been a while. The breakup was over a year ago, which is a significant amount of time. The sister's behavior includes moping, being negative, and stalking her ex. The author's response was to tell her to \"move the fuck on and get over it,\" which led to the sister avoiding them.\n\nNow, thinking about whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, the sister has been dealing with a breakup and the subsequent negative emotions for over a year. Maybe she's still grieving or dealing with unresolved feelings. The author's frustration is understandable because they're living with someone who's creating a toxic environment. But is it wrong to tell someone to move on from a breakup that's been over for a year?\n\nI remember that sometimes people need time to heal, and others might rush them through the grieving process. The sister's actions, like stalking her ex and being bitter, could indicate she's not processing her emotions healthily. However, telling someone to \"get over it\" might not be the best approach. It could be dismissive of her feelings, even if the author is frustrated.\n\nBut the author's intent might be to help their sister move on. Maybe they're tired of the negativity affecting their own life. However, the sister might feel criticized or not supported. The author's approach was direct and perhaps harsh, using a strong phrase (\"move the fuck on\"), which might have been hurtful.\n\nI should consider if there's a better way to approach the situation. Maybe instead of telling her to get over it, the author could offer support or suggest seeking professional help. But given the context of living together and the sister's behavior, the author's frustration is valid. However, the method of confronting her might have contributed to the sister avoiding them.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, they might not be entirely wrong because the sister's behavior has been problematic for a long time. But their approach could have been more empathetic. The key here is whether the author's response was appropriate given the circumstances. The sister's actions are affecting the author's living situation, so the author has a reason to want things to improve. However, demanding that someone move on from a year-old breakup might be unrealistic and insensitive.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's frustration is understandable, their approach might have been too harsh, leading the sister to avoid them. So, there's a chance the author is partially in the wrong. But maybe not entirely, because the sister's behavior was affecting them. It's a bit of a grey area. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. I think the answer might be B (No), but there's a nuance here. The author is not in the wrong, but their approach could have been better. However, given the context, maybe the answer is B. But I'm a bit conflicted here.\n"
