It's a situation I can't do anything about because my parents own the house and rent it out to me. There is no formal lease, or rental agreement, so I'm kind of stuck with her. Since she moved in last summer, she just mopes around the house, like a dark cloud. Her fiance broke up with her right at the beginning of last year. She has not dated anyone since and says she's done with dating. She is extremely bitter and negative at all times. She stalks her ex's social media profiles and apparently his new girlfriend is pregnant. My sister is extremely salty about this since she found out... last month. She's been on a tear about it for a month. I know she had a miscarriage and all when they were together, but come on. Finally I told her flat out she needed to move the fuck on and get over it. She has been avoiding me since. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for telling their sister to move on from a breakup that happened over a year ago.\n\nFirst, the situation: The sister lives with the author in a house owned by their parents. There's no lease, so the author can't ask her to leave. The sister has been moping since her fianc\u00e9 broke up with her over a year ago. She hasn't dated anyone since, is bitter, stalks her ex's social media, and is upset because her ex's new girlfriend is pregnant. The author finally told her to get over it, and now the sister is avoiding them.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but wants to know my take. I need to decide if the answer is A (yes) or B (no).\n\nFactors to consider: \n1. The sister has been dealing with this breakup for over a year. A year is a significant amount of time, but healing can vary. However, the sister's behavior (moping, bitterness, stalking) suggests she's struggling a lot.\n2. The author's intervention was direct: telling her to \"move the fuck on.\" That might come off as harsh, even if well-intentioned. The sister is in a vulnerable state, and being told to just get over it could be dismissive of her feelings.\n3. The sister's reaction of avoiding the author indicates that the confrontation hurt her feelings or made her feel unsupported.\n4. The author's own situation: they're stuck living with their sister and dealing with her negative behavior, which could be stressful. It's understandable they'd feel frustrated.\n\nPossible angles for AITA: The author might be seen as dismissive, not validating their sister's emotions. Even though the sister is acting out, the author's approach could be too harsh. Alternatively, the sister's behavior is unreasonable, and the author is just telling her to stop dragging everyone down.\n\nBut in AITA cases, the community often considers intent and the balance of actions. The sister's behavior is problematic, but the author's response could be seen as not supportive. However, the sister has had a year to process the breakup, and the author's frustration is understandable given the living situation. The key is whether the author was in the wrong for their approach. \n\nI think the line is thin. The author might be right to want their sister to move on but the delivery was harsh. However, the sister's behavior has been ongoing and negative. The community might side with the author here, considering the sister's actions are the main issue. So the answer is B (not in the wrong).\n"
