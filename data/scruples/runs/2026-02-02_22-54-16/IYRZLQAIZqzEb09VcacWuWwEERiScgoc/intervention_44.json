It's a situation I can't do anything about because my parents own the house and rent it out to me. There is no formal lease, or rental agreement, so I'm kind of stuck with her. Since she moved in last summer, she just mopes around the house, like a dark cloud. Her fiance broke up with her right at the beginning of last year. She has not dated anyone since and says she's done with dating. She is extremely bitter and negative at all times. She stalks her ex's social media profiles and apparently his new girlfriend is pregnant. My sister is extremely salty about this since she found out... last month. She's been on a tear about it for a month. I know she had a miscarriage and all when they were together, but come on. Finally I told her flat out she needed to move the fuck on and get over it. She has been avoiding me since. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their sister to get over a breakup that's over a year old. The sister has been living with the author for about a year since moving in last summer. The sister's fianc\u00e9 broke up with her at the start of last year, and she hasn't dated anyone since. She's been really negative, bitter, and stalking her ex's social media. The author told her to move on, and now the sister is avoiding them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is living with their sister, which can be stressful, especially when the sister is in a bad emotional state. The sister's behavior\u2014moping, bitterness, stalking ex\u2014might be affecting the author's quality of life. The author's main point is that the breakup is over a year ago, so maybe they feel the sister isn't handling it well anymore.\n\nBut the sister has experienced a miscarriage, which is a significant trauma. The author acknowledges that but still feels the sister is being overly negative. The author's response was to tell her to move on. The sister's reaction is avoidance, which is typical when someone feels criticized, especially in a sensitive area like a breakup and miscarriage.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, the author is in a stressful living situation and might be justified in setting boundaries. On the other hand, telling someone to \"get over\" a past trauma, especially when there's a miscarriage involved, might be dismissive of her feelings. The sister's behavior indicates unresolved grief and anger, which the author might not fully understand. The author's approach could be seen as harsh, even if well-intentioned.\n\nBut the sister's actions over the past year (moping, bitterness, stalking) have likely been causing stress, so the author might feel justified in pushing for her to move on. However, the way it's phrased\u2014\"needed to move the fuck on\"\u2014might come across as insensitive. The key here is whether the author's comment was a reasonable boundary or an overstep.\n\nAlso, the sister's choice to avoid the author suggests that the comment hurt her feelings. It's possible the author didn't consider her emotional state or the depth of her trauma. The author might have a valid frustration but could have approached it with more empathy. The answer might depend on cultural norms around family support and boundaries. In some contexts, pushing a family member to move on could be seen as inconsiderate, especially if the person is struggling with unresolved issues.\n\nSo, weighing these factors, the author might be in the wrong because they didn't approach the situation with enough empathy, even if they were frustrated. The sister's grief and ongoing emotional pain might require more support rather than a direct confrontation. Therefore, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
