It's a situation I can't do anything about because my parents own the house and rent it out to me. There is no formal lease, or rental agreement, so I'm kind of stuck with her. Since she moved in last summer, she just mopes around the house, like a dark cloud. Her fiance broke up with her right at the beginning of last year. She has not dated anyone since and says she's done with dating. She is extremely bitter and negative at all times. She stalks her ex's social media profiles and apparently his new girlfriend is pregnant. My sister is extremely salty about this since she found out... last month. She's been on a tear about it for a month. I know she had a miscarriage and all when they were together, but come on. Finally I told her flat out she needed to move the fuck on and get over it. She has been avoiding me since. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for telling their sister to get over a breakup that happened over a year ago. \n\nFirst, the sister is living with the author because the parents own the house and there's no formal lease. The sister has been moping since a breakup a year back, hasn't dated since, and is bitter. She's been acting out for a month after finding out her ex's new girlfriend is pregnant. The author told her to move on, and now the sister is avoiding them.\n\nI need to consider the dynamics here. The sister's behavior is affecting the household environment. The author is stuck living with her because of the rental arrangement. The sister's actions\u2014moping, being negative, stalking social media\u2014might be creating a tense atmosphere. The author's frustration is understandable given the situation. \n\nHowever, telling someone to \"get over\" a breakup, especially when it's been a year, can be seen as dismissive of their feelings. The sister might still be grieving and the author's blunt approach could have been insensitive. On the other hand, the sister has had a year to process the breakup, and her ongoing bitterness might be affecting others. \n\nThe key points are: the sister hasn't moved on, her behavior is impacting the household, and the author is trying to address it. The question is whether the author's response was appropriate. \n\nIn similar situations, advice often suggests that being patient and offering support is better than pressuring someone to move on. But if someone's behavior is harmful or disruptive, setting boundaries is important. The author might be trying to set boundaries for their own well-being. \n\nSo, the author might not be entirely in the wrong because they're dealing with a difficult living situation. However, the approach taken could have been more empathetic. The sister's mental health and the author's stress are both factors here. \n\nBalancing these aspects, I think the author isn't in the wrong, but could have handled it more compassionately. Therefore, the answer would be B (No).\n"
