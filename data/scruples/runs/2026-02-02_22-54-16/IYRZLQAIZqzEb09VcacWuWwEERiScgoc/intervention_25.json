It's a situation I can't do anything about because my parents own the house and rent it out to me. There is no formal lease, or rental agreement, so I'm kind of stuck with her. Since she moved in last summer, she just mopes around the house, like a dark cloud. Her fiance broke up with her right at the beginning of last year. She has not dated anyone since and says she's done with dating. She is extremely bitter and negative at all times. She stalks her ex's social media profiles and apparently his new girlfriend is pregnant. My sister is extremely salty about this since she found out... last month. She's been on a tear about it for a month. I know she had a miscarriage and all when they were together, but come on. Finally I told her flat out she needed to move the fuck on and get over it. She has been avoiding me since. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The person is asking if they're the a**hole for telling their sister to get over a breakup that happened over a year ago. The sister has been living with them for about a year, and since the breakup, she's been moping around, being negative, stalking her ex, and now she's upset because her ex's new girlfriend is pregnant. The author got frustrated and told them to move on.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The sister's behavior is affecting the author's living situation. She's been in a bad state for a year and a half, which is a long time. The author might be feeling the emotional and social burden of living with someone who's constantly negative and bitter. But on the other hand, the sister is dealing with a significant emotional event\u2014the breakup and a miscarriage. \n\nThe key points here are the timing and the approach. The breakup was over a year ago, and the sister has been in this state since. The author's sister is taking an extended period to recover, which might not be typical, but grief and heartbreak can last a long time. The author's comment was direct and maybe harsh (\"move the fuck on\"), which could be perceived as dismissive of their sister's feelings. Even if the author is frustrated, the way they expressed it might have been unhelpful.\n\nHowever, the sister has a history of not moving on and now is fixated on her ex's new relationship. The author might feel that their sister isn't making an effort to heal, leading to the frustration. But telling someone who's in a vulnerable state to \"get over it\" can be seen as invalidating their emotions. It's possible that the sister needs more support or understanding rather than being told to hurry up and move on. \n\nI should also think about the dynamic between siblings. Siblings often have a close relationship where they might feel they can be honest, but even in that case, the method of communication matters. The author's approach was confrontational, which might not be the best way to handle it. The sister's reaction (avoiding the author) suggests that the message was hurtful, even if the intent was to help.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author overstepped. If the sister is still struggling and the author's comment was unsupportive, then maybe the author is in the wrong. On the flip side, if the sister's behavior is unbearable and the author tried to communicate their concerns in a direct way, it's a tough spot. But from a psychological perspective, telling someone to \"get over\" a significant emotional event can be harmful, regardless of how long it's been. People grieve differently, and a year and a half isn't necessarily a set time to heal. The author's frustration is understandable, but the approach might have been wrong. \n\nAnother angle: the author is living in a house with no formal lease, so they can't get rid of their sister. This might add to their stress, making their reaction more immediate. But that doesn't justify being dismissive. The right approach would be to encourage the sister to seek help or find a supportive way to talk, rather than being blunt and possibly harmful. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would lean towards AITA being the author because the way they communicated their frustration was harsh and might have invalidated their sister's feelings. Even if the sister hasn't moved on, the author could have taken a more compassionate approach.\n"
