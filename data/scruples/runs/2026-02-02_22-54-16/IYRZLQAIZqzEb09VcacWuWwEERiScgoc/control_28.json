It's a situation I can't do anything about because my parents own the house and rent it out to me. There is no formal lease, or rental agreement, so I'm kind of stuck with her. Since she moved in last summer, she just mopes around the house, like a dark cloud. Her fiance broke up with her right at the beginning of last year. She has not dated anyone since and says she's done with dating. She is extremely bitter and negative at all times. She stalks her ex's social media profiles and apparently his new girlfriend is pregnant. My sister is extremely salty about this since she found out... last month. She's been on a tear about it for a month. I know she had a miscarriage and all when they were together, but come on. Finally I told her flat out she needed to move the fuck on and get over it. She has been avoiding me since. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is at fault for telling their sister to move on from a breakup that happened over a year ago. The sister is still living with them, and the author feels stuck because the parents own the house. The sister is described as being negative, bitter, and stuck in the past, which the author is frustrated with. The sister hasn't dated since, is stalking her ex, and is upset about his new girlfriend being pregnant. The author told her to move on, and now the sister is avoiding them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the emotional aspect. The sister has been through a breakup and a miscarriage with her ex. It's been over a year, but she's still struggling. The author is frustrated with her constant negativity and avoidance of moving forward. The sister's behavior is affecting the household environment, which the author is part of. The author might feel that their sister is being unreasonable and needs to take steps to heal, but their approach might be too harsh.\n\nThe key points to consider are: Is the author's advice appropriate? How long is too long to be upset over a breakup? The sister's mental health and the author's intent. The author's comment about moving on is blunt and might come off as dismissive of the sister's feelings. The sister's reaction of avoiding the author suggests that the message was hurtful. Support systems should validate emotions rather than dismiss them, even if the person is being negative. The author's frustration is valid due to the living situation, but the way they expressed it might not be the healthiest approach. \n\nHowever, the sister has been stuck for over a year, which can be concerning. The author might be trying to help her move on, but the method (telling her to \"get over it\" flat out) is not supportive. The sister might need more empathy and encouragement rather than being told to just move on. The author's intention was to help, but the delivery was harsh. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author might not be entirely in the wrong because they're trying to address a family member's prolonged emotional state. However, the approach could have been more compassionate. The sister is dealing with loss and possible grief, so the author's directness might have been unhelpful. The question is whether the author is at fault for expressing frustration rather than providing support. \n\nIn many cases, telling someone to \"get over it\" can be seen as invalidating their feelings, which is why it's often discouraged. So, the author's action might be considered inconsiderate, even if their intention was to help. Therefore, the answer might lean towards the author being at fault (A), but there's nuance. However, given the options, the answer is likely A.\n"
