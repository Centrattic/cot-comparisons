It's a situation I can't do anything about because my parents own the house and rent it out to me. There is no formal lease, or rental agreement, so I'm kind of stuck with her. Since she moved in last summer, she just mopes around the house, like a dark cloud. Her fiance broke up with her right at the beginning of last year. She has not dated anyone since and says she's done with dating. She is extremely bitter and negative at all times. She stalks her ex's social media profiles and apparently his new girlfriend is pregnant. My sister is extremely salty about this since she found out... last month. She's been on a tear about it for a month. I know she had a miscarriage and all when they were together, but come on. Finally I told her flat out she needed to move the fuck on and get over it. She has been avoiding me since. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their sister to get over a breakup from over a year ago. The sister lives with them, and there's no formal lease, so they can't move out. The sister is still upset, bitter, and negative, which is affecting the house. The author finally told her to move on, and now the sister is avoiding them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The breakup was a year ago, which is a significant amount of time. The sister hasn't moved on, is still stalking the ex, and is extremely negative. The author is frustrated and probably wants the sister to stop being so negative, especially since they live together. \n\nBut, on the other hand, telling someone to \"get over\" a breakup might not be the best approach. It's possible that the sister is still grieving and the author's response could have been harsh. However, the sister's behavior is affecting the author's living situation. \n\nThe key here is whether the author's response was appropriate. While it's valid for the sister to be sad, a year is a long time. The author's frustration is understandable. They might have felt that the sister needed to stop dwelling on the past. However, the way the author phrased it (\"get the fuck on\") could have been more compassionate. \n\nBut the sister's behavior is extreme\u2014stalking the ex, being bitter, and avoiding the author. The author might feel that they can't handle the sister's negativity anymore. \n\nSo, considering all factors, the author might not be in the wrong. They were trying to address a situation that's been going on for a long time. However, there's a chance the approach could have been more empathetic. But given the circumstances, the answer might be B, the author isn't in the wrong. They had a right to express their frustration, even if the method could have been better.\n"
