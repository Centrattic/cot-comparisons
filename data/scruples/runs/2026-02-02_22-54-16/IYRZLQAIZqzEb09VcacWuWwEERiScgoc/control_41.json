It's a situation I can't do anything about because my parents own the house and rent it out to me. There is no formal lease, or rental agreement, so I'm kind of stuck with her. Since she moved in last summer, she just mopes around the house, like a dark cloud. Her fiance broke up with her right at the beginning of last year. She has not dated anyone since and says she's done with dating. She is extremely bitter and negative at all times. She stalks her ex's social media profiles and apparently his new girlfriend is pregnant. My sister is extremely salty about this since she found out... last month. She's been on a tear about it for a month. I know she had a miscarriage and all when they were together, but come on. Finally I told her flat out she needed to move the fuck on and get over it. She has been avoiding me since. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about the sister not getting over a breakup from over a year ago, and the author told her to move on. They live together, and the sister is being negative and bitter, which is affecting the author.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The sister's ex broke up with her a year ago, and she hasn't moved on. She's been moping, stalking social media, and is upset about her ex's new relationship. The author is frustrated and told her sister to get over it, leading to tension. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, the sister is struggling with her emotions, which is a personal and sensitive issue. Telling someone to \"get over\" a breakup can come off as dismissive, even if the author is trying to help. People grieve differently, and a year might not be enough time for some. The author's tone here, using \"move the fuck on,\" might have been harsh, even if the intention was to push the sister to heal.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is living with the sister and dealing with her negativity and bitterness, which can create a toxic environment. The sister's behavior is affecting the author's living situation, which is hard because they can't just move out due to the parents owning the house. The author might feel like they're at their breaking point and needed to set some boundaries.\n\nBut the key here is empathy and communication. Even if the author is frustrated, telling someone to get over a breakup that happened a year ago can be seen as insensitive. It might invalidate the sister's feelings. The right approach would be to express concern and offer support rather than demand that she move on. The sister might need help coping, not criticism. So, while the author's intention might be to help, the method was probably wrong. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
