It's a situation I can't do anything about because my parents own the house and rent it out to me. There is no formal lease, or rental agreement, so I'm kind of stuck with her. Since she moved in last summer, she just mopes around the house, like a dark cloud. Her fiance broke up with her right at the beginning of last year. She has not dated anyone since and says she's done with dating. She is extremely bitter and negative at all times. She stalks her ex's social media profiles and apparently his new girlfriend is pregnant. My sister is extremely salty about this since she found out... last month. She's been on a tear about it for a month. I know she had a miscarriage and all when they were together, but come on. Finally I told her flat out she needed to move the fuck on and get over it. She has been avoiding me since. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA question is in the wrong. The situation involves their sister who's been moping since a breakup over a year ago. The sister is bitter, negative, and still upset about her ex's new girlfriend being pregnant. The author told her to move on, and now the sister is avoiding them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The sister has been dealing with this breakup for a year. A year is a significant amount of time, but grief and emotional recovery can vary a lot from person to person. The sister's behavior includes stalking the ex, which is unhealthy, and reacting negatively to his new relationship. The author, living with the sister, is probably feeling frustrated because the sister's negativity affects the household environment.\n\nThe key points are the sister's ongoing emotional state and the author's response. The author's advice to \"get over it\" might come off as dismissive. Even though the breakup was a year ago, the sister's reaction to the ex's new girlfriend (especially with a pregnancy) is a recent trigger. The author might not realize that the sister is still dealing with unresolved feelings or trauma from the miscarriage mentioned.\n\nBut on the other hand, the author is living in the same house, so the sister's constant negativity is affecting their quality of life. The author's frustration is understandable, but the way they expressed it\u2014telling her to \"move the fuck on\"\u2014could be seen as harsh and unsupportive. It's important to validate someone's feelings instead of dismissing them. The sister might need empathy and support rather than being told to get over it. \n\nAlso, the fact that the sister has avoided the author since suggests that the confrontation hurt her feelings. The author might have intended to help, but the approach was lacking in compassion. The sister's behavior isn't healthy, but the author's response could have been more constructive, like encouraging her to seek counseling or finding ways to cope rather than just telling her to move on.\n\nConsidering all this, the author's advice was probably too harsh without offering support, making them at least partially in the wrong. However, there's context about the living situation and the sister's ongoing negative behavior. The answer isn't black and white, but the author's approach was likely unhelpful and contributed to the sister's avoidance.\n"
