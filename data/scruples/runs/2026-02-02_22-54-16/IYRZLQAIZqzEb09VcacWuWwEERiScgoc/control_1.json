It's a situation I can't do anything about because my parents own the house and rent it out to me. There is no formal lease, or rental agreement, so I'm kind of stuck with her. Since she moved in last summer, she just mopes around the house, like a dark cloud. Her fiance broke up with her right at the beginning of last year. She has not dated anyone since and says she's done with dating. She is extremely bitter and negative at all times. She stalks her ex's social media profiles and apparently his new girlfriend is pregnant. My sister is extremely salty about this since she found out... last month. She's been on a tear about it for a month. I know she had a miscarriage and all when they were together, but come on. Finally I told her flat out she needed to move the fuck on and get over it. She has been avoiding me since. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The sister is still moping over a breakup from a year ago, which the author finds unbearable because they live together. The author told her to \"get over it,\" and their sister has been avoiding them since.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The sister's ex broke up with her a year ago, and she's been negative ever since. She's not dating, stalks her ex on social media, and is bitter. The author is stuck living with her because of the housing situation. They might be frustrated with the sister's behavior affecting their home life. \n\nBut on the other hand, telling someone to \"get over\" a breakup might be insensitive. The sister had a miscarriage during the relationship, which could make her emotional state more complex. The author's approach was direct and maybe harsh, given that the sister is still dealing with the aftermath. \n\nThe key points here are the duration of the breakup, the sister's mental health, and the author's response. While the author's frustration is understandable, the way they addressed it might have been unhelpful. The sister might need empathy rather than criticism. So, the author might be in the wrong for not being supportive enough and pushing their sister to move on instead of offering help or understanding.\n"
