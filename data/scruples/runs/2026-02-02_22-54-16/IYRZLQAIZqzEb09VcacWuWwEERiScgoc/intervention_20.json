It's a situation I can't do anything about because my parents own the house and rent it out to me. There is no formal lease, or rental agreement, so I'm kind of stuck with her. Since she moved in last summer, she just mopes around the house, like a dark cloud. Her fiance broke up with her right at the beginning of last year. She has not dated anyone since and says she's done with dating. She is extremely bitter and negative at all times. She stalks her ex's social media profiles and apparently his new girlfriend is pregnant. My sister is extremely salty about this since she found out... last month. She's been on a tear about it for a month. I know she had a miscarriage and all when they were together, but come on. Finally I told her flat out she needed to move the fuck on and get over it. She has been avoiding me since. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for telling their sister to get over a breakup that happened over a year ago.\n\nFirst, the context: the sister lives with the author, and they can't move out because the parents own the house. The sister's ex broke up with her over a year ago, and she's been moping, bitter, and negative ever since. She's stalking her ex and his new partner's pregnancy, which is causing tension. The author finally told her to move on, leading to the sister avoiding them.\n\nSo, the key points here are the duration of the breakup (over a year), the sister's current emotional state, and the author's reaction. The author feels stuck because they can't leave the living situation, which adds to their stress. The sister's behavior is affecting the household environment negatively.\n\nNow, considering empathy and emotional support. Even if a year has passed, grief and heartbreak don't always follow a set timeline. The sister's behavior suggests she's still deeply affected, which might not be resolved just by time. Telling someone to \"get over it\" can come off as dismissive, especially if they're still struggling. It's possible the author is frustrated and wants the situation to improve, but their approach might not be the most supportive. \n\nOn the other hand, the sister's actions (stalking, bitterness) are impacting the author's quality of life. The author might feel they have a right to express their frustration, especially if the sister isn't making efforts to improve her behavior. However, the way it was communicated (\"get over it\") could be seen as harsh, even if well-intentioned.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. In terms of emotional support, telling someone to move on can be seen as invalidating their feelings. But considering the context of cohabitation and the sister's ongoing negative impact, the author's frustration is understandable. The answer might depend on whether the author's approach was constructive or just an outburst. \n\nSo, if the author was trying to encourage their sister to seek help or make positive changes, that's different from just dismissing her feelings. But as presented, the author's response was direct and possibly hurtful. The sister's avoidance indicates that the communication wasn't effective. \n\nIn conclusion, while both parties have valid points, the key issue is how the author expressed their concerns. The author might not be entirely in the wrong for expressing frustration, but their approach could have been more empathetic. The answer might lean towards the author not being in the wrong (B), but with the note that a more supportive approach could have been better. However, the sister's behavior is also a significant factor here.\n"
