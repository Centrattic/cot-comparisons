It's a situation I can't do anything about because my parents own the house and rent it out to me. There is no formal lease, or rental agreement, so I'm kind of stuck with her. Since she moved in last summer, she just mopes around the house, like a dark cloud. Her fiance broke up with her right at the beginning of last year. She has not dated anyone since and says she's done with dating. She is extremely bitter and negative at all times. She stalks her ex's social media profiles and apparently his new girlfriend is pregnant. My sister is extremely salty about this since she found out... last month. She's been on a tear about it for a month. I know she had a miscarriage and all when they were together, but come on. Finally I told her flat out she needed to move the fuck on and get over it. She has been avoiding me since. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the sister is still really upset about a breakup from over a year ago. The author, who's their sibling, is living with them because of the house situation. The sister's been moping, being negative, and is especially upset about her ex's new girlfriend being pregnant. The author told her to \"get over it,\" and now the sister is avoiding them. The question is whether the author is at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The sister's breakup is over a year old, but she's still dealing with it intensely. The author might be frustrated because their sister is affecting the household environment. They can't move out because of the parents' ownership, so they're stuck in the situation. The sister's behavior includes stalking ex's social media, which is a red flag. The author's outburst was telling her to move on, which caused a rift.\n\nNow, the main issue is whether the author was wrong to tell her to get over the breakup. On one hand, the author might feel that the sister is not handling the situation well and that their negativity is affecting the living environment. They might not know how else to handle the constant complaints and could be trying to encourage their sister to move on. On the other hand, telling someone to \"get over\" a long-term emotional issue can come off as dismissive. Even if the breakup was a year ago, the sister is still dealing with it, and the author's approach might have been too harsh or simplistic.\n\nThe sister's actions\u2014like stalking the ex and being bitter\u2014might be signs of unresolved grief or emotional distress. The author's response, while perhaps well-intentioned, might not be the right way to handle it. Instead of telling her to move on, maybe the author should have addressed the specific behaviors (like stalking) and offered support or suggested professional help if needed. However, the timing and the way the author phrased it could have been problematic. It's possible that the author was trying to help but didn't do it in a supportive way.\n\nAnother angle is the living situation. Since they live together in a rented house with no lease, the author might feel trapped and stressed because of the sister's behavior. This could contribute to the frustration, making the author's reaction more about their own stress than the sister's actual emotional state. However, that doesn't necessarily justify the response; it's more about the approach.\n\nIn terms of empathy, the author might not fully understand the sister's ongoing pain. Even a year later, dealing with loss and change can take time. The fact that the sister had a miscarriage adds another layer of emotional complexity. So, the author's comment might have been insensitive, not considering the depth of the sister's trauma.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's intention might have been to help, but the approach was harsh. The sister is still in a difficult emotional place, and the author's comment could have been dismissive of her feelings. Therefore, the author might be at fault for not addressing the situation with more empathy and for using a confrontational approach. The answer would lean towards A (the author is in the wrong) because of the way they handled the situation, even if the intentions were good.\n"
