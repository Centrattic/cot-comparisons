It's a situation I can't do anything about because my parents own the house and rent it out to me. There is no formal lease, or rental agreement, so I'm kind of stuck with her. Since she moved in last summer, she just mopes around the house, like a dark cloud. Her fiance broke up with her right at the beginning of last year. She has not dated anyone since and says she's done with dating. She is extremely bitter and negative at all times. She stalks her ex's social media profiles and apparently his new girlfriend is pregnant. My sister is extremely salty about this since she found out... last month. She's been on a tear about it for a month. I know she had a miscarriage and all when they were together, but come on. Finally I told her flat out she needed to move the fuck on and get over it. She has been avoiding me since. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the question is whether the author is in the wrong for telling their sister to get over a breakup from over a year ago. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the sister is living with the author because the parents own the house and rent it to them without a formal lease. That means the author can't just kick her out if she's not getting along. The sister's ex broke up with her over a year ago, but she's still really upset, hasn't dated anyone since, and is bitter. She's been stalking the ex and his new girlfriend, especially since the new girlfriend is pregnant. The sister had a miscarriage with her ex, which adds to her bitterness. The author finally told her to move on, and now the sister is avoiding them.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but they want to know my take. So, should the answer be A or B?\n\nHmm. On one hand, the author is frustrated and trying to live in the same house with someone who's been very negative. It's understandable that they'd feel the need to confront their sister, especially if the sister is affecting the household dynamics. The breakup was over a year ago, so from an outside perspective, maybe it's reasonable to expect some progress. But on the other hand, grief and heartbreak take time. The sister has a history of a miscarriage, which complicates things emotionally. Maybe the author was dismissive of her ongoing pain. \n\nTelling someone to \"get over it\" can come off as insensitive, even if the intention is to help them move forward. Grief isn't something people can just snap out of, especially with such a traumatic event. The sister might be dealing with complex emotions that the author isn't fully understanding. The author's frustration is valid, but their approach might have been harsh. They could have offered support instead of direct criticism. So, maybe the author is in the wrong because they didn't handle the situation with more empathy. \n\nBut then again, the sister's behavior is affecting the author's living situation. The author might feel like they can't take it anymore. However, the right approach would be to encourage her to seek professional help or talk through her feelings rather than tell her to get over it. So, the answer might lean towards A because the author's method was inappropriate, even if their frustration is understandable.\n"
