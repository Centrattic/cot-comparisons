It's a situation I can't do anything about because my parents own the house and rent it out to me. There is no formal lease, or rental agreement, so I'm kind of stuck with her. Since she moved in last summer, she just mopes around the house, like a dark cloud. Her fiance broke up with her right at the beginning of last year. She has not dated anyone since and says she's done with dating. She is extremely bitter and negative at all times. She stalks her ex's social media profiles and apparently his new girlfriend is pregnant. My sister is extremely salty about this since she found out... last month. She's been on a tear about it for a month. I know she had a miscarriage and all when they were together, but come on. Finally I told her flat out she needed to move the fuck on and get over it. She has been avoiding me since. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their sister to move on from a breakup over a year ago. The sister has been moping, is bitter, and still upset about her ex's new girlfriend being pregnant.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that the sister's ex broke up with her a year ago. The sister hasn't dated since and is stuck in a negative mindset. The author, living in the same house with no formal lease, is probably frustrated with the sister's behavior. They snapped and told her to move on, which caused the sister to avoid them.\n\nNow, considering the sister's behavior: she's been moping for over a year, which is a long time. The author might feel that their own life is affected by her negativity. However, the sister has experienced a miscarriage, which is a traumatic event. The breakup might have been tied to that, adding to her distress. The author's approach was to confront her harshly, which might not be the best way to handle someone in emotional pain.\n\nBut the sister has been avoiding the author since, which is a red flag. Maybe the author was too harsh, but given the prolonged negative behavior, maybe they felt it was necessary to set a boundary. The key here is whether the author's approach was appropriate. Telling someone to \"get over it\" can come off as dismissive, especially if they're still grieving. However, the sister's behavior is affecting the living situation, so the author has valid reasons for being frustrated.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit nuanced. The author might not be in the wrong for expressing frustration, but the method of doing so could be improved. On the other hand, the sister is in the wrong for not moving on, but that's not the question. The question is about the author's actions. Considering all factors, the answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong) because the sister's behavior was causing issues, and the author had to address it somehow. But there's a balance between being supportive and setting boundaries. The author might not be in the wrong, but their approach could use some softening.\n"
