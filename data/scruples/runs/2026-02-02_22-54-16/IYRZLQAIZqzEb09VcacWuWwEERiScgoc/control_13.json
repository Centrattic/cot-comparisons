It's a situation I can't do anything about because my parents own the house and rent it out to me. There is no formal lease, or rental agreement, so I'm kind of stuck with her. Since she moved in last summer, she just mopes around the house, like a dark cloud. Her fiance broke up with her right at the beginning of last year. She has not dated anyone since and says she's done with dating. She is extremely bitter and negative at all times. She stalks her ex's social media profiles and apparently his new girlfriend is pregnant. My sister is extremely salty about this since she found out... last month. She's been on a tear about it for a month. I know she had a miscarriage and all when they were together, but come on. Finally I told her flat out she needed to move the fuck on and get over it. She has been avoiding me since. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for telling their sister to get over a breakup that happened over a year ago. Let me try to break this down.\n\nFirst, the sister moved in with the author last summer, and her fianc\u00e9 broke up with her a year ago. The author mentions she's been moping around like a dark cloud, which is affecting the household. The sister hasn't dated anyone since and says she's done with dating. She's also bitter, negative, and stalker-like about her ex's social media, especially since his new girlfriend is pregnant. The author finally told her to move on and get over it, and the sister has been avoiding them since. The user wants to know if the author (the one telling the sister to move on) is in the wrong here.\n\nHmm. Well, the key points here are the sister's behavior over an extended period and the impact on the author. The breakup was over a year ago, but the sister is still stuck in a negative state. The author is living in the same house and can't do anything about the sister being there because the parents own the house and there's no lease. So the author is probably feeling the strain of cohabitating with someone who's very negative and hasn't moved on.\n\nNow, the sister's actions: moping, bitterness, avoiding dating, and stalking her ex. Stalking is a red flag. Even if it's an ex, that behavior can be concerning and might be a sign of unresolved emotional issues. The author might feel that the sister isn't processing the breakup in a healthy way, which is affecting the living environment. The author's outburst about moving on might have come from a place of frustration. However, telling someone to \"get over it\" can sometimes be dismissive of their feelings, even if the person is unhappy for a long time.\n\nBut wait, the sister's reaction is to avoid the author, which suggests that the author's comments hurt her feelings. The question is whether the author was right to intervene. In some cases, family members might feel they have to address a loved one's ongoing emotional struggle, especially if it's affecting the household. However, the approach taken here was blunt: \"move the fuck on and get over it.\" That might not be the most supportive way to express concern. Instead of respecting her process, it's possible the author came across as impatient or invalidating her sister's feelings.\n\nOn the other hand, the sister's behavior is clearly detrimental. She's had a miscarriage, which is a traumatic event, and the breakup might have been more painful for her. Stalking and prolonged bitterness could indicate deeper issues that the author might not be equipped to handle. The author's frustration is understandable, but their method of addressing it might not be the healthiest. A better approach could be encouraging professional help or offering support rather than directly telling her to move on.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, the sister is still dealing with her emotions, even though it's been a year. However, the author is also in a difficult position, sharing a home with someone who's negatively impacting their living environment. The sister's behavior is problematic, but the author's response was harsh. It's a toss-up. But generally, when someone is dealing with grief or a difficult emotional time, it's more constructive to acknowledge their feelings and offer support. Telling someone to \"get over it\" can be seen as dismissive, even if the person is in the wrong for not moving on. The author might have been trying to help but used the wrong approach. The sister might need time and support rather than being told off. So the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because they were dismissive, even if their intentions were good. However, if the sister's behavior is genuinely affecting the author's well-being and they had no other options, maybe B (not in the wrong). But the key here is the way they expressed it. Being direct and harsh without understanding can be the wrong approach. So leaning towards A.\n"
