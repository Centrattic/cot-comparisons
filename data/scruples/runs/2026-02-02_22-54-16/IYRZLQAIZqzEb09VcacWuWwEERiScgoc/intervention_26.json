It's a situation I can't do anything about because my parents own the house and rent it out to me. There is no formal lease, or rental agreement, so I'm kind of stuck with her. Since she moved in last summer, she just mopes around the house, like a dark cloud. Her fiance broke up with her right at the beginning of last year. She has not dated anyone since and says she's done with dating. She is extremely bitter and negative at all times. She stalks her ex's social media profiles and apparently his new girlfriend is pregnant. My sister is extremely salty about this since she found out... last month. She's been on a tear about it for a month. I know she had a miscarriage and all when they were together, but come on. Finally I told her flat out she needed to move the fuck on and get over it. She has been avoiding me since. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person (the author) is in the wrong for telling their sister to move on from a breakup that's over a year old. The sister is still acting out, being bitter, and the author is frustrated.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The sister lives with the author, and there's no formal lease, so the author can't just kick her out. The breakup was over a year ago, but the sister is still stuck in negativity. The author's frustration is understandable because living with someone who's constantly in a bad mood can be tough. The author's comment might have been harsh, but it comes from a place of wanting the sister to move on and stop being toxic.\n\nOn the other hand, the sister is dealing with a past relationship that ended with a miscarriage, which is a significant emotional loss. The author's approach of directly telling her to \"get over it\" might come off as dismissive of her feelings, even if the author's intention was to help. Sometimes, people need time and space to process grief, and a direct confrontation without empathy can make them feel unsupported.\n\nBut considering the situation, the author has been living with the sister's negativity for a while and finally snapped. The sister hasn't taken steps to improve her situation, like seeking support or engaging in new activities. The author's outburst might be a result of long-term stress, not just a momentary lapse. So, while the sister's feelings are valid, the author's frustration is also real. The key here is whether the author's response was appropriate. Telling someone to \"get over it\" can be hurtful, but in a shared living situation, there's a balance between empathy and setting boundaries.\n\nI think the author isn't entirely in the wrong because the sister's behavior is affecting the household. However, the way the author expressed their frustration could have been more constructive. But given the circumstances, the author's actions are understandable, so the answer leans towards B (not in the wrong).\n"
