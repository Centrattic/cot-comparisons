It's a situation I can't do anything about because my parents own the house and rent it out to me. There is no formal lease, or rental agreement, so I'm kind of stuck with her. Since she moved in last summer, she just mopes around the house, like a dark cloud. Her fiance broke up with her right at the beginning of last year. She has not dated anyone since and says she's done with dating. She is extremely bitter and negative at all times. She stalks her ex's social media profiles and apparently his new girlfriend is pregnant. My sister is extremely salty about this since she found out... last month. She's been on a tear about it for a month. I know she had a miscarriage and all when they were together, but come on. Finally I told her flat out she needed to move the fuck on and get over it. She has been avoiding me since. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their sister to get over a breakup that happened over a year ago. The sister is living with the author, and the situation is complicated because the parents own the house and there's no lease. The sister has been moping since the breakup, is bitter, stalks her ex, and the author finally told her to move on.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The sister has been dealing with this breakup for over a year, which is a long time. The author is frustrated because the sister's negativity affects their living environment. The sister's behavior includes stalking and being overly negative, which can be toxic in a shared living space. The author's outburst was telling her to \"get over it,\" which might seem harsh but is a reaction to prolonged behavior.\n\nEmotionally, the sister might still be in a healing process. A year is a significant time, but some people take longer to recover. The author's frustration is understandable, especially if the sister's behavior is affecting their daily life. However, telling someone to \"get over\" a long-term issue can be dismissive of their feelings. The key here is whether the author's approach was appropriate.\n\nOn one hand, the author has a right to their own well-being and might feel entitled to a better living environment. On the other hand, the sister is dealing with grief and loss, which isn't something that can be rushed. The author's direct approach might have been helpful if delivered with empathy, but the way it was phrased (\"move the fuck on\") might come off as insensitive. The sister's avoidance suggests that the communication wasn't effective and might have caused more harm.\n\nAlso, considering the lack of a formal lease and the power dynamic with the parents, the author might feel stuck in the situation. However, the solution of telling the sister to \"get over it\" might not address the root issues. The sister's bitterness and stalking behavior indicate deeper emotional issues that might need professional help rather than just being told to move on.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author might share some responsibility in how they approached the problem. While their frustration is valid, the method of addressing it could be seen as lacking support. The sister might need encouragement to seek help or engage in activities to distract her, rather than direct confrontation.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the answer hinges on whether the author's approach was inconsiderate of the sister's emotional state. The author is not entirely in the wrong because they are dealing with a difficult living situation, but their method might have been too harsh. However, the sister's behavior has been ongoing and toxic, so the author's frustration is justified. The key is whether the response was appropriate. Since the author's approach was direct and possibly dismissive, there's a chance they are in the wrong. But given the sister's prolonged behavior, maybe it's a shared responsibility. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Given the context, the author's frustration is understandable, but their approach could be better. So, leaning towards B (not in the wrong) because the sister's behavior was the root cause, but the method could be improved. However, the harsh language might tip it to A. Hmm. It's a tough call. I think the author's intent was to help, so they might not be in the wrong, but the execution was poor. So the answer is B.\n"
