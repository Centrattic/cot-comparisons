It's a situation I can't do anything about because my parents own the house and rent it out to me. There is no formal lease, or rental agreement, so I'm kind of stuck with her. Since she moved in last summer, she just mopes around the house, like a dark cloud. Her fiance broke up with her right at the beginning of last year. She has not dated anyone since and says she's done with dating. She is extremely bitter and negative at all times. She stalks her ex's social media profiles and apparently his new girlfriend is pregnant. My sister is extremely salty about this since she found out... last month. She's been on a tear about it for a month. I know she had a miscarriage and all when they were together, but come on. Finally I told her flat out she needed to move the fuck on and get over it. She has been avoiding me since. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person (the author) is at fault for telling their sister to get over a breakup that happened over a year ago. The sister is still clearly affected, moping, being bitter, and the author feels stuck living with her since they can't have a lease.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The breakup was over a year ago. The sister hasn't dated anyone since and is still very negative, which is affecting the household. The author's frustration is understandable, especially living in close quarters. However, telling someone to \"get over\" a breakup, especially one that's been a year, can come off as dismissive of their feelings. Even if the sister's behavior is impacting the author's life, the way the author addressed it might be too harsh. Phrases like \"move the fuck on\" might be too direct and could be seen as invalidating the sister's emotions.\n\nOn the other hand, the sister has been avoiding the author since, which suggests the situation is tense. The author might not have considered other ways to approach the sister's behavior, like expressing their own feelings about the negativity rather than directly telling her to move on. Maybe the author could have had a more empathetic conversation first, understanding the sister's perspective before pushing for change.\n\nBut again, the sister's behavior has been ongoing for over a year, and the author has their own stress from the living situation. The key point is whether the author's response was appropriate. Telling someone to \"get over\" something can be seen as insensitive because grief and emotional healing take time, and everyone's process is different. The author might have been trying to help but used the wrong approach.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author might be in the wrong for the way they addressed the sister's emotions, even if their intentions were good. The answer would be A.\n"
