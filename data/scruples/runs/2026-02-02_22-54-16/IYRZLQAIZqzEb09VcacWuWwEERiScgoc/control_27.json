It's a situation I can't do anything about because my parents own the house and rent it out to me. There is no formal lease, or rental agreement, so I'm kind of stuck with her. Since she moved in last summer, she just mopes around the house, like a dark cloud. Her fiance broke up with her right at the beginning of last year. She has not dated anyone since and says she's done with dating. She is extremely bitter and negative at all times. She stalks her ex's social media profiles and apparently his new girlfriend is pregnant. My sister is extremely salty about this since she found out... last month. She's been on a tear about it for a month. I know she had a miscarriage and all when they were together, but come on. Finally I told her flat out she needed to move the fuck on and get over it. She has been avoiding me since. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their sister to get over a breakup that happened over a year ago. The sister lives with the author, and there's no lease, so the author can't just kick her out. The sister's been moping around since the breakup, not dating anyone, bitter, and recently found out her ex has a new girlfriend who's pregnant. The author told her to move on, and now the sister is avoiding them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The sister's been dealing with this breakup for a year and is still emotionally affected. The user's advice was direct and maybe harsh (\"move the fuck on\"), which could have come off as dismissive. Emotional healing varies; what's a year for some might not be enough for others. The sister's behavior\u2014stalking, bitterness, negativity\u2014suggests she's struggling, and the author might be frustrated. But is it their place to tell her to \"get over it\"? \n\nFamily dynamics play a role here. Siblings can have different coping mechanisms. The author might be trying to help, but the approach could be too harsh. The sister's avoidance indicates the comment hurt her. Even if the author's intention was to help, the method might be flawed. Also, the sister had a miscarriage during their relationship, which the author mentions. That adds a layer of trauma. The author might not be in the wrong for expressing frustration, but the way they did it could be seen as insensitive. \n\nOn the other hand, the sister hasn't moved on and is affecting the household environment. The author might feel that the sister isn't taking care of her emotional well-being, leading to the direct comment. However, telling someone to \"get over\" a breakup quickly can be harmful, as it's a personal journey. The author's words might be seen as minimizing the sister's pain, which is a common issue in such conflicts. \n\nI should also think about the shared living situation. Without a lease, the author has to manage the sister's behavior, but that doesn't mean they can be unkind. The sister's behavior is impacting the author's living environment, so there's a tension between personal space and family support. \n\nConsidering these factors, the author's intentions might be good, but the approach was likely too harsh. The sister is still processing her grief, and the author's comment could have been perceived as invalidating her feelings. So the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong, but it's a bit nuanced. However, the key point is the sister's ongoing emotional state, which the author is urging her to move past. In many cases, people are told to \"move on\" before they're ready, which can be hurtful. Therefore, the answer is probably A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
