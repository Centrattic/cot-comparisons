It's a situation I can't do anything about because my parents own the house and rent it out to me. There is no formal lease, or rental agreement, so I'm kind of stuck with her. Since she moved in last summer, she just mopes around the house, like a dark cloud. Her fiance broke up with her right at the beginning of last year. She has not dated anyone since and says she's done with dating. She is extremely bitter and negative at all times. She stalks her ex's social media profiles and apparently his new girlfriend is pregnant. My sister is extremely salty about this since she found out... last month. She's been on a tear about it for a month. I know she had a miscarriage and all when they were together, but come on. Finally I told her flat out she needed to move the fuck on and get over it. She has been avoiding me since. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for telling their sister to get over a breakup from over a year ago. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The sister lives with the author, and there's no formal lease, so the author can't move out. The sister has been moping since the breakup, is bitter, stalks her ex and his new girlfriend, and is negative. The author finally told her to move on.\n\nThe key points here are the sister's behavior and how it's affecting the household. The author might feel that the sister's negativity is impacting their own life, especially living under the same roof. The sister's actions, like stalking and being bitter for over a year, might be causing tension. The author's frustration could be justified if they feel they can't escape this negativity. \n\nHowever, telling someone to \"get over it\" might not be the best approach. It could come off as dismissive of her emotions. Grieving and processing a breakup, especially after a miscarriage, can take time. The sister's behavior might indicate she's struggling with unresolved feelings or mental health issues. The author's approach might be seen as insensitive, even if they're frustrated. \n\nBut considering the living situation and the sister's ongoing negative behavior, the author might feel they have no choice but to confront her. The sister's actions are affecting the household dynamics. The author might not be in the wrong for trying to set boundaries, especially if they're stuck living together without the option to leave.\n\nOn the other hand, the author could have handled it more compassionately. Maybe suggesting professional help or offering support would have been better. But given the circumstances, the author's frustration is understandable. The answer hinges on whether the author's approach was appropriate given the sister's behavior and the living situation.\n"
