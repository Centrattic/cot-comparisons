It's a situation I can't do anything about because my parents own the house and rent it out to me. There is no formal lease, or rental agreement, so I'm kind of stuck with her. Since she moved in last summer, she just mopes around the house, like a dark cloud. Her fiance broke up with her right at the beginning of last year. She has not dated anyone since and says she's done with dating. She is extremely bitter and negative at all times. She stalks her ex's social media profiles and apparently his new girlfriend is pregnant. My sister is extremely salty about this since she found out... last month. She's been on a tear about it for a month. I know she had a miscarriage and all when they were together, but come on. Finally I told her flat out she needed to move the fuck on and get over it. She has been avoiding me since. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nThe author's sister has been living with them for about a year after a breakup over a year ago. The sister is described as moping, bitter, and negative, especially since her ex started a new relationship and his girlfriend is pregnant. The sister had a miscarriage when they were together, which adds to her bitterness. The author finally told her to \"get over it\" and now the sister is avoiding them.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. I need to decide if that's accurate. Let me consider the dynamics here. The sister has been dealing with this breakup for over a year, but her behavior has been affecting the household. The author is living in a situation where they can't remove their sister, leading to possible tension and stress. The author's frustration is understandable, but how did they handle it?\n\nTelling someone to \"get over\" something, especially a breakup that's still fresh, can come off as dismissive. The sister's behavior might stem from unresolved grief or trauma, especially with the miscarriage. The author's approach might have been too harsh, especially if the sister wasn't given enough support. However, the sister's actions\u2014like constant negativity and social media stalking\u2014might have pushed the author to a breaking point.\n\nBut even so, the way the author expressed their frustration could have been more empathetic. Instead of demanding she move on, perhaps a more supportive approach would have been better. The sister's emotional state might need understanding rather than direct confrontation. So, while the author's frustration is valid, the method of addressing it might be the issue here.\n\nI think the answer is A (author is in the wrong) because the approach taken was confrontational and dismissive, which might have been unhelpful. However, there's nuance. The sister's behavior is problematic, but the author's response could have been more compassionate. It's a balance between empathy and setting boundaries. Since the author is in a shared living situation, they need to manage the household dynamics, but the way they communicated their frustration might have been the problem.\n"
