It's a situation I can't do anything about because my parents own the house and rent it out to me. There is no formal lease, or rental agreement, so I'm kind of stuck with her. Since she moved in last summer, she just mopes around the house, like a dark cloud. Her fiance broke up with her right at the beginning of last year. She has not dated anyone since and says she's done with dating. She is extremely bitter and negative at all times. She stalks her ex's social media profiles and apparently his new girlfriend is pregnant. My sister is extremely salty about this since she found out... last month. She's been on a tear about it for a month. I know she had a miscarriage and all when they were together, but come on. Finally I told her flat out she needed to move the fuck on and get over it. She has been avoiding me since. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for telling their sister to get over a breakup that happened over a year ago. Let's start by breaking down the situation.\n\nFirst, the sister moved in with the author last summer, and the author can't move out because the parents own the house and there's no formal lease. That probably adds some stress to the situation because the author is stuck living with their sister, which might affect their patience.\n\nThe sister's ex broke up with her a year ago. She hasn't dated anyone since and is now bitter and negative. She's also been stalking her ex's social media and is upset because his new girlfriend is pregnant. The author finally snaps and tells their sister to move on, and the sister is now avoiding them.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks the author isn't, but wants my opinion. Let me consider both sides.\n\nOn one hand, the sister's behavior is affecting the living environment. The author is trying to maintain their own well-being by telling their sister to stop being so negative. The sister's actions (stalking, bitterness) could be making the home environment toxic. The author might feel they have to set boundaries to protect their own mental health.\n\nOn the other hand, telling someone to \"get over\" a breakup, especially when it's been a year but the person is still struggling, might come off as dismissive. The sister might still be grieving the loss and the miscarriage, which are significant events. The author's approach could be seen as not empathetic enough. Even though it's been a year, healing isn't linear, and the sister might be going through a rough patch right now.\n\nAlso, the author's method of communication\u2014telling her flat out to \"move the fuck on\"\u2014might be harsh. A more compassionate approach could be more effective. But given the sister's ongoing negative behavior, maybe the author felt they had no choice.\n\nBut does that make the author in the wrong? Possibly. Sometimes, even if someone's behavior is annoying, the way to address it matters. The author might have a valid point about needing the sister to move on, but the way they expressed it might have been too abrupt or lacked the necessary support.\n\nHowever, considering the sister's actions (stalking, bitterness), the author's frustration is understandable. The sister's behavior is affecting the entire household, so the author might not be entirely wrong for trying to address it.\n\nI need to weigh the sister's emotional state against the author's need for a respectful living environment. The key points are: the sister's behavior is ongoing and harmful, the author can't just move out, and the sister's refusal to date and her bitterness are causing issues. The author's response was direct but maybe not the best method.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit nuanced. The author might not be in the wrong because the sister's behavior is problematic, but the approach could have been better. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong, not whether they could have handled it better. Since the sister is still dealing with grief and the author's response was harsh, maybe the author is in the wrong. But if the sister's behavior is unacceptable, maybe the author isn't. It's tricky.\n\nI think the answer might depend on the intent and empathy shown. The author might have intended to help but used the wrong tone. Alternatively, the sister's actions are so negative that the author had to set a boundary. I'm leaning towards the author not being in the wrong because they were trying to address a toxic situation, even if the method wasn't perfect. But maybe they should have approached it with more empathy. Hmm.\n"
