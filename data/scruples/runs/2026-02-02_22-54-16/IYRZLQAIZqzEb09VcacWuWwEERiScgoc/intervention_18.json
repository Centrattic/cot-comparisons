It's a situation I can't do anything about because my parents own the house and rent it out to me. There is no formal lease, or rental agreement, so I'm kind of stuck with her. Since she moved in last summer, she just mopes around the house, like a dark cloud. Her fiance broke up with her right at the beginning of last year. She has not dated anyone since and says she's done with dating. She is extremely bitter and negative at all times. She stalks her ex's social media profiles and apparently his new girlfriend is pregnant. My sister is extremely salty about this since she found out... last month. She's been on a tear about it for a month. I know she had a miscarriage and all when they were together, but come on. Finally I told her flat out she needed to move the fuck on and get over it. She has been avoiding me since. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking if the author (the person who told their sister to get over a year-old breakup) is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context provided. The sister has been living with the author for over a year since the breakup. She's been moping, negative, and bitter. The author feels stuck because the parents own the house and there's no formal lease. The sister's behavior is affecting the author's life, and the author finally told her to move on. Now the sister is avoiding the author.\n\nThe user thinks the author is not in the wrong. But I need to evaluate this objectively. Let's look at factors like intent, communication, and potential consequences.\n\nThe author's intention might have been to help their sister move past the breakup. However, the approach was direct and possibly harsh (\"move the fuck on\"). While the sister's behavior is problematic, the author's tone could be seen as dismissive of her sister's feelings. Even if the sister hasn't moved on, the author might not have considered the emotional impact of their words.\n\nAlso, the sister's situation includes a miscarriage, which adds a layer of sensitivity. The author's comment might come across as insensitive, especially given the sister's history. The sister's reaction (avoiding the author) suggests that the advice was not well-received and might have caused more harm than good.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, it's a shared situation. The sister's behavior is affecting the household, but the author might have handled it differently. Perhaps offering support instead of a blunt confrontation could have been more effective. The key here is whether the author's approach was the right way to handle their sister's emotional state, rather than just whether they were \"wrong.\"\n\nConsidering all that, while the sister's behavior is problematic, the author's approach might not be the most empathetic. So maybe the answer leans towards the author being in the wrong, but I need to check if there's a point where the sister's actions justified the author's response. However, even in that case, the way the author expressed it could be unhelpful. So the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because their communication was harsh and possibly dismissive, even if the intention was to help.\n"
