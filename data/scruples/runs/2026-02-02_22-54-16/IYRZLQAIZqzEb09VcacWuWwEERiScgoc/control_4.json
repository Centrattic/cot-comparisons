It's a situation I can't do anything about because my parents own the house and rent it out to me. There is no formal lease, or rental agreement, so I'm kind of stuck with her. Since she moved in last summer, she just mopes around the house, like a dark cloud. Her fiance broke up with her right at the beginning of last year. She has not dated anyone since and says she's done with dating. She is extremely bitter and negative at all times. She stalks her ex's social media profiles and apparently his new girlfriend is pregnant. My sister is extremely salty about this since she found out... last month. She's been on a tear about it for a month. I know she had a miscarriage and all when they were together, but come on. Finally I told her flat out she needed to move the fuck on and get over it. She has been avoiding me since. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this AITA question. The user is asking if they're the asshole for telling their sister to get over a breakup that happened over a year ago. The sister lives with the user because the parents own the house, and there's no lease, so the user can't do much about their living arrangement. The sister's been moping since the breakup, hasn't dated anyone since, and is bitter. She's been especially upset since finding out her ex has a new pregnant girlfriend a month ago. The user finally told her to move on, and now the sister is avoiding them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The sister's been dealing with the breakup for over a year, which is a long time. The user might feel frustrated because they're living together and the sister's behavior is affecting the household. However, the sister also had a miscarriage when they were together, which could be a significant emotional factor. The user's approach was direct and maybe harsh (\"move the fuck on\"), which could have come off as insensitive. \n\nOn one hand, the user is trying to address the situation by encouraging their sister to move on. It's common for people to feel that someone should get over a breakup after a certain time, but everyone processes emotions differently. The sister might still be grieving, especially with the recent news about the ex's new relationship and pregnancy. The user's comment might be seen as dismissive of her ongoing pain.\n\nOn the other hand, the user is in a shared living space and might be struggling with their sister's constant negativity. They might not have other options since they can't evict her, so they're lashing out as a way to cope. However, even if that's the case, the way they addressed it could be problematic. Telling someone to \"get over it\" can minimize their feelings and make them feel unsupported.\n\nI should also think about the sister's behavior: stalking the ex, being bitter, and not dating. These actions might indicate unresolved issues or emotional distress. The user's intervention might be well-intentioned but poorly executed. Instead of being harsh, maybe a more empathetic approach would be better. \n\nSo, considering all this, the user's approach could be seen as inconsiderate. They might be in the wrong for not handling the situation with more sensitivity. The sister's avoidance might be a reaction to feeling judged or dismissed. Therefore, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
