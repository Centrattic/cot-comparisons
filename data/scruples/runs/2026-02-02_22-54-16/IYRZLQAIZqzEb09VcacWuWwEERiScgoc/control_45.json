It's a situation I can't do anything about because my parents own the house and rent it out to me. There is no formal lease, or rental agreement, so I'm kind of stuck with her. Since she moved in last summer, she just mopes around the house, like a dark cloud. Her fiance broke up with her right at the beginning of last year. She has not dated anyone since and says she's done with dating. She is extremely bitter and negative at all times. She stalks her ex's social media profiles and apparently his new girlfriend is pregnant. My sister is extremely salty about this since she found out... last month. She's been on a tear about it for a month. I know she had a miscarriage and all when they were together, but come on. Finally I told her flat out she needed to move the fuck on and get over it. She has been avoiding me since. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves the person telling their sister, who lives with them, to get over a breakup that happened over a year ago. The sister is still upset, moping, and being bitter, and the author decided to tell her to move on.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The sister has been through a breakup over a year ago, which is a significant period. The author's sister is still affected, showing symptoms of ongoing emotional distress\u2014moping, bitterness, stalking the ex's social media, and reacting negatively to his new relationship. The author, living in the same house without a formal lease, feels stuck and frustrated, leading them to confront their sister directly about moving on.\n\nThe key points here are the duration of the breakup, the sister's ongoing emotional state, and the author's approach. The sister's behavior has been affecting the household environment, making it a shared living issue. The author's frustration stems from the sister's inability to move forward, which impacts their own living situation.\n\nNow, evaluating the author's actions. Telling someone to \"get over it\" can often come off as dismissive, especially if the person is still grieving. But in this case, the author might feel that the sister is not progressing emotionally, which affects them. However, the sister has a valid reason for her distress\u2014past trauma like a miscarriage adds layers to her emotional state. The author's approach was direct and perhaps harsh, but the situation involves a shared living space where the sister's behavior affects the author's daily life.\n\nI should also consider if the author gave the sister support or tried other methods before confronting her. The article mentions the sister has been moping since last summer, so maybe the author didn't offer support, leading to this outburst. However, the sister's actions suggest she might not be seeking help, making the author's frustration understandable.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's a balance between empathy and practicality. The author might not be in the wrong because they're dealing with the consequences of their sister's long-term emotional state in a shared space. However, the way they communicated their frustration could be seen as insensitive. But given the context of a year-long situation without resolution, the author's actions might be justified as a last resort.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because they're trying to address a long-standing issue affecting their living environment, even if their approach was harsh.\n"
