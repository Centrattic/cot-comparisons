It's a situation I can't do anything about because my parents own the house and rent it out to me. There is no formal lease, or rental agreement, so I'm kind of stuck with her. Since she moved in last summer, she just mopes around the house, like a dark cloud. Her fiance broke up with her right at the beginning of last year. She has not dated anyone since and says she's done with dating. She is extremely bitter and negative at all times. She stalks her ex's social media profiles and apparently his new girlfriend is pregnant. My sister is extremely salty about this since she found out... last month. She's been on a tear about it for a month. I know she had a miscarriage and all when they were together, but come on. Finally I told her flat out she needed to move the fuck on and get over it. She has been avoiding me since. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who told their sister to get over a breakup from over a year ago is in the wrong. The sister is still clearly affected, with bitterness and negativity, and the person felt stuck because they can't move out. The sister's ex is with someone new and pregnant, which is making her even more upset. The user confronts her, telling her to move on, and now the sister is avoiding them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the emotional state of the sister. A breakup over a year ago is significant, and if she's still moping around, it's possible she's struggling with unresolved feelings. The user's sister also had a miscarriage, which could add to her emotional distress. The user's frustration is understandable, living in the same house and dealing with her negativity daily. But is telling her to \"move on\" the right approach?\n\nEmpathy is key here. The user might be feeling overwhelmed and want the sister to stop being negative. However, pushing someone to \"get over\" a breakup can come across as dismissive. Grief and heartbreak take time, and everyone processes it differently. The sister might not be ready, and the user's direct approach might have been too harsh. The user might not have considered the sister's emotional needs, thinking more about their own tolerance for the situation.\n\nAlso, the living arrangement complicates things. The user can't just move out, so there's a conflict between their living environment and the sister's emotional state. The sister's behavior is affecting the household dynamics. However, the user's solution was to confront her abruptly, which could have been more constructive. Maybe suggesting support, encouraging professional help, or setting boundaries could have been better approaches. \n\nOn the other hand, the sister's actions\u2014stalking ex and being bitter for a month after the new girlfriend's pregnancy\u2014are concerning. The user's frustration is valid, but the way they handled it might have been too abrupt. The sister's avoidance now might indicate she felt attacked. \n\nSo, while the user has valid reasons for their frustration, the way they addressed the issue could be seen as insensitive. The answer might lean towards the user being at fault for not handling it with more empathy and understanding. However, it's a tough situation with valid points on both sides. The key is whether the user's approach was supportive or dismissive. Since they told her to \"get over it\" without addressing her feelings, they might be in the wrong.\n"
