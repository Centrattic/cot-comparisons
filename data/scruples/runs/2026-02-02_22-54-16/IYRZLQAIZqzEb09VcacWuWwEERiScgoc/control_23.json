It's a situation I can't do anything about because my parents own the house and rent it out to me. There is no formal lease, or rental agreement, so I'm kind of stuck with her. Since she moved in last summer, she just mopes around the house, like a dark cloud. Her fiance broke up with her right at the beginning of last year. She has not dated anyone since and says she's done with dating. She is extremely bitter and negative at all times. She stalks her ex's social media profiles and apparently his new girlfriend is pregnant. My sister is extremely salty about this since she found out... last month. She's been on a tear about it for a month. I know she had a miscarriage and all when they were together, but come on. Finally I told her flat out she needed to move the fuck on and get over it. She has been avoiding me since. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their sister to get over a breakup from over a year ago. The sister lives with them, and the situation is complicated because the parents own the house and there's no lease, so the author feels stuck. \n\nFirst, the sister's behavior: she's been moping, negative, stalking ex's social media, and reacting strongly to his new girlfriend's pregnancy. The author finally tells her to move on. The key points here are the timing of the breakup (over a year) and the sister's ongoing negative behavior.\n\nThe author's perspective is that their sister hasn't moved on, which is affecting their living environment. They might feel frustrated because the sister's behavior is impacting their own well-being. The sister, on the other hand, is dealing with a breakup and a miscarriage, which are significant emotional issues. \n\nNow, considering if the author is in the wrong. Being in the wrong would mean that their response was inappropriate or dismissive of the sister's feelings. Telling someone to \"get over\" a breakup, especially after a miscarriage, could be seen as invalidating her emotions. However, the sister has had over a year and is still stuck in bitterness, which might make the author's frustration understandable. \n\nThe sister's actions (stalking, negativity) are affecting the household, so the author might have a valid reason to push for her to move on. But the approach of telling her to \"get over it\" could be seen as harsh. The line between concern and overstepping can be thin here. \n\nIn some cases, people might argue that the author has a right to their own space and mental health, so pushing for the sister to change her behavior isn't entirely wrong. However, the way it was communicated might be the issue. Instead of telling her to \"get over it,\" offering support or suggesting professional help could be more constructive. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a grey area. They had a valid reason to be frustrated, but their response might have been too direct and dismissive. The sister's mental health and the author's living situation both play roles. The answer likely leans towards the author not being in the wrong because they're trying to protect their own well-being, but there's room to argue both sides. The key is the intention versus the method. The method (telling her to move on) might be the problem, not the intent. So maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong) because the situation is complex, but the approach could have been better. However, if the sister's emotional state is severe, the author might need to be more supportive. Hmm, tricky.\n"
