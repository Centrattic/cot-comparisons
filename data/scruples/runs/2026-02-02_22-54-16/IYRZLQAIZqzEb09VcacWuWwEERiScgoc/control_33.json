It's a situation I can't do anything about because my parents own the house and rent it out to me. There is no formal lease, or rental agreement, so I'm kind of stuck with her. Since she moved in last summer, she just mopes around the house, like a dark cloud. Her fiance broke up with her right at the beginning of last year. She has not dated anyone since and says she's done with dating. She is extremely bitter and negative at all times. She stalks her ex's social media profiles and apparently his new girlfriend is pregnant. My sister is extremely salty about this since she found out... last month. She's been on a tear about it for a month. I know she had a miscarriage and all when they were together, but come on. Finally I told her flat out she needed to move the fuck on and get over it. She has been avoiding me since. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about the author telling their sister to get over a breakup that happened over a year ago. The sister is still very affected, moping around, being bitter, and the author is frustrated and told her to move on. The sister is now avoiding the author.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The sister's behavior has been ongoing for over a year, which is a long time. The author is living with her, which can create a tense environment. The sister's negative behavior is affecting the author's living situation, making it hard to cope. The author's frustration is understandable, given the prolonged stress.\n\nBut the key point is whether the author is at fault. The sister's emotional state is real; she's dealing with a breakup and the pain of a miscarriage. The author's response was to tell her to \"get over it,\" which might come off as dismissive. Empathy is important here. Even if the author is frustrated, the sister's feelings are valid. The author might not have handled it in the best way, maybe not considering the sister's emotional needs.\n\nHowever, the sister's behavior has been a year-long issue without showing signs of improvement. The author is in a difficult position, sharing a home with someone who's not moving on. The author's outburst could be a reaction to accumulated stress. But instead of just telling her to move on, maybe the author should have approached it with more support and understanding.\n\nIn relationships, especially with family, empathy and communication are key. The author might have intended to help, but the approach was harsh. The sister might feel invalidated, leading her to avoid the author. The question is whether the author's frustration justifies their response. While the sister's behavior is problematic, the author's method of addressing it could be seen as lacking compassion. Therefore, the author might be at fault for not approaching the situation with more empathy and support.\n"
