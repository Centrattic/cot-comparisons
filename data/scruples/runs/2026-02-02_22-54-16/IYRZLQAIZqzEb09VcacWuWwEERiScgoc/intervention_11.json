It's a situation I can't do anything about because my parents own the house and rent it out to me. There is no formal lease, or rental agreement, so I'm kind of stuck with her. Since she moved in last summer, she just mopes around the house, like a dark cloud. Her fiance broke up with her right at the beginning of last year. She has not dated anyone since and says she's done with dating. She is extremely bitter and negative at all times. She stalks her ex's social media profiles and apparently his new girlfriend is pregnant. My sister is extremely salty about this since she found out... last month. She's been on a tear about it for a month. I know she had a miscarriage and all when they were together, but come on. Finally I told her flat out she needed to move the fuck on and get over it. She has been avoiding me since. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation is that the author told their sister to get over a breakup from over a year ago. The sister is still really upset, moping around, and the author is frustrated.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The sister has been living with the author for about a year, and there's no lease, so the author can't easily kick her out. The sister is stuck in a negative state, which is affecting the whole household. The author is probably dealing with a lot of stress from living with someone who's so negative and not moving on. \n\nBut the key point is whether the author is in the wrong. The sister's breakup was over a year ago, so some might say it's reasonable to expect her to have moved on. However, healing from a breakup, especially one involving a miscarriage, takes time. The sister is also dealing with her ex's new relationship and a pregnancy, which could be triggering. \n\nThe author's outburst\u2014telling her to \"move the fuck on\"\u2014might come off as harsh or dismissive of her feelings. Even if the author's intention was to help, the way they expressed it could have been unhelpful. The sister's reaction of avoiding the author suggests that the comment hurt her. \n\nHowever, the author is also in a difficult position, living with someone who's impacting their living environment. They might feel they have no control over the situation. The question is whether it's the author's fault for expressing their frustration. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often looks at intent and impact. The author's intent might have been to push the sister to heal, but the impact was negative. So maybe the author is partly in the wrong. But some might argue that the sister should have moved on by now, so the author's frustration is understandable. \n\nI think the answer depends on balancing empathy for the sister's ongoing pain with the author's need for a positive living environment. But since the author's comment was direct and maybe unkind, it's possible they are in the wrong. However, the sister's behavior is also problematic. The answer might lean towards the author not being in the wrong because they were trying to address a long-standing issue, but the way they handled it was poor. Alternatively, the author could be in the wrong for not being more supportive. \n\nHmm. I'm a bit torn. But I think the key is that the author's approach was harsh, even if their intention was good. So maybe they are in the wrong (A). But if the sister's behavior is unreasonable, then the author might not be. The fact that the sister is still moping a year later is a red flag, but the author's directness could have been unhelpful. I'm not sure. Maybe the answer is B, not in the wrong, because the sister's behavior is the main issue, and the author couldn't take it anymore. But I'm not certain.\n"
