It's a situation I can't do anything about because my parents own the house and rent it out to me. There is no formal lease, or rental agreement, so I'm kind of stuck with her. Since she moved in last summer, she just mopes around the house, like a dark cloud. Her fiance broke up with her right at the beginning of last year. She has not dated anyone since and says she's done with dating. She is extremely bitter and negative at all times. She stalks her ex's social media profiles and apparently his new girlfriend is pregnant. My sister is extremely salty about this since she found out... last month. She's been on a tear about it for a month. I know she had a miscarriage and all when they were together, but come on. Finally I told her flat out she needed to move the fuck on and get over it. She has been avoiding me since. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong.\n\nThe situation is about the sister who's been moping around since her breakup over a year ago. The author, who lives with her, is frustrated because she's bitter, negative, and still focused on her ex and his new girlfriend. The sister had a miscarriage when they were together, which adds another layer. The author told her to \"get over it\" and now the sister is avoiding them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The sister is living with the author, so their living situation is intertwined. The author isn't a parent but is sharing a home, which can create tension. The sister's behavior is affecting the author's living environment\u2014she's a \"dark cloud,\" stalking her ex, being bitter. The author is frustrated and finally snaps, telling her to move on. \n\nThe key points are the length of time since the breakup (over a year), the sister's ongoing negativity, and the author's direct confrontation. The author's message is blunt, but is it justified? On one hand, the sister's behavior is disruptive and she's been moping for a long time. On the other hand, telling someone to \"get over it\" can be hurtful and dismissive of their feelings, especially if they're dealing with loss and grief.\n\nThe sister's miscarriage might mean she's dealing with more than just a breakup. The author may not be considering the emotional complexity. However, the sister's refusal to date and her continued negativity could indicate she's stuck in grief and resentment, which affects their shared living space.\n\nThe question is whether the author's response was inconsiderate or necessary. The author's frustration is valid because the sister's behavior is impacting their life. But the way they addressed it might be seen as harsh. The sister might need support rather than a demand to move on. However, given the context of the living situation and the duration of the sister's behavior, the author might feel they have the right to set boundaries. \n\nIn AITA cases, the community often looks at intent and impact. The author's intent was to encourage the sister to move forward, but the impact was likely hurtful. However, the sister's behavior was ongoing and affecting the author's quality of life. It's a tough call. But considering the sister's long-term negativity and the author's position in the shared living arrangement, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. They had to set a boundary. So I think the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
