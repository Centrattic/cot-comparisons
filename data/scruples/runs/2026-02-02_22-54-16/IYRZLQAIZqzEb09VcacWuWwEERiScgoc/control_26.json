It's a situation I can't do anything about because my parents own the house and rent it out to me. There is no formal lease, or rental agreement, so I'm kind of stuck with her. Since she moved in last summer, she just mopes around the house, like a dark cloud. Her fiance broke up with her right at the beginning of last year. She has not dated anyone since and says she's done with dating. She is extremely bitter and negative at all times. She stalks her ex's social media profiles and apparently his new girlfriend is pregnant. My sister is extremely salty about this since she found out... last month. She's been on a tear about it for a month. I know she had a miscarriage and all when they were together, but come on. Finally I told her flat out she needed to move the fuck on and get over it. She has been avoiding me since. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about the sister being stuck living with her sibling because of their parents' house setup. The sister has been moping since a breakup over a year ago, and the author told her to \"get over it,\" leading to tension.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the context. The sister has been dealing with the breakup for more than a year, had a miscarriage, and is now upset because her ex has a new girlfriend who's pregnant. The author feels she's been negative for too long and told her to move on. The key points here are the duration of the grief and the author's approach.\n\nGrief and healing timelines vary. A year is a long time, but it's not unheard of for people to take longer, especially if the relationship had significant pain like a miscarriage. The sister's behavior (stalking ex's social media, bitterness) suggests she's still struggling. However, telling someone to \"get over it\" can come off as dismissive, even if the intentions are to help. It might invalidate the sister's feelings and not acknowledge the complexity of her emotions.\n\nThe author's frustration is understandable, given the living situation and the sister's prolonged negativity. But instead of a direct, harsh comment, a more empathetic approach might have been better. The sister is avoiding the author now, which indicates that the conversation didn't go well. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often values emotional support and understanding. While the sister's behavior is draining, the author's method of addressing it might have been too abrupt. The right approach might have been to encourage seeking professional help or setting boundaries rather than telling her to just \"get over\" the breakup. \n\nSo, considering the situation, the author might not be entirely in the wrong because they were trying to address the issue, but their method could be seen as insensitive. However, in AITA judgments, the community often leans towards being wrong if the advice given is harsh without considering the other person's feelings. Hence, the author might be in the wrong here.\n"
