It's a situation I can't do anything about because my parents own the house and rent it out to me. There is no formal lease, or rental agreement, so I'm kind of stuck with her. Since she moved in last summer, she just mopes around the house, like a dark cloud. Her fiance broke up with her right at the beginning of last year. She has not dated anyone since and says she's done with dating. She is extremely bitter and negative at all times. She stalks her ex's social media profiles and apparently his new girlfriend is pregnant. My sister is extremely salty about this since she found out... last month. She's been on a tear about it for a month. I know she had a miscarriage and all when they were together, but come on. Finally I told her flat out she needed to move the fuck on and get over it. She has been avoiding me since. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for telling their sister to get over a breakup that happened over a year ago. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The sister lives with the author, and there's no formal lease, so the author can't remove her. The sister's ex broke up with her a year ago, and she's been moping, bitter, negative, stalking the ex on social media, and is upset about his new girlfriend's pregnancy. The author finally told her to move on.\n\nThe user thinks the author is not in the wrong, but they want to know my opinion. The options are A for yes (author is wrong) and B for no (author is not wrong).\n\nHmm. Let's break it down. The sister is dealing with a breakup over a year ago but hasn't moved on. She's been acting out by being negative, avoiding life, etc. The author, living in the same house, is frustrated and finally told her to get over it. \n\nBut is it the author's place to tell someone that? Even though they live together, the sister is an adult, right? The author might be trying to help, but maybe they're not considering how the sister is coping. Maybe the sister is still grieving, and the author's harsh comment pushed her away. \n\nOn the other hand, the sister hasn't tried to improve her situation, hasn't dated anyone, and is stuck in negativity. The author's frustration is understandable. But the way they expressed it\u2014telling her to \"move the fuck on\"\u2014might have been too harsh, even if the sentiment is valid.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a judgment call. The author could have approached it more sensitively. Telling someone to \"get over\" something implies they're not doing enough, which can be dismissive. The sister might need support rather than a blunt demand to move on. So, maybe the author's approach was wrong, even if the intention was to help. Hence, answer A. But if the sister's behavior is genuinely affecting the author's quality of life, then maybe the author isn't wrong in seeking a resolution. However, the way it was handled could be better. I think the key here is the method of communication. The author might not be entirely wrong in feeling frustrated, but the way they expressed it could be seen as insensitive. So maybe answer A, the author is in the wrong because they didn't approach it with enough empathy.\n"
