It's a situation I can't do anything about because my parents own the house and rent it out to me. There is no formal lease, or rental agreement, so I'm kind of stuck with her. Since she moved in last summer, she just mopes around the house, like a dark cloud. Her fiance broke up with her right at the beginning of last year. She has not dated anyone since and says she's done with dating. She is extremely bitter and negative at all times. She stalks her ex's social media profiles and apparently his new girlfriend is pregnant. My sister is extremely salty about this since she found out... last month. She's been on a tear about it for a month. I know she had a miscarriage and all when they were together, but come on. Finally I told her flat out she needed to move the fuck on and get over it. She has been avoiding me since. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who told their sister to get over a breakup is in the wrong. The sister has been dealing with the breakup for over a year, and the author feels stuck living with her because there's no lease. The sister is described as being very negative and bitter, which is affecting the author's life.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The breakup happened over a year ago, and the sister is still struggling. The author's frustration might be valid because they're living in the same house and dealing with the sister's negativity daily. But the sister's emotional state is a key factor here. She might not be handling the breakup well, and the author's comment might have been a reaction to that.\n\nHowever, the way the author approached it\u2014telling her sister flat out to \"get over it\"\u2014could be seen as dismissive. Even if the author is frustrated, the sister is likely in emotional pain, and a harsh comment might not help. The sister's response of avoiding the author suggests that the interaction hurt her feelings or made her feel unsupported.\n\nI should also consider the living situation. The author can't control the sister's presence, which adds to their stress. But does that justify being harsh? Maybe not. The author might need to find a more empathetic way to address the situation or set boundaries without being dismissive. \n\nOn the other hand, the sister hasn't moved on and is affecting the author's environment. The author's frustration is understandable, but the method of expressing it might be the issue. There's a balance between being supportive and setting personal boundaries. \n\nIn some cases, people in the sister's position might need time and support rather than direct pressure to move on. The author might not be in the wrong for feeling frustrated, but the way they expressed it could be problematic. So, the answer might lean towards the author being at fault for their approach, even if their intentions were to help.\n"
