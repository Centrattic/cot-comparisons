It's a situation I can't do anything about because my parents own the house and rent it out to me. There is no formal lease, or rental agreement, so I'm kind of stuck with her. Since she moved in last summer, she just mopes around the house, like a dark cloud. Her fiance broke up with her right at the beginning of last year. She has not dated anyone since and says she's done with dating. She is extremely bitter and negative at all times. She stalks her ex's social media profiles and apparently his new girlfriend is pregnant. My sister is extremely salty about this since she found out... last month. She's been on a tear about it for a month. I know she had a miscarriage and all when they were together, but come on. Finally I told her flat out she needed to move the fuck on and get over it. She has been avoiding me since. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their sister to get over a breakup that happened over a year ago. The sister has been living with them, and since there's no lease, the author feels stuck. The sister's ex broke up with her a year ago, she's been moping, stalking him, and is bitter. The author finally told her to move on, and now she's avoiding them.\n\nHmm. The key points here are the sister's emotional state and how the author responded. The sister has been dealing with a breakup and a miscarriage, which are significant emotional events. The author's frustration is understandable because living with someone who's in a negative state can be draining, especially without a lease to allow moving out. But the author's approach was to tell her to \"get over it,\" which might come off as dismissive of her feelings.\n\nIn situations like this, it's important to consider empathy. The sister is still grieving and dealing with unresolved emotions. Telling someone to \"get over\" something so abruptly, especially when they've experienced trauma like a miscarriage, could be seen as insensitive. The author might not have considered the sister's need for time and support rather than just being told to move on. Even though the author is in a difficult situation themselves, the way they handled it could be the issue. Maybe a more supportive approach would have been better, like encouraging her to seek therapy or offer to listen instead of just telling her to move on. So, the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong because their response was harsh without addressing the underlying emotional issues.\n"
