It's a situation I can't do anything about because my parents own the house and rent it out to me. There is no formal lease, or rental agreement, so I'm kind of stuck with her. Since she moved in last summer, she just mopes around the house, like a dark cloud. Her fiance broke up with her right at the beginning of last year. She has not dated anyone since and says she's done with dating. She is extremely bitter and negative at all times. She stalks her ex's social media profiles and apparently his new girlfriend is pregnant. My sister is extremely salty about this since she found out... last month. She's been on a tear about it for a month. I know she had a miscarriage and all when they were together, but come on. Finally I told her flat out she needed to move the fuck on and get over it. She has been avoiding me since. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the sister is still really upset about a breakup from over a year ago. The author lives with her because the parents own the house, and they can't move out. The sister's been moping, bitter, stalking her ex's social media, and is especially upset because the ex has a new girlfriend who's pregnant. The author finally told her to get over it, and now the sister is avoiding them.\n\nFirst, the author's perspective: They might feel frustrated because their sister's behavior is affecting the household. Living together, the sister's negativity and fixation on the past could be making the environment uncomfortable. The author might not know how else to handle it and thought directly telling her to move on was the solution.\n\nBut on the other hand, the sister is dealing with a significant emotional issue. A breakup, especially one that led to no dating since and a miscarriage mentioned, is a major trauma. Being stuck in that emotional state for over a year could indicate unresolved grief or depression. The sister might need support rather than someone telling her to \"get over it.\" The author's approach might be dismissive of her feelings and not consider her mental health. \n\nThe question is whether the author's advice was appropriate. Telling someone to \"get over\" a breakup that's been over a year might seem harsh, especially if the person is still struggling. It's possible the author didn't realize the depth of their sister's emotional pain. The sister's reaction of avoiding the author might stem from feeling judged or unsupported. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author might not be in the wrong if they were trying to help, but their method could be seen as insensitive. Emotional support often requires empathy and understanding, not a directive approach. The sister's situation might require professional help, which the author didn't provide for. However, the author isn't necessarily at fault because they might not have known better or felt their own frustration.\n\nConsidering all that, the answer is probably B (not in the wrong) because the author was trying to address a problem they're in a difficult situation with, but there's a valid argument that their approach was harsh. However, given the context of the sister's behavior affecting the household, the author's frustration is understandable. The key point is that while the method might be questionable, the author isn't entirely in the wrong because they were trying to help in their own way.\n"
