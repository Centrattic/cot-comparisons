It's a situation I can't do anything about because my parents own the house and rent it out to me. There is no formal lease, or rental agreement, so I'm kind of stuck with her. Since she moved in last summer, she just mopes around the house, like a dark cloud. Her fiance broke up with her right at the beginning of last year. She has not dated anyone since and says she's done with dating. She is extremely bitter and negative at all times. She stalks her ex's social media profiles and apparently his new girlfriend is pregnant. My sister is extremely salty about this since she found out... last month. She's been on a tear about it for a month. I know she had a miscarriage and all when they were together, but come on. Finally I told her flat out she needed to move the fuck on and get over it. She has been avoiding me since. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person (the author) is in the wrong for telling their sister to move on from a breakup that happened over a year ago.\n\nFirst, the situation: the sister lives with the author in a house owned by their parents, no lease, so the author can't just kick her out. The sister's ex-fianc\u00e9 broke up with her a year ago, she hasn't dated anyone since, is bitter, negative, and has been fixated on her ex and his new girlfriend. The author finally snapped and told her to get over it, leading to the sister avoiding them.\n\nSo, the key points here are the timing (over a year ago), the sister's ongoing emotional state, and the author's frustration. The author is probably feeling stressed because they can't leave the house and are stuck with a sister who's making the environment unpleasant.\n\nBut how long does someone have to be upset before it's reasonable to say they need to move on? A year isn't that long in the grand scheme of emotional healing. People process grief and breakup at different rates. The sister's actions\u2014like stalking social media and being bitter\u2014might indicate she's still struggling, but the author is frustrated. However, telling someone to \"get over it\" can come off as dismissive. It's possible the author's comment was harsh, especially if they didn't consider their sister's emotional state or validate her feelings before giving that advice.\n\nThe sister's miscarriage also adds another layer of trauma, which might make it harder for her to move on. The author might not have considered the depth of her pain. Even though the author is in a difficult living situation, their approach could have been more empathetic. Instead of demanding she move on, maybe offering support or suggesting she seek professional help would have been better.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's frustration is understandable. Living with someone who's constantly negative can be draining. They might not have known how else to handle the situation, especially if they've tried other methods without success.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit nuanced. The author's intention might have been to help their sister move on, but the way they expressed it was hurtful. The sister's avoidance suggests the comment was damaging. So while the author's frustration is valid, their approach might have been inappropriate. Therefore, they could be in the wrong for not handling the situation with more compassion and understanding.\n"
