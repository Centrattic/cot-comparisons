It's a situation I can't do anything about because my parents own the house and rent it out to me. There is no formal lease, or rental agreement, so I'm kind of stuck with her. Since she moved in last summer, she just mopes around the house, like a dark cloud. Her fiance broke up with her right at the beginning of last year. She has not dated anyone since and says she's done with dating. She is extremely bitter and negative at all times. She stalks her ex's social media profiles and apparently his new girlfriend is pregnant. My sister is extremely salty about this since she found out... last month. She's been on a tear about it for a month. I know she had a miscarriage and all when they were together, but come on. Finally I told her flat out she needed to move the fuck on and get over it. She has been avoiding me since. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about the sister not getting over a breakup from over a year ago, and the author told her to \"get over it.\" \n\nFirst, I need to analyze the context. The sister's fianc\u00e9 broke up with her a year ago, she hasn't dated since, and is still very bitter. She's been moping around the house, stalking her ex's social media, and is upset about his new girlfriend's pregnancy. The author tells her to move on, leading to the sister avoiding them.\n\nThe question is whether the author is at fault. From a psychological perspective, dealing with a breakup, especially after a miscarriage, can take time. The sister's behavior (stalking, bitterness) suggests she might still be in her grieving process. The author's approach of directly telling her to \"get over it\" might be seen as dismissive of her feelings. People often need time and space to process such events, and being told to move on can feel invalidating.\n\nHowever, the author is living with her and might be feeling the strain of her sister's behavior affecting their living environment. The sister's actions (dark cloud, negativity) could be making the home environment uncomfortable. The author's frustration is understandable, but how they expressed it could be the issue.\n\nIn terms of social dynamics, it's important to support someone through grief rather than pushing them to move on. The sister might need empathy and encouragement rather than direct confrontation. The author's tone (\"move the fuck on\") might have been too harsh, especially if the sister is still in the early stages of healing, even a year later.\n\nAlso, the sister's avoidance after the conversation suggests that the approach may have caused harm. The key here is whether the author gave the sister enough support and understanding before telling her to move on. If the author didn't acknowledge her feelings and instead dismissed them, that could be where the fault lies.\n\nConsidering all this, the author might be in the wrong for not approaching the situation with more compassion and for using a confrontational method that didn't address the sister's emotional needs. So the answer would likely be A (they are in the wrong)."
