It's a situation I can't do anything about because my parents own the house and rent it out to me. There is no formal lease, or rental agreement, so I'm kind of stuck with her. Since she moved in last summer, she just mopes around the house, like a dark cloud. Her fiance broke up with her right at the beginning of last year. She has not dated anyone since and says she's done with dating. She is extremely bitter and negative at all times. She stalks her ex's social media profiles and apparently his new girlfriend is pregnant. My sister is extremely salty about this since she found out... last month. She's been on a tear about it for a month. I know she had a miscarriage and all when they were together, but come on. Finally I told her flat out she needed to move the fuck on and get over it. She has been avoiding me since. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who told their sister to move on from a one-year-old breakup is in the wrong. The sister has been moping, avoiding dating, and is bitter since her ex proposed a new girlfriend's pregnancy. The user lives with her because their parents own the house, and they can't leave. They finally told her to get over it, leading to the sister avoiding them.\n\nFirst, the sister's behavior is clearly affecting the household. She's been stuck in this emotional state for over a year, which is a long time. The user's frustration is understandable, especially living together. But the key question is whether the user was wrong to confront her that way.\n\nThe user's approach was direct and perhaps harsh (\"move the fuck on\"), which might have been too abrupt. Emotional support usually requires patience and understanding. However, the sister's prolonged negativity and avoidance of life (not dating, stalking ex) might have warranted some intervention. The user's comment could be seen as a reaction to their own stress from living in the same space with someone in such a state. \n\nBut is the user in the wrong? Well, while the sister's behavior is problematic, the user's response might lack empathy. Instead of telling her to \"get over it,\" maybe offering support or suggesting professional help would be better. However, the user might not be at fault for expressing frustration, especially if they've tried other approaches without success. The sister's avoidance now might be more about feeling criticized than the user being necessarily wrong.\n\nSo, considering both sides, the answer could be B (No), because the user's frustration is valid, but maybe the approach could have been softer. However, the user might not be in the wrong for trying to address the issue. Alternatively, A (Yes), because the comment was hurtful and dismissive. Hmm. It's a bit of a toss-up, but the user's intent was to help, even if the method was harsh. So leaning towards B.\n"
