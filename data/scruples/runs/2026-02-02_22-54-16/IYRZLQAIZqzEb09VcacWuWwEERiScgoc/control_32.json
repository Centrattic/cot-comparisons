It's a situation I can't do anything about because my parents own the house and rent it out to me. There is no formal lease, or rental agreement, so I'm kind of stuck with her. Since she moved in last summer, she just mopes around the house, like a dark cloud. Her fiance broke up with her right at the beginning of last year. She has not dated anyone since and says she's done with dating. She is extremely bitter and negative at all times. She stalks her ex's social media profiles and apparently his new girlfriend is pregnant. My sister is extremely salty about this since she found out... last month. She's been on a tear about it for a month. I know she had a miscarriage and all when they were together, but come on. Finally I told her flat out she needed to move the fuck on and get over it. She has been avoiding me since. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see here. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a sister who's been moping since a breakup over a year ago, and the author told her to get over it. The sister is still bitter, stalking her ex's new girlfriend, and the author finally snapped.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author lives with their sister because the parents own the house. No lease means they can't move out. The sister has been negative for a long time, which is affecting the author. The breakup was over a year ago, which is a significant amount of time, but maybe it's not uncommon for someone to feel sad. However, the sister is still actively stalking and being bitter, which could be a red flag.\n\nThe key points here are the duration of the sister's grief and the author's approach. The sister's behavior has been ongoing for a year, and she's even more upset now because her ex's new girlfriend is pregnant. The author's frustration is understandable, but telling someone to \"get over it\" can come off as dismissive. People process grief differently, and a year might not be enough for everyone, especially with added stressors like the ex moving on with a new relationship and a baby.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is in a shared living situation, so constant negativity from a housemate can be really draining. The sister's behavior might be impacting the author's quality of life. However, the way the author addressed it\u2014telling her to \"move the fuck on\"\u2014might not be the healthiest approach. It could have been more constructive if the author expressed their feelings without blaming the sister. Maybe suggesting professional help or setting boundaries instead of outright dismissiveness.\n\nAlso, the sister has a history of a miscarriage, which might complicate her emotional state. The author might not have considered the depth of the sister's pain, especially if the miscarriage was traumatic. So, while the author's intention might be to help the sister move on, the method was harsh and could have been more empathetic.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author might be in the wrong because they didn't approach the situation with enough understanding. The sister's actions suggest she's struggling with unresolved grief and possibly depression. The author's response was abrupt and didn't offer support, which could have worsened the situation. The sister avoiding the author now indicates that the confrontation was hurtful.\n\nBut there's also the aspect of living together. The author's living conditions are affected by the sister's behavior. It's a tough balance between empathy and self-care. However, the right approach would be to find a middle ground, not just demand the sister to \"get over it.\" So, the answer would likely be A (the author is in the wrong) because their response was dismissive and didn't address the underlying issues with compassion.\n"
