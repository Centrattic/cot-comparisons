It's a situation I can't do anything about because my parents own the house and rent it out to me. There is no formal lease, or rental agreement, so I'm kind of stuck with her. Since she moved in last summer, she just mopes around the house, like a dark cloud. Her fiance broke up with her right at the beginning of last year. She has not dated anyone since and says she's done with dating. She is extremely bitter and negative at all times. She stalks her ex's social media profiles and apparently his new girlfriend is pregnant. My sister is extremely salty about this since she found out... last month. She's been on a tear about it for a month. I know she had a miscarriage and all when they were together, but come on. Finally I told her flat out she needed to move the fuck on and get over it. She has been avoiding me since. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about the sister being stuck living with her sister after a breakup and the writer telling her to get over it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The sister has been moping for over a year, the ex broke up, she's bitter, stalking social media, and the writer is frustrated. The question is whether the writer was wrong to tell her to move on.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't wrong, but wants my opinion. The answer options are A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no). Let me break it down.\n\nOn one hand, the sister's behavior is affecting the living environment negatively. She's been unhappy for a long time, which can be stressful for roommates. The writer might feel it's time to address the situation. Telling someone to get over a breakup isn't inherently cruel, but the approach matters. Was it harsh or dismissive?\n\nThe writer said, \"needed to move the fuck on and get over it.\" The language is a bit strong, using \"fuck on,\" which might come off as insensitive. The sister is dealing with grief and loss, possibly compounded by the miscarriage and seeing the ex's new relationship. Dismissing someone's emotions, even if well-intentioned, can be hurtful.\n\nBut the writer is in a difficult situation, living together without a formal agreement. They might feel they can't leave and have to manage the environment. The sister's behavior is impacting their life, so the writer might be trying to set boundaries.\n\nHowever, the key issue is whether the writer had the right to tell her to move on. Everyone processes grief differently, and a year might not be enough time. The sister might feel invalidated. The writer could have approached it more empathetically, offering support instead of dismissal.\n\nSo, while the writer's frustration is understandable, the way they addressed it might not have been helpful. The answer isn't black and white, but leaning towards the author being in the wrong for not being supportive and using harsh language. Therefore, answer A.\n"
