It's a situation I can't do anything about because my parents own the house and rent it out to me. There is no formal lease, or rental agreement, so I'm kind of stuck with her. Since she moved in last summer, she just mopes around the house, like a dark cloud. Her fiance broke up with her right at the beginning of last year. She has not dated anyone since and says she's done with dating. She is extremely bitter and negative at all times. She stalks her ex's social media profiles and apparently his new girlfriend is pregnant. My sister is extremely salty about this since she found out... last month. She's been on a tear about it for a month. I know she had a miscarriage and all when they were together, but come on. Finally I told her flat out she needed to move the fuck on and get over it. She has been avoiding me since. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for telling their sister to get over a breakup that happened over a year ago. The sister lives with them, and the sister has been moping around, being negative, and is still upset about the breakup. The author said she needed to move on and get over it, and now the sister is avoiding them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The sister's ex broke up with her over a year ago, and she hasn't dated anyone since. She's been bitter, stalking his social media, and is upset because his new girlfriend is pregnant. The author feels stuck living with her because their parents own the house and there's no lease. The author's comment was direct: \"move the fuck on and get over it,\" which might have been harsh.\n\nThe user's own opinion is that the author isn't in the wrong. Now, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nI should think about the dynamics here. The sister is dealing with a past relationship that's causing her ongoing distress. The author, living with her, is affected by her negativity. But the author's approach was to tell her to move on, which might not be supportive. The sister's behavior is a year-long issue, and the author is frustrated. However, telling someone to \"get over\" a breakup that's causing them emotional pain might not be helpful. Maybe the author could have approached it differently, like offering support or suggesting therapy.\n\nOn the other hand, the sister's behavior is affecting the author's living environment. The author might feel they have the right to address the sister's negativity. But is it fair to accuse them of being in the wrong? The sister's response of avoiding the author suggests the comment hurt her. So perhaps the author's approach was too harsh, even if their intentions were to improve the living situation.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the key points are intent and impact. The impact here is that the sister is avoiding the author. The intent was to help the sister move on, but the method was abrasive. The author might not be in the wrong if they were trying to help, but the way they did it could be problematic. However, given the sister's ongoing behavior, maybe the author had a valid reason to speak up. \n\nBut the core of the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The sister's emotional state is a result of a past trauma (miscarriage and breakup). The author's comment could be seen as dismissive of her feelings. Even if the author is frustrated, telling someone to \"get over\" a breakup that's been difficult for them might be invalidating. That could be where the author is in the wrong. So the answer might be A (yes). However, some might argue that the author isn't in the wrong because they were trying to protect their own well-being. \n\nBut usually, in these situations, the advice is to be supportive rather than dismissive. The author could have suggested seeking help or offered support instead of being blunt. So maybe the answer is A. However, the user thinks it's B, so there's a conflict. I need to decide based on typical AITA responses. Often, the person is seen as in the wrong if their advice is unsupportive, even if the situation is frustrating. Therefore, the answer might be A.\n"
