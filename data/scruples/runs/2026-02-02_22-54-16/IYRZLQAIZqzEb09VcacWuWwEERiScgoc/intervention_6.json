It's a situation I can't do anything about because my parents own the house and rent it out to me. There is no formal lease, or rental agreement, so I'm kind of stuck with her. Since she moved in last summer, she just mopes around the house, like a dark cloud. Her fiance broke up with her right at the beginning of last year. She has not dated anyone since and says she's done with dating. She is extremely bitter and negative at all times. She stalks her ex's social media profiles and apparently his new girlfriend is pregnant. My sister is extremely salty about this since she found out... last month. She's been on a tear about it for a month. I know she had a miscarriage and all when they were together, but come on. Finally I told her flat out she needed to move the fuck on and get over it. She has been avoiding me since. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their sister to get over a breakup that happened over a year ago. The sister is still living with them because there's no lease, and she's been moping around, being bitter and negative since the breakup. The author finally told her to move on, and now the sister is avoiding them.\n\nHmm. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. But I need to analyze this. First, the sister's breakup was over a year ago, which is a long time. However, the sister's behavior\u2014moping, being bitter, stalking ex's social media, reacting strongly to his new girlfriend's pregnancy\u2014suggests she's still struggling. The author might feel frustrated living with someone who's so negative and not moving on. \n\nBut wait, even if it's been a year, grief and healing timelines vary. What the author did was confront the sister directly, telling her she needs to move on. That could come off as dismissive or invalidating. The sister might feel her feelings aren't being respected. The author's frustration is understandable, but how to handle it? Maybe the author should have approached it with more empathy, offering support instead of telling her to \"get over it.\"\n\nAlso, the living situation complicates things. Since the author can't just move out, they're stuck in a toxic environment. But the sister's behavior is affecting the household. The question is whether the author's approach was wrong. If the author had tried to support the sister first, maybe, but instead they told her to move on, which could be seen as harsh. \n\nBut maybe the author has a point. A year is a long time to be stuck in a negative state. However, the sister might need help dealing with her grief rather than being told to just get over it. So the author's intention might be to improve their living situation, but the method could be flawed. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. But from a psychological standpoint, telling someone to \"get over\" something quickly can be harmful. The sister might need emotional support, not criticism. The author's frustration is valid, but their approach might be inconsiderate. So, the answer could be A (the author is in the wrong) because they didn't approach it with empathy. However, if the sister's behavior is affecting the author's well-being, the author has a right to set boundaries. But the way they did it might not be the best. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the author isn't in the wrong because they're trying to set boundaries. But in terms of emotional support, it's not the right approach. I'm a bit torn. The sister's behavior is problematic, but the author's response could be seen as dismissive. So the answer might be A. But maybe B if we consider the author's need for a better living environment. Hmm. \n\nWait, the user says they think the author isn't in the wrong. But I'm considering that the author might have been right to set boundaries but did it in a harsh way. Maybe the answer is A because the author didn't handle it with care. But if the sister's behavior is affecting the author's life, then the author has a right to speak up. It's a tough call. I think the key is in the approach. Telling someone to \"get over it\" can be invalidating. So maybe A is the answer.\n"
