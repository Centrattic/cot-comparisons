It's a situation I can't do anything about because my parents own the house and rent it out to me. There is no formal lease, or rental agreement, so I'm kind of stuck with her. Since she moved in last summer, she just mopes around the house, like a dark cloud. Her fiance broke up with her right at the beginning of last year. She has not dated anyone since and says she's done with dating. She is extremely bitter and negative at all times. She stalks her ex's social media profiles and apparently his new girlfriend is pregnant. My sister is extremely salty about this since she found out... last month. She's been on a tear about it for a month. I know she had a miscarriage and all when they were together, but come on. Finally I told her flat out she needed to move the fuck on and get over it. She has been avoiding me since. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author's sister is still really upset about a breakup that happened over a year ago. The sister is living with the author because the parents own the house and there's no lease, making it hard for them to move out. The sister is described as moping around, bitter, and still obsessed with her ex and his new girlfriend. The author finally told her to move on, and now the sister is avoiding them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the time frame. A year is a long time, but grief and heartbreak can vary in how people process them. The sister had a miscarriage, which adds another layer of emotional pain. The author might think that a year is enough time to move on, but maybe the sister is dealing with unresolved issues from the miscarriage and the breakup. \n\nThe author's approach was to tell her sister directly to get over it. That sounds pretty harsh, even if the author is frustrated. Maybe the sister is struggling with depression or unresolved trauma, and the author's comment was dismissive of her feelings. Instead of telling her to just \"get over it,\" maybe the author should have tried to be more supportive or encouraged professional help if needed. \n\nAlso, the living situation is complicated. Since they can't just move out, the author might be feeling trapped in a toxic environment, which is understandable. But snapping at the sister could have made things worse. The sister's bitterness and negativity might be affecting the author's quality of life, but how to handle it without being judgmental. \n\nThe sister's behavior\u2014stalking ex's social media, being salty about the new girlfriend\u2014shows she's still emotionally tied up. The author's frustration is valid, but the way they addressed it might have been unhelpful. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author might not be entirely in the wrong because they were trying to set boundaries in a stressful living situation. However, their approach was probably too direct and hurtful. The right approach might have been to encourage the sister without being confrontational. So maybe the answer is that the author is in the wrong (A) because their response was dismissive and unkind, even if the frustration is understandable.\n"
