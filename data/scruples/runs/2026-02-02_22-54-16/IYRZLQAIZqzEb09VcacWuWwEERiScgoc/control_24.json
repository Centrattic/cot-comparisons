It's a situation I can't do anything about because my parents own the house and rent it out to me. There is no formal lease, or rental agreement, so I'm kind of stuck with her. Since she moved in last summer, she just mopes around the house, like a dark cloud. Her fiance broke up with her right at the beginning of last year. She has not dated anyone since and says she's done with dating. She is extremely bitter and negative at all times. She stalks her ex's social media profiles and apparently his new girlfriend is pregnant. My sister is extremely salty about this since she found out... last month. She's been on a tear about it for a month. I know she had a miscarriage and all when they were together, but come on. Finally I told her flat out she needed to move the fuck on and get over it. She has been avoiding me since. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is that the sister is still really upset about a breakup from over a year ago, and the author told her to get over it. The sister is living with the author, and there's no formal lease, so the author can't just kick her out. The sister is described as moping, negative, bitter, and fixated on her ex and his new girlfriend. The author finally told her to move on, and now the sister is avoiding them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is stuck living with their sister because of the parents' house and lack of a lease. The sister's behavior is affecting the household environment. The author is frustrated and decided to confront her. The key question is whether telling someone to \"get over\" a past relationship is wrong, especially when it's been over a year.\n\nThe sister's behavior seems extreme and unhelpful. Stalking the ex, being bitter, and avoiding dating for over a year might indicate unresolved grief or emotional issues. However, the author's approach was to tell her to \"move the fuck on,\" which came off as harsh. The sister is now avoiding the author. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the author's frustration is understandable given the living situation and the sister's ongoing negativity. But the way they expressed that frustration might have been insensitive. Telling someone to \"get over\" a breakup can be dismissive of their feelings, even if the breakup was a year ago. People grieve differently, and some take longer to process such events. The author's comment could be seen as invalidating the sister's emotions, which might not be the healthiest approach, even if the sister's behavior is problematic.\n\nHowever, the author is in a difficult position, having to live with someone who is negatively impacting the household. They might have felt that they had to set a boundary. The sister's behavior might require professional help rather than just being told to move on. The author might not be in the wrong for expressing their frustration, but perhaps could have approached it more compassionately. The answer might depend on cultural or personal values about handling family issues and emotional support.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the answer is A, yes, then the reasoning is that the author was dismissive of their sister's feelings. If B, no, then it's about the author standing up for themselves in a difficult living situation. I think it's a bit of both, but the question is whether they are \"in the wrong.\" Since the sister's behavior is clearly affecting the household, the author might not be in the wrong for trying to address it, even if the approach was harsh. However, the way they addressed it could be seen as invalidating, which is part of the problem. The right answer might be A, but I'm a bit conflicted. Alternatively, maybe the answer is B, because the author is not the one who caused the issue and is trying to manage their own stress. But I'm not 100% sure. I'll go with A because the way they told their sister to move on might have been unkind and dismissive, even if the sister's behavior was problematic.\n"
