It's a situation I can't do anything about because my parents own the house and rent it out to me. There is no formal lease, or rental agreement, so I'm kind of stuck with her. Since she moved in last summer, she just mopes around the house, like a dark cloud. Her fiance broke up with her right at the beginning of last year. She has not dated anyone since and says she's done with dating. She is extremely bitter and negative at all times. She stalks her ex's social media profiles and apparently his new girlfriend is pregnant. My sister is extremely salty about this since she found out... last month. She's been on a tear about it for a month. I know she had a miscarriage and all when they were together, but come on. Finally I told her flat out she needed to move the fuck on and get over it. She has been avoiding me since. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break down the situation. The user is asking if the author is at fault for telling their sister to get over a breakup that happened over a year ago. The sister has been living with the author, and there's no formal lease or agreement, which complicates things because they can't just move out. The sister is still dealing with the breakup, showing bitterness, stalking her ex, and being negative. The author finally told her to move on, leading to the sister avoiding them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The sister is dealing with a past breakup, which is still affecting her emotionally. The author, living in the same house, is frustrated by her sister's constant negativity and behavior. The key points are the time since the breakup, the sister's ongoing emotional state, and the author's reaction.\n\nThe author's main issue is that they feel their sister hasn't moved on and is being overly negative. They intervened by telling her to get over it. Now, the sister is avoiding them. The question is whether the author was wrong to do so.\n\nFrom a psychological standpoint, people grieve and process breakups differently. A year is a long time, but some people might still struggle, especially if there were traumatic events like a miscarriage. The sister's behavior, such as stalking the ex and being bitter, suggests unresolved issues. However, telling someone to \"get over it\" can be dismissive of their feelings. It might minimize their pain and make them feel unsupported, even if the author's intention was to help.\n\nThe author's frustration is understandable, especially living with someone who is consistently negative. But the way they addressed it\u2014telling her to \"move the fuck on\"\u2014could come off as harsh and invalidating. It's possible that the sister felt attacked, leading to her avoiding the author. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author might not be entirely at fault because they were trying to encourage their sister to move forward. However, the approach was likely too direct and unempathetic. A better approach might have been to express concern and offer support rather than issuing a command. \n\nOn the other hand, the sister has a responsibility to manage her own behavior and not let it negatively impact the household. If she's been this way for a year, the author might feel justified in setting boundaries. But the way the author communicated this might have been the issue.\n\nSo, considering all angles, the answer hinges on whether the author's response was appropriately empathetic. Since the sister is still dealing with emotional pain, the author's blunt approach might have been inappropriate. Therefore, the author could be seen as in the wrong for not handling the situation with more sensitivity and support.\n"
