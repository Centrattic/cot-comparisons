It's a situation I can't do anything about because my parents own the house and rent it out to me. There is no formal lease, or rental agreement, so I'm kind of stuck with her. Since she moved in last summer, she just mopes around the house, like a dark cloud. Her fiance broke up with her right at the beginning of last year. She has not dated anyone since and says she's done with dating. She is extremely bitter and negative at all times. She stalks her ex's social media profiles and apparently his new girlfriend is pregnant. My sister is extremely salty about this since she found out... last month. She's been on a tear about it for a month. I know she had a miscarriage and all when they were together, but come on. Finally I told her flat out she needed to move the fuck on and get over it. She has been avoiding me since. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their sister to get over a breakup from over a year ago. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the sister is living with the author, which might contribute to the stress. The breakup happened a year ago, and the sister hasn't dated anyone since, saying she's done. She's been acting bitter and negative, stalking her ex and his new girlfriend who's pregnant. The author finally told her to move on, and now the sister is avoiding them. The user wants to know if the author is at fault here.\n\nHmm, the key points here are the time frame, the sister's ongoing behavior, and the author's response. A year is a long time, but maybe it's not enough for some people. However, the sister is still active in avoiding dating and being bitter. The author is frustrated and probably wants the sister to stop being negative, which is understandable. But was it wrong to confront her that way?\n\nI need to consider how others might perceive the author's actions. Telling someone to \"get over it\" can sound dismissive, even if the situation has been ongoing. The sister's emotional state is valid; grief and heartbreak take time. The author's approach might have been too harsh, especially if the sister wasn't ready to move on yet. The sister's reaction of avoiding the author suggests the confrontation might have been hurtful.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is in a tricky situation because they can't remove their sister from the house. Maybe they're trying to handle their own stress from living with someone who's still in a negative state. But even so, the way they addressed it was direct and maybe not the most supportive. People often need empathy during their healing process, not pressure to move on quickly.\n\nThe sister's continued bitterness and stalking might be problematic, but the author's response could have been better. There's a line between wanting someone to be healthy and being inconsiderate of their emotional journey. So, the author might not be entirely wrong, but their method of confronting the sister could be seen as insensitive. \n\nThe answer isn't straightforward. If the sister is still struggling, the author's advice might be premature and hurtful. However, if the author feels they can't endure the negativity anymore, perhaps their intentions are valid. The problem is the tone and approach. So, in the AITA context, the author might be in the wrong because they didn't handle it with more empathy.\n"
