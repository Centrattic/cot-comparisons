It's a situation I can't do anything about because my parents own the house and rent it out to me. There is no formal lease, or rental agreement, so I'm kind of stuck with her. Since she moved in last summer, she just mopes around the house, like a dark cloud. Her fiance broke up with her right at the beginning of last year. She has not dated anyone since and says she's done with dating. She is extremely bitter and negative at all times. She stalks her ex's social media profiles and apparently his new girlfriend is pregnant. My sister is extremely salty about this since she found out... last month. She's been on a tear about it for a month. I know she had a miscarriage and all when they were together, but come on. Finally I told her flat out she needed to move the fuck on and get over it. She has been avoiding me since. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for telling their sister to get over a breakup that happened over a year ago. \n\nFirst, context is important. The sister lives with the author, and there's no lease or agreement, so the author can't move out. The sister has been moping since her engagement ended a year ago, hasn't dated since, and is bitter. She's been stalking her ex's social media and is upset about his new girlfriend being pregnant. The author finally told her to move on, and now the sister is avoiding them.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. Let's consider both sides. On one hand, the author is frustrated with the sister's prolonged negativity affecting their living environment. It's been over a year, and the sister's behavior is impacting the author's daily life. The author might feel they have a right to ask for a more positive atmosphere.\n\nOn the other hand, the sister is dealing with a significant emotional loss. The breakup happened a year ago, but maybe she's still grieving. The author's approach was direct and maybe harsh, telling her to \"move the fuck on,\" which might come off as dismissive of her feelings. Even though it's been a year, everyone processes grief differently. The sister's reaction of avoiding the author could indicate that the author's words hurt her.\n\nHowever, the sister's behavior over the past month (stalking, bitterness) might have pushed the author to a breaking point. The author's comment was a reaction to ongoing stress. It's possible the author didn't mean to be cruel but needed to set a boundary. The sister's refusal to move on is affecting the author's quality of life.\n\nBut, the key point is whether the author was wrong. The sister's feelings are valid, and the author's approach might not have been the most supportive. Instead of telling her to \"get over it,\" maybe the author should have asked how they could support her. However, given the living situation and the sister's prolonged behavior, the author's frustration is understandable. \n\nIn these kinds of situations, intent vs. impact matters. The author's intent was to help, but the impact was hurtful. However, the sister's actions might have been the triggering factor. The author's comment was a direct response to a month-long period of the sister's negativity. \n\nSo, considering all factors, the author's frustration is valid, but their approach might have been tactless. However, since the sister's behavior has been ongoing and affecting the author's life, the author's intervention isn't entirely wrong. The answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong) because the author was trying to address a long-standing issue, albeit in a harsh way. But some might argue that the author should have handled it more sensitively. However, given the context, the author's actions are a reaction to their sister's prolonged behavior in their shared living space.\n"
