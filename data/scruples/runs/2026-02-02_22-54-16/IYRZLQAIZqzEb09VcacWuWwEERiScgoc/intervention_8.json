It's a situation I can't do anything about because my parents own the house and rent it out to me. There is no formal lease, or rental agreement, so I'm kind of stuck with her. Since she moved in last summer, she just mopes around the house, like a dark cloud. Her fiance broke up with her right at the beginning of last year. She has not dated anyone since and says she's done with dating. She is extremely bitter and negative at all times. She stalks her ex's social media profiles and apparently his new girlfriend is pregnant. My sister is extremely salty about this since she found out... last month. She's been on a tear about it for a month. I know she had a miscarriage and all when they were together, but come on. Finally I told her flat out she needed to move the fuck on and get over it. She has been avoiding me since. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their sister to get over a breakup that happened over a year ago. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the sister lives with the author because their parents own the house and rent it to them without a lease. The sister has been moping since her fianc\u00e9 broke up with her over a year ago. She's bitter, negative, stalks her ex's social media, and is upset because her ex's new girlfriend is pregnant. The author finally told her to move on, and now the sister is avoiding them.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. I need to figure if that's correct. \n\nWell, the author's sister has been dealing with this breakup for over a year. The author might be frustrated with her constant negativity and not moving on. But is it right to tell someone to \"get over it\"? Grief and healing processes vary. A year isn't necessarily too long, but maybe the sister is stuck in her grief. The author's approach was to confront her directly, which could be seen as harsh. \n\nOn the other hand, the sister's behavior is affecting the household environment. The author has to live with this negativity, so they might feel justified in trying to set boundaries. However, telling someone to \"get over it\" can be dismissive of their feelings. The sister's response of avoiding the author suggests the confrontation hurt her feelings.\n\nBut the sister has also been avoiding the situation for a long time, so maybe the author had the right to express frustration. However, the method might have been inappropriate. A better approach could have been offering support or suggesting therapy, but the author's directness might not be the issue here.\n\nConsidering that the sister's behavior is impacting the author's living situation, the author might feel justified. However, the emotional aspect is tricky. The sister might still be grieving, and the author's approach could be too abrupt. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the sister's actions are affecting the author's life, and the author tried to address it, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. The sister might need more support, but the author's frustration is understandable. \n\nSo, I think the answer is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. They had valid reasons due to the living situation and the sister's prolonged negative behavior. However, the approach could have been more empathetic. But in terms of right or wrong, the author's action stems from frustration in a difficult situation, so they're not in the wrong.\n"
