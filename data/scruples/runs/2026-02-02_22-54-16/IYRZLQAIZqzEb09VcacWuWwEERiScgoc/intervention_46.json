It's a situation I can't do anything about because my parents own the house and rent it out to me. There is no formal lease, or rental agreement, so I'm kind of stuck with her. Since she moved in last summer, she just mopes around the house, like a dark cloud. Her fiance broke up with her right at the beginning of last year. She has not dated anyone since and says she's done with dating. She is extremely bitter and negative at all times. She stalks her ex's social media profiles and apparently his new girlfriend is pregnant. My sister is extremely salty about this since she found out... last month. She's been on a tear about it for a month. I know she had a miscarriage and all when they were together, but come on. Finally I told her flat out she needed to move the fuck on and get over it. She has been avoiding me since. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about the person telling their sister to get over a breakup that happened over a year ago.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The sister lives with the author, and they can't move out because the parents own the house. The sister's ex broke up with her at the start of last year, and she's been moping, bitter, and negative. She's been stalking her ex and is upset because his new girlfriend is pregnant. The author told her to move on, and now the sister is avoiding them.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but wants to know my opinion. Answer A for yes (author is wrong), B for no (not wrong).\n\nHmm. Let's break it down. The sister has been dealing with this breakup for over a year and is still showing negative behaviors. The author is frustrated and finally told her to get over it. But is that appropriate?\n\nEmotionally, when someone is grieving or dealing with a breakup, especially after a miscarriage, it's a traumatic experience. The sister might still be in the healing process. The author's approach was direct and maybe harsh\u2014\"get over it\" can come off as dismissive. However, the author is living with someone who's making the environment unpleasant. They might feel they have a right to ask for a change in behavior.\n\nBut is the author in the wrong? Well, telling someone to \"get over\" something can be seen as invalidating their feelings. It's possible the sister hasn't processed her grief, and instead of support, the author gave advice that might have been hurtful. The sister's reaction (avoiding) suggests it didn't help. However, the author is in a stressful situation too, living with someone they can't easily remove.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, it's often about empathy and communication. The author might have a valid frustration, but their approach could be seen as lacking compassion. Alternatively, maybe they were justified in setting a boundary. It's a bit of a gray area. The sister hasn't dated in over a year, which is a long time, but grief isn't linear. The author's tone was harsh, which might make them the asshole. However, the sister's behavior is affecting the author's living environment, so maybe the author isn't wrong to ask for change, but the way they did it was wrong.\n\nI think the answer hinges on the approach. If the author had tried to support the sister first, maybe. But they just told her to move on, which can be dismissive. So perhaps the author is in the wrong. But some might argue they're just asking someone to stop being negative in their home. Hmm. I'm leaning towards B (not in the wrong) because the sister's behavior is affecting the author's life, and the author tried to address it. But the method was harsh. However, in AITA, sometimes even if you have a valid point, if your approach is hurtful, you're considered the asshole. So maybe A. It's conflicting. I think the key is that the author didn't provide support or understanding, just told the sister to get over it. That's dismissive. So I might think A. But others might say the author isn't wrong to ask for better behavior. It's tricky. I need to decide based on typical AITA responses. Usually, telling someone to \"get over\" something is seen as a problem. So answer A.\n"
