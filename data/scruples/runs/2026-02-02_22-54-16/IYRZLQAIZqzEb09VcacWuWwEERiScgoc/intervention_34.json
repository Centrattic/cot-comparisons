It's a situation I can't do anything about because my parents own the house and rent it out to me. There is no formal lease, or rental agreement, so I'm kind of stuck with her. Since she moved in last summer, she just mopes around the house, like a dark cloud. Her fiance broke up with her right at the beginning of last year. She has not dated anyone since and says she's done with dating. She is extremely bitter and negative at all times. She stalks her ex's social media profiles and apparently his new girlfriend is pregnant. My sister is extremely salty about this since she found out... last month. She's been on a tear about it for a month. I know she had a miscarriage and all when they were together, but come on. Finally I told her flat out she needed to move the fuck on and get over it. She has been avoiding me since. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author of this situation is in the wrong. The sister is still upset about a breakup from over a year ago, acting bitter and negative, and the author told her to get over it. The user thinks the author isn't wrong, but they're asking for my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The sister has been living with the author since last summer, and the breakup was at the start of last year. So it's been about a year or more. She's been moping, stalking her ex, and is upset about his new girlfriend being pregnant. The author's response was to tell her to move on.\n\nEmotionally, the sister is dealing with unresolved feelings. The author might think she's being too negative and that she should move past it. But sometimes, people process breakups at different rates. A year is a long time, but maybe the sister is still struggling, especially with the miscarriage and the recent news. \n\nThe author's approach was direct and maybe a bit harsh. Saying \"move the fuck on\" could come off as dismissive. It's possible they were frustrated and wanted their sister to stop being negative, but the way they expressed it might have been unhelpful. Siblings can have boundaries, but in a shared living space, the impact of one's behavior on the other is significant. \n\nSupporting someone through grief isn't just about telling them to get over it; it's about offering empathy and understanding. The sister might need more emotional support rather than being told to stop moping. Even if the author's intention was to help, the method could have been better. \n\nAlso, the author is stuck in the situation because the house is owned by their parents and there's no lease. That adds stress, which might explain why the author reacted that way. However, the sister's behavior could be affecting the author's living environment, so there's a valid concern there.\n\nBut the key point is whether the author is in the wrong. The sister's actions are causing tension, and the author's frustration led to a confrontational statement. While the author's intent might have been to help, the approach was possibly too abrupt. The sister might feel unsupported, leading to her avoidance. \n\nIn such cases, it's often better to approach with compassion and encourage seeking professional help if needed. Telling someone to get over it can be invalidating. So, the answer might lean towards A (the author is in the wrong) because the method was harsh even if the concern was valid. However, the living situation complicates things. But the main issue is the way the author expressed their frustration rather than the frustration itself. So, I think the answer is A.\n"
