It's a situation I can't do anything about because my parents own the house and rent it out to me. There is no formal lease, or rental agreement, so I'm kind of stuck with her. Since she moved in last summer, she just mopes around the house, like a dark cloud. Her fiance broke up with her right at the beginning of last year. She has not dated anyone since and says she's done with dating. She is extremely bitter and negative at all times. She stalks her ex's social media profiles and apparently his new girlfriend is pregnant. My sister is extremely salty about this since she found out... last month. She's been on a tear about it for a month. I know she had a miscarriage and all when they were together, but come on. Finally I told her flat out she needed to move the fuck on and get over it. She has been avoiding me since. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're at fault for telling their sister to move on from a breakup that happened over a year ago. The sister is living with them, and the situation is complicated because the parents own the house. The sister has been moping since the breakup, hasn't dated since, and is bitter and negative, especially after finding out her ex's new girlfriend is pregnant. The author told her to \"get over it,\" and now the sister is avoiding them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Breakups can be really hard, and dealing with a family member who's still upset a year later might be stressful. The author might feel frustrated with the sister's constant negativity affecting the household. But is it right to tell someone to \"get over\" something that's been ongoing for a year? Maybe the sister is still grieving and needs support instead of pressure to move on. The author's approach might have been harsh, even if their intention was to help. However, the sister's behavior\u2014stalking the ex, being bitter\u2014might have pushed the author to say something. \n\nAlso, the living situation adds stress. The author can't move out, so they're stuck with the sister's negativity. The sister's behavior is affecting the author's living environment, which is a valid concern. But the way the author expressed their frustration might have been too abrupt. Instead of telling the sister to \"get over it,\" maybe offering support or suggesting professional help would have been better. \n\nOn the other hand, the sister's reaction to the ex's new girlfriend being pregnant and her own past miscarriage might mean she's dealing with unresolved trauma. The author might not have considered that their words could be dismissive of her pain. So, while the author has valid reasons for feeling frustrated, the way they handled it could be seen as insensitive. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The author's frustration is understandable, but their approach might have been unhelpful. The sister's behavior is problematic, but the author's response might not be the best way to address it. So, the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong (A) because they dismissed the sister's feelings, even if unintentionally. However, some might argue the author was justified in trying to improve their living situation. The key here is whether the author's actions were inconsiderate of the sister's emotional state versus their own stress. I think the author's message could be seen as harsh, hence they might be at fault.\n"
