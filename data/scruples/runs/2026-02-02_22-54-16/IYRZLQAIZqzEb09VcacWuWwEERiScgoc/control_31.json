It's a situation I can't do anything about because my parents own the house and rent it out to me. There is no formal lease, or rental agreement, so I'm kind of stuck with her. Since she moved in last summer, she just mopes around the house, like a dark cloud. Her fiance broke up with her right at the beginning of last year. She has not dated anyone since and says she's done with dating. She is extremely bitter and negative at all times. She stalks her ex's social media profiles and apparently his new girlfriend is pregnant. My sister is extremely salty about this since she found out... last month. She's been on a tear about it for a month. I know she had a miscarriage and all when they were together, but come on. Finally I told her flat out she needed to move the fuck on and get over it. She has been avoiding me since. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through the scenario again. The author has a sister living with them, and there's no lease or formal agreement because the parents own the house. The sister's breakup was over a year ago, but she's still really bitter and negative. The author told her to get over it, and now the sister is avoiding them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The sister has been living with the author for a while, and the breakup happened over a year ago. The sister's behavior is described as moping, being a dark cloud, stalking her ex's social media, and being extremely negative. The author, frustrated with the constant negativity, told her to move on. The sister is now avoiding the author.\n\nFrom a psychological standpoint, it's common for people to have different processing times for breakups. Some might take longer than others, especially if there were significant events like a miscarriage involved. The sister's reaction might be a sign of unresolved grief or depression. However, the author is living in the same house and might be feeling the impact of the sister's negative behavior on their own mental health and living environment.\n\nBut is the author in the wrong? The key here is the approach. Telling someone directly to \"get over it\" can come off as dismissive and lacking empathy. It might invalidate the sister's feelings, making her feel unheard. Even if the author is frustrated, the method of addressing the issue could be more constructive. Instead of demanding she move on, suggesting support or offering to help her find ways to cope might be better. The sister's avoidance after the confrontation suggests that the approach might have been harsh.\n\nAlso, considering the living situation, the author might not have the authority to set boundaries without a formal agreement. However, they have a right to a peaceful living environment. The challenge is balancing their own needs with their sister's emotional state.\n\nAnother angle is the sister's responsibility. If she's been moping for over a year, she might need to seek professional help. But it's not the author's role to force her to do so. The author's frustration is understandable, but the way they expressed it could be problematic.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the author might not be in the wrong for expressing their frustration, but their approach was likely not the best. The sister's ongoing behavior is not healthy, but the author's direct and possibly harsh response could have worsened the situation. There's a middle ground where the author could have approached the sister with more empathy and suggested support rather than demanding change.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the answer might be that the author is not entirely in the wrong (B), but their method could be improved. However, depending on cultural or personal values, some might argue the author is in the wrong (A) for not being more supportive. But given the context, I think B is the more balanced answer.\n"
