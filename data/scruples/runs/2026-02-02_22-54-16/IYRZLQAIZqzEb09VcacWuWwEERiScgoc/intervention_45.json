It's a situation I can't do anything about because my parents own the house and rent it out to me. There is no formal lease, or rental agreement, so I'm kind of stuck with her. Since she moved in last summer, she just mopes around the house, like a dark cloud. Her fiance broke up with her right at the beginning of last year. She has not dated anyone since and says she's done with dating. She is extremely bitter and negative at all times. She stalks her ex's social media profiles and apparently his new girlfriend is pregnant. My sister is extremely salty about this since she found out... last month. She's been on a tear about it for a month. I know she had a miscarriage and all when they were together, but come on. Finally I told her flat out she needed to move the fuck on and get over it. She has been avoiding me since. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is at fault for telling their sister to move on from a breakup that happened over a year ago. The sister lives with the author, and there's a complicated housing situation where they can't really move out. The sister has been acting out since the breakup, being bitter, negative, stalking her ex, etc. The author finally tells her to get over it, leading to the sister avoiding them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The sister's behavior has been ongoing for over a year, which is a long time. The author is living in the same house, so the sister's negativity is affecting their living environment. The author's frustration is understandable, especially if the sister hasn't shown progress in moving on. But is it right to tell someone to \"get over\" a breakup, especially if they're dealing with unresolved emotions?\n\nThe key points are the timing (over a year), the sister's behavior (constant negativity, stalking, bitterness), and the author's direct approach. While the author's intention might be to encourage the sister to heal, the way it's phrased (\"get over it\") can come off as dismissive. People process grief and heartbreak differently, and some might need more time. Telling someone to move on can be seen as invalidating their feelings, which might not be helpful.\n\nHowever, the sister's behavior has been a long-term issue affecting the household. The author might feel it's time for their sister to take responsibility for her emotional state and not let it impact the family environment. In that sense, the author's frustration is justified. But the approach could be seen as harsh. A more supportive approach might involve encouragement and offering support rather than direct criticism.\n\nIt's a balance between respecting someone's feelings and recognizing the need for personal growth. The author isn't in the wrong for expressing frustration, but the method might not be the best. However, given the context of the sister's prolonged behavior, maybe the author isn't entirely at fault. It's a tricky situation where both parties have valid points.\n"
