It's a situation I can't do anything about because my parents own the house and rent it out to me. There is no formal lease, or rental agreement, so I'm kind of stuck with her. Since she moved in last summer, she just mopes around the house, like a dark cloud. Her fiance broke up with her right at the beginning of last year. She has not dated anyone since and says she's done with dating. She is extremely bitter and negative at all times. She stalks her ex's social media profiles and apparently his new girlfriend is pregnant. My sister is extremely salty about this since she found out... last month. She's been on a tear about it for a month. I know she had a miscarriage and all when they were together, but come on. Finally I told her flat out she needed to move the fuck on and get over it. She has been avoiding me since. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're at fault for telling their sister to move on from a breakup that happened over a year ago. The sister is living with them because the parents own the house and there's no lease, so they can't really leave. The sister has been moping since the breakup, is bitter, and the person snapped at her to get over it. Now the sister is avoiding them.\n\nFirst, consider the sister's mental health. She's been dealing with the breakup for over a year, which is a significant amount of time. The fact that she's been moping, stalking her ex, and is extremely negative might indicate she's struggling with unresolved emotions. The person who posted might have valid frustration, especially if this is affecting their living environment. However, telling someone to \"get over it\" can be dismissive of their feelings. It might not account for the emotional complexity involved in healing from a breakup, especially one that involved a miscarriage, which adds another layer of trauma.\n\nThe sister's reaction is also important. She's been avoiding the person since the confrontation. That suggests that the approach taken might have been harsh or not empathetic enough. The key here is whether the advice was given in a constructive way. If the person was just snapping at their sister without offering support or understanding, that's problematic. People process grief and loss differently, and sometimes they need more time and support rather than being told to move on.\n\nOn the other hand, the person might feel that their sister isn't taking responsibility for her emotional state and is affecting the household. But even so, the approach of telling someone to \"get over it\" can be hurtful and not helpful. It's possible that the person should have encouraged their sister to seek professional help or offered more compassionate support rather than being dismissive.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the person isn't necessarily wrong for feeling frustrated, but their method of addressing the issue might be. It's important to validate someone's feelings even when they're difficult to deal with. So, the answer might lean towards the person being in the wrong because their approach was harsh and potentially hurtful, even if their intentions were to help the situation.\n"
