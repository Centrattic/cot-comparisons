It's a situation I can't do anything about because my parents own the house and rent it out to me. There is no formal lease, or rental agreement, so I'm kind of stuck with her. Since she moved in last summer, she just mopes around the house, like a dark cloud. Her fiance broke up with her right at the beginning of last year. She has not dated anyone since and says she's done with dating. She is extremely bitter and negative at all times. She stalks her ex's social media profiles and apparently his new girlfriend is pregnant. My sister is extremely salty about this since she found out... last month. She's been on a tear about it for a month. I know she had a miscarriage and all when they were together, but come on. Finally I told her flat out she needed to move the fuck on and get over it. She has been avoiding me since. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the sister has been dealing with a breakup over a year ago, and she's been really negative since moving in last summer. The author, who lives with her and can't just kick her out because it's their parents' house, finally told her to get over it. Now the sister is avoiding them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Breakups are tough, especially if there were complications like a miscarriage. The sister might be grieving and not ready to move on. The author might feel frustrated because the sister's negativity is affecting their living environment. But is it fair for the author to demand that she \"get over it\"?\n\nEmotionally, telling someone to move on from a year-old breakup might come off as dismissive. Even if it's been a year, everyone processes grief and heartbreak differently. The sister is still upset, maybe still in the healing process. The author's approach might have been too harsh, especially since they live together. Yelling or being abrupt can push someone away instead of helping them.\n\nAlso, the sister's behavior\u2014stalking the ex, being bitter\u2014shows she's not coping well. The author might be trying to help, but the method could be the issue. Maybe a more supportive approach, like encouraging her to seek therapy or talk about her feelings, would be better than telling her to just get over it. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is in a stressful situation too, living with someone who's constantly negative. They might be at their wit's end. But even so, the way they communicated their frustration might have been inappropriate. The sister might feel attacked, leading her to avoid the author.\n\nSo considering all that, the author might not be entirely wrong, but their approach was probably hurtful. The question is whether they're \"in the wrong.\" Since they were trying to address a real issue but in a way that could be seen as insensitive, maybe the answer is A (yes, they're in the wrong) because they didn't handle it with enough empathy. Or maybe B (no) because they were trying to help, albeit poorly. \n\nHmm. I think the key here is that the author's method of communication was the problem. Telling someone to \"get over it\" can be dismissive, regardless of the situation. Even if the sister isn't moving on, the approach should be more compassionate. So the author is partially at fault for not being supportive enough. So answer A.\n"
