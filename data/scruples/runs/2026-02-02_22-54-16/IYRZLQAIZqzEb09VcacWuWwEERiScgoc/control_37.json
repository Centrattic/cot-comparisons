It's a situation I can't do anything about because my parents own the house and rent it out to me. There is no formal lease, or rental agreement, so I'm kind of stuck with her. Since she moved in last summer, she just mopes around the house, like a dark cloud. Her fiance broke up with her right at the beginning of last year. She has not dated anyone since and says she's done with dating. She is extremely bitter and negative at all times. She stalks her ex's social media profiles and apparently his new girlfriend is pregnant. My sister is extremely salty about this since she found out... last month. She's been on a tear about it for a month. I know she had a miscarriage and all when they were together, but come on. Finally I told her flat out she needed to move the fuck on and get over it. She has been avoiding me since. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person (AITA) is in the wrong for telling their sister to get over a breakup from over a year ago.\n\nFirst, context: the sister lives with the author, no formal lease, so the author can't just kick her out. The sister's ex broke up with her over a year ago, she's been moping, bitter, stalking his social media, and now his new girlfriend is pregnant. The sister is upset, had a miscarriage during the relationship. The author told her to move on, and now the sister is avoiding them.\n\nHmm. The question is whether the author is at fault. Let's break it down.\n\nThe sister has been dealing with the breakup for over a year, which is a long time. But she's still clearly struggling, showing negative behaviors. The author is frustrated and told her to get over it. But is that the right approach?\n\nOn one hand, the author is in a difficult situation, living in the same house with someone who's emotionally affecting them. They might feel helpless and think that pushing the sister to move on is the only way. But on the other hand, telling someone to \"get over\" a breakup, especially a year later, can be very hurtful. It might invalidate her feelings. Even if the sister is being negative, the author's approach might be too harsh without offering support.\n\nThe sister's behavior (stalking, bitterness) isn't healthy, but the author's response was to tell her to \"move the fuck on.\" That's pretty direct and might come off as dismissive. The author might not realize that their sister is still in pain and needs support rather than criticism. The sister's avoidance now suggests the author's words hurt.\n\nBut maybe the author is just frustrated and wants peace in the household. However, the sister's emotional state is complex, with a past miscarriage and ongoing grief. The author's approach might not be the right way to handle it. Instead of telling her to get over it, they might need to encourage her to seek help or talk to someone, but that's not what they did.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author's approach was probably not the best. They might be in the wrong for not being more empathetic and for not addressing the sister's need for support instead of just pushing her to move on. So the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
