It's a situation I can't do anything about because my parents own the house and rent it out to me. There is no formal lease, or rental agreement, so I'm kind of stuck with her. Since she moved in last summer, she just mopes around the house, like a dark cloud. Her fiance broke up with her right at the beginning of last year. She has not dated anyone since and says she's done with dating. She is extremely bitter and negative at all times. She stalks her ex's social media profiles and apparently his new girlfriend is pregnant. My sister is extremely salty about this since she found out... last month. She's been on a tear about it for a month. I know she had a miscarriage and all when they were together, but come on. Finally I told her flat out she needed to move the fuck on and get over it. She has been avoiding me since. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong (AITA). The situation is about the writer telling their sister to get over a breakup from over a year ago. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The sister is still living with the writer, and there's no lease or formal agreement, so she can't be kicked out. The sister's fianc\u00e9 broke up with her a year ago, and she's been moping ever since. She hasn't dated anyone, is bitter, negative, stalks the ex, and is upset about his new girlfriend's pregnancy. The writer finally told her to get over it, leading to the sister avoiding them.\n\nNow, considering the sister's behavior: she's been dealing with emotional issues for over a year. Breaking up is hard, and some people take longer to heal. Stalking the ex and his new relationship might indicate unresolved feelings or emotional distress. The writer's frustration is understandable, especially sharing a home where the sister's negativity affects their living environment.\n\nBut how long should one expect someone to \"get over\" a breakup? A year can be a reasonable time for some, but others might need longer. The sister's mention of a miscarriage adds another layer\u2014grief from loss can complicate the breakup. The writer's direct approach might be seen as harsh, especially if the sister is still in a vulnerable state. However, the writer's own living conditions are affected, so they have valid concerns about their own well-being and shared space.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the sister's behavior might be unhealthily prolonged, but the writer's response could be perceived as dismissive. The key is whether the writer's comment was supportive or hurtful. Telling someone to \"get over it\" without offering support can come off as uncaring. However, the sister's actions (stalking, negativity) are impacting the writer's life, so the writer might feel justified in setting boundaries.\n\nConsidering all factors, the answer isn't black and white. The sister's behavior is problematic, but the writer's approach might have been too abrupt. The writer could have sought to understand or support the sister instead of directly telling them to move on. So, maybe the writer is partially at fault for not handling it with more empathy.\n"
