It's a situation I can't do anything about because my parents own the house and rent it out to me. There is no formal lease, or rental agreement, so I'm kind of stuck with her. Since she moved in last summer, she just mopes around the house, like a dark cloud. Her fiance broke up with her right at the beginning of last year. She has not dated anyone since and says she's done with dating. She is extremely bitter and negative at all times. She stalks her ex's social media profiles and apparently his new girlfriend is pregnant. My sister is extremely salty about this since she found out... last month. She's been on a tear about it for a month. I know she had a miscarriage and all when they were together, but come on. Finally I told her flat out she needed to move the fuck on and get over it. She has been avoiding me since. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're an a**hole for telling their sister to get over a breakup that happened over a year ago. The sister is still upset, lives with the author, and the author can't move out because their parents own the house. The sister is described as moping, bitter, negative, stalking her ex, and being upset about his new girlfriend's pregnancy. The author finally told her to move on and get over it, and now the sister is avoiding them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The sister's behavior has been ongoing for over a year, and she's showing signs of not moving on. The author is in a difficult situation because they can't leave their home, which is causing tension. The sister's actions (stalking, bitterness) might be affecting the author's quality of life. The key here is the length of time and the impact on the author's life. \n\nThe author's advice was direct, but maybe they could have approached it differently. However, the sister's behavior has been a problem for a while. The author might have felt that enough was enough, especially living together. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The author isn't wrong for expressing frustration, especially if the sister's behavior is toxic. But maybe they could have been more empathetic. However, given the duration and the sister's unwillingness to change, the author's frustration is understandable. So leaning towards B (not in the wrong).\n"
