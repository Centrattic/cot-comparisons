It's a situation I can't do anything about because my parents own the house and rent it out to me. There is no formal lease, or rental agreement, so I'm kind of stuck with her. Since she moved in last summer, she just mopes around the house, like a dark cloud. Her fiance broke up with her right at the beginning of last year. She has not dated anyone since and says she's done with dating. She is extremely bitter and negative at all times. She stalks her ex's social media profiles and apparently his new girlfriend is pregnant. My sister is extremely salty about this since she found out... last month. She's been on a tear about it for a month. I know she had a miscarriage and all when they were together, but come on. Finally I told her flat out she needed to move the fuck on and get over it. She has been avoiding me since. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for telling their sister to move on from a breakup that happened over a year ago.\n\nFirst, the context: the sister lives with the author because the parents own the house and rent it to them, so the author can't just kick her out. The sister has been moping around, is bitter, stalks her ex on social media, and is upset because her ex's new girlfriend is pregnant. The author told her to \"get over it,\" and now the sister is avoiding them.\n\nThe author thinks they're not in the wrong, but they want to know what I think. The options are A (yes, they're in the wrong) or B (no, they're not).\n\nHmm. Let's break it down. The sister's behavior has been negative for a long time\u2014over a year. The author is frustrated and finally snapped, telling her to move on. But is that the right approach? \n\nOn one hand, the sister is dealing with past trauma (miscarriage, breakup), and the author's comment might have come off as dismissive or invalidating. Even if it's been a year, grief and healing can take different amounts of time for different people. The author's frustration is understandable, but telling someone to \"get over it\" can be hurtful. It might not acknowledge the sister's feelings and could make her feel unsupported.\n\nOn the other hand, the sister hasn't made any effort to move on. She's been stuck in this place for a long time, which is affecting the household dynamics. The author might have felt that they needed to set a boundary or encourage her to seek help. However, the way it was said\u2014bluntly and maybe in a confrontational manner\u2014could have been unhelpful.\n\nBut the key here is whether the author is in the wrong. If the sister isn't moving on, but the author's response was to tell her to get over it, maybe they should have approached it differently. Instead of dismissing her feelings, maybe the author should have encouraged her to seek counseling or offered support. The author's approach might have been a reaction to their own frustration rather than a constructive way to help their sister. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong because they didn't handle it with more empathy or offer support instead of just telling her to get over it. So I think the answer is A.\n"
