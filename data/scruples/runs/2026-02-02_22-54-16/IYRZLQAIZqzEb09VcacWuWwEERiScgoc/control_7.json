It's a situation I can't do anything about because my parents own the house and rent it out to me. There is no formal lease, or rental agreement, so I'm kind of stuck with her. Since she moved in last summer, she just mopes around the house, like a dark cloud. Her fiance broke up with her right at the beginning of last year. She has not dated anyone since and says she's done with dating. She is extremely bitter and negative at all times. She stalks her ex's social media profiles and apparently his new girlfriend is pregnant. My sister is extremely salty about this since she found out... last month. She's been on a tear about it for a month. I know she had a miscarriage and all when they were together, but come on. Finally I told her flat out she needed to move the fuck on and get over it. She has been avoiding me since. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The question is whether the sister (the person who wrote the post) is at fault for telling her sibling to get over a breakup that happened over a year ago. The scenario involves two sisters living together, with the older sister being stuck in this situation because the parents own the house. The younger sister is still grieving a breakup from the previous year, becoming very negative, and the older sister finally snaps, telling her to move on.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the emotional aspect. The younger sister is dealing with a breakup that's over a year old, which might not be an unusually long time for someone to still feel hurt. However, the sister's behavior is affecting the household environment\u2014being a dark cloud, not dating, being bitter, stalking ex's social media, and reacting strongly to his new girlfriend being pregnant. The older sister is frustrated and finally confronts her, leading to the younger sister avoiding her.\n\nFrom a psychological standpoint, it's not uncommon for people to take varying amounts of time to recover from a breakup, especially if there were traumatic elements like a miscarriage. The older sister's frustration is understandable, but the way she addressed it\u2014telling her to \"get over it\" and using a harsh tone (\"move the fuck on\")\u2014might have been dismissive of her sister's ongoing pain. This could be seen as invalidating her emotions, which is generally not helpful in supporting someone through grief.\n\nOn the other hand, living in the same house without a lease and having to deal with the negative behavior day-to-day can create a stressful environment. The older sister might feel that the younger sister is not making an effort to improve the situation, hence her outburst. However, the approach taken was confrontational rather than supportive. Instead of pushing her sister to move on quickly, offering support or seeking ways to help her cope might have been more constructive.\n\nThe key here is whether the author was in the wrong. If the sister's advice was given in a hurtful manner without considering her sister's emotional state, then the author is partly at fault. But if the sister's behavior was genuinely affecting the household dynamics in a significant way, there's some context that might mitigate the blame. However, the main issue is the tone and approach used. The author didn't consider that her sister might still need time and support rather than being told to \"get over it.\" \n\nSo, considering all these factors, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong because she responded in a dismissive and harsh way without addressing the underlying issues or providing support.\n"
