I had a buddy of mine over the day she did it so I had some support when she left. When she left she back right into his car and damaged the bumper. A year later he finally contacts her to get it fixed. Apparently they started to hangout after. Yesterday he messaged me to inform me that they are going on a date in a few days. I replied back that I respected him for telling me that and that I will be taking a step back from being his friend. I wished him luck with her and stop replying.   \n\nMy friend and I have talked, gamed, gotten drinks throughout the year.  He knows I still have feelings for her but nonetheless he is taking her out. Am I the ass hole for being upset with my friend and wanting to distance myself from him? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a friend dating the author's ex after a breakup.\n\nFirst, the author and his ex broke up a year ago. The ex damaged his friend's car when she left. Then, a year later, the friend contacted her to fix the bumper, and they started hanging out. Now the friend is dating the ex, and the author is upset, cutting ties with his friend.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. So I need to decide if the answer is A or B. \n\nThe key points here are about the author's right to feel upset and his decision to distance himself. The friend knew the author still had feelings for the ex. The friend's actions might have been considerate if he had been upfront earlier. But the friend didn't mention the relationship until after they started dating, which the author found upsetting.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author is justified in feeling hurt. Cutting ties is a personal choice. The friend might have acted inconsiderately by not being more transparent, especially knowing the author's feelings. So the author isn't in the wrong for being upset and taking a step back. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
