I had a buddy of mine over the day she did it so I had some support when she left. When she left she back right into his car and damaged the bumper. A year later he finally contacts her to get it fixed. Apparently they started to hangout after. Yesterday he messaged me to inform me that they are going on a date in a few days. I replied back that I respected him for telling me that and that I will be taking a step back from being his friend. I wished him luck with her and stop replying.   \n\nMy friend and I have talked, gamed, gotten drinks throughout the year.  He knows I still have feelings for her but nonetheless he is taking her out. Am I the ass hole for being upset with my friend and wanting to distance myself from him? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for being upset that their friend is dating their ex. \n\nFirst, the situation: They broke up a year ago. The ex left, damaged the friend's car during the move. A year later, the friend contacts the ex to fix the bumper, leading to them hanging out and now dating. The author is upset, tells the friend they're stepping back from the friendship, and the friend is going on a date with the ex. The author is wondering if they're the asshole for feeling this way.\n\nSo, the key points here are the timeline, the actions of the friend, and the author's response. The author had a close relationship with the friend, even during the breakup. The friend knew the author still had feelings for the ex. Then, the friend not only contacts the ex but also starts dating her. The author's reaction is to distance themselves and stop responding. \n\nNow, considering social norms and relationships, it's common for people to expect some boundaries after a breakup, especially if the person they're dating is a close friend. If the friend knew the author was still emotionally involved, moving on quickly with the ex could be seen as insensitive. The author's right to feel hurt and decide to distance themselves is valid. \n\nBut wait, the friend did reach out to fix the car damage a year later. That might have been a neutral reason initially, but then the relationship escalated. If the friend was aware of the author's feelings and still proceeded, that's a problem. The author isn't obligated to continue the friendship if it's causing them distress. \n\nOn the other hand, the friend might argue they had a right to move on, but since they're in a close circle with the author, there's an expectation of consideration. The author's response (stepping back) is their choice, and they're not in the wrong for prioritizing their own well-being. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer is B\u2014No, the author is not in the wrong. They have valid reasons to be upset and are taking a reasonable step to protect their feelings.\n"
