I had a buddy of mine over the day she did it so I had some support when she left. When she left she back right into his car and damaged the bumper. A year later he finally contacts her to get it fixed. Apparently they started to hangout after. Yesterday he messaged me to inform me that they are going on a date in a few days. I replied back that I respected him for telling me that and that I will be taking a step back from being his friend. I wished him luck with her and stop replying.   \n\nMy friend and I have talked, gamed, gotten drinks throughout the year.  He knows I still have feelings for her but nonetheless he is taking her out. Am I the ass hole for being upset with my friend and wanting to distance myself from him? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for distancing themselves from a friend who is dating their ex. \n\nThe situation: They broke up a year ago. The ex left their place and damaged a friend's car. Then, the friend contacted the ex to fix the car, they started hanging out, and now the friend is dating the ex. The author is upset and cutting the friend off.\n\nFirst, the author still has feelings for the ex. The friend knew about these feelings but went ahead with the relationship. The author is reacting by stepping back from the friendship. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the friend didn't hide the dating. The author is allowed to feel hurt and decide their own boundaries. It's reasonable to distance if the friendship is causing emotional pain. The friend might have handled it differently by not dating the ex if they knew it would upset the author, but the author isn't in the wrong for their reaction. So the answer is B.\n"
