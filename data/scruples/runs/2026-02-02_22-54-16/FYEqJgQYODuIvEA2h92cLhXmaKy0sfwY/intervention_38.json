I had a buddy of mine over the day she did it so I had some support when she left. When she left she back right into his car and damaged the bumper. A year later he finally contacts her to get it fixed. Apparently they started to hangout after. Yesterday he messaged me to inform me that they are going on a date in a few days. I replied back that I respected him for telling me that and that I will be taking a step back from being his friend. I wished him luck with her and stop replying.   \n\nMy friend and I have talked, gamed, gotten drinks throughout the year.  He knows I still have feelings for her but nonetheless he is taking her out. Am I the ass hole for being upset with my friend and wanting to distance myself from him? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author had a breakup a year ago with their ex, who moved out. The author had a friend over when the ex left, and the ex accidentally damaged the friend's car. A year later, the friend contacts the ex to fix the bumper, and they start hanging out, leading to a date. The author finds out and decides to distance themselves from the friend. The author is asking if they're the asshole for being upset and cutting off the friend.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the dynamics here. The author and the friend had been friends for a year after the breakup, even though the author still had feelings for the ex. The friend knew about these feelings. Then the friend pursued a relationship with the ex, which the author found out about. The author feels hurt and decides to step back from the friendship.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no, not in the wrong). \n\nLet me break it down. The key points are:\n\n1. The ex damaged the friend's car a year ago. The friend waited a year to address it, which seems odd. Maybe the friend had some feelings for the ex all along, or maybe they just wanted to fix the damage. But starting a relationship after such a long time could be seen as taking advantage of the ex's emotional state if the author was still upset.\n\n2. The friend knew the author still had feelings for the ex. If the friend was aware of this, pursuing a relationship with the ex might be considered insensitive or taking advantage of the situation. The author might feel betrayed because they trusted the friend to respect their feelings.\n\n3. The author's response is to distance themselves from the friend. It's a personal choice, but is it justified? The friend's actions could be seen as crossing a line, especially if the author felt the friend was being disloyal or opportunistic.\n\n4. The timing of the friend fixing the bumper after a year is suspicious. Maybe the friend used the car damage as an excuse to get in touch with the ex. If the friend had other intentions, that could be manipulative.\n\nOn the other hand, the friend might have had no ill intentions, just wanted to fix the car and then developed feelings. The author's reaction might be seen as overreacting if the friend didn't do anything wrong. However, the friend knew about the author's feelings and still pursued the ex, which could be problematic.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's about intentions and actions. If the friend knowingly pursued the ex while being aware of the author's feelings, that could be the friend's fault. The author's right to be upset is valid, especially if the friendship was important to them. Choosing to distance oneself is their prerogative, even if it's hurtful.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. The friend's actions are questionable, and the author has the right to protect their emotional well-being by stepping back. The answer should be B.\n"
