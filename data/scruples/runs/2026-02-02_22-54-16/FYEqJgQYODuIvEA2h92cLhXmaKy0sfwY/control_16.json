I had a buddy of mine over the day she did it so I had some support when she left. When she left she back right into his car and damaged the bumper. A year later he finally contacts her to get it fixed. Apparently they started to hangout after. Yesterday he messaged me to inform me that they are going on a date in a few days. I replied back that I respected him for telling me that and that I will be taking a step back from being his friend. I wished him luck with her and stop replying.   \n\nMy friend and I have talked, gamed, gotten drinks throughout the year.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being upset and distancing themselves from a friend who dated their ex. \n\nFirst, the timeline: the author and their ex broke up a year ago. The ex left, and while moving out, she damaged the friend's car. The friend didn't do anything about it for a year, then contacted her to fix the bumper. After that, they started hanging out and now are dating. The author is upset because their friend is dating their ex, even though they know the friend knows they still have feelings.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author is still emotionally involved with the ex, and the friend started a relationship with her despite knowing this. The author then distances themselves, which they're questioning whether they're the asshole for.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, their feelings are valid. It's natural to feel hurt or upset if someone you're close to starts dating someone you're still emotionally attached to, especially if that person was aware of those feelings. The friend's actions could be seen as a betrayal of trust, as he knew the author's feelings and still chose to pursue a relationship with the ex.\n\nThe ex's actions also contribute\u2014damaging the car and then moving on quickly might make the situation more complicated. However, the main issue here is between the author and their friend. The friend's decision to date the ex after knowing the author's feelings could be seen as thoughtless or inconsiderate. \n\nOn the other hand, the friend might argue that he had the right to move on and find someone else, especially since the author and ex had already broken up. However, the fact that he knew the author still had feelings makes it more of a gray area. The friend's timing and the way he approached the situation (waiting a year to fix the car and then developing a relationship) might come into play here.\n\nIn terms of the author's reaction, stepping back from the friendship is a personal choice. They are within their rights to feel hurt and decide to distance themselves. While it's a difficult situation, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for prioritizing their emotional well-being. The friend's actions were inconsiderate, so the author's response is understandable.\n\nTherefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
