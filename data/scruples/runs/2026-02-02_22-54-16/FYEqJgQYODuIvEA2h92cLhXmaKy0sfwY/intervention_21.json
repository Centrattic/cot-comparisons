I had a buddy of mine over the day she did it so I had some support when she left. When she left she back right into his car and damaged the bumper. A year later he finally contacts her to get it fixed. Apparently they started to hangout after. Yesterday he messaged me to inform me that they are going on a date in a few days. I replied back that I respected him for telling me that and that I will be taking a step back from being his friend. I wished him luck with her and stop replying.   \n\nMy friend and I have talked, gamed, gotten drinks throughout the year.  He knows I still have feelings for her but nonetheless he is taking her out. Am I the ass hole for being upset with my friend and wanting to distance myself from him? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being upset with their friend who dated their ex. \n\nFirst, the timeline: They broke up a year ago. The ex left, damaged the friend's car, and then the friend waited a year before contacting her to fix the bumper. Then they started hanging out and now they're dating. The author is upset that their friend is dating their ex, even though they had mentioned still having feelings for her. The author decided to distance themselves.\n\nHmm, so the friend knew about the author's feelings. If he knew and still went ahead with dating the ex, maybe he's at fault here. The author isn't doing anything wrong by feeling hurt. It's reasonable to want space if someone you're close to is dating someone you're still emotionally connected to. \n\nThe friend waited a year to contact the ex, which might be a red flag. Maybe he was waiting for the author to move on, but that's not his responsibility. The author's reaction is about their own feelings, which are valid. Cutting back on the friendship is their choice. \n\nSo, I think the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
