I had a buddy of mine over the day she did it so I had some support when she left. When she left she back right into his car and damaged the bumper. A year later he finally contacts her to get it fixed. Apparently they started to hangout after. Yesterday he messaged me to inform me that they are going on a date in a few days. I replied back that I respected him for telling me that and that I will be taking a step back from being his friend. I wished him luck with her and stop replying.   \n\nMy friend and I have talked, gamed, gotten drinks throughout the year.  He knows I still have feelings for her but nonetheless he is taking her out. Am I the ass hole for being upset with my friend and wanting to distance myself from him? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in the situation they described. The scenario is about a person whose ex is dating their friend. The ex broke up a year ago, and during the breakup, the ex damaged the friend's car. The friend waited a year to contact the ex to fix the bumper, and then they started hanging out and eventually dating. The author is upset and decided to distance themselves from the friend by cutting off contact.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is still having feelings for their ex, which might make the situation more emotional. The friend, knowing about these feelings, still decides to date the ex. There's also the initial incident with the car damage, which might have been a point of contention between the friend and the ex. The friend waited a year to address the bumper issue, which could either be seen as giving space or as avoiding the issue. \n\nNow, the author is upset and cutting ties with the friend. The friend informed the author about the date, and the author is respecting that communication but choosing to step back. The author is asking if they're the one in the wrong (A or B). \n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, the friend's actions could be seen as insensitive if they knew the author still had feelings for the ex. However, since the breakup was a year ago and the author was still friends with the ex's friend, the friend might have felt it was a closure issue. The author's right to be upset is valid because they're dealing with emotional pain. Deciding to cut off a friend over this is a personal choice. \n\nIn such situations, it's about personal boundaries. The author is not obligated to remain friends if they feel their feelings aren't respected. The friend might have a right to move on, but the timing and the knowledge of the author's feelings could be a point of contention. \n\nConsidering all this, the author is not in the wrong for being upset and choosing to distance themselves. Their reaction is a valid response to their emotional situation. The friend might not be at fault either, but the author's choice to step back is understandable. So the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
