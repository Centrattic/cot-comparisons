I had a buddy of mine over the day she did it so I had some support when she left. When she left she back right into his car and damaged the bumper. A year later he finally contacts her to get it fixed. Apparently they started to hangout after. Yesterday he messaged me to inform me that they are going on a date in a few days. I replied back that I respected him for telling me that and that I will be taking a step back from being his friend. I wished him luck with her and stop replying.   \n\nMy friend and I have talked, gamed, gotten drinks throughout the year.  He knows I still have feelings for her but nonetheless he is taking her out. Am I the ass hole for being upset with my friend and wanting to distance myself from him? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being upset that their friend is dating their ex. The situation is that they broke up a year ago, the ex left and damaged the friend's car, then the friend and ex started hanging out after a year. The friend told the author about the date, and the author decided to distance themselves.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the timeline. They were in a relationship a year ago, so there's been a significant amount of time. The author still has feelings for the ex, which is important. The friend, who was a buddy of the author, ended up with the ex. The author feels hurt and is cutting ties with the friend. \n\nThe key points here are the author's emotional state. They mention still having feelings for their ex, which makes the situation more personal. The friend knew about these feelings but still pursued the ex. That seems like a breach of trust if the friend was aware. The author's decision to distance themselves is a personal choice, but is it justified? \n\nFrom the friend's perspective, maybe he didn't realize how much the author still felt, or he might have thought giving the ex time to move on was right. However, the friend's actions could be seen as insensitive. The author's reaction\u2014respecting the friend for informing them but then stepping back\u2014seems like a valid response. \n\nI should also consider the damage to the car. The ex damaged the friend's car when moving out. The friend waited a year to contact her about fixing it, which might have been for financial reasons or other considerations. But after a year, maybe the author's ex had already moved on, so the friend's decision to date her despite the past incident could be a factor.\n\nThe main question is about the author's right to be upset. People have the right to feel hurt when someone close to them acts in a way that affects their emotional state. Cutting off a friend is a strong move, but if the author feels it's necessary for their well-being, it's their choice. However, the author might be overreacting if the friend didn't do anything malicious, just made a choice that the author is sensitive to.\n\nIn summary, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They're dealing with unresolved feelings, and the friend's actions, while perhaps not malicious, have caused emotional distress. The author's response is about protecting their own feelings, which is understandable. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
