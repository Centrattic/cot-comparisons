I had a buddy of mine over the day she did it so I had some support when she left. When she left she back right into his car and damaged the bumper. A year later he finally contacts her to get it fixed. Apparently they started to hangout after. Yesterday he messaged me to inform me that they are going on a date in a few days. I replied back that I respected him for telling me that and that I will be taking a step back from being his friend. I wished him luck with her and stop replying.   \n\nMy friend and I have talked, gamed, gotten drinks throughout the year.  He knows I still have feelings for her but nonetheless he is taking her out. Am I the ass hole for being upset with my friend and wanting to distance myself from him? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

The situation is that the author's friend dated their ex, which is causing the author to feel upset and leading them to distance themselves.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author and their ex broke up a year ago. The ex left, and during that time, she damaged the friend's car. A year later, the friend contacted her to fix the bumper, and they started hanging out. Now they're dating, and the friend told the author. The author is cutting contact with the friend.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. I need to assess both sides. The author's feelings are valid\u2014they're upset because their ex is dating their friend, and they still have feelings. The friend might be seen as taking advantage of the situation, especially since he knew the author had feelings for the ex. However, the friend might have thought it was just fixing the car and then became a relationship. \n\nThe author's response is to step back from the friendship. That's a personal choice, but is it wrong? Well, the friend did inform the author, so maybe the friend tried to be respectful. But the author is allowed to feel hurt and choose their boundaries. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because they're prioritizing their own emotional well-being. The friend might have made a mistake by pursuing the ex, knowing the author's feelings, but the author isn't at fault for distancing themselves. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
