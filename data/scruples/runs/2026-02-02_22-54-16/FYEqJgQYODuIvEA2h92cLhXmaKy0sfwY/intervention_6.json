I had a buddy of mine over the day she did it so I had some support when she left. When she left she back right into his car and damaged the bumper. A year later he finally contacts her to get it fixed. Apparently they started to hangout after. Yesterday he messaged me to inform me that they are going on a date in a few days. I replied back that I respected him for telling me that and that I will be taking a step back from being his friend. I wished him luck with her and stop replying.   \n\nMy friend and I have talked, gamed, gotten drinks throughout the year.  He knows I still have feelings for her but nonetheless he is taking her out. Am I the ass hole for being upset with my friend and wanting to distance myself from him? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being upset with their friend after he started dating the author's ex. The situation is that they broke up a year ago, the ex left in a way that damaged the friend's car, and then a year later the friend asked to fix it. They started hanging out again, and now the friend is going on a date with her. The author told their friend they'll step back but still wished him luck.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the moral or social implications here. The author is still having feelings for the ex, which is clear. The friend, who was a buddy during the breakup, then contacted the ex after a year to fix the bumper. That seems like a normal request for a repair, but then they started hanging out and dating. The author is upset and wants to distance themselves, but is that the right move?\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is justified in their feelings and actions. The friend did inform them, which is a good point. The author respected the friend for telling them. But then they decided to step back. The problem is, is the author being unreasonable? Well, the friend wasn't the one who caused the breakup, right? The author is upset because the friend is dating their ex, even though they broke up a year ago. Maybe the friend didn't act out of malice. The author might be dealing with unresolved feelings, which is valid. But in terms of right or wrong, the friend's actions are within his rights. He can date whoever he wants, including the author's ex. The author's reaction is about their own emotions, not necessarily something the friend did wrong. However, the friend might have known the author still had feelings and chose to date them anyway, which could be considered inconsiderate. \n\nBut the key here is that the author is choosing to distance themselves, not necessarily confronting the friend about wrongdoing. So, the question is if the author is the asshole for being upset. The author's feelings are valid, but maybe the action of cutting off the friend is a bit harsh. However, since the author is the one removing themselves from the friendship, they might not be the wrong one. The friend might be at fault for dating the ex when the author is still healing, but the author isn't in the wrong for reacting to that. So, I think the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
