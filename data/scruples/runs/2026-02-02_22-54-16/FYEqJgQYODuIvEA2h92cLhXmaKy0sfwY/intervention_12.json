I had a buddy of mine over the day she did it so I had some support when she left. When she left she back right into his car and damaged the bumper. A year later he finally contacts her to get it fixed. Apparently they started to hangout after. Yesterday he messaged me to inform me that they are going on a date in a few days. I replied back that I respected him for telling me that and that I will be taking a step back from being his friend. I wished him luck with her and stop replying.   \n\nMy friend and I have talked, gamed, gotten drinks throughout the year.  He knows I still have feelings for her but nonetheless he is taking her out. Am I the ass hole for being upset with my friend and wanting to distance myself from him? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about the author's friend dating their ex, and the author cutting off the friend.\n\nFirst, the timeline: They broke up a year ago. The ex moved out, there was a damage incident with the friend's car. Then a year later, the friend contacts the ex to fix the bumper. They start hanging out and now are dating. The author is upset and decides to distance from the friend.\n\nThe author mentions they still have feelings for the ex, but the friend is going out with her anyway. The key points here are the author's emotional response and their decision to end the friendship. \n\nI need to consider if the author's reaction is justified. The friend did tell the author, which is respectful, but the author is hurt. The author's feelings are valid; being in a situation where an ex is dating someone you're still close to can be painful. The friend might not realize the depth of the author's feelings, but he did reach out. However, the friend's actions could be seen as insensitive, especially if he knew the author still had feelings.\n\nThe author's response is to step back from the friendship. Is that unreasonable? It depends on the context. If the author is hurt and needs space, cutting off the friend makes sense. The friend might have overstepped, but the author's reaction is about their own emotional well-being. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for protecting their feelings. The friend might be at fault for pursuing the ex while knowing the author's feelings. The author's decision to distance is a personal choice, not necessarily a wrong one. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
