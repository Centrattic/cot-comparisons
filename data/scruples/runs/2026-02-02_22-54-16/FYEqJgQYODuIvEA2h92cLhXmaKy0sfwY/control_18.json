I had a buddy of mine over the day she did it so I had some support when she left. When she left she back right into his car and damaged the bumper. A year later he finally contacts her to get it fixed. Apparently they started to hangout after. Yesterday he messaged me to inform me that they are going on a date in a few days. I replied back that I respected him for telling me that and that I will be taking a step back from being his friend. I wished him luck with her and stop replying.   \n\nMy friend and I have talked, gamed, gotten drinks throughout the year.  He knows I still have feelings for her but nonetheless he is taking her out. Am I the ass hole for being upset with my friend and wanting to distance myself from him? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being upset with their friend who started dating their ex. \n\nFirst, the timeline: They broke up a year ago, and the friend was there for the user when the ex left, even getting a damaged bumper. Then, after a year, the friend contacts the ex to fix the bumper, they start hanging out, and now they're dating. The user is upset, tells the friend they're distancing, and is wondering if they're the asshole.\n\nThe key points here are the user's feelings and the friend's actions. The user still has feelings for the ex, which they mentioned to the friend. The friend knew this but still went ahead with the relationship. The user is choosing to distance themselves, which is a personal choice. \n\nIs the user in the wrong? Well, they're reacting to someone they trusted getting involved with their ex. The friend might have thought the user was over it, but if the user communicated their feelings, then the friend should have respected that. The user isn't attacking the friend, just stepping back. \n\nSo, the answer is B. The user isn't in the wrong for protecting their emotional space after being honest about their feelings.\n"
