A year later he finally contacts her to get it fixed. Apparently they started to hangout after. Yesterday he messaged me to inform me that they are going on a date in a few days.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being upset with their friend who is dating their ex. The situation is that the author and their ex broke up a year ago. The ex left in a hurry, damaging the friend's car. Then, the friend waited a year to contact the ex about fixing the bumper, and they started hanging out again. Now the friend is going on a date with the author's ex, and the author is cutting them off.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the timeline. The breakup was a year ago, which isn't that short, but maybe the author is still affected. The friend had the author over when the ex left, so the author was present. The damage to the car happened then. But the friend waited a year to reach out to the ex. That seems like a long time to wait. Maybe the friend was avoiding the author or didn't want to cause tension. However, when they did contact the ex, they started hanging out again, even though the author is still having feelings. \n\nThe author is upset and wants to distance themselves from the friend. The friend knows the author still has feelings, yet went ahead with the date. The key points here are: the friend's actions after the breakup, the timing of their contact with the ex, and the author's reaction. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the author is reacting to their friend dating their ex. If the author is still in love, it's understandable to be upset. The friend didn't ask the author's opinion before pursuing a relationship with the ex. Even though a year has passed, the author is allowed to feel hurt. However, the author is cutting off a friend because of their feelings. Is that fair? The friend might have a right to move on and date someone they're interested in. \n\nBut the friend did wait a long time to fix the car issue, which could imply they were waiting for the author to move on. However, the friend knew the author still had feelings and proceeded. That might be inconsiderate. The author's decision to distance themselves is a personal choice; they can't be forced to stay friends if they're uncomfortable. \n\nSo, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They have the right to protect their emotional well-being. The friend's actions might have been inconsiderate, but the author's response is about their own feelings, which are valid. Therefore, the answer is B (not in the wrong).\n"
