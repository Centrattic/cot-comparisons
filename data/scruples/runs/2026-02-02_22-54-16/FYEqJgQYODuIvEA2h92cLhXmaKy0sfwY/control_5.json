I had a buddy of mine over the day she did it so I had some support when she left. When she left she back right into his car and damaged the bumper. A year later he finally contacts her to get it fixed. Apparently they started to hangout after. Yesterday he messaged me to inform me that they are going on a date in a few days. I replied back that I respected him for telling me that and that I will be taking a step back from being his friend. I wished him luck with her and stop replying.   \n\nMy friend and I have talked, gamed, gotten drinks throughout the year.  He knows I still have feelings for her but nonetheless he is taking her out. Am I the ass hole for being upset with my friend and wanting to distance myself from him? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being upset with their friend who is dating their ex. The situation involves a breakup a year ago. The ex left the author's place and damaged the friend's car. A year later, the friend contacts the ex to fix the bumper, leading to them hanging out and eventually dating. The author is upset, tells the friend they'll step back, and stops replying.\n\nFirst, the author's feelings are valid. Even though a year has passed, it's natural to still have lingering feelings. The friend knew about these feelings yet pursued a relationship with the ex. That's a point against the friend. The author's reaction is to distance themselves, which is a personal choice. The question is whether this makes the author the asshole (AITA).\n\nThe key points are: the friend knew about the author's feelings, acted on the situation, and the author is reacting emotionally. The author is not in the wrong because they have the right to feel hurt and choose their boundaries. The friend, however, might have been inconsiderate. So the answer is B.\n"
