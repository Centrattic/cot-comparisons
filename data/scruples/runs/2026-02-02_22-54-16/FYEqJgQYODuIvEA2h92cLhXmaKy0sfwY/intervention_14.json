A year later he finally contacts her to get it fixed. Apparently they started to hangout after. Yesterday he messaged me to inform me that they are going on a date in a few days.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being upset that their friend is dating their ex. The situation is that the author and their ex broke up a year ago. When the ex moved out, she damaged her friend's car. A year later, the friend contacted her about fixing the bumper, they started hanging out, and now they're going on a date. The author is cutting off the friend because of this.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the timeline. The breakup was a year ago, which is a significant amount of time. The ex damaged the friend's car right after the breakup, but the friend only reached out a year later to fix it. That delay might be important. The author mentions they still have feelings for the ex, which complicates things. The friend knew about these feelings but still went ahead with the relationship.\n\nThe author's reaction is to distance themselves from the friend. They respected the friend for informing them but chose to step back. Is that reasonable? Well, it's their right to set boundaries. If the friend was aware of the author's feelings and proceeded anyway, that could be seen as insensitive. The author might feel betrayed or hurt, which is a valid emotional response. The friend's actions might have crossed a line, especially if he knew how the author felt. \n\nHowever, maybe the friend didn't realize the depth of the author's feelings. But the author states that they've talked, gamed, and gotten drinks throughout the year, implying they're close. If the friend knew about the lingering feelings, then proceeding with the ex could be seen as disloyal. The author's decision to take a step back isn't necessarily inconsiderate; they're prioritizing their own emotional well-being. \n\nOn the other hand, the friend might not be the issue. The author's ex moving on quickly after a year could be a factor, but the question is about the author's action towards their friend. The key points are the friend's awareness of the author's feelings and the author's right to set boundaries. Since the author is not confronting the ex but their friend, the focus is on the friendship's integrity. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author's reaction seems justified. They're not being unreasonable by choosing to distance themselves. The friend might be at fault here for not respecting the author's feelings. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
