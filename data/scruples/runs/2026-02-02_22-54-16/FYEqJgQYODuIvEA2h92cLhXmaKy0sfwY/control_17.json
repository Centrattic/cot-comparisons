I had a buddy of mine over the day she did it so I had some support when she left. When she left she back right into his car and damaged the bumper. A year later he finally contacts her to get it fixed. Apparently they started to hangout after. Yesterday he messaged me to inform me that they are going on a date in a few days. I replied back that I respected him for telling me that and that I will be taking a step back from being his friend. I wished him luck with her and stop replying.   \n\nMy friend and I have talked, gamed, gotten drinks throughout the year.  He knows I still have feelings for her but nonetheless he is taking her out.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being upset that their friend is dating their ex. The situation is that the author and their ex broke up a year ago, and when the ex moved out, she damaged their friend's car. A year later, the friend contacted her to fix the bumper, and they started hanging out, leading to a date. The author is upset and wants to distance themselves from the friend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author still has feelings for the ex, which the friend knows. The friend waited a year to contact the ex, but then pursued a relationship. The author feels hurt and is cutting ties. \n\nIs the friend right to pursue the ex? Well, the ex was single after the breakup. There's no law against dating someone who's ex, especially after a year. The friend might have had good intentions when contacting her about the car, but the timing and their knowledge of the author's feelings matter. Since the friend knew the author still cared, pursuing a relationship might be insensitive. \n\nThe author's reaction is to distance themselves, which is a personal choice. They aren't doing anything wrong by protecting their emotions. The friend's actions might be considered crossing a line by using the car incident as a reason to get involved with the ex, possibly out of guilt or opportunism. \n\nSo, the author isn't wrong for their reaction. The friend might have been inconsiderate, hence the author's decision to step back. Therefore, the answer should be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
