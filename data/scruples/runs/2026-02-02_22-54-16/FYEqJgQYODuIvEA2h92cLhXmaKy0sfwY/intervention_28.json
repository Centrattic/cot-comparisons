I had a buddy of mine over the day she did it so I had some support when she left. When she left she back right into his car and damaged the bumper. A year later he finally contacts her to get it fixed. Apparently they started to hangout after. Yesterday he messaged me to inform me that they are going on a date in a few days. I replied back that I respected him for telling me that and that I will be taking a step back from being his friend. I wished him luck with her and stop replying.   \n\nMy friend and I have talked, gamed, gotten drinks throughout the year.  He knows I still have feelings for her but nonetheless he is taking her out. Am I the ass hole for being upset with my friend and wanting to distance myself from him? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being upset that their friend is dating their ex. The situation is that they broke up a year ago, the ex moved out and damaged the friend's car. A year later, the friend contacted the ex to fix the car, started hanging out, and now they're on a date. The author is cutting off the friend because of this.\n\nFirst, the author's feelings are valid. It's common to feel upset if someone you care about is involved with an ex, especially if the relationship ended recently. The author mentions they still have feelings, so this is a personal matter. The friend did inform the author, which shows some respect, but the author felt the need to distance themselves. \n\nThe key points here are consent and boundaries. The friend didn't do anything illegal or unethical by dating the ex. The author's reaction is based on their own emotions, which is their prerogative. People have different coping mechanisms, and choosing to step back from a friendship is a personal choice. The author isn't wrong for prioritizing their emotional well-being.\n\nThe ex's actions might be a factor, but the question is about the friend. The friend might have known the author still had feelings, but unless there's some prior agreement about not dating exes, it's not the friend's fault. The author's response is about their own feelings, not the friend's actions being wrong.\n\nSo, the answer is B. The author isn't in the wrong because their reaction stems from their feelings and they have the right to set boundaries. The friend's actions aren't inherently wrong, just a personal choice that the author is struggling with emotionally.\n"
