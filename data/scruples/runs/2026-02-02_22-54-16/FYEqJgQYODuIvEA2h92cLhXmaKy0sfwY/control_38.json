I had a buddy of mine over the day she did it so I had some support when she left. When she left she back right into his car and damaged the bumper. A year later he finally contacts her to get it fixed. Apparently they started to hangout after. Yesterday he messaged me to inform me that they are going on a date in a few days. I replied back that I respected him for telling me that and that I will be taking a step back from being his friend. I wished him luck with her and stop replying.   \n\nMy friend and I have talked, gamed, gotten drinks throughout the year.  He knows I still have feelings for her but nonetheless he is taking her out.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking if they're the asshole (AITA) for being upset that their friend is dating their ex. The ex broke up a year ago, and the friend had a damaged bumper from when the ex left. A year later, the friend contacted her to fix the bumper, and they started hanging out, leading to a date. The user told their friend they'd step back from the friendship because they're upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the timeline. The breakup was a year ago, which is a significant amount of time. The user still has feelings for the ex, which is clear. The friend reached out to the ex about the bumper, which was a practical matter. The user feels hurt that the friend is now dating the ex, even though they've been friends all this time.\n\nIs the user in the wrong? Well, people have different boundaries. The user's reaction is understandable if they're still emotionally involved. They have the right to feel upset. The friend might not have realized how sensitive the user was, but it's the user's choice to distance themselves. However, does the friend cross a line by dating the ex? Maybe not, unless there was an agreement or boundary set post-breakup. The user hasn't mentioned any such agreement. So, the friend might not be in the wrong, but the user's reaction is their prerogative. The answer is likely B (not in the wrong) because they're allowed to prioritize their feelings and set boundaries, even if it means ending a friendship over someone dating their ex.\n"
