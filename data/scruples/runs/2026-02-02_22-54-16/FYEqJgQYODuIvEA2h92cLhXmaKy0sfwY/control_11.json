I had a buddy of mine over the day she did it so I had some support when she left. When she left she back right into his car and damaged the bumper. A year later he finally contacts her to get it fixed. Apparently they started to hangout after. Yesterday he messaged me to inform me that they are going on a date in a few days. I replied back that I respected him for telling me that and that I will be taking a step back from being his friend. I wished him luck with her and stop replying.   \n\nMy friend and I have talked, gamed, gotten drinks throughout the year.  He knows I still have feelings for her but nonetheless he is taking her out.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author had a breakup a year ago, and their friend dated their ex. The friend didn't tell them about the damaged bumper until a year later and then just started hanging out. The author is now cutting off the friend.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the timeline. The ex left a year ago, damaged the friend's car then. The friend waited a year to contact her about fixing it. Then they started hanging out and now they're dating. The author is upset because their friend is dating their ex, even though they broke up a year ago. \n\nThe author still has feelings for the ex. The friend knew this but still went ahead. The author is cutting ties with the friend. The question is whether the author is the asshole (AITA) for being upset and distancing themselves.\n\nSo, from the author's perspective, their friend is dating someone they still care about, even after a breakup. The friend didn't inform them immediately about the damaged car but waited a year. Then, after a year of not addressing it, he contacts the ex, starts hanging out, and now is dating her. The author is hurt and wants to distance. \n\nIs the author wrong? Well, the friend did reach out to the ex first. The author might feel betrayed, even if the breakup was a year ago. The friend knew the author still had feelings, so maybe the friend made a mistake by pursuing the ex. The author's reaction is understandable because they're dealing with lingering emotions. \n\nOn the other hand, the friend might have thought that a year is enough time, and maybe the author needed to move on. But since the friend knew the author's feelings, approaching the ex could be seen as crossing a line. The author's decision to step back from the friendship isn't necessarily wrong. They have the right to be upset if they feel their friend is disrespecting their emotions.\n\nThe key points are: the friend approached the ex after a year, knew about the author's feelings, and the author is reacting by distancing. The friend's actions could be seen as insensitive. The author isn't in the wrong for being upset. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
