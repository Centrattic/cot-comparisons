I had a buddy of mine over the day she did it so I had some support when she left. When she left she back right into his car and damaged the bumper. A year later he finally contacts her to get it fixed. Apparently they started to hangout after. Yesterday he messaged me to inform me that they are going on a date in a few days. I replied back that I respected him for telling me that and that I will be taking a step back from being his friend. I wished him luck with her and stop replying.   \n\nMy friend and I have talked, gamed, gotten drinks throughout the year.  He knows I still have feelings for her but nonetheless he is taking her out. Am I the ass hole for being upset with my friend and wanting to distance myself from him? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author and their ex broke up a year ago. The ex moved out, and when she left, she backed into the friend's car, damaging the bumper. A year later, the friend contacts her about fixing the bumper, and they start hanging out. Now, they're dating, and the author is upset and wants to distance themselves from the friend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is still in contact with their ex, as they've been talking, gaming, and getting drinks. The friend knows the author still has feelings for the ex but goes ahead and dates her anyway. Wait, no\u2014the friend is dating the author's ex, right? Wait, the author's ex is the one who broke up with the author, and then the ex started dating the friend. So the friend is now dating the author's ex.\n\nThe author is upset that the friend is dating their ex. The friend might have a right to date whoever they want, but the author feels betrayed because the friend knew about their feelings. Also, there's the issue of the car damage. The ex damaged the friend's car when she left the author's place. The friend waited a year to contact her about fixing it, which seems odd. Maybe the friend had some lingering feelings or was waiting for the right time?\n\nThe author cut off contact with the friend, saying they respected him for telling them but would step back. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nFrom the author's perspective, they're hurt because their friend is dating their ex, especially after knowing about their feelings. The friend might feel that the author is being petty, especially since they broke up a year ago. But the author had a reason to be upset, given the circumstances of the breakup and the car incident. \n\nBut does the friend have a right to date the ex? Yes, unless there were specific agreements made. The author can't stop the friend from dating someone else. However, the friend might have overstepped by dating the ex while knowing the author still had feelings. The author's reaction is about their own emotional response, not about controlling the friend's actions.\n\nThe author's decision to distance themselves is a personal choice. They're not in a position to stop the friend from dating, but they can choose to reduce contact because it's painful. So, the author isn't in the wrong for feeling upset or for choosing to step back. The friend might be in the wrong for not considering the author's feelings, but the main question is about the author's actions. Since the author isn't doing anything harmful themselves, just distancing, it's a no. Answer B.\n"
