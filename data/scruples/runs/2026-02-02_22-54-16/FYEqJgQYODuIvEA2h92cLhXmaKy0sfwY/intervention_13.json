I had a buddy of mine over the day she did it so I had some support when she left. When she left she back right into his car and damaged the bumper. A year later he finally contacts her to get it fixed. Apparently they started to hangout after. Yesterday he messaged me to inform me that they are going on a date in a few days. I replied back that I respected him for telling me that and that I will be taking a step back from being his friend. I wished him luck with her and stop replying.   \n\nMy friend and I have talked, gamed, gotten drinks throughout the year.  He knows I still have feelings for her but nonetheless he is taking her out. Am I the ass hole for being upset with my friend and wanting to distance myself from him? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for being upset and distancing themselves from their friend who is dating their ex. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the situation. The ex broke up a year ago, and the friend (let's call him Friend A) was there when the author's ex left. The ex damaged Friend A's car then. Now, a year later, Friend A contacts the ex to fix the bumper, they start hanging out, and now they're on a date. The author is upset and cutting Friend A off.\n\nThe author still has feelings for the ex, which Friend A knew about. The author respects Friend A for telling them but decides to distance. The main question is whether the author is wrong for being upset and cutting off their friend.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, Friend A knew about their feelings. Even though a year has passed, the ex is now with Friend A. The author might feel betrayed or hurt, especially since Friend A was present during the breakup and the incident with the car. The timing of the contact (a year later) might not matter if the author is still emotionally affected.\n\nOn the other hand, Friend A might have thought that a year was enough time, and perhaps they didn't realize how sensitive the author was. But since the author had mentioned having feelings, Friend A should have been more careful. However, the author's reaction is to cut off a friend, which could be seen as extreme by some.\n\nBut the key points here are that the author communicated their feelings, Friend A was aware, and the author is taking a stand for their own emotional well-being. The author is not forbidding the relationship but choosing to distance themselves. That seems like a personal decision, not necessarily wrong.\n\nSo, considering that the author had valid reasons and the friend knew their feelings, the author isn't in the wrong. Answering B makes sense here.\n"
