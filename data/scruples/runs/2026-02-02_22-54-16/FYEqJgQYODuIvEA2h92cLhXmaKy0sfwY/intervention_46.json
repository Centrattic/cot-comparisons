I had a buddy of mine over the day she did it so I had some support when she left. When she left she back right into his car and damaged the bumper. A year later he finally contacts her to get it fixed. Apparently they started to hangout after. Yesterday he messaged me to inform me that they are going on a date in a few days. I replied back that I respected him for telling me that and that I will be taking a step back from being his friend. I wished him luck with her and stop replying.   \n\nMy friend and I have talked, gamed, gotten drinks throughout the year.  He knows I still have feelings for her but nonetheless he is taking her out. Am I the ass hole for being upset with my friend and wanting to distance myself from him? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being upset that their friend is dating their ex. The situation is that the author and their ex broke up a year ago. The ex left the author's place, and during that time, the ex damaged the friend's car. A year later, the friend contacted the ex to fix the damage, they started hanging out, and now they're going on a date. The author told the friend they're stepping back from the friendship and isn't replying anymore.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author still has feelings for their ex, which they mentioned. The friend knows this but still chose to date the ex. The author is upset and cutting off the friend. Is that justified?\n\nThe key points are the friendship and the author's feelings. The friend acted in a way that might be seen as insensitive\u2014dating someone the author is still emotionally attached to, even if the relationship is over. However, the friend didn't know the ex was damaging the car at the time of the breakup. The friend contacted the ex a year later for a practical reason (fixing the bumper), which led to a relationship. \n\nIs the friend to blame for dating the ex? Maybe not entirely, because the ex isn't off-limits once the relationship is over unless there's an agreement. But the fact that the author is still emotionally attached and the friend knew about that complicates things. The friend might have thought that a year later, the author had moved on, but since the author still has feelings, the timing is awkward.\n\nThe author's reaction is to cut off the friend. Is that reasonable? The author might feel betrayed, especially since the friend knew about their feelings. The friend might have a right to date whomever they choose, but the way they handled the situation could be seen as thoughtless. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for being upset. People need to respect each other's emotions. The friend's actions may not be malicious, but they were insensitive. The author has the right to distance themselves if they're uncomfortable. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
