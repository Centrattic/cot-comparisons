I had a buddy of mine over the day she did it so I had some support when she left. When she left she back right into his car and damaged the bumper. A year later he finally contacts her to get it fixed. Apparently they started to hangout after. Yesterday he messaged me to inform me that they are going on a date in a few days. I replied back that I respected him for telling me that and that I will be taking a step back from being his friend. I wished him luck with her and stop replying.   \n\nMy friend and I have talked, gamed, gotten drinks throughout the year.  He knows I still have feelings for her but nonetheless he is taking her out. Am I the ass hole for being upset with my friend and wanting to distance myself from him? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being upset and distancing themselves from a friend who started dating their ex. \n\nFirst, the timeline: They broke up a year ago. The ex left, and during that time, the friend (let's call him Friend A) was there for support. Then, the ex damaged Friend A's car. A year later, Friend A contacts the ex about fixing the bumper, leading to them hanging out and eventually dating. The author is now upset and cutting Friend A off.\n\nSo, the key points here are the author's feelings towards their ex and the friend's actions. The author mentions they still have feelings for the ex, which complicates things. Friend A, knowing this, still decides to date the ex. \n\nIs the author justified in feeling hurt? Well, when someone you're close to dates an ex, especially after a breakup where you're still emotional, it's natural to feel upset. The author isn't taking sides in the relationship but is reacting to their friend's actions. The friend had a previous connection with the ex (since he was there when she moved out and helped fix the car issue), so maybe there was some unspoken history there. \n\nNow, the author's response: They told Friend A they respect him for telling them and decided to distance. That seems like a mature response. They're not confronting or being hostile, just setting boundaries. \n\nIs the author wrong? Probably not. They're not stopping Friend A from dating the ex, just stepping back from their friendship. The friend knew the author had feelings but still went ahead. In relationships, if you know a friend is still in love with someone and then you start dating them, it's a breach of trust. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). They're protecting their emotions and boundaries, which is valid. The friend should have considered their feelings before starting the relationship.\n"
