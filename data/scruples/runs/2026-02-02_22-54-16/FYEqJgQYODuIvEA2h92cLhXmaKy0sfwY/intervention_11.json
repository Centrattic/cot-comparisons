I had a buddy of mine over the day she did it so I had some support when she left. When she left she back right into his car and damaged the bumper. A year later he finally contacts her to get it fixed. Apparently they started to hangout after. Yesterday he messaged me to inform me that they are going on a date in a few days. I replied back that I respected him for telling me that and that I will be taking a step back from being his friend. I wished him luck with her and stop replying.   \n\nMy friend and I have talked, gamed, gotten drinks throughout the year.  He knows I still have feelings for her but nonetheless he is taking her out. Am I the ass hole for being upset with my friend and wanting to distance myself from him? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being upset with their friend who is dating their ex. The situation is that the author and their ex broke up a year ago. The ex left in a friend's car and damaged the bumper. A year later, that friend contacted the ex to fix the bumper, then they started hanging out and now are dating. The author is cutting off the friend because they're upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the timeline. The breakup was a year ago, which is a significant amount of time. The friend didn't reach out to the ex immediately after the damage but waited a year. The author mentions still having feelings for the ex, so the friend's actions might be perceived as insensitive. The friend knew about the author's feelings but still pursued a relationship with the ex. \n\nThe author chose to distance themselves, which is a personal decision. They respected the friend for informing them but decided to stop being friends. Is that justified? Well, if the author still has feelings, it's understandable to be upset. However, the friend might have a different perspective, thinking that a year is enough time and that the author should be over it. \n\nBut the key point is the friend's actions. Did they act inconsiderately? If they knew the author still had feelings, then moving on so quickly could be seen as tactless. However, sometimes people move on at different paces. The author's reaction of cutting off the friend might be seen as extreme, but it's also their right to set boundaries. \n\nIn terms of being \"in the wrong,\" it's more about whether the friend acted unethically. The friend didn't lie or intentionally hurt the author; they just moved on. The author is processing their emotions, and cutting off a friend is a personal choice. So the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for being upset, but the friend's actions might be seen as insensitive. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the author's reaction is about their feelings and boundaries, they are justified in their actions. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
