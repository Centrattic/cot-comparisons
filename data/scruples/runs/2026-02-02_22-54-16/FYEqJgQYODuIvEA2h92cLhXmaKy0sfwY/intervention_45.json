I had a buddy of mine over the day she did it so I had some support when she left. When she left she back right into his car and damaged the bumper. A year later he finally contacts her to get it fixed. Apparently they started to hangout after. Yesterday he messaged me to inform me that they are going on a date in a few days. I replied back that I respected him for telling me that and that I will be taking a step back from being his friend. I wished him luck with her and stop replying.   \n\nMy friend and I have talked, gamed, gotten drinks throughout the year.  He knows I still have feelings for her but nonetheless he is taking her out. Am I the ass hole for being upset with my friend and wanting to distance myself from him? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So the user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for being upset with their friend who's dating their ex. The situation is that the author and their ex broke up a year ago. The ex left and damaged the friend's bumper. A year later, the friend contacted her to fix the bumper, and they started hanging out. Now the friend is dating the ex, and the author is cutting ties with him because they're upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is still having feelings for the ex, which the friend knows. The friend reached out to the ex to fix the bumper after a year, which led to them dating. The author is upset and stepping back as a friend. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nI think the key points here are: the friend was aware of the author's feelings towards the ex. Even though they broke up a year ago, the author hasn't moved on completely. The friend decided to date someone who is still emotionally significant to the author. The timing might be an issue here. The friend waited a year to contact the ex about the bumper, which was a practical matter, but then the relationship developed. \n\nIs the friend at fault for dating the ex when he knew the author's feelings? The author's reaction is understandable; they might feel betrayed or hurt. The friend could be seen as using the situation to his advantage, knowing the author's emotional state. \n\nOn the other hand, the ex is free to date whoever she wants, and the friend isn't in the wrong for pursuing a relationship with her. The author's feelings are valid, but maybe their reaction is a bit harsh? By cutting off contact, the author is making a choice based on their own comfort, which is their right. \n\nBut the friend's actions\u2014contacting the ex for a personal matter and then dating her\u2014could be seen as crossing a line, especially since he knew about the author's feelings. The fact that the ex left in a messy way (damaging the bumper) might add to the author's hurt. \n\nI think the author is justified in feeling upset. They have the right to set boundaries if someone is dating someone they have feelings for. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
