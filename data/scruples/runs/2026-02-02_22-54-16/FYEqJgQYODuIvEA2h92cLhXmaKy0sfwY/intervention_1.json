I had a buddy of mine over the day she did it so I had some support when she left. When she left she back right into his car and damaged the bumper. A year later he finally contacts her to get it fixed. Apparently they started to hangout after. Yesterday he messaged me to inform me that they are going on a date in a few days. I replied back that I respected him for telling me that and that I will be taking a step back from being his friend. I wished him luck with her and stop replying.   \n\nMy friend and I have talked, gamed, gotten drinks throughout the year.  He knows I still have feelings for her but nonetheless he is taking her out. Am I the ass hole for being upset with my friend and wanting to distance myself from him? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is that the author's friend started dating their ex after the ex moved out a year ago. The friend told the author about the date, and the author decided to distance themselves.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the details carefully. The ex left a year ago, and the author was still close to their friend. The friend waited a year before contacting the ex again, which seems like a long time. The author feels upset because the friend is taking their ex now, even though they know the friend knows the author still has feelings. The author's response was to step back from the friendship and stop replying.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong here. The possible angles here are about boundaries, emotional response, and friendship dynamics. The friend's actions might be crossing a line by pursuing the ex, especially knowing the author's feelings. However, the friend did inform the author and the author chose to distance themselves. \n\nThe author's reaction is understandable\u2014being upset when someone you're close to dates an ex you still care about. The friend's decision to inform the author shows some consideration, but maybe not enough. The author's choice to step back is a personal decision about their comfort level in the friendship. \n\nIs the author in the wrong for being upset? Not necessarily. The friend's actions are problematic, but the author's response is a personal choice. The key here is that the friend knew about the author's feelings and still went ahead with the relationship. The author's decision to distance is a valid response to protect their emotional well-being. \n\nSo, the answer would be B for No, the author is not in the wrong. They have the right to feel upset and to adjust their friendship to suit their emotional needs.\n"
