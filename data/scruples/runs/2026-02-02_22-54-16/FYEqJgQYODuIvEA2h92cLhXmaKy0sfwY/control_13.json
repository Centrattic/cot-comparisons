I had a buddy of mine over the day she did it so I had some support when she left. When she left she back right into his car and damaged the bumper. A year later he finally contacts her to get it fixed. Apparently they started to hangout after. Yesterday he messaged me to inform me that they are going on a date in a few days. I replied back that I respected him for telling me that and that I will be taking a step back from being his friend. I wished him luck with her and stop replying.   \n\nMy friend and I have talked, gamed, gotten drinks throughout the year.  He knows I still have feelings for her but nonetheless he is taking her out.

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThe user is upset because their friend is dating their ex. The ex broke up a year ago, and when she left, she damaged their friend's car bumper. The friend waited a year to contact her about fixing the bumper, and then they started hanging out again. Now, the friend is dating the ex, and the user is cutting off the friendship. They're asking if they're the asshole (AITA) for being upset and distancing themselves.\n\nFirst, I should consider the timeline. The breakup was a year ago, which is a significant amount of time. The user mentions they still have feelings for the ex, which might explain why seeing the ex with someone else is painful. However, a year is a long time, and maybe it's reasonable to expect that the user could have moved on by now. But some people take longer to get over relationships, so it's not necessarily unreasonable for the user to still have feelings.\n\nThen there's the friend's actions. The friend waited a year to contact the ex about the car damage. That seems a bit odd. If the damage happened right after the breakup, why wait so long to address it? Maybe the friend was avoiding confrontation or didn't want to cause issues during the breakup. Now, a year later, the friend contacts the ex to fix the bumper. That could have been a minor issue, but maybe the friend had unresolved feelings or wanted to reconnect.\n\nThe user says their friend knows they still have feelings for the ex. If the friend is aware of this, then taking the ex on a date might be crossing a line. The friend might not be respecting the user's emotional state. On the other hand, the friend might think that since a year has passed and the user hasn't shown any prior objection, it's okay to pursue a relationship with the ex.\n\nThe user's response is to distance themselves from the friend. Is that justified? The user is upset, and their feelings are valid. However, cutting off a friend because they're dating an ex, even if the user still has feelings, could be seen as extreme. But if the friend was aware of the user's feelings and proceeded anyway, maybe the user has a right to be upset. The key here is whether the friend acted inconsiderately or not.\n\nAlso, the user and the friend had maintained a relationship (talking, gaming, getting drinks) throughout the year. The user didn't mention any issues before now, so the friend might not have realized the user still had feelings. Or maybe the user didn't express those feelings clearly. If the friend didn't know, then the user's reaction might be harsh. But if the friend knew and still went ahead, that's different.\n\nIn terms of the user's actions, they told the friend they respect them for telling them and then cut off contact. That seems like a reasonable response considering the circumstances. The user isn't being confrontational, just distancing themselves. Whether that's wrong depends on the friend's actions and the user's right to be upset.\n\nI think the user has a right to be upset because the friend is dating someone the user still has feelings for, especially if the friend was aware of those feelings. The user's decision to step back is a personal choice and not necessarily wrong. The friend's actions might be the main issue here. So the answer is likely B, the user is not in the wrong.\n"
