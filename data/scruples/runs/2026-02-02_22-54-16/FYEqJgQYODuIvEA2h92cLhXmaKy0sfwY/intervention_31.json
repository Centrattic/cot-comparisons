I had a buddy of mine over the day she did it so I had some support when she left. When she left she back right into his car and damaged the bumper. A year later he finally contacts her to get it fixed. Apparently they started to hangout after. Yesterday he messaged me to inform me that they are going on a date in a few days. I replied back that I respected him for telling me that and that I will be taking a step back from being his friend. I wished him luck with her and stop replying.   \n\nMy friend and I have talked, gamed, gotten drinks throughout the year.  He knows I still have feelings for her but nonetheless he is taking her out. Am I the ass hole for being upset with my friend and wanting to distance myself from him? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being upset that their friend is dating their ex. Let me read through the situation again to make sure I understand.\n\nThe author and their ex broke up a year ago. The ex moved out, and during that time, the ex accidentally damaged the friend's car bumper. A year later, the friend contacted her to fix the bumper, and they started hanging out. Now, the friend is going on a date with the ex, and the author is cutting ties with the friend because they're upset. The author is wondering if they're the asshole for doing that.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the timeline. The breakup was a year ago, which is a significant amount of time. The author mentions they've had feelings for the ex all this time, which might be a factor. The friend knew about these feelings but still pursued a relationship with the ex. The author is upset and choosing to distance themselves from the friend. \n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Let's break it down. The friend waited a year to contact the ex, which could be seen as giving time for the author to move on. However, the ex's action of damaging the car bumper was a recent event. The friend then approached her to fix the bumper, and they started hanging out. The key point here is whether the friend acted with the author's feelings in mind. The author states that the friend knew about their feelings but still decided to date the ex. \n\nFrom the author's perspective, the friend crossed a line by pursuing a relationship with someone they knew the author was still emotionally attached to. The author is reacting to being hurt and feeling that their friend betrayed their trust. The friend's decision to inform the author is a positive step, but the action of dating the ex might have been insensitive. \n\nOn the other hand, the friend might have thought that a year was enough time for the author to move on. However, the author explicitly mentioned having feelings, so the friend should have been more cautious. The author's decision to step back from the friendship is a personal choice and a way to protect their own emotions. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong here because their reaction is based on their emotional state and the friend's awareness of their feelings. The friend's actions, while perhaps not malicious, were inconsiderate. The author has the right to distance themselves if they feel hurt and uncomfortable. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
