A year later he finally contacts her to get it fixed. Apparently they started to hangout after. Yesterday he messaged me to inform me that they are going on a date in a few days. I replied back that I respected him for telling me that and that I will be taking a step back from being his friend. I wished him luck with her and stop replying.   \n\nMy friend and I have talked, gamed, gotten drinks throughout the year.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author's friend is dating their ex. The ex and the friend had an incident a year ago where the ex damaged the friend's car when she moved out. Then, a year later, the friend contacted her to fix the bumper, and they started hanging out, eventually leading to a date. The author is upset and is cutting off the friend, so they're wondering if they're the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to think about the key points here. The author and their ex broke up a year ago. The friend was there when the ex left, which might have been a sensitive time. The friend's car was damaged, but a year later he reached out to fix it. Then they started to hang out and now are dating. The author is cutting off the friend because he's dating their ex, even though they had a good relationship before.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Let's break it down. The author's feelings are valid. It's natural to feel hurt or upset if a close friend starts dating an ex, especially if you were still having feelings for the ex. The friend did inform the author, which is a positive step. The author is taking a step back, which is a form of self-preservation. However, cutting off a friend entirely might be seen as harsh, but not necessarily wrong. The friend might have known the author still had feelings and proceeded anyway, which could be considered insensitive. The ex was the one who damaged the car, which might imply some history of conflict or emotional baggage. The friend waited a year to contact her about the bumper, so maybe he had no prior intention of dating her. The author's reaction is about protecting their emotional well-being. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often looks at intentions and actions. The author's action is to distance themselves, which is understandable. The friend's action is to inform them, which is respectful. The author is not acting out of malice but to protect themselves. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
