A year later he finally contacts her to get it fixed. Apparently they started to hangout after. Yesterday he messaged me to inform me that they are going on a date in a few days.

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author and their ex broke up a year ago. The ex left the author's place and accidentally damaged their friend's car bumper. Then, a year later, the friend contacts the ex to fix the bumper, and they start hanging out, leading to a date. The author finds out and decides to distance themselves from the friend, cutting contact.\n\nThe key points here are: the ex and the friend started dating after the breakup. The author is still upset about the breakup, has feelings for the ex, and is upset that the friend is dating them. The author is cutting contact with the friend as a result.\n\nNow, considering if the author is in the wrong. The friend did reach out to the ex to fix the bumper, which happened a year after the breakup. The author's reaction is to distance themselves from the friend. The question is whether that's justified.\n\nOn one hand, the friend might have thought that after a year, it's okay to pursue a relationship with the ex. The author's feelings are valid because they're still emotionally involved with the ex. However, the friend might not have known the author still had feelings, but the author mentioned to the friend that they still had feelings. Wait, the user says \"He knows I still have feelings for her but nonetheless he is taking her out.\" So the friend was aware that the author still had feelings. That's a critical point. If the friend knew the author wasn't over the ex and still had feelings, then pursuing a relationship with the ex could be seen as crossing a boundary. The friend didn't ask the author if it was okay or consider their feelings, which might make the friend at fault here.\n\nThe author's response is to step back from the friendship. They didn't confront the friend aggressively but instead communicated their feelings and distanced themselves. That seems reasonable. The friend might have overstepped by pursuing a relationship knowing the author's feelings. So the author isn't in the wrong for being upset and choosing to distance themselves. The friend's actions, knowing the author's feelings, could be the issue here.\n\nAnother angle: the timeline. A year has passed, so maybe the author should have moved on. But people grieve and move on at different paces. It's possible the author isn't ready yet. The friend might have made a mistake, but the author's reaction is about their own emotional state. The author isn't the one dating the ex; the friend is. The friend's actions could be seen as more problematic here. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
