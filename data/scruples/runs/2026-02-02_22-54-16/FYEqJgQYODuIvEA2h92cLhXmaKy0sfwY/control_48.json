I had a buddy of mine over the day she did it so I had some support when she left. When she left she back right into his car and damaged the bumper. A year later he finally contacts her to get it fixed. Apparently they started to hangout after. Yesterday he messaged me to inform me that they are going on a date in a few days. I replied back that I respected him for telling me that and that I will be taking a step back from being his friend. I wished him luck with her and stop replying.   \n\nMy friend and I have talked, gamed, gotten drinks throughout the year.  He knows I still have feelings for her but nonetheless he is taking her out.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario is that the author's friend is dating the author's ex. They broke up a year ago, and the friend helped the author during the breakup. The ex damaged the friend's car then, and now the friend is going out with her again. The author is upset and cutting ties.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The key points are: the breakup was a year ago, the friend supported the author when the ex left, there was a car incident, and now the friend is dating the ex. The author feels hurt and is distancing themselves.\n\nThe question is if the author is in the wrong. So, I need to consider the dynamics here. The friend might have a right to move on and date someone, even if they are an ex. However, the author is still dealing with feelings for the ex. The friend might not have considered the author's feelings when pursuing the ex. Also, the friend did inform the author, which is a positive step.\n\nBut the author's reaction is to cut off the friend. Is that justified? Well, if the author is still emotionally attached, it's natural to feel upset. However, cutting off a friend because they're dating an ex could be seen as a personal choice. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong because they have the right to prioritize their emotional well-being. On the other hand, the friend might have a right to pursue their happiness too.\n\nI need to check if the friend did anything morally wrong. The friend waited a year to contact the ex, which shows some time passed. The car incident might have been a minor issue. The friend informed the author, so there's transparency. The author's feelings are valid, but cutting off a friend over this might be extreme. However, the author isn't obligated to stay friends if it's causing emotional pain. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the judgment often depends on the actions of both parties. Here, the friend's actions might be seen as respectful by informing the author, but the author's reaction is about their emotional state. The author isn't in the wrong for choosing to distance themselves because they're hurting. The friend isn't in the wrong for moving on either. So the answer might be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
