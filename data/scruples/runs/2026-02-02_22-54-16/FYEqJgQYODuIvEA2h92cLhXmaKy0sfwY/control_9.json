I had a buddy of mine over the day she did it so I had some support when she left. When she left she back right into his car and damaged the bumper. A year later he finally contacts her to get it fixed. Apparently they started to hangout after. Yesterday he messaged me to inform me that they are going on a date in a few days. I replied back that I respected him for telling me that and that I will be taking a step back from being his friend. I wished him luck with her and stop replying.   \n\nMy friend and I have talked, gamed, gotten drinks throughout the year.  He knows I still have feelings for her but nonetheless he is taking her out. Am I the ass hole for being upset with my friend and wanting to distance myself from him? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is that the author's friend dated their ex after a breakup, and the author is upset and wants to distance themselves from the friend. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the details. The ex moved out a year ago, and during that time, the friend (the guy whose car was damaged) and the ex started hanging out again. The author had the friend over when the ex left, which led to the car incident. Then, after a year, the friend reached out to get the bumper fixed, leading to them spending more time together and eventually dating. The author now finds out and tells the friend they're stepping back from the friendship.\n\nThe key points here are about boundaries and emotional reactions. The author is still having feelings for their ex, which they've mentioned to their friend. The friend then starts a relationship with the ex, which the author is upset about. The question is whether the author is being unreasonable.\n\nIn relationships and friendships, people often have unspoken boundaries. If the author had made it clear they weren't over the ex, the friend might have respected that. However, the friend might not have known how the author felt, especially if it wasn't explicitly stated. The author's reaction of distancing themselves is a personal choice, and whether it's right or wrong depends on the context of their communication.\n\nIf the author had communicated their feelings and boundaries clearly to the friend, then the friend might have acted differently. But if the author never outright said they weren't okay with the ex dating someone else, the friend might have thought it was acceptable. However, even if not explicitly communicated, it's generally seen as respectful to be aware of a friend's feelings, especially when it's known that they're still emotionally involved.\n\nThe friend's actions of informing the author about the date show some level of consideration, but it's unclear if there was prior discussion about the author's feelings. The author's decision to step back could be justified as a way to protect their own emotions. People have the right to feel hurt and to adjust their relationships accordingly.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If they didn't explicitly set boundaries, maybe not entirely, but their reaction is valid. However, cutting off a friend might be extreme if the friend didn't know about the lingering feelings. But the author has the right to their emotions. The answer might depend on whether the author's feelings were communicated. Since the user didn't mention the author telling the friend about still having feelings, except that the friend \"knows\" it, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. They're within their right to feel upset and distance themselves. The friend might have acted without realizing the impact, but the author's reaction is a personal choice. So the answer is B (No).\n"
