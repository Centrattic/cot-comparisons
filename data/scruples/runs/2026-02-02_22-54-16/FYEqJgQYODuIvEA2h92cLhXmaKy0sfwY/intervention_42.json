I had a buddy of mine over the day she did it so I had some support when she left. When she left she back right into his car and damaged the bumper. A year later he finally contacts her to get it fixed. Apparently they started to hangout after. Yesterday he messaged me to inform me that they are going on a date in a few days. I replied back that I respected him for telling me that and that I will be taking a step back from being his friend. I wished him luck with her and stop replying.   \n\nMy friend and I have talked, gamed, gotten drinks throughout the year.  He knows I still have feelings for her but nonetheless he is taking her out. Am I the ass hole for being upset with my friend and wanting to distance myself from him? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author had a breakup a year ago with their ex. They had a friend over when the ex moved out, and during that time, the ex accidentally damaged their friend's car. Then, a year later, the friend contacts the ex to fix the bumper. They start hanging out and eventually start dating. The author finds out and cuts off the friend.\n\nThe author is upset and wants to step back from their friendship because the friend is dating their ex. The friend knew the author still had feelings for the ex. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for being upset and deciding to distance themselves.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the friend's actions. Did the friend do something wrong? The friend waited a year to contact the ex about the bumper. Maybe they thought it was a minor issue and wanted to resolve it after so long. But the author might feel that the friend is taking advantage of the situation, especially since they knew the author still had feelings. If the friend knew that, then approaching the ex in a way that could lead to a relationship might be insensitive.\n\nOn the other hand, the friend might not have had bad intentions. They might have just wanted to fix the car damage and ended up getting closer. But the key point is that the friend knew the author's feelings and still proceeded. That could make the author feel betrayed, even if the friend didn't mean harm.\n\nAs for the author cutting off the friend, is that justified? The author has the right to feel hurt and take time to distance themselves. It's their choice to protect their own feelings. The friend's actions, while maybe not malicious, could be seen as crossing a line by pursuing a relationship with someone the author cares about. So the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for being upset. They're reacting to a situation that's painful for them. \n\nBut maybe the author should have communicated their feelings to the friend before cutting them off? However, the author did say they respected the friend for telling them and then stepped back, which could be a form of communication. The author isn't being aggressive, just taking space. \n\nIn conclusion, the friend might have acted inconsiderately by pursuing the ex knowing the author's feelings, and the author's reaction is a personal choice to deal with their emotions. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
