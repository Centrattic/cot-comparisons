I had a buddy of mine over the day she did it so I had some support when she left. When she left she back right into his car and damaged the bumper. A year later he finally contacts her to get it fixed. Apparently they started to hangout after. Yesterday he messaged me to inform me that they are going on a date in a few days. I replied back that I respected him for telling me that and that I will be taking a step back from being his friend. I wished him luck with her and stop replying.   \n\nMy friend and I have talked, gamed, gotten drinks throughout the year.  He knows I still have feelings for her but nonetheless he is taking her out.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this \"Am I the Asshole\" situation is in the wrong. The scenario is that the author's ex moved out a year ago, damaged a friend's car when she left, and the friend waited a year to contact her about fixing it. Now the friend is dating the ex, and the author is upset, deciding to distance themselves.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The author and the ex broke up a year ago. The friend was present when the ex left, which might explain why he was the one she backed into. Then, after a year, the friend reached out about the bumper damage. They started hanging out, leading to a date. The author is upset because they still have feelings for the ex, and the friend is now dating her. The author cut off contact after the message.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. Let me consider the perspectives. The friend might feel that since the author and the ex are no longer together, it's okay for him to date her. But the author is still hurt and wants to distance from the friend because they feel betrayed or disrespected. \n\nIs the friend's action unethical? If the ex and the friend started a relationship soon after the friend contacted her about the car damage, maybe the friend saw an opportunity. The author might feel like the friend is interfering or moving on too quickly. \n\nThe author's response was to step back and stop replying. That seems reasonable if they're not ready to deal with it. But is it fair for the author to be upset? People have different timelines for moving on. The author still has feelings, so the friend dating the ex could be a trigger. \n\nThe friend might not have known the author still had feelings, but the author mentioned they did. The friend could be seen as insensitive for pursuing a relationship with someone who's still emotionally tied to their ex. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the friend's actions might be the issue here, not the author's. The author is protecting their feelings, which is valid. Cutting off a friend who's dating their ex isn't necessarily wrong if it's causing them distress. \n\nSo the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because the author is responding to their own emotional needs and the situation isn't their fault. The friend might be the one in the wrong for dating someone who's still in a relationship with their ex, but the user is asking about the author's actions. The author isn't being unreasonable here.\n"
