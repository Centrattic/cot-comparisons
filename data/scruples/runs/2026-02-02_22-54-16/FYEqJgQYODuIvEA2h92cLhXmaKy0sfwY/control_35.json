I had a buddy of mine over the day she did it so I had some support when she left. When she left she back right into his car and damaged the bumper. A year later he finally contacts her to get it fixed. Apparently they started to hangout after. Yesterday he messaged me to inform me that they are going on a date in a few days. I replied back that I respected him for telling me that and that I will be taking a step back from being his friend. I wished him luck with her and stop replying.   \n\nMy friend and I have talked, gamed, gotten drinks throughout the year.  He knows I still have feelings for her but nonetheless he is taking her out.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being upset with their friend who started dating their ex. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author and their ex broke up a year ago. The ex left, and during that time, she damaged the friend's car. A year later, the friend contacts her to fix the bumper, they start hanging out, and now he's dating her. The author finds out and distances themselves from the friend. \n\nSo, the main question is if the author is the asshole here. Let's break it down. The author still has feelings for their ex, which they mentioned. The friend knew about these feelings but chose to date the ex anyway. The author is upset and cutting off the friend. \n\nFrom the author's perspective, it's understandable to feel hurt. The friend didn't just date the ex without knowing the history; he was aware the author still had feelings. That might be seen as a betrayal or lack of consideration. The author is taking a stand by distancing themselves, which is a personal choice. \n\nOn the other hand, the friend might have thought he was being honest by telling the author. The author chose to back off, so the friend isn't necessarily wrong for pursuing a relationship. But the friend's actions could be seen as insensitive given the author's feelings. \n\nThe key points are: The friend knew the author's feelings, the author is within their rights to cut ties, and the friend's actions might have been thoughtless. The author isn't obligated to be friends with someone who's dating an ex they're still close to. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong). They have a valid reason to be upset, and their response is a personal choice to protect their feelings.\n"
