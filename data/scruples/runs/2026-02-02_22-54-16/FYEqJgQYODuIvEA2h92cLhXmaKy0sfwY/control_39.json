I had a buddy of mine over the day she did it so I had some support when she left. When she left she back right into his car and damaged the bumper. A year later he finally contacts her to get it fixed. Apparently they started to hangout after. Yesterday he messaged me to inform me that they are going on a date in a few days. I replied back that I respected him for telling me that and that I will be taking a step back from being his friend. I wished him luck with her and stop replying.   \n\nMy friend and I have talked, gamed, gotten drinks throughout the year.  He knows I still have feelings for her but nonetheless he is taking her out. Am I the ass hole for being upset with my friend and wanting to distance myself from him? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for cutting ties with their friend who started dating their ex. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author broke up with their ex a year ago, and their friend was there when the ex moved out. The friend's car was damaged then. After a year, the friend contacted the ex to get the bumper fixed, and they started hanging out and now are dating. The author found out and told their friend they'll step back from being friends. They want to know if they're the asshole here.\n\nHmm. So, the author is upset because their friend started dating their ex. They felt they still had feelings for the ex, and the friend knew that. The friend might have crossed a line by pursuing the ex despite knowing the author's feelings. \n\nThe key points here are: the friend was aware of the author's feelings, yet still chose to date the ex. Also, the friend waited a year to contact the ex about the bumper. Maybe the friend didn't realize it would affect the author, but they should have considered that. \n\nThe author is cutting off the friendship because of this. Is that justified? People have different boundaries, but if the friend knowingly took the ex despite the author's feelings, then the author's reaction is understandable. The author isn't obligated to stay friends if they're hurt. \n\nBut maybe there's more context. Did the friend have a reason to contact the ex? Like the bumper issue. If it's just about a damaged bumper, maybe the friend needed to fix it, but then moving on to a dating level after a year? The author might feel betrayed. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong. They have the right to be upset and choose their boundaries. The friend might have overstepped, especially since they knew the author still had feelings. So, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
