I had a buddy of mine over the day she did it so I had some support when she left. When she left she back right into his car and damaged the bumper. A year later he finally contacts her to get it fixed. Apparently they started to hangout after. Yesterday he messaged me to inform me that they are going on a date in a few days. I replied back that I respected him for telling me that and that I will be taking a step back from being his friend. I wished him luck with her and stop replying.   \n\nMy friend and I have talked, gamed, gotten drinks throughout the year.  He knows I still have feelings for her but nonetheless he is taking her out. Am I the ass hole for being upset with my friend and wanting to distance myself from him? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the person (the author) is in the wrong for being upset with their friend who dated their ex. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author and their ex broke up a year ago. When the ex moved out, she hit their friend's car, damaging the bumper. The friend waited a year to contact her about fixing it. Then they started hanging out, and now they're dating. The author found out and decided to step back from the friend. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nHmm. Let's consider the key points. The friend was aware that the author still had feelings for the ex. The ex had just broken up with the author, so moving on might be a sensitive time. The friend waited a year to contact her about the car damage, which could have been a way to avoid conflict, but then started dating her. \n\nThe author's reaction is to distance themselves from the friend. Is that justified? Well, the friend might have thought that a year later, it's okay to move on. But the author still has feelings, so the friend's actions could be hurtful. However, the friend did inform the author, which is respectful. The author's response is to step back, which is their right. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? If the friend was upfront, maybe the author's reaction is valid. The friend might not be in the wrong for moving on, but the author has the right to feel hurt and adjust their friendship. So the answer is probably B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
