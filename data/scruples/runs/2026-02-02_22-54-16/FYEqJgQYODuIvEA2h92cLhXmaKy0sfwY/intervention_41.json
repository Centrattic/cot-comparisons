I had a buddy of mine over the day she did it so I had some support when she left. When she left she back right into his car and damaged the bumper. A year later he finally contacts her to get it fixed. Apparently they started to hangout after. Yesterday he messaged me to inform me that they are going on a date in a few days. I replied back that I respected him for telling me that and that I will be taking a step back from being his friend. I wished him luck with her and stop replying.   \n\nMy friend and I have talked, gamed, gotten drinks throughout the year.  He knows I still have feelings for her but nonetheless he is taking her out. Am I the ass hole for being upset with my friend and wanting to distance myself from him? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being upset with their friend who is dating their ex. The situation is that the author and their ex broke up a year ago. The ex left the author's place, there was some damage to the friend's car, and a year later, the friend approached the ex to fix it. They started hanging out and are now dating.\n\nThe author feels that their friend knows they still have feelings for the ex, yet the friend is dating her. The author is cutting ties with the friend as a result. The user thinks the author is not in the wrong but wants confirmation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author and ex broke up a year ago, which is a significant amount of time. However, the author still has lingering feelings. The friend knew this and still chose to pursue a relationship with the ex. The author's reaction is to distance themselves from the friend, which is a personal choice.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the friend approached the ex after a year, possibly after the author had moved on, but the author is still upset. The friend knew about the author's feelings. That seems like a red flag. The author's response is to step back from the friendship. That's a personal decision, but whether it's wrong depends on context. The friend might have thought the author had moved on, but if the author still had feelings and the friend was aware, then the friend might have crossed a boundary. However, the author isn't confronting the ex directly but the friend. The friend might have a right to date whoever they choose unless there were boundaries set beforehand. The author's reaction is valid given their emotions, but is it fair to cut off the friend? Maybe. The key points are the friend's awareness of the author's feelings and the timing. The author isn't doing anything illegal or unethical, just reacting emotionally. So the answer is probably B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
