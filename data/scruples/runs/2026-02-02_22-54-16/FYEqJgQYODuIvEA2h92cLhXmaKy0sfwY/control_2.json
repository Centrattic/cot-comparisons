I had a buddy of mine over the day she did it so I had some support when she left. When she left she back right into his car and damaged the bumper. A year later he finally contacts her to get it fixed. Apparently they started to hangout after. Yesterday he messaged me to inform me that they are going on a date in a few days. I replied back that I respected him for telling me that and that I will be taking a step back from being his friend. I wished him luck with her and stop replying.   \n\nMy friend and I have talked, gamed, gotten drinks throughout the year.  He knows I still have feelings for her but nonetheless he is taking her out. Am I the ass hole for being upset with my friend and wanting to distance myself from him? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're the a**hole for being upset with a friend who is dating their ex. The situation is that they broke up a year ago, and when their ex moved out, she accidentally damaged their friend's car bumper. The friend only contacted her about fixing it a year later, and now they're dating. The user told the friend they'd step back from being friends and stopped responding.\n\nHmm, first, the user's feelings are valid. It's natural to feel hurt or upset when an ex starts dating someone else, especially a friend. The friend knew the user still had feelings, so approaching the ex after the user had moved on could be seen as crossing a boundary. The friend waited a year to address the car damage, which might suggest he was avoiding the issue or maybe even waiting for the user to be over it. Then he starts hanging out with the ex, leading to a date. The user's response\u2014respecting the friend's honesty but deciding to distance\u2014seems reasonable. They're not in the wrong for protecting their feelings. The friend might have been insensitive, but the user's reaction is about self-respect. So the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
