I had a buddy of mine over the day she did it so I had some support when she left. When she left she back right into his car and damaged the bumper. A year later he finally contacts her to get it fixed. Apparently they started to hangout after. Yesterday he messaged me to inform me that they are going on a date in a few days. I replied back that I respected him for telling me that and that I will be taking a step back from being his friend. I wished him luck with her and stop replying.   \n\nMy friend and I have talked, gamed, gotten drinks throughout the year.  He knows I still have feelings for her but nonetheless he is taking her out. Am I the ass hole for being upset with my friend and wanting to distance myself from him? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for being upset and cutting off their friend who is dating the author's ex. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the timeline. The author and their ex broke up a year ago. The ex left the author's place, and there was some minor damage to the friend's car. Then, a year later, the friend contacts the ex to fix the bumper, they start hanging out, and now the friend is dating the author's ex. \n\nThe author is upset and decides to distance themselves from the friend. They mention that they've been friends before, played games, had drinks, and the friend knew the author still had feelings for the ex. The author feels they're justified in being upset because their friend is dating someone they were still emotionally involved with.\n\nNow, considering social norms and personal boundaries. The friend did reach out to the ex after a year, which the author might see as taking advantage of the author's emotional state. The friend also knew about the author's feelings, which adds a layer of betrayal. The author's reaction\u2014respecting the friend for informing them but choosing to distance\u2014is a personal choice. People often feel hurt in such situations, and cutting off a friend isn't necessarily wrong if they feel their trust is broken.\n\nBut is the author in the wrong? Well, the friend did inform the author, which is a positive step. However, the friend's actions could be seen as crossing a line, especially knowing the author's feelings. The author's decision to step back is a personal boundary they're setting, which is their right. There's no clear evidence that the author is being unreasonable. The friend might have misjudged the situation, but the author isn't at fault for feeling hurt and choosing to distance themselves.\n\nSo, the answer would be B (No), the author is not in the wrong here. They have the right to set boundaries based on their emotional response.\n"
