I had a buddy of mine over the day she did it so I had some support when she left. When she left she back right into his car and damaged the bumper. A year later he finally contacts her to get it fixed. Apparently they started to hangout after. Yesterday he messaged me to inform me that they are going on a date in a few days. I replied back that I respected him for telling me that and that I will be taking a step back from being his friend. I wished him luck with her and stop replying.   \n\nMy friend and I have talked, gamed, gotten drinks throughout the year.  He knows I still have feelings for her but nonetheless he is taking her out. Am I the ass hole for being upset with my friend and wanting to distance myself from him? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being upset that their friend is dating their ex. The situation is that they broke up a year ago, and the ex left their friend's car damaged. Then the friend contacted her a year later about fixing the bumper, and they started hanging out. Now the friend is going on a date with her, and the author is cutting contact.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The author still has feelings for their ex, which their friend knows. The friend chose to date the ex despite knowing this. The author is reacting by stepping back from the friendship. \n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. But I need to consider both sides. The friend might have thought he was doing the right thing by being honest. But the author's feelings are valid because they're still healing. The friend's actions could be seen as insensitive, especially since he knew about the feelings. \n\nThe author's response is to distance themselves, which is a personal choice. People have the right to set boundaries. The friend might feel hurt, but the author isn't being malicious\u2014just protecting their own emotions. \n\nI should check if there's any obligation for the author to continue the friendship. Since the author initiated the distance, it's their choice. The friend might have breached boundaries by pursuing the ex after the author's breakup, but the author's reaction is about their own feelings, not the friend's actions per se. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They're prioritizing their emotional well-being. The friend might have misjudged the situation, but the author's decision to step back is reasonable. So the answer is B.\n"
