I had a buddy of mine over the day she did it so I had some support when she left. When she left she back right into his car and damaged the bumper. A year later he finally contacts her to get it fixed. Apparently they started to hangout after. Yesterday he messaged me to inform me that they are going on a date in a few days. I replied back that I respected him for telling me that and that I will be taking a step back from being his friend. I wished him luck with her and stop replying.   \n\nMy friend and I have talked, gamed, gotten drinks throughout the year.  He knows I still have feelings for her but nonetheless he is taking her out.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a friend dating an ex after a breakup. The author broke up with their ex a year ago, and during the move-out process, the ex damaged their friend's car. A year later, the friend contacts the ex to fix the bumper, they start hanging out, and now the friend is dating the ex. The author is upset, told the friend they're stepping back from the friendship, and is wondering if they're the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the timeline. The breakup was a year ago, which is a significant amount of time. The author mentions still having feelings for the ex, which might be lingering. The friend contacted the ex after a year to fix the bumper, which seems reasonable for a repair, but then they started hanging out and dating. The author is cutting off the friend because of this.\n\nThe key points here are the author's emotional state and the friend's actions. The friend might have thought it was okay to date the ex after a year, especially since the author had moved on enough to continue being friends with them. However, the author still has feelings, which makes it hurtful. The friend's actions could be seen as crossing a boundary, even if unintentionally.\n\nEmotionally, it's valid for the author to feel hurt. Even though a year has passed, the fact that the friend is now with someone the author still has feelings for can be painful. The author's decision to step back is a personal choice and a way to protect their emotional well-being. Friends are supposed to respect each other's boundaries and emotions. If the friend wasn't aware that the author still had feelings, it's on them to have considered that before pursuing a relationship. But if the author didn't communicate their ongoing feelings, the friend might not have known. However, the author did mention to the friend that they still had feelings in their interactions over the year. So the friend should have been aware.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, cutting off a friend is a strong action, but it's a consequence of the hurt. The author isn't obligated to maintain a friendship if it's causing them pain. The friend's actions, while perhaps not malicious, did cause harm. The author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing their own well-being. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
