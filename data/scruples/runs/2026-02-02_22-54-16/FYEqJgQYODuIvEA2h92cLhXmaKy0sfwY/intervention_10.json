I had a buddy of mine over the day she did it so I had some support when she left. When she left she back right into his car and damaged the bumper. A year later he finally contacts her to get it fixed. Apparently they started to hangout after. Yesterday he messaged me to inform me that they are going on a date in a few days. I replied back that I respected him for telling me that and that I will be taking a step back from being his friend. I wished him luck with her and stop replying.   \n\nMy friend and I have talked, gamed, gotten drinks throughout the year.  He knows I still have feelings for her but nonetheless he is taking her out. Am I the ass hole for being upset with my friend and wanting to distance myself from him? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author's friend is dating their ex. The ex broke up a year ago, and during the move-out, she damaged the friend's car. The friend waited until a year later to contact her about fixing the bumper, and then they started hanging out and now are dating. The author is upset, respects the friend for informing them, but is cutting off the friendship. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The author still has feelings for the ex, which they mentioned to the friend. The friend knew about these feelings but decided to date the ex regardless. The author is ending the friendship because of this. \n\nFrom an emotional perspective, the author has the right to feel hurt. Even if the breakup was a year ago, unresolved feelings can affect them. The friend's actions might be seen as crossing a boundary, especially after being informed of the author's feelings. The friend might have a responsibility to consider the author's emotions, given their ongoing friendship. \n\nHowever, the ex and the friend were involved in an accident a year prior. The friend waited a year to address the damage, which might have given the ex time to move on. The friend contacting her for repairs could be seen as a practical matter, but the subsequent dating might be a separate issue. \n\nThe friend did inform the author, which is a positive step. The author's response was to distance themselves, which is a personal choice. Whether this is justified depends on the friendship's nature and mutual respect. \n\nIn terms of moral wrong, it's subjective. The author isn't doing anything unethical by cutting off the friend. The friend might have considered the impact on the author, but people sometimes act in their own interest. The author's feelings are valid, even if the friend's actions weren't malicious. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong). The decision to distance oneself is a personal boundary, and the friend's actions, while perhaps inconsiderate, don't make the author the asshole. The author has the right to prioritize their emotional well-being.\n"
