I had a buddy of mine over the day she did it so I had some support when she left. When she left she back right into his car and damaged the bumper. A year later he finally contacts her to get it fixed. Apparently they started to hangout after. Yesterday he messaged me to inform me that they are going on a date in a few days. I replied back that I respected him for telling me that and that I will be taking a step back from being his friend. I wished him luck with her and stop replying.   \n\nMy friend and I have talked, gamed, gotten drinks throughout the year.  He knows I still have feelings for her but nonetheless he is taking her out. Am I the ass hole for being upset with my friend and wanting to distance myself from him? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong after their friend started dating their ex. The situation is that the author and their ex broke up a year ago. The ex moved out, and when she left, she damaged the friend's car. A year later, the friend contacted her to fix the bumper, and they ended up dating. The author is upset and is cutting ties with the friend. The question is whether the author is an asshole for doing that.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is still having feelings for their ex, which is mentioned. The friend knew about these feelings but still pursued a relationship with the ex. The author is taking a step back from the friendship because of this. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the friend might have thought it was okay to pursue the ex after a year. But the author is hurt because their friend is dating someone they still have feelings for. The friend didn't consult the author before moving on, which could be seen as insensitive. However, the friend did inform the author, which is a positive step. \n\nThe author's reaction is to distance themselves. That's a personal choice. People handle hurt feelings differently. The friend might not have considered the author's feelings when deciding to date the ex, but the author isn't wrong for being upset. Relationships can be complex, and exes sometimes reconnect. The key point is whether the friend acted with care. Since the author is still emotionally involved, the friend might have known that and still chose to proceed, which could be seen as a mistake. However, the author isn't the one at fault for feeling hurt and deciding to protect their emotions. So, the answer is likely B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
