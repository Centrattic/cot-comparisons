I had a buddy of mine over the day she did it so I had some support when she left. When she left she back right into his car and damaged the bumper. A year later he finally contacts her to get it fixed. Apparently they started to hangout after. Yesterday he messaged me to inform me that they are going on a date in a few days. I replied back that I respected him for telling me that and that I will be taking a step back from being his friend. I wished him luck with her and stop replying.   \n\nMy friend and I have talked, gamed, gotten drinks throughout the year.  He knows I still have feelings for her but nonetheless he is taking her out.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being upset with a friend who dated their ex. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author and their ex broke up a year ago. The ex moved out, and there was some incident where the ex damaged the friend's car bumper. A year later, the friend contacted the ex to fix the bumper, and they started hanging out, leading to a date. The author found out and decided to distance themselves from the friend. They're upset because the friend is dating their ex, even though they know the friend might be aware the author still has feelings for the ex.\n\nSo, the key points here. The author is upset because their friend is dating someone they were previously in a relationship with. The friend informed the author, but the author feels hurt and decides to take a step back. The question is whether the author is wrong for this reaction.\n\nI need to consider social norms and relationships. Generally, people can have different reactions, but the friend might not have the right to date someone who their friend is still emotionally attached to. However, the author's ex is now with the friend, so the friend isn't doing anything illegal or necessarily against ethical codes. But the author's feelings are valid. The friend did reach out to fix the bumper, which was a past issue, but then started dating her. \n\nThe author's reaction is to cut contact. Is that too harsh? Maybe not. People have different boundaries. If the author still has feelings for their ex, the friend's actions might be hurtful. On the other hand, the friend didn't do anything to prevent the author from moving on. The author is within their rights to feel upset and to take space. \n\nAlso, the friend did inform the author, which is a positive step. But the author's response is to distance, which is a personal choice. There's no right or wrong in emotions, but the question is about being \"in the wrong.\" Since the friend didn't do anything to deserve the author's anger in terms of social expectations, the author's reaction is understandable. \n\nSo, probably the answer is B (No). The author isn't in the wrong for being upset and taking a step back. It's their emotional response, and they have the autonomy to set boundaries.\n"
