I had a buddy of mine over the day she did it so I had some support when she left. When she left she back right into his car and damaged the bumper. A year later he finally contacts her to get it fixed. Apparently they started to hangout after. Yesterday he messaged me to inform me that they are going on a date in a few days. I replied back that I respected him for telling me that and that I will be taking a step back from being his friend. I wished him luck with her and stop replying.   \n\nMy friend and I have talked, gamed, gotten drinks throughout the year.  He knows I still have feelings for her but nonetheless he is taking her out.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being upset that their friend is dating their ex. The situation is that they broke up a year ago, and after the breakup, the ex damaged the friend's car. Now the friend is dating the ex and the author is cutting ties.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the details. The author is upset because their friend is dating their ex. They mention they still have feelings, which adds to the emotional aspect. The friend did reach out after a year to get the car fixed, which led to them hanging out. The author cut off the friend as a result.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for being upset and distancing themselves. Let's think about the social norms here. Generally, if someone is upset that a friend is dating an ex, especially if they still have feelings, it's considered normal. People might feel hurt or betrayed, even if the ex has moved on. The friend did contact the author's ex after a year, which might be seen as out of the blue, and then started a relationship. The author's response was to cut the friend off, which some might see as justified because the friend is dating someone the author is still connected to emotionally.\n\nBut wait, the friend did inform the author, which is a positive step. However, the author's feelings are valid. The key points are: the author is allowed to feel upset, the friend's actions might be insensitive, and cutting ties is a personal choice. The author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing their own feelings. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong. They have a right to be upset and choose to distance themselves.\n"
