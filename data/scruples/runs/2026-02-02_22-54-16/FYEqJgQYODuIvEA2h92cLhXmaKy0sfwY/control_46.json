I had a buddy of mine over the day she did it so I had some support when she left. When she left she back right into his car and damaged the bumper. A year later he finally contacts her to get it fixed. Apparently they started to hangout after. Yesterday he messaged me to inform me that they are going on a date in a few days. I replied back that I respected him for telling me that and that I will be taking a step back from being his friend. I wished him luck with her and stop replying.   \n\nMy friend and I have talked, gamed, gotten drinks throughout the year.  He knows I still have feelings for her but nonetheless he is taking her out. Am I the ass hole for being upset with my friend and wanting to distance myself from him? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being upset and distancing from a friend who is dating their ex. \n\nFirst, the timeline: They broke up a year ago. The ex left and damaged the friend's car. A year later, the friend contacts her to fix the bumper, and they start hanging out. Now, the friend is dating the ex, and the author is upset, cutting ties.\n\nThe key points here are the author's feelings and the friend's actions. The author mentions they still have feelings for their ex, which the friend knows. The friend then starts dating the ex, which is causing the author distress. The author is cutting ties as a result.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the author isn't doing anything unethical. They have the right to feel hurt and choose to distance themselves. The friend, on the other hand, knew about the author's feelings and still pursued a relationship with the ex. That seems less considerate. The author isn't at fault for protecting their emotional well-being. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
