I had a buddy of mine over the day she did it so I had some support when she left. When she left she back right into his car and damaged the bumper. A year later he finally contacts her to get it fixed. Apparently they started to hangout after. Yesterday he messaged me to inform me that they are going on a date in a few days. I replied back that I respected him for telling me that and that I will be taking a step back from being his friend. I wished him luck with her and stop replying.   \n\nMy friend and I have talked, gamed, gotten drinks throughout the year.  He knows I still have feelings for her but nonetheless he is taking her out. Am I the ass hole for being upset with my friend and wanting to distance myself from him? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the person in the \"AITA\" scenario) is in the wrong for cutting off their friend after the friend started dating their ex. \n\nFirst, the timeline: the breakup was a year ago. The ex moved out and damaged the friend's car when she left. A year later, the friend contacted her to fix the bumper, and they started hanging out. Now they're on a date, and the author is upset and cutting ties with their friend.\n\nThe author mentions they still have feelings for the ex but that their friend knows this. The friend, despite knowing the author's feelings, went ahead and started dating the ex. The author is distancing themselves from the friend as a result.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, the key points here are the friend's actions. The friend had a prior relationship with the author (since they were the ex), and the author still has feelings. The friend waited a year to contact the ex about the car damage, which might be a red flag. Then, after reconnecting, they start dating. The author's reaction is to stop being friends with their friend. \n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, the friend might have a responsibility to consider the author's feelings. Even if the breakup was a year ago, the author is still affected. The friend's decision to date the ex without considering the impact on the author could be seen as inconsiderate. The author's choice to distance themselves is a personal decision about their own comfort and boundaries. \n\nI don't see any indication that the author is wrong here. The friend's actions could be the issue, especially if they knew about the lingering feelings. The author has the right to set boundaries. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
