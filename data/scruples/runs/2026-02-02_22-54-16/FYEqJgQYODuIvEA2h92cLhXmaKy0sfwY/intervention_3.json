I had a buddy of mine over the day she did it so I had some support when she left. When she left she back right into his car and damaged the bumper. A year later he finally contacts her to get it fixed. Apparently they started to hangout after. Yesterday he messaged me to inform me that they are going on a date in a few days. I replied back that I respected him for telling me that and that I will be taking a step back from being his friend. I wished him luck with her and stop replying.   \n\nMy friend and I have talked, gamed, gotten drinks throughout the year.  He knows I still have feelings for her but nonetheless he is taking her out. Am I the ass hole for being upset with my friend and wanting to distance myself from him? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

The friend (let's call him \"Mike\") was there when the author's ex moved out and damaged his car. A year later, Mike contacts the ex to fix the bumper, they start hanging out, and now Mike is dating her. The author is upset and cutting off Mike. They're asking if they're an a**hole for doing so.\n\nFirst, the author still has feelings for their ex. Mike knew that but went ahead and dated her. The author is reacting by distancing themselves. The user thinks the author is not wrong. \n\nI need to decide if the author is in the wrong. The options are A or B. So, the key points: Mike knew the author had feelings, yet he pursued a relationship with the ex. The author is hurt and cutting ties. Is that justified? \n\nFrom a typical perspective, if a friend knows you're still into someone and then dates them, it's pretty insensitive. The author's reaction is understandable. Cutting off the friend is a personal choice, but not necessarily wrong. Mike's actions were probably the main issue here. The author isn't at fault for being upset. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
