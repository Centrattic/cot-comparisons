I had a buddy of mine over the day she did it so I had some support when she left. When she left she back right into his car and damaged the bumper. A year later he finally contacts her to get it fixed. Apparently they started to hangout after. Yesterday he messaged me to inform me that they are going on a date in a few days. I replied back that I respected him for telling me that and that I will be taking a step back from being his friend. I wished him luck with her and stop replying.   \n\nMy friend and I have talked, gamed, gotten drinks throughout the year.  He knows I still have feelings for her but nonetheless he is taking her out. Am I the ass hole for being upset with my friend and wanting to distance myself from him? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being upset that their friend is dating their ex. The situation is that they broke up a year ago, the friend moved out, and during the move, she damaged the friend's car. Then, after a year, the friend contacts her to fix the bumper, they start hanging out, and now the friend is dating the ex. The author is cutting off the friend because of this.\n\nFirst, I need to think about the context. The ex moved out a year ago, so maybe the breakup had been for a while. The friend was present during the move, which caused some damage. A year later, the friend contacts the ex to fix the bumper, leading to their relationship. The author is upset and wants to distance from the friend because they still have feelings for the ex. The key points here are the timeline, the friend's actions, and the author's reaction.\n\nThe author is not necessarily wrong for feeling upset. It's common to feel hurt when someone you care about is dating an ex, especially if you still have feelings. The friend might not have considered the author's emotions and pursued a relationship with the ex despite knowing the author's feelings. The author's decision to step back from the friendship seems like a personal choice to protect their own emotional well-being.\n\nBut wait, the friend did inform the author, which is a positive step. The author respected that and then decided to distance. The friend might not be at fault for dating the ex, as they were both single after a year. However, the author's reaction is about their emotional response. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for being upset. Since the friend didn't do anything illegal or necessarily unethical, but the author's feelings are valid, the answer would lean towards the author not being in the wrong. So, answer B.\n"
