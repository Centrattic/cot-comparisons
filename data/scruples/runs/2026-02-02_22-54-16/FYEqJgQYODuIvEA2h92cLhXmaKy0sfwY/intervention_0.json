I had a buddy of mine over the day she did it so I had some support when she left. When she left she back right into his car and damaged the bumper. A year later he finally contacts her to get it fixed. Apparently they started to hangout after. Yesterday he messaged me to inform me that they are going on a date in a few days. I replied back that I respected him for telling me that and that I will be taking a step back from being his friend. I wished him luck with her and stop replying.   \n\nMy friend and I have talked, gamed, gotten drinks throughout the year.  He knows I still have feelings for her but nonetheless he is taking her out. Am I the ass hole for being upset with my friend and wanting to distance myself from him? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being upset and distancing from their friend who is dating their ex. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author and their ex broke up a year ago. The ex left, and during that time, she damaged her friend's (the buddy) car. A year later, the buddy contacts her to fix the bumper, they start hanging out, and eventually, he takes her on a date. The author finds out, tells the friend they'll step back, and stops replying. The author is upset because they still have feelings for the ex.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nHmm. The author's reaction is understandable. They have feelings for the ex, and their friend is now dating her. The friend might have a responsibility to inform the author earlier, but he did reach out. The author's decision to distance themselves is a personal choice. But does that make them an asshole? \n\nThe friend knew the author had feelings for the ex but still chose to date her. The author's response is to step back, which is their right. They didn't lash out or confront the friend aggressively, just communicated their intention to distance. \n\nThe key points are: the author's feelings are valid, the friend's actions might be insensitive, but the author's reaction is a personal boundary. The author isn't causing harm here. So probably, the answer is B (not in the wrong). But I need to be careful. Sometimes people might think the author is overreacting, but emotionally, it's valid. Also, the friend's actions might have been careless, but the author's response is reasonable. So I think B is the right answer.\n"
