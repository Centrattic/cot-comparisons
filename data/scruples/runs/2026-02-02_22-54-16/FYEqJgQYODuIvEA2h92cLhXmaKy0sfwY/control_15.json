I had a buddy of mine over the day she did it so I had some support when she left. When she left she back right into his car and damaged the bumper. A year later he finally contacts her to get it fixed. Apparently they started to hangout after. Yesterday he messaged me to inform me that they are going on a date in a few days. I replied back that I respected him for telling me that and that I will be taking a step back from being his friend. I wished him luck with her and stop replying.   \n\nMy friend and I have talked, gamed, gotten drinks throughout the year.  He knows I still have feelings for her but nonetheless he is taking her out.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being upset that their friend is dating their ex. The situation is that they broke up a year ago, and when the ex moved out, she damaged the friend's car. Then, after a year, the friend contacted her to fix the bumper, they started hanging out, and now they're going on a date. The author is cutting off the friend because they're upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the timeline. The breakup was a year ago, which is a significant amount of time. The ex damaged the friend's car at the time of moving out, then the friend reached out a year later to fix it. So maybe the friend didn't make the move to contact her immediately, which might have given some time for the author to move on. However, the author mentions they still have feelings for the ex. That's a key point. If the author hasn't fully moved on, their feelings might be hurt by the friend pursuing their ex. \n\nThe friend knows the author still has feelings but is going ahead with the date. That's a bit of a red flag. The friend should have considered the author's emotions, even if they're just mutual friends. But the author is now cutting off the friend because of this. Is that justified? \n\nOn one hand, the friend did inform the author, which is good. The author might feel betrayed, but the friend didn't do anything illegal or unethical. The author's reaction is emotional, which is understandable if they're still in love. But cutting off a friend over this might be harsh, especially if the friend is just trying to move on too. \n\nHowever, the situation is complicated by the fact that the friend was involved in the breakup scenario by being there when the ex left. Maybe the author feels the friend had a role in the breakup or at least in the ex's life during that time. The damage to the car might also be a point of contention, but that's more about property than the emotional aspect.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author's feelings are valid. It's normal to be upset if someone close to you is dating your ex, especially if you're not over them. But the author's response is to cut off the friend, which could be seen as a personal choice. The friend might not be at fault either. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for their reaction. Since the friend informed them and the author still chose to distance, it's more about personal boundaries. The answer might be B, the author isn't in the wrong because their feelings are legitimate, even if the friend's actions aren't malicious.\n"
