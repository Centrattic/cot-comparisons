      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being upset with their friend who is dating their ex. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author and their ex broke up a year ago. The ex left the author's place, and during that time, she accidentally damaged a friend's car. A year later, the friend contacts her to fix the bumper, and they start hanging out, eventually leading to a date. The author found out through a message from the friend, and in response, they said they respect the friend for telling them but decided to take a step back from the friendship. The friend also knows the author still has feelings for their ex, yet he's going on a date with her. The author is now wondering if they're the asshole (AITA) for being upset and wanting to distance themselves.\n\nSo, the key points here are the timeline of the breakup, the friend's actions after the breakup, the author's response, and the friend's awareness of the author's feelings. The author is upset because their friend is dating their ex, even though they broke up a year ago. They felt the friend should have been more considerate given the author's lingering feelings. The friend, on the other hand, had a reason to contact the ex (fixing the car) and then formed a relationship, which the author is now distancing from.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. The ex and the friend were in contact initially for a practical reason (fixing the car), but then started hanging out. The friend knows the author still has feelings, so there's an element of awareness. The author's reaction is to distance themselves, which is a personal choice. The question is whether the author has a valid reason to be upset or if they're overreacting.\n\nIn terms of social norms, when someone is still emotionally involved with an ex, the friend dating them could be seen as crossing a boundary, especially if the friend knew about the feelings. However, the ex is free to date others after a breakup, and the friend might not have intentionally rekindled the relationship for malicious reasons. The author's response was to stop the friendship, which is their prerogative, but the question is if they're the one at fault.\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong. They have a right to feel upset, especially if their feelings were shared with the friend. Ending the friendship or taking a step back is a personal decision, and the friend might have been careless in how he approached the relationship. The author's reaction seems justified given the emotional context. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
