A year later he finally contacts her to get it fixed. Apparently they started to hangout after. Yesterday he messaged me to inform me that they are going on a date in a few days. I replied back that I respected him for telling me that and that I will be taking a step back from being his friend. I wished him luck with her and stop replying.   \n\nMy friend and I have talked, gamed, gotten drinks throughout the year.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being upset with their friend who dated their ex. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the timeline: The ex moved out a year ago, and during that time, the author had a friend over for support. The ex damaged the friend's car bumper when she left. A year later, the friend contacted the ex to fix the bumper, leading to them hanging out and now dating. The author found out and decided to distance themselves from the friend because they still have feelings for the ex.\n\nSo, the main points here. The author is upset because their friend is dating someone they're still emotionally attached to. The friend tried to inform them, which the author appreciated, but then chose to distance. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nHmm. Well, the author's feelings are valid. If someone is still in love with an ex and then their friend dates that ex, it's natural to feel hurt or upset. The author's reaction of stepping back from the friendship is a personal choice, and they have the right to set boundaries. The friend did contact them initially, which shows respect, but the situation is still tricky.\n\nIs the author wrong for being upset? Probably not. Emotional reactions are subjective. The friend might have made a poor choice, but the author's decision to distance is self-care. The key here is whether the author overstepped. They just stopped responding, which is their prerogative. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
