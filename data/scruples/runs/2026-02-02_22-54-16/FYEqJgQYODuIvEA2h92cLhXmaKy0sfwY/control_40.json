A year later he finally contacts her to get it fixed. Apparently they started to hangout after. Yesterday he messaged me to inform me that they are going on a date in a few days.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the question is in the wrong. The situation is about a friend dating their ex. The author broke up with their ex a year ago, and during the breakup, the ex damaged their friend's bumper. The friend waited a year and then started hanging out with the ex again. Now, the friend is going on a date with the ex, and the author is upset, deciding to distance themselves from the friend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The breakup happened a year ago, which is a significant amount of time. The author still has feelings for the ex, even though they've been trying to move on by talking, gaming, and getting drinks with the friend. The friend, knowing about these feelings, decided to date the ex. \n\nThe key points here are the friend's actions. The author had support from this friend during the breakup, which might mean the friend was aware of the emotional state at the time. Now, the friend is moving on to date the ex, which could be seen as a betrayal of trust, especially since the author is still emotionally involved. \n\nThe author's reaction is to distance themselves from the friend. The question is whether this reaction makes them the \"asshole.\" \n\nFrom an emotional standpoint, the author has every right to feel hurt and betrayed. The friend was part of their support system during the breakup, and now they're taking the ex out. The author's decision to step back is a personal choice to protect their own feelings. \n\nOn the other hand, the friend might feel that it's his right to pursue a relationship with someone he's interested in, especially since the breakup was a year ago. However, the friend's timing and the fact that he knew the author still had feelings could be seen as insensitive. \n\nThe damage to the car is a past event, but the friend only contacted the ex to fix it a year later. This delay might have given the friend time to develop feelings, but the author might see this as taking advantage of a vulnerable moment. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's more about the friend's actions than the author's reaction. The author isn't in the wrong for feeling upset and choosing to distance themselves. They are allowed to protect their emotional well-being. The friend's decision to date the ex, knowing the author's feelings, could be seen as the problematic part. \n\nSo, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because they have valid reasons to be upset and are acting to preserve their own mental health.\n"
