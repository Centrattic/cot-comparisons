I had a buddy of mine over the day she did it so I had some support when she left. When she left she back right into his car and damaged the bumper. A year later he finally contacts her to get it fixed. Apparently they started to hangout after. Yesterday he messaged me to inform me that they are going on a date in a few days. I replied back that I respected him for telling me that and that I will be taking a step back from being his friend. I wished him luck with her and stop replying.   \n\nMy friend and I have talked, gamed, gotten drinks throughout the year.  He knows I still have feelings for her but nonetheless he is taking her out. Am I the ass hole for being upset with my friend and wanting to distance myself from him? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author (ITA) is in the wrong for being upset that their friend is dating their ex. The situation is that they broke up a year ago, the ex left and damaged the friend's car. Then the friend contacted her to fix the bumper, they started hanging out, and now the friend is going on a date with her. The author is cutting off the friend because they're upset and still have feelings for the ex.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the timeline. The breakup was a year ago, which is a significant amount of time. The friend waited until now to contact the ex about the car damage, and then started dating her. The author is hurt because their friend is dating someone they're still emotionally attached to. \n\nThe friend did reach out to the author to inform them about the date, which is a positive step. The author respected that and then chose to distance themselves. The question is whether the author is justified in their reaction. \n\nIn terms of social norms, it's common for people to feel upset if someone they care about is dating an ex, especially if they're still not over them. The friend might have a right to date whoever they want, but the author's feelings are valid. The author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing their own emotional well-being by stepping back from the friendship. \n\nThe key points are the author's feelings, the time since the breakup, and the friend's actions. Since the author is not forcing the friend to do anything, just choosing to distance themselves, it seems reasonable. Therefore, the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
