I had a buddy of mine over the day she did it so I had some support when she left. When she left she back right into his car and damaged the bumper. A year later he finally contacts her to get it fixed. Apparently they started to hangout after. Yesterday he messaged me to inform me that they are going on a date in a few days. I replied back that I respected him for telling me that and that I will be taking a step back from being his friend. I wished him luck with her and stop replying.   \n\nMy friend and I have talked, gamed, gotten drinks throughout the year.  He knows I still have feelings for her but nonetheless he is taking her out. Am I the ass hole for being upset with my friend and wanting to distance myself from him? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person in the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a friend dating their ex. The author broke up with their ex a year ago, and during the breakup, the ex damaged their friend's car. Then, after a year, the friend contacted the ex to get the bumper fixed, and they started hanging out and now are dating. The author is upset and is cutting off the friend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the main points. The author and the friend were close, still interacted a lot even after the breakup. The author had feelings for the ex, and the friend knew that. The friend then started dating the ex, which the author is upset about.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the friend approached the ex to fix the car damage a year later. The ex was the one who damaged the car, so it makes sense the friend wanted to get that resolved. But then they started dating. The friend did inform the author before the date, so he was honest. The author is cutting off the friend because of this. \n\nThe key here is whether the friend overstepped. The friend knew the author still had feelings for the ex, but he still decided to date her. Even though he told the author, he could have considered how the author would feel. However, the author is also reacting by cutting off their friend. \n\nOn the other hand, the author has the right to be upset. If you have a friend who knows you're still emotionally involved with someone, and they choose to date that person despite knowing it might hurt you, it's understandable to be hurt. The friend's actions might have been thoughtless, even if he was honest.\n\nSo, the author is not in the wrong. The friend's actions were the issue here. The author is taking a stand to protect their own feelings. So the answer is B."
