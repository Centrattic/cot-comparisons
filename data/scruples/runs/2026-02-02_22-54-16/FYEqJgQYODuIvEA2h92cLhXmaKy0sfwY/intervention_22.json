I had a buddy of mine over the day she did it so I had some support when she left. When she left she back right into his car and damaged the bumper. A year later he finally contacts her to get it fixed. Apparently they started to hangout after. Yesterday he messaged me to inform me that they are going on a date in a few days. I replied back that I respected him for telling me that and that I will be taking a step back from being his friend. I wished him luck with her and stop replying.   \n\nMy friend and I have talked, gamed, gotten drinks throughout the year.  He knows I still have feelings for her but nonetheless he is taking her out. Am I the ass hole for being upset with my friend and wanting to distance myself from him? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being upset that their friend is dating their ex. The situation involves a breakup a year ago, some damage to a car when the ex moved out, and the friend contacting her to fix it. Now the friend is dating her, and the author is cutting ties.\n\nFirst, the author's feelings: they still have feelings for the ex, which the friend knows. The friend, despite that knowledge, is dating her. The author is upset and stepping back from the friendship. Is that justified?\n\nThe key points here are the timeline and the friend's awareness. The breakup was a year ago, and the author and friend have been in contact since. The friend waited a year to approach the ex, so there's a delay in reconnecting. However, the friend knew about the author's lingering feelings. The act of dating someone that a friend still has feelings for can be seen as insensitive. The author's reaction is to distance themselves, which is a personal choice. \n\nIs the author in the wrong for being upset? Probably not. They have the right to feel hurt or upset. The friend, on the other hand, might be at fault for not considering the author's feelings. The author's decision to step back is their choice, and they're not obligated to maintain a friendship that's causing them distress. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. They're justified in their feelings and actions given the circumstances.\n"
