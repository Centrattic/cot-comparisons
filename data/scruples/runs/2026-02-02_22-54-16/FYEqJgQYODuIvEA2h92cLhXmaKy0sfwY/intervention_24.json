I had a buddy of mine over the day she did it so I had some support when she left. When she left she back right into his car and damaged the bumper. A year later he finally contacts her to get it fixed. Apparently they started to hangout after. Yesterday he messaged me to inform me that they are going on a date in a few days. I replied back that I respected him for telling me that and that I will be taking a step back from being his friend. I wished him luck with her and stop replying.   \n\nMy friend and I have talked, gamed, gotten drinks throughout the year.  He knows I still have feelings for her but nonetheless he is taking her out. Am I the ass hole for being upset with my friend and wanting to distance myself from him? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being upset and distancing from their friend who is dating their ex. Let's break down the situation step by step.\n\nFirst, the author and their ex broke up a year ago. The ex moved out, and during that time, she damaged the friend's car. A year later, the friend contacts her to fix the bumper, and they start hanging out, leading to a date. The author finds out and cuts off the friend. The key points here are the timeline and the actions taken by each person.\n\nThe user thinks the author is not in the wrong. I need to check if the author's reaction is justified. The friend waited a year to contact the ex. A year is a significant amount of time, so from an objective standpoint, the friend might have thought it was appropriate. However, the author still has feelings for the ex, and the friend knew about these feelings. The friend's decision to date the ex could be seen as insensitive, especially since they had a prior relationship.\n\nThe author's response was to distance themselves from the friend. Is that fair? The friend did inform the author, so he tried to be respectful. The author's reaction is about protecting their own feelings. In such cases, people often take time to move on, and even after a year, it can be painful. The friend might have acted without considering the author's emotional state, even if he wasn't obligated to do so. \n\nOn the other hand, the friend might have thought that a year was enough time and that he had a right to pursue a relationship with someone he had a connection with. However, since the author was still affected and the friend knew this, the action could be seen as thoughtless. The author's right to set boundaries is important. The friend's actions caused emotional harm, so the author's decision to step back makes sense. \n\nSo, considering all factors, the author is not in the wrong. The friend's actions, while perhaps not malicious, were inconsiderate given the author's known feelings. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
