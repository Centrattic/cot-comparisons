I had a buddy of mine over the day she did it so I had some support when she left. When she left she back right into his car and damaged the bumper. A year later he finally contacts her to get it fixed. Apparently they started to hangout after. Yesterday he messaged me to inform me that they are going on a date in a few days. I replied back that I respected him for telling me that and that I will be taking a step back from being his friend. I wished him luck with her and stop replying.   \n\nMy friend and I have talked, gamed, gotten drinks throughout the year.  He knows I still have feelings for her but nonetheless he is taking her out. Am I the ass hole for being upset with my friend and wanting to distance myself from him? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being upset that their friend is dating their ex. The situation is that they broke up a year ago, the ex left and damaged the friend's car. A year later, the friend contacted the ex to fix the bumper, they started hanging out, and now they're going on a date. The author told the friend they're stepping back from the friendship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the timeline. A year after the breakup, the friend reached out to the ex. The author has been friends with this person for a while, even though they knew the author still had feelings for the ex. The friend didn't ask for the author's opinion before dating the ex. The author is upset and cutting ties, which they feel is justified.\n\nEmotionally, it's natural to feel hurt when someone you're close to dates an ex, especially if there are lingering feelings. The author is being honest about their feelings, which is important. The friend might have thought there were no feelings left, but the author's reaction shows there still are. The friend could have been more considerate, but the author isn't wrong for feeling this way. The key here is the friend's actions versus the author's response. The author isn't attacking the friend but setting boundaries, which is a healthy response. So, the answer is B (No).\n"
