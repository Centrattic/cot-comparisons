I had a buddy of mine over the day she did it so I had some support when she left. When she left she back right into his car and damaged the bumper. A year later he finally contacts her to get it fixed. Apparently they started to hangout after. Yesterday he messaged me to inform me that they are going on a date in a few days. I replied back that I respected him for telling me that and that I will be taking a step back from being his friend. I wished him luck with her and stop replying.   \n\nMy friend and I have talked, gamed, gotten drinks throughout the year.  He knows I still have feelings for her but nonetheless he is taking her out. Am I the ass hole for being upset with my friend and wanting to distance myself from him? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation is that the author's friend dated their ex after a breakup. The ex damaged the friend's bumper when moving out, and a year later, the friend reached out to get it fixed, leading to them hanging out and now dating. The author is upset and cutting off the friend.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the dynamics here. The author and ex broke up a year ago, and the author still has feelings. The friend knew about these feelings but went ahead with dating the ex. The author is responding by distancing themselves from the friend. \n\nThe key points are: Did the friend do something wrong by dating the ex? The friend might have done that, but the question is about the author. The author is upset and cutting off the friend. Is that justified?\n\nEmotionally, it's understandable for the author to be hurt. They still have feelings for the ex, and the friend chose to pursue a relationship with someone the author wasn't over. The friend might not be in the right here, but the author's reaction is about their own emotions. The author is not being cruel; they're protecting their feelings by stepping back. \n\nIs cutting off a friend a harsh response? Maybe, but people have different boundaries. The author isn't attacking the friend, just distancing. The friend might have overstepped by pursuing the ex despite knowing the author's feelings. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. They have a right to be upset and set boundaries. The answer should be B, No.\n"
