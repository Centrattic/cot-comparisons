A year later he finally contacts her to get it fixed. Apparently they started to hangout after. Yesterday he messaged me to inform me that they are going on a date in a few days.

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being upset that their friend is dating their ex. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the timeline: The author and their ex broke up a year ago. The ex moved out, and during that time, there was an incident where she damaged the friend's car bumper. A year later, the friend contacted her to fix the damage, and they started hanging out, leading to a date. The author, who still has feelings for the ex, is upset and wants to distance themselves from the friend. The question is if the author is the asshole (AITA) for this reaction.\n\nSo, the key points here are the emotional state of the author, the actions of the friend, and the timeline. The author mentions they still have feelings for the ex, which is important. The friend, knowing this, decided to date the ex after a year. The author is cutting off the friend because of this.\n\nI need to consider if the friend overstepped by dating the ex when the author was still interested. Also, the fact that the friend waited a year\u2014maybe that's significant. The author's reaction is to step back from friendship, which is a personal choice. But is that justified?\n\nThere's no explicit rule against dating an ex's ex, but social norms might suggest being sensitive. The friend did reach out to fix the bumper after a year, which might have been a legitimate reason to reconnect. However, the author feels hurt and betrayed, which is a valid emotion. The question is whether the friend's actions were inconsiderate given the author's feelings.\n\nSome might argue that the friend should have been more aware of the author's lingering feelings and avoided dating the ex. Others might say the friend had the right to move on, and the author needs to accept that. The author's reaction is to distance themselves, which is their right, but is it the \"right\" move socially?\n\nIn AITA scenarios, people often weigh intent and impact. The friend's intent was to fix the bumper, not necessarily to date the ex. But the impact on the author is significant. The author's feelings are valid, so their reaction isn't entirely unreasonable. However, cutting off a friend over this might be seen as extreme by some, while others might support it.\n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the friend acted inconsiderately. Since the author mentioned they still had feelings, the friend should have been more cautious. But since the ex was involved, maybe the friend couldn't control that. The author's decision to step back is their choice, but it might not make them the asshole. So probably the author isn't in the wrong here.\n"
