A year later he finally contacts her to get it fixed. Apparently they started to hangout after. Yesterday he messaged me to inform me that they are going on a date in a few days.

I wished him luck with her and stop replying.   \n\nMy friend and I have talked, gamed, gotten drinks throughout the year.

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's break down the situation step by step.\n\nFirst, the author and their ex broke up a year ago. The ex moved out, and during that time, there was some damage to the friend's car. The friend waited a year before contacting the ex about fixing the bumper. Then, they started hanging out and eventually went on a date. The author finds out and decides to distance themselves from the friend because they still have feelings for the ex. The question is whether the author is the asshole (AITA) for being upset and cutting off the friend.\n\nHmm. The key points here are the timing and the friend's actions. The friend waited a year to contact the ex about the car damage. That seems odd. If the bumper was damaged a year ago, maybe there was a reason the friend didn't fix it sooner. Maybe the friend had a change of heart or was waiting for a good time. But then, starting a relationship with someone who is or was your friend's ex could be problematic.\n\nThe author still has feelings for the ex, so the friend's actions might be seen as crossing a line. The friend knew about the author's feelings but still decided to date the ex. That could be a breach of trust. Friends are supposed to respect each other's boundaries. If the friend was aware that the author wasn't over the ex, moving on so quickly might be insensitive.\n\nOn the other hand, the friend might have had their own reasons. Maybe they were trying to resolve the car issue first and then realized they had feelings for the ex. Or maybe they didn't know the extent of the author's feelings. But the author mentions that they've been talking, gaming, and getting drinks throughout the year. The friend had time to consider the author's feelings and still chose to proceed. \n\nThe author's reaction is to distance themselves. That's understandable given the situation. The friend's actions might have been insensitive, so the author isn't the one at fault here. The friend's choice to date the ex despite knowing the author's feelings is the main issue. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
