A year later he finally contacts her to get it fixed. Apparently they started to hangout after. Yesterday he messaged me to inform me that they are going on a date in a few days.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. So the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being upset with their friend who started dating their ex. The situation is that the ex and the friend were involved after the breakup, the friend contacted her to fix a bumper that was damaged a year ago, and then they started hanging out and now are dating. The author is cutting off the friend because of this.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the dynamics here. The author and their ex broke up a year ago. After the breakup, the ex left and damaged the friend's car. The friend waited a year to contact her about fixing the bumper. During that year, the author and the friend continued to interact normally. Now, the friend told the author about the date with the ex, and the author is upset and cutting them off.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? The key points to consider are the timing and the friend's actions. The friend didn't approach the ex immediately. There was a year-long gap before the friend reached out, possibly just to fix the car. The friend might have had no intention of dating her at first. However, after the contact, they started hanging out. The author has still unresolved feelings for the ex, which makes this situation painful.\n\nThe author's response is to distance themselves from the friend. The question is whether this is justified. The friend didn't know the author still had feelings, but they did start a relationship with the ex. Depending on cultural norms and personal boundaries, some might say the friend overstepped. However, others might argue that the author needs to deal with their own feelings and isn't in the right to punish the friend for dating someone they're no longer with.\n\nBut here's a twist: the friend didn't know the author still had feelings, right? The author mentions that the friend knows they still have feelings, but the friend proceeded anyway. Wait, the author says the friend knows they still have feelings but went ahead. So the friend might be aware and still chose to date the ex. That's a key point. If the friend knew the author's feelings and still went ahead, that's more of a betrayal. If they didn't know, maybe the author has a right to be upset, but the answer might be different.\n\nWait, the original statement says: \"My friend and I have talked, gamed, gotten drinks throughout the year. He knows I still have feelings for her but nonetheless he is taking her out.\" So the friend is aware of the author's feelings but went ahead. That's a problem. The friend's actions here could be seen as disrespectful towards the author's feelings. Therefore, the author's reaction is understandable. They are cutting off the friend because they feel betrayed.\n\nIn that case, the author is not in the wrong. The friend's actions were a breach of trust or at least a lack of consideration. The author's response is a personal choice to protect their own emotional state. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
