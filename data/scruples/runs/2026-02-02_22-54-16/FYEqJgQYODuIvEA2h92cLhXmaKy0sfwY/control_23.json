I had a buddy of mine over the day she did it so I had some support when she left. When she left she back right into his car and damaged the bumper. A year later he finally contacts her to get it fixed. Apparently they started to hangout after. Yesterday he messaged me to inform me that they are going on a date in a few days. I replied back that I respected him for telling me that and that I will be taking a step back from being his friend. I wished him luck with her and stop replying.   \n\nMy friend and I have talked, gamed, gotten drinks throughout the year.  He knows I still have feelings for her but nonetheless he is taking her out. Am I the ass hole for being upset with my friend and wanting to distance myself from him? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being upset and cutting off their friend who dated their ex. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the timeline: They broke up a year ago. The ex left, damaged the friend's car. Then a year later, the friend contacts the ex to fix the bumper, and they start hanging out. Now the friend is dating the ex, and the author is cutting them off.\n\nThe author mentions they still have feelings for the ex. The friend told them about the date, and the author is upset, so they're distancing themselves. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nHmm. Well, the author isn't in a relationship with the friend. They're upset that their friend is dating their ex. But the friend did inform them, which is good. The author's reaction is based on their own feelings. People have different boundaries. The author isn't the one who was wronged here; the ex and the friend might have their own history. The author is prioritizing their emotional well-being by stepping back. That's their right. So probably the answer is B, not in the wrong.\n"
