I had a buddy of mine over the day she did it so I had some support when she left. When she left she back right into his car and damaged the bumper. A year later he finally contacts her to get it fixed. Apparently they started to hangout after. Yesterday he messaged me to inform me that they are going on a date in a few days. I replied back that I respected him for telling me that and that I will be taking a step back from being his friend. I wished him luck with her and stop replying.   \n\nMy friend and I have talked, gamed, gotten drinks throughout the year.  He knows I still have feelings for her but nonetheless he is taking her out.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being upset with their friend who is dating their ex. The situation is that they broke up a year ago, and during the breakup, the friend's car was damaged. The friend didn't contact the ex until a year later, and then they started hanging out and eventually dated. The author is cutting off the friend because of this. The question is whether the author is the asshole (AITA) or not.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author is still upset about the breakup, and their friend is now dating the ex. The author is cutting off the friend because of this. The friend did inform the author about the date, which the author appreciated but then decided to distance themselves. The friend was aware that the author still had feelings for the ex.\n\nFrom an emotional standpoint, the author is justified in feeling hurt. If someone is still in love with an ex and then sees that the friend is dating the ex, it's natural to feel upset. The friend might have a responsibility to consider the author's feelings, especially if they knew the author wasn't over it. However, the friend also has the right to move on and form relationships. The timeline is a year, which isn't an extremely long time, so maybe the author is still processing the breakup. \n\nThe author's reaction is to step back from the friendship. That's a personal choice and might be seen as self-preservation. It's not necessarily being in the wrong. The friend did reach out to fix the car issue, which was a year later, and then started dating the ex. The author's decision to distance themselves isn't malicious but rather a way to protect their feelings. \n\nI need to check if the author is overreacting. The friend tried to be respectful by informing them, which the author acknowledged. The author's choice to step back is their own, and it's not uncommon for people in such situations to need space. The friend might not have intended to hurt the author but was aware of their feelings and still chose to date the ex. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B (No).\n"
