A year later he finally contacts her to get it fixed. Apparently they started to hangout after. Yesterday he messaged me to inform me that they are going on a date in a few days.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being upset that their friend is dating their ex. Let's break down the situation step by step.\n\nFirst, the author and their ex broke up a year ago. The ex moved out, and when she left, she backed into the friend's car, damaging the bumper. Then, a year later, the friend contacts her to get the bumper fixed. After that, they start hanging out and eventually go on a date. The author finds out and tells their friend they're going to step back from the friendship, then stops replying. The author is upset because they still have feelings for their ex, and they feel the friend is taking advantage of the situation.\n\nHmm, so the key points here are: the ex and friend started hanging out after a year, the friend waited a year to fix the bumper, and the author still has feelings. The author is cutting off the friend because of this. Is the author in the wrong?\n\nWell, the author isn't doing anything illegal or unethical. They're just expressing their feelings and choosing to distance themselves. The friend did reach out to the ex after a long time, which might have been a mistake. The author's reaction is emotional but not necessarily wrong. People have different ways of handling breakups. The fact that the author still has feelings might make them sensitive to this situation. The friend might have known about the author's feelings and still went ahead, which could be the friend's fault. The author's decision to step back is a personal choice and not an attack on the friend. So I think the answer would be B, the author isn't in the wrong here.\n"
