A year later he finally contacts her to get it fixed. Apparently they started to hangout after. Yesterday he messaged me to inform me that they are going on a date in a few days. I replied back that I respected him for telling me that and that I will be taking a step back from being his friend. I wished him luck with her and stop replying.   \n\nMy friend and I have talked, gamed, gotten drinks throughout the year.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being upset with their friend who started dating their ex. The situation is that they broke up a year ago, and the ex damaged their friend's car when leaving. Then, after a year, the friend contacted the ex to fix the car, they started hanging out, and now they're dating. The author is cutting off the friend because they're upset and still have feelings for the ex.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The author and their ex broke up a year ago. The ex moved out, and when she left, she backed into the friend's car. The friend waited a year to contact her about fixing the bumper. They started hanging out, leading to a date. The author is upset because their friend is dating their ex, even though they mentioned they still have feelings. The author is cutting off the friend.\n\nNow, considering if the author is in the wrong. The main issue is the friend dating the ex after the breakup. The author's reaction is being upset and distancing themselves. The question is whether this reaction is justified. \n\nIn terms of emotional response, it's natural to feel hurt if someone you're close to dates an ex, especially if you still have feelings. The author might be prioritizing their own emotional well-being by stepping back. The friend did reach out to inform the author, which is respectful. The author's response was to say they respected that and then step back, which seems reasonable. The friend might not have the same emotional attachment to the author's feelings as the author does, so the author's decision to distance isn't necessarily wrong.\n\nLooking at the actions: The author isn't doing anything harmful, just setting a boundary. The friend and ex are making their own choices, which the author can't control. The author's reaction is self-care. So the answer would likely be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
