I had a buddy of mine over the day she did it so I had some support when she left. When she left she back right into his car and damaged the bumper. A year later he finally contacts her to get it fixed. Apparently they started to hangout after. Yesterday he messaged me to inform me that they are going on a date in a few days. I replied back that I respected him for telling me that and that I will be taking a step back from being his friend. I wished him luck with her and stop replying.   \n\nMy friend and I have talked, gamed, gotten drinks throughout the year.  He knows I still have feelings for her but nonetheless he is taking her out. Am I the ass hole for being upset with my friend and wanting to distance myself from him? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author had a breakup with their ex, and then their friend started dating the ex. The friend told the author about the date, and the author decided to step back from the friendship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the timeline. The breakup was a year ago. The author had a friend over when the ex moved out, which might have been a support system. The ex damaged the friend's car then. A year later, the friend contacts the ex to fix the bumper, and they start hanging out. Now, the author is upset because the friend is dating their ex, even though the author still has feelings. The author cut off contact with the friend.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is wrong for being upset and stepping back. The author mentions they respect the friend for informing them but are choosing to distance. The key points here are the author's feelings, the friend's actions, and the timing.\n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because it's understandable to feel hurt when someone close dates an ex, especially if you still have feelings. The friend knew about the author's feelings but chose to date the ex anyway. The author cutting back isn't necessarily wrong; people can choose their relationships and boundaries. The friend didn't make the author's breakup worse, but the situation is sensitive. The fact that the friend waited a year might be a point in their favor, but the author's right to be upset is valid. So the answer should be B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
