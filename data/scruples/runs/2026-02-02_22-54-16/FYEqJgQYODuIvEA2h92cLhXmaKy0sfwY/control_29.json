I had a buddy of mine over the day she did it so I had some support when she left. When she left she back right into his car and damaged the bumper. A year later he finally contacts her to get it fixed. Apparently they started to hangout after. Yesterday he messaged me to inform me that they are going on a date in a few days. I replied back that I respected him for telling me that and that I will be taking a step back from being his friend. I wished him luck with her and stop replying.   \n\nMy friend and I have talked, gamed, gotten drinks throughout the year.  He knows I still have feelings for her but nonetheless he is taking her out. Am I the ass hole for being upset with my friend and wanting to distance myself from him? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being upset that their friend is dating their ex. The situation is that they broke up a year ago, and the ex left in a hurry, damaging the friend's car. A year later, the friend contacts the ex to fix the bumper, and they start hanging out again. Now the author is cutting off the friend because they're upset.\n\nFirst, the author's feelings are valid. It's natural to feel hurt when someone close to you starts a relationship with an ex, especially if you still have feelings. The friend did reach out to inform the author, which shows some consideration. However, the author is choosing to distance themselves, which is a personal choice. \n\nThe key points here are the author's right to their emotions and the friend's actions. The friend might have known the author still had feelings but proceeded anyway. The author's decision to step back isn't necessarily wrong because they're prioritizing their own emotional well-being. The friend's behavior could be seen as thoughtless, but the author isn't at fault for reacting this way. \n\nAlso, the timeline is a year after the breakup. While a year is a long time, it's not uncommon for people to still feel attached. The author isn't obligated to maintain a friendship if it's causing them distress. The friend might feel the author is overreacting, but the author's choice to protect their feelings is justified. \n\nIn summary, the author isn't in the wrong for distancing themselves from the friend after the friend started a relationship with their ex. The friend might have acted without considering the author's feelings, but the author's reaction is a personal decision they have the right to make. So the answer should be B.\n"
