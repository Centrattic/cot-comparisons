I had a buddy of mine over the day she did it so I had some support when she left. When she left she back right into his car and damaged the bumper. A year later he finally contacts her to get it fixed. Apparently they started to hangout after. Yesterday he messaged me to inform me that they are going on a date in a few days. I replied back that I respected him for telling me that and that I will be taking a step back from being his friend. I wished him luck with her and stop replying.   \n\nMy friend and I have talked, gamed, gotten drinks throughout the year.  He knows I still have feelings for her but nonetheless he is taking her out.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being upset that their friend is dating their ex. The situation is that they broke up a year ago, and the ex damaged the friend's car when she moved out. A year later, the friend contacted her to fix the bumper, and they started hanging out. Now, the friend is going on a date with her, and the author is cutting them off.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is still upset about the breakup, which is understandable. They had support from their friend during the breakup, so the friend's timing in contacting the ex might be sensitive. The friend did inform the author, which is a point in their favor, but the author feels hurt and wants to distance themselves.\n\nThe key points are: the author has feelings for the ex, the friend knew about this, yet still pursued a relationship with the ex. The friend's actions might be seen as crossing a boundary, but the author's reaction is to distance themselves. \n\nIs the author in the wrong for being upset? Emotionally, it's valid to be hurt. People need to respect others' feelings, but the friend might have thought it was resolved. However, the author's choice to step back is their right. They aren't obligated to stay friends if they're uncomfortable. The friend did make an effort to inform them, which is good, but the situation is complex. \n\nThe question is whether the author is the asshole. From the description, the author is reacting to being hurt, which is a natural response. The friend might have misjudged the situation, but the author isn't in the wrong for protecting their own emotions. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
