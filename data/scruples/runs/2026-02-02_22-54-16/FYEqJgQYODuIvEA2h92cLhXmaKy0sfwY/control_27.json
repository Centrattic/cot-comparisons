I had a buddy of mine over the day she did it so I had some support when she left. When she left she back right into his car and damaged the bumper. A year later he finally contacts her to get it fixed. Apparently they started to hangout after. Yesterday he messaged me to inform me that they are going on a date in a few days. I replied back that I respected him for telling me that and that I will be taking a step back from being his friend. I wished him luck with her and stop replying.   \n\nMy friend and I have talked, gamed, gotten drinks throughout the year.  He knows I still have feelings for her but nonetheless he is taking her out.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong here. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author's ex moved out a year ago. The author had a friend over for support when the ex left, and the ex hit the friend's car, damaging the bumper. A year later, the friend contacts the ex to get the bumper fixed, and they start hanging out. Now, the friend is dating the author's ex, and the author is upset and wants to distance themselves from the friend. The question is whether the author is the asshole.\n\nSo, the key points here: the author still has feelings for the ex, which they've mentioned to their friend. The friend, knowing that, decides to date the ex. The author is upset and cutting off the friend. Let me think about the ethics here.\n\nThe friend knew about the author's feelings and chose to pursue a relationship with the ex anyway. That could be seen as betraying the trust of the friendship. Even if the ex is technically available, the friend might have been aware of the emotional impact this would have on the author. The fact that the ex damaged the friend's car initially might be a red flag, but that's not the main issue here.\n\nThe author's reaction is understandable. They feel hurt and are choosing to step back from the friendship. Is it their fault for being upset? Probably not. The friend's actions, knowing the author's feelings, might be the bigger issue. The author isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries and protecting their emotional well-being. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. The friend's actions are more questionable here. The author is justified in their feelings and response.\n"
