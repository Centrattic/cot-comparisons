      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is: the author had a breakup a year ago, and their ex moved out. The author had a friend over when the ex left, and the ex accidentally damaged the friend's car bumper. Then a year later, the friend contacts the ex to get the bumper fixed, and they started hanging out. Now the friend is dating the ex and the author is upset, so they're cutting ties with the friend. The question is whether the author is the asshole (AITA).\n\nFirst, the author mentions they still have feelings for their ex. That's important. The friend and ex connected a year later to fix the bumper. Maybe the friend was just being responsible. But then they started dating? The author is cut off from the friend because they're upset. \n\nThe author's friend knew they had feelings for the ex, which the author says. But the friend still went ahead and dated her. So maybe the friend should have been more considerate? The initial damage was accidental, and the friend waited a year to contact her. But maybe the friend thought the author had moved on. However, the author explicitly told the friend about their lingering feelings, so the friend might have known it could be a sensitive issue. \n\nThe author's reaction is to step back from the friendship. Is that justified? The author isn't in a relationship with the ex anymore, so the friend isn't violating any current relationship. But the author is still emotionally attached. The friend might have overstepped by pursuing a romantic relationship with someone the author is still close to. However, the friend might also feel that the author has moved on, and the author's reaction is too harsh. \n\nBut the key points are: the ex was the one who reached out first to fix the bumper, which led to hanging out and dating. The friend didn't initiate contact until a year later, and then only for a practical reason. The author's friend might not have intended to cause harm but did so by pursuing a relationship. The author's decision to distance themselves is a personal choice, but is it wrong? \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author is not in a position to control their friend's romantic choices once they're no longer with the ex. The author is allowed to feel upset, but cutting off a friend solely because they dated an ex could be seen as overly possessive, especially if the author isn't in a current relationship with the ex. However, if the friend knew about the lingering feelings and still chose to date her, maybe that's the friend's fault. \n\nBut the author's action is about their own emotional response. They have the right to step back if they feel hurt. It's not about being wrong, but about the friend respecting their feelings. The answer might depend on the friend's awareness. Since the author says the friend knew they had feelings, the friend should have been more cautious. Therefore, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. So the answer is B (No).\n"
