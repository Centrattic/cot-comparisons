I had a buddy of mine over the day she did it so I had some support when she left. When she left she back right into his car and damaged the bumper. A year later he finally contacts her to get it fixed. Apparently they started to hangout after. Yesterday he messaged me to inform me that they are going on a date in a few days. I replied back that I respected him for telling me that and that I will be taking a step back from being his friend. I wished him luck with her and stop replying.   \n\nMy friend and I have talked, gamed, gotten drinks throughout the year.  He knows I still have feelings for her but nonetheless he is taking her out. Am I the ass hole for being upset with my friend and wanting to distance myself from him? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being upset and cutting off a friend who started dating their ex. \n\nFirst, the timeline: They broke up a year ago. The ex left, and during that time, the friend was over. The ex damaged the friend's car. A year later, the friend contacts her to fix the bumper, and they start hanging out, eventually dating. The author is upset, tells the friend they want to step back, and stops responding. \n\nThe author's reasoning: They still have feelings for the ex, the friend knew this, yet chose to date her. The author is distancing themselves. \n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, the friend did reach out to fix a car issue from a year ago, which could be seen as a simple matter. But then they started hanging out and dating. The author feels hurt because the friend knew about their feelings and went ahead anyway. \n\nThe key points here are: Did the friend owe the author any consideration? If the friend was aware of the author's lingering feelings, then perhaps there's an expectation of some discretion. But the friend isn't the one who was in a relationship with the author's ex; the ex was. The friend might have thought it was okay to move on, especially a year after the breakup. \n\nHowever, the author's reaction is to cut off the friend. Is that justified? People might see it as the author punishing the friend for dating someone who is now available. Others might think the friend had no obligation to avoid dating the ex, so the author is overreacting. \n\nBut the author isn't the one who broke up with the ex; the ex left. The author might still be in the process of moving on, and the friend's actions could feel like a betrayal. The friend's decision to date the ex, knowing the author's feelings, could be seen as insensitive. \n\nSo, the author's reaction isn't necessarily wrong. They have the right to feel hurt and want to create distance. The friend might not have done anything wrong by dating the ex, but the way they handled it, knowing the author's feelings, might have been inconsiderate. \n\nTherefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
