I had a buddy of mine over the day she did it so I had some support when she left. When she left she back right into his car and damaged the bumper. A year later he finally contacts her to get it fixed. Apparently they started to hangout after. Yesterday he messaged me to inform me that they are going on a date in a few days. I replied back that I respected him for telling me that and that I will be taking a step back from being his friend. I wished him luck with her and stop replying.   \n\nMy friend and I have talked, gamed, gotten drinks throughout the year.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author's friend is dating their ex. The ex broke up with the author a year ago, moved out, and there was some damage to the friend's car. A year later, the friend contacts the ex to fix the bumper, and now they're going on a date. The author is upset and cutting ties with the friend. The user thinks the author isn't wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to break this down. The key points are: the author's ex is now dating their friend. The friend waited a year to contact the ex, maybe to fix car damage. They started hanging out, then the friend informed the author about the date. The author is cutting ties because they're upset, even though they said they respected the friend for telling them.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for distancing themselves. The options are A (yes) or B (no). The user thinks B. \n\nI need to consider if the friend did something wrong. The friend waited a year to contact the ex. Maybe the timing is relevant. A year after a breakup, the ex is probably allowed to date someone else. The friend might have thought it was okay since it's been a year. The author still has feelings for the ex, which complicates things. The friend informed the author, which is considerate, and then the author is cutting ties. \n\nIs there a betrayal here? The friend didn't do anything to the author before. The car damage was from when the ex left, not the friend. The friend's actions now are about dating the ex. The author is upset because the friend is dating their ex. But is that the friend's fault? The ex is free to date someone else. The friend might be in a new relationship that the author is not comfortable with. \n\nThe author is taking a step back from the friendship. Is that justified? If the author is still emotionally attached, maybe they need time to process. The friend didn't do anything illegal or morally wrong. He might have even done the right thing by informing the author. \n\nSo, the friend isn't in the wrong here. The author is upset, which is understandable, but cutting ties might be their own emotional response. The author isn't in the wrong for feeling that way, but maybe the friend isn't at fault either. The answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because the author has the right to feel upset and manage their own relationships. The friend's actions don't necessarily make him at fault here.\n"
