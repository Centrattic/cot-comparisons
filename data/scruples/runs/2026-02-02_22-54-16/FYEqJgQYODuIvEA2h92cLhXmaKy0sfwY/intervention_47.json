A year later he finally contacts her to get it fixed. Apparently they started to hangout after. Yesterday he messaged me to inform me that they are going on a date in a few days. I replied back that I respected him for telling me that and that I will be taking a step back from being his friend. I wished him luck with her and stop replying.   \n\nMy friend and I have talked, gamed, gotten drinks throughout the year.  He knows I still have feelings for her but nonetheless he is taking her out.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for getting upset with their friend who is dating their ex. The situation involves a past relationship that ended a year ago. The ex left the author's place and damaged the friend's car. A year later, the friend contacts the ex to fix the bumper, leading to them hanging out and eventually dating.\n\nThe author feels upset because their friend is now dating the ex, even though they've still had contact and interactions with the author throughout the year. The author cut ties with the friend after finding out about the date.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider both sides.\n\nFirst, the author's perspective: They were in a year-long relationship with the ex, which ended a year ago. The friend knew the author still had feelings for the ex. The friend then started dating the ex after some time. The author feels betrayed or hurt and decides to distance themselves. From an emotional standpoint, it's reasonable to feel upset, especially if the friend knew about the feelings and proceeded anyway. The friend's actions might be seen as crossing a line by dating someone the author is still emotionally connected to.\n\nOn the other hand, the friend's actions: They waited a year after the breakup before contacting the ex to fix the car. The initial contact was about a damaged bumper, which was a practical matter. If the friend had no prior knowledge that the author was still interested in the ex, then their actions might be more understandable. However, the friend did know about the author's feelings, which complicates things. If the friend was aware and still chose to date the ex, that could be seen as disloyal to the author's friendship.\n\nThe key factors here are the timeline and the friend's knowledge. The friend had ongoing interactions with the author during the year after the breakup, indicating they were aware of the author's situation. Then, after a year, they start dating the ex. The author's decision to distance themselves is a personal choice, and it's their right to feel upset. The friend's actions might be seen as insensitive if they knew about the lingering feelings.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's often a gray area. However, the author is not in the wrong for feeling hurt and choosing to step back. They have every right to make decisions about their own emotional well-being. The friend might be at fault for not considering the author's feelings, especially if they were aware of them. So, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
