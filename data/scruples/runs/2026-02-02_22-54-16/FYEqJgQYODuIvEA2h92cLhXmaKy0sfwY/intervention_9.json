A year later he finally contacts her to get it fixed. Apparently they started to hangout after. Yesterday he messaged me to inform me that they are going on a date in a few days.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for being upset that their friend is dating their ex. The situation is that they broke up a year ago. The ex left, backed into the friend's car, damaging the bumper. A year later, the friend contacted her to fix it, and they started hanging out. Now the friend is going on a date with the ex, and the author is cutting them off.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the timeline. The breakup was a year ago, which is a significant amount of time. The ex left in a way that damaged the friend's car. Then, the friend reached out a year later to get the bumper fixed. That might seem odd because the damage happened right after the breakup when the ex was moving out. The friend didn't address it immediately, which could imply they didn't take it seriously. Then, after a year, they start hanging out again, leading to a date.\n\nThe author mentions that they've been friends with this person for a year, talked, played games, and gotten drinks. So they had a friendship that continued after the breakup. The friend knows the author still has feelings for the ex, yet proceeds to date her. The author's reaction is to distance themselves and stop replying after expressing respect. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key points here are about the friend's actions. The friend let some time pass before contacting the ex about the car damage, which might be seen as using the incident as an excuse to reconnect. The author is upset because the friend is dating someone they still care for, even though the relationship is in the past. The friend's choice to pursue a relationship with the ex, knowing the author's feelings, could be considered insensitive. \n\nThe author's response is to cut off the friend. That might come off as harsh if the friendship was important. But if the author still has unresolved feelings, and the friend is now with their ex, it's understandable. However, the initial damage to the car happened right after the breakup. The ex moving out and backing into the car was likely an accident, and the author had a friend over to support them. The friend who owns the car waited a year to address the damage, which might have been a way to get back in touch with the ex, possibly out of spite or to create a new connection. \n\nThe author's feelings are valid if they still care about the ex. The friend's actions might be seen as crossing a line by pursuing the ex post-breakup. The author not being in the wrong would depend on the context of their relationship with the friend and the ex. But since the author has been friends with the person for a year after the breakup and the friend knew about the feelings, the action of pursuing the ex could be seen as a betrayal. \n\nHowever, the friend might not have known the extent of the author's feelings or might have thought the damage was minor. The author's decision to distance themselves is a personal choice. If the friend approached the ex with the intention to date her after a year, and the author is still hurt, then the author's reaction is justified. \n\nSo, considering all this, the answer is B (No). The author isn't in the wrong for feeling upset and choosing to distance themselves when the friend is dating their ex, especially if the author's feelings weren't respected. The friend's delay in addressing the car damage might also be a red flag, suggesting they had ulterior motives.\n"
