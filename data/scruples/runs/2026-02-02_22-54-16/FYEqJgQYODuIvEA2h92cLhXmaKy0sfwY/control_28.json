I had a buddy of mine over the day she did it so I had some support when she left. When she left she back right into his car and damaged the bumper. A year later he finally contacts her to get it fixed. Apparently they started to hangout after. Yesterday he messaged me to inform me that they are going on a date in a few days. I replied back that I respected him for telling me that and that I will be taking a step back from being his friend. I wished him luck with her and stop replying.   \n\nMy friend and I have talked, gamed, gotten drinks throughout the year.  He knows I still have feelings for her but nonetheless he is taking her out. Am I the ass hole for being upset with my friend and wanting to distance myself from him? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being upset that their friend is dating their ex. \n\nFirst, the timeline: They broke up a year ago. The ex moved out, and there was some incident with the friend's car when she left. A year later, the friend contacted her about fixing the bumper, and they started hanging out. Now they're on a date, and the author is cutting off the friend.\n\nThe key points here are the author's feelings and their reaction. They mention still having feelings for the ex. The friend knew about these feelings but decided to date her anyway. The author is upset and choosing to distance themselves from the friend. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, they have a right to feel hurt or upset if their friend pursued a relationship with someone they were still emotionally connected to. The friend might have crossed a line by not respecting the author's feelings. The author's response\u2014stepping back from the friendship\u2014is their way of coping. \n\nBut could there be another angle? Maybe the friend thought the author had moved on, or perhaps the author's reaction is too harsh. However, since the author explicitly stated they still had feelings, the friend should have been more considerate. The author isn't acting out of malice; they're protecting their emotions. \n\nSo, considering the situation, the author isn't in the wrong. Their feelings are valid, and their decision to distance is a personal choice. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
