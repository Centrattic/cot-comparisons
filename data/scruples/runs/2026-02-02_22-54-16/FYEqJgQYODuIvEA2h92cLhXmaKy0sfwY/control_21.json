A year later he finally contacts her to get it fixed. Apparently they started to hangout after. Yesterday he messaged me to inform me that they are going on a date in a few days.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The situation is about a friend dating their ex. Let me break down the details.\n\nSo, the person (the author) broke up with their girlfriend a year ago. The ex moved out, and when she left, the author had a friend over for support. The ex accidentally damaged the friend's car bumper when she left. Then, a year later, the friend contacted the ex to fix the bumper. They started hanging out and are now going on a date. The author is upset and wants to distance themselves from the friend. The question is whether the author is at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the timeline. The breakup was a year ago, which is a significant time. The friend didn't contact the ex right away but waited a year. The friend informed the author before the date, which is a good gesture. The author feels that the friend is dating their ex despite knowing the author still has feelings. The author decides to step back from the friendship. \n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Let's think about boundaries and respect. The friend might have thought that after a year, it's okay to date the ex. However, the fact that the friend knew the author still had feelings could be a problem. The author's reaction is about their own feelings being hurt. It's their right to take space from someone who's dating someone they're still emotional about. \n\nBut then again, maybe the author should have communicated their feelings to the friend before cutting off contact. The friend did reach out to the ex after a long time. Also, the ex's actions (damaging the car) might be a red flag, but the friend might not be at fault for trying to fix the bumper. However, the author's decision to distance themselves is a personal choice. \n\nIn terms of being in the wrong, the friend might be in the wrong for dating the ex without considering the author's feelings. But the author's reaction is about their own emotional response. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for feeling upset and wanting to step back. It's a matter of personal boundaries and emotional respect. Therefore, the answer is probably B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
