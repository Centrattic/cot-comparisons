I had a buddy of mine over the day she did it so I had some support when she left. When she left she back right into his car and damaged the bumper. A year later he finally contacts her to get it fixed. Apparently they started to hangout after. Yesterday he messaged me to inform me that they are going on a date in a few days. I replied back that I respected him for telling me that and that I will be taking a step back from being his friend. I wished him luck with her and stop replying.   \n\nMy friend and I have talked, gamed, gotten drinks throughout the year.  He knows I still have feelings for her but nonetheless he is taking her out.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The scenario is that the author's friend is dating the author's ex, and the author is upset and cutting off the friend.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author and their ex broke up a year ago. The ex moved out, and there was an incident where she backed into the friend's car. A year later, the friend contacted her to fix the bumper, they started hanging out, and now they're dating. The author found out through the friend, who told them, and the author is cutting off the friend.\n\nThe key points here are: the author still has feelings for their ex, and the friend knew this. The friend started dating the ex despite knowing the author's feelings. The author is upset and deciding to distance themselves from the friend.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. So, I need to consider emotional boundaries, respect, and how the friend handled the situation. The friend approached the author to inform them, which could be respectful, but then proceeded to date the ex. The author's reaction is understandable because they're still dealing with their feelings. However, cutting off a friend might be a strong move. But given the circumstances, maybe it's valid.\n\nAlso, the timing: a year after the breakup, the friend waited until the bumper was fixed to start a relationship. The friend might have had good intentions, but the author feels hurt. It's about respect for the author's feelings. The friend knew about the lingering feelings, so moving forward with a relationship could be seen as insensitive.\n\nSo, the author's reaction is a personal choice. They have the right to protect their emotional well-being. The friend might not be wrong for moving on, but the way they handled it could be an issue. The author isn't necessarily the wronged party here. They have every right to feel upset and decide to distance themselves. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
