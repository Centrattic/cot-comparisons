I had a buddy of mine over the day she did it so I had some support when she left. When she left she back right into his car and damaged the bumper. A year later he finally contacts her to get it fixed. Apparently they started to hangout after. Yesterday he messaged me to inform me that they are going on a date in a few days. I replied back that I respected him for telling me that and that I will be taking a step back from being his friend. I wished him luck with her and stop replying.   \n\nMy friend and I have talked, gamed, gotten drinks throughout the year.  He knows I still have feelings for her but nonetheless he is taking her out. Am I the ass hole for being upset with my friend and wanting to distance myself from him? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being upset that their friend is dating their ex. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the ex moved out a year ago, and there was some damage to the friend's car. The friend waited a year to contact her about fixing the bumper. Then they started hanging out and now are dating. The author is cutting off the friend because of this.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about boundaries and emotional response. The author still has feelings for the ex, which they mentioned. The friend knew about these feelings but still chose to date her. That seems like a breach of trust or at least poor judgment on the friend's part. The author's reaction is to distance themselves, which is a personal choice. \n\nIs the author wrong for being upset? Well, people have different reactions. If the friend crossed a boundary by pursuing the ex despite knowing the author's feelings, then the author's reaction is understandable. However, maybe the author is overreacting. But the friend did wait a year, so maybe he thought it was okay. But the author's feelings are valid. The author isn't in the wrong for feeling hurt and choosing to distance. The friend might be at fault for not respecting the author's feelings. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
