A year later he finally contacts her to get it fixed. Apparently they started to hangout after. Yesterday he messaged me to inform me that they are going on a date in a few days. I replied back that I respected him for telling me that and that I will be taking a step back from being his friend. I wished him luck with her and stop replying.   \n\nMy friend and I have talked, gamed, gotten drinks throughout the year.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves an ex who broke up a year ago, moved out, and during her departure, she accidentally damaged her ex-buddy's car. A year later, the buddy contacts her to fix the bumper, and they start hanging out, leading to a date. The author, who still has feelings for the ex, is upset and cuts off the friend. \n\nFirst, the author's friend was friends with both him and his ex. The ex damaged the friend's car when moving out. A year later, the friend and ex start dating. The author feels betrayed and decides to distance himself from the friend. \n\nThe key points here are about boundaries and respect. The author had a close relationship with the friend, including social activities. The friend knew the author still had feelings for the ex. The question is whether the author is wrong for being upset and cutting off contact. \n\nFrom the author's perspective, the friend might have crossed a line by dating someone the author was still emotionally invested in, especially after the author had trusted the friend. The friend's actions could be seen as violating that trust. However, the friend might have thought that the author had moved on, especially since a year had passed. \n\nLegally and socially, the friend isn't doing anything wrong by pursuing a relationship. However, the author's feelings are valid because of the existing friendship and the knowledge of the author's feelings. The author's decision to step back might be seen as justified because of the trust issues and emotional harm. \n\nOn the other hand, the friend might not have intended to hurt the author, but the timing and circumstances could be problematic. The author's reaction is about personal boundaries and emotional response, which can be subjective. \n\nConsidering all this, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for feeling hurt and needing space. The friend's actions, while not illegal, might be insensitive given the context. Therefore, the answer would lean towards the author not being the asshole.\n"
