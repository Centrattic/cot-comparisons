A year later he finally contacts her to get it fixed. Apparently they started to hangout after. Yesterday he messaged me to inform me that they are going on a date in a few days.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author's ex-girlfriend broke up a year ago, and she moved out of the author's place. When she left, she backed into her friend's (the author's current friend) car and damaged the bumper. A year later, the friend contacts her to get the bumper fixed, and they started hanging out, leading to a date. The author is upset because their friend is dating their ex. The author told the friend they're stepping back from the friendship and stopped replying.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the dynamics here. The ex and the friend started dating after a year. The author is still having feelings for the ex, which might make this situation harder. The friend did reach out to the author to inform about the date, which shows some level of consideration. The author's response was to distance themselves, which is a personal choice.\n\nThe key points: The author's feelings about the ex are still present, the friend's actions might be seen as taking advantage of the situation since the ex damaged his car, and the author's reaction is to cut ties. Is the author wrong for being upset? Well, people have the right to be upset if someone they care about is with an ex, especially if there's lingering feelings. Also, the friend's actions might be seen as opportunistic\u2014using the car incident to reconnect. The author's decision to step back is their choice; they're not obligated to maintain the friendship if it's causing them distress. So, the answer might be B (not in the wrong). But wait, maybe the author should consider if their friend had no idea about the feelings. The post mentions that the author and friend have been in contact all year, and the friend knew about the feelings. So the friend knowingly started a relationship with the ex. The author's reaction is justified because the friend breached trust or ignored the author's feelings. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for distancing themselves. So answer B.\n"
