I had a buddy of mine over the day she did it so I had some support when she left. When she left she back right into his car and damaged the bumper. A year later he finally contacts her to get it fixed. Apparently they started to hangout after. Yesterday he messaged me to inform me that they are going on a date in a few days. I replied back that I respected him for telling me that and that I will be taking a step back from being his friend. I wished him luck with her and stop replying.   \n\nMy friend and I have talked, gamed, gotten drinks throughout the year.  He knows I still have feelings for her but nonetheless he is taking her out. Am I the ass hole for being upset with my friend and wanting to distance myself from him? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a friend dating their ex after the breakup. The key points here are the timeline and the actions taken.\n\nFirst, the breakup was a year ago. The ex moved out, and there was an incident with the friend's car. A year later, the friend contacts the ex to fix the bumper, then starts hanging out and eventually dates her. The author finds out and decides to distance themselves from the friend, even though they've remained friends over the year.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't wrong. I need to consider if the author has a valid reason to be upset. The friend knew the author still had feelings for the ex but went ahead and dated her. The author's response was to step back, which is a personal choice. \n\nIs the friend's action wrong? Well, the friend might have thought it's okay after a year, but if he knew the author's feelings, maybe he should have been more considerate. The author's reaction is about their own feelings being hurt, which is valid. The question is whether the author's reaction is justified. \n\nThe friend didn't do anything illegal or unethical, just acted on his feelings. However, the author has the right to set boundaries if his friend's actions are causing emotional distress. So, the author isn't in the wrong for being upset and choosing to distance. The answer should be B.\n"
