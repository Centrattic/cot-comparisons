A year later he finally contacts her to get it fixed. Apparently they started to hangout after. Yesterday he messaged me to inform me that they are going on a date in a few days.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author's friend dated their ex, and the author is upset and wants to distance themselves from the friend.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the details. The author and their ex broke up a year ago. When the ex left, the friend (the one who now dates the ex) was present, and there was an incident with the bumper. A year later, the friend contacts the ex to fix the bumper, leading to them hanging out and eventually dating. The author found out, told their friend they respect them but will step back from being friends, and stopped replying. The question is if the author is in the wrong.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but wants my opinion. Let's consider the key points. The author had feelings for their ex, which their friend knew about. The friend waited a year to contact the ex, and then started dating her. The author is hurt and wants space. \n\nIs the author justified in their reaction? Well, the friend was aware of the author's feelings. The act of dating someone's ex, especially when you know the person still cares, can be seen as insensitive. The author's friend might have crossed a line by pursuing the ex after knowing the emotional impact. The author's decision to distance themselves is a personal choice, and it's their right to set boundaries. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the friend thought the author had moved on, or that a year was enough time. But the author states they still have feelings, so the friend should have been more considerate. The friend's actions led to the author's hurt, so the author isn't the one at fault here. They're acting to protect their own emotions, which is reasonable. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The friend's actions were the problem, not the author's response.\n"
