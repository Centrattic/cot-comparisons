I had a buddy of mine over the day she did it so I had some support when she left. When she left she back right into his car and damaged the bumper. A year later he finally contacts her to get it fixed. Apparently they started to hangout after. Yesterday he messaged me to inform me that they are going on a date in a few days. I replied back that I respected him for telling me that and that I will be taking a step back from being his friend. I wished him luck with her and stop replying.   \n\nMy friend and I have talked, gamed, gotten drinks throughout the year.  He knows I still have feelings for her but nonetheless he is taking her out. Am I the ass hole for being upset with my friend and wanting to distance myself from him? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being upset with their friend who dated their ex. The situation is that they broke up a year ago, the ex moved out, there was some damage to the friend's car when she left, and now the friend is dating the ex. The author is cutting off the friend and wants to know if they're the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the timeline. The breakup was a year ago, which is a significant amount of time. The author mentions still having feelings for the ex, so maybe the emotional wounds are still fresh. The friend waited until a year later to contact the ex about fixing the car and then started hanging out. The author feels hurt that the friend is dating the ex, especially since they knew the author still had feelings.\n\nThe friend's actions might be seen as insensitive. He was aware of the author's feelings and then pursued a relationship with the ex. The author's response is to step back from the friendship, which is a personal choice. They didn't lash out or confront aggressively, just distanced themselves. That seems reasonable.\n\nThe key points: The friend knew about the ongoing feelings but still chose to date the ex. The author is upset and wants space. Cutting off a friend is a tough decision, but in this context, it's a reaction to emotional hurt. The friend's actions might be considered crossing a boundary, especially if he knew the author's feelings.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Probably not. They have a right to feel hurt and to protect their emotional well-being by distancing from the friend. The friend's actions were the initial issue. Therefore, the answer is B (No).\n"
