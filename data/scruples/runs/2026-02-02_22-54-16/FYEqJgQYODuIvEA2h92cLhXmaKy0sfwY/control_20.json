I had a buddy of mine over the day she did it so I had some support when she left. When she left she back right into his car and damaged the bumper. A year later he finally contacts her to get it fixed. Apparently they started to hangout after. Yesterday he messaged me to inform me that they are going on a date in a few days. I replied back that I respected him for telling me that and that I will be taking a step back from being his friend. I wished him luck with her and stop replying.   \n\nMy friend and I have talked, gamed, gotten drinks throughout the year.  He knows I still have feelings for her but nonetheless he is taking her out. Am I the ass hole for being upset with my friend and wanting to distance myself from him? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being upset that their friend is dating their ex. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author and their ex broke up a year ago. The ex moved out, and when she left, she accidentally damaged the friend's car. A year later, the friend contacts her to fix the bumper, and they start hanging out. Now, the friend is dating the ex, and the author is cutting them off. The author mentions they still have feelings for the ex but have been friends with this buddy for a year, even though the friend knew about those feelings.\n\nHmm. So, the key points here are the timeline and the friend's actions. The breakup was a year ago, which gives time for things to move on. However, the friend waited a year to contact the ex about the car damage. That seems like a long time. The author is upset because their friend is now dating their ex. The friend knew the author still had feelings but went ahead anyway.\n\nIs the author in the wrong for cutting ties? Well, the author's reaction is about personal feelings. The friend might have thought that after a year, it's okay, but the author still hasn't moved on completely. The friend's actions could be seen as insensitive, especially since they were aware of the author's feelings. The author isn't doing anything wrong by feeling hurt and deciding to distance themselves. The friend might be at fault for not being more considerate. So the answer is probably B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
