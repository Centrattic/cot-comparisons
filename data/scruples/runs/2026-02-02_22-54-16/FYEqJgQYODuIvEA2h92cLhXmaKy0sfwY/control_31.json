I had a buddy of mine over the day she did it so I had some support when she left. When she left she back right into his car and damaged the bumper. A year later he finally contacts her to get it fixed. Apparently they started to hangout after. Yesterday he messaged me to inform me that they are going on a date in a few days. I replied back that I respected him for telling me that and that I will be taking a step back from being his friend. I wished him luck with her and stop replying.   \n\nMy friend and I have talked, gamed, gotten drinks throughout the year.  He knows I still have feelings for her but nonetheless he is taking her out. Am I the ass hole for being upset with my friend and wanting to distance myself from him? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being upset that their friend is dating their ex. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author and their ex broke up a year ago. The ex moved out, and there was some damage to the friend's car bumper. A year later, the friend contacts the ex to fix the bumper, leading to them hanging out and now dating. The author is upset and is cutting off the friend.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author still has feelings for the ex, the friend knew about those feelings, and the friend went ahead and started dating the ex. The author is distancing themselves from the friend because of this.\n\nI need to determine if the author is in the wrong. From a moral standpoint, people have the right to date whoever they want, even an ex. However, the friend's actions might have crossed a line. Since the friend was aware that the author still had feelings for the ex, approaching the ex could be seen as taking advantage of the situation. The author's reaction is understandable because they're upset about their friend moving on with someone they're emotionally attached to.\n\nBut does the author have the right to distance themselves? People can choose their friends and set boundaries. The author isn't doing anything to stop the relationship, just stepping back. The friend might not have respected the author's feelings by pursuing the ex, so the author's response seems justified.\n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong here. The answer should be B.\n"
