A year later he finally contacts her to get it fixed. Apparently they started to hangout after. Yesterday he messaged me to inform me that they are going on a date in a few days. I replied back that I respected him for telling me that and that I will be taking a step back from being his friend. I wished him luck with her and stop replying.   \n\nMy friend and I have talked, gamed, gotten drinks throughout the year.  He knows I still have feelings for her but nonetheless he is taking her out.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being upset that their friend is dating their ex. The situation is that they broke up a year ago, the ex moved out, and during that time, the friend was there when the ex left, and there was a car incident. Then a year later, the friend contacted the ex about fixing the bumper, they started hanging out, and now they're on a date. The author is cutting off the friend because they're upset. They want to know if they're the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the timeline. The breakup was a year ago, which is a significant amount of time. The ex moved out, and the friend was present when she left. The author had support from their buddy during that time. The friend then waited a year to reach out about fixing the bumper, which led to them dating. The author is now cutting off the friend because he's dating their ex, even though they had contact throughout the year. \n\nThe key points here are about the author's feelings and their response. The author mentions they still have feelings for the ex, which might make the situation more emotionally charged. The friend knew about these feelings but still chose to start a relationship with the ex. The author's reaction is to distance themselves from the friend. \n\nNow, I need to assess if the author is in the wrong. The friend had a history with the ex (the car incident) and was around during the breakup. The fact that the friend waited a year to contact the ex might not be relevant, but the fact that they started dating after a year could be seen as moving on, which the author might not be over yet. \n\nIs it fair for the author to be upset? People have different timelines for moving on. If the author hasn't fully moved on and their friend is dating their ex, it's natural to feel hurt or upset. However, the author is cutting off a friend who might have been there for them during a tough time. \n\nBut the friend knew the author still had feelings and proceeded anyway. That could be seen as crossing a boundary. The author's decision to distance themselves might be a valid reaction to protect their own feelings. \n\nOn the other hand, if the author is taking away a friendship because their ex is dating someone else, even after a year, that might not be fair. The friend isn't the ex's parent; maybe the ex is allowed to date someone else. \n\nThe key is whether the friend acted inconsiderately. The friend knew the author's feelings but still pursued a relationship. That could make the friend partly at fault. The author's reaction is understandable, but cutting off someone who was there for them might not be the healthiest approach. However, the author isn't the one who initiated the relationship, so they might not be in the wrong here. \n\nI think the answer is B, No. The author isn't in the wrong for being upset. They have the right to feel hurt, and their reaction is a personal choice based on their emotions. The friend's actions might be more questionable since he knew the author's feelings.\n"
