I had a buddy of mine over the day she did it so I had some support when she left. When she left she back right into his car and damaged the bumper. A year later he finally contacts her to get it fixed. Apparently they started to hangout after. Yesterday he messaged me to inform me that they are going on a date in a few days. I replied back that I respected him for telling me that and that I will be taking a step back from being his friend. I wished him luck with her and stop replying.   \n\nMy friend and I have talked, gamed, gotten drinks throughout the year.  He knows I still have feelings for her but nonetheless he is taking her out. Am I the ass hole for being upset with my friend and wanting to distance myself from him? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being upset that their friend is dating their ex. The situation is that they broke up a year ago, the ex left, there was some damage to the friend's car, and a year later the friend contacted her to fix it. Then they started hanging out and now the friend is dating the ex. The author is cutting off the friend because they're upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the emotional aspect. The author still has feelings for their ex, which they mentioned. The friend knew about these feelings but still pursued a relationship. That seems like a betrayal of trust. The friend didn't check in with the author before moving forward, which could be hurtful.\n\nThe author's reaction is to take a step back from the friendship. Is that reasonable? Yes, because they're hurt. People have the right to protect their emotional well-being. The friend's actions might have crossed a line by moving on with someone the author still cares about.\n\nBut maybe the author is overreacting? Well, the friend did reach out to the ex after a year to fix the car, which led to them hanging out. The author might feel like the friendship is being undermined. The friend's decision to date the ex without considering the author's feelings could be seen as thoughtless.\n\nAlso, the author is cutting off the friend, but that's their choice. They're not being confrontational, just distancing. It's a common reaction when someone feels betrayed. The question is whether the author is the asshole. From the given info, the friend's actions contributed to the problem. So the answer is probably B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
