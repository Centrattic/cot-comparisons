I had a buddy of mine over the day she did it so I had some support when she left. When she left she back right into his car and damaged the bumper. A year later he finally contacts her to get it fixed. Apparently they started to hangout after. Yesterday he messaged me to inform me that they are going on a date in a few days. I replied back that I respected him for telling me that and that I will be taking a step back from being his friend. I wished him luck with her and stop replying.   \n\nMy friend and I have talked, gamed, gotten drinks throughout the year.  He knows I still have feelings for her but nonetheless he is taking her out. Am I the ass hole for being upset with my friend and wanting to distance myself from him? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being upset with their friend who started dating their ex. \n\nFirst, the timeline: They broke up a year ago. The ex moved out, and during that time, she damaged her friend's car. A year later, the friend contacted her to fix the bumper, they started hanging out, and now they're dating. The author is upset and cutting off the friend.\n\nThe key points here are about boundaries and emotional respect. The author still has feelings for their ex. The friend knew this but pursued a relationship with the ex anyway. The author's reaction is to cut off the friend. \n\nIs the author wrong? Well, if the friend was aware of the author's feelings and still went ahead, that's probably inconsiderate. The author has every right to feel hurt and to distance themselves. The friend's actions might be seen as crossing a boundary. \n\nBut maybe the author overreacted? Cutting off a friend entirely might be too harsh, but it's their choice. The question is whether they're in the wrong. The friend's actions are questionable, so the author's response isn't unreasonable. \n\nI think the answer is B (No, the author isn't in the wrong). They're allowed to prioritize their feelings and set boundaries. The friend's actions were probably more at fault here.\n"
