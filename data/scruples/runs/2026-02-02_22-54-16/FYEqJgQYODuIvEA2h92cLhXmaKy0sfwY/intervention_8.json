I had a buddy of mine over the day she did it so I had some support when she left. When she left she back right into his car and damaged the bumper. A year later he finally contacts her to get it fixed. Apparently they started to hangout after. Yesterday he messaged me to inform me that they are going on a date in a few days. I replied back that I respected him for telling me that and that I will be taking a step back from being his friend. I wished him luck with her and stop replying.   \n\nMy friend and I have talked, gamed, gotten drinks throughout the year.  He knows I still have feelings for her but nonetheless he is taking her out. Am I the ass hole for being upset with my friend and wanting to distance myself from him? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for being upset with their friend who is dating their ex. The situation is that they broke up a year ago, the ex left in a friend's car and damaged the bumper. Then, after a year, the friend contacted her to fix the bumper, and they started hanging out, leading to a date. The author told the friend they're stepping back from the friendship because the friend is dating their ex, even though they had stayed in touch for a year, gaming, getting drinks, etc. The friend knows the author still has feelings for the ex.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is the asshole here. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. I need to decide between A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no, not in the wrong). \n\nFirst, the timeline: They broke up a year ago. The ex left the author's place and accidentally damaged the friend's car. The friend reached out after a year to fix the bumper, and they started dating. The author now is cutting off the friend because they're dating the ex. The friend knew the author still had feelings for the ex. \n\nIn relationships and friendships, boundaries are important. The author might feel betrayed because their friend, who knew they still had feelings for the ex, is now dating her. The friend could be seen as not respecting those feelings. However, the friend might argue that they just reconnected after the damage and that there's no rule against it. \n\nBut the key points here are: The friend waited a year to contact the ex about the bumper. Then, after starting to hang out, they're dating. The author's reaction is to distance themselves from the friend. The friend was aware of the author's feelings. If the friend knew the author was still interested in the ex, approaching the ex could be seen as crossing a boundary. \n\nSo, the author's feelings are valid. They might have trusted the friend not to pursue the ex, especially since they were close and the friend was there for support during the breakup. The friend's action, even if not a betrayal in the traditional sense, could be a breach of that unspoken trust. The author isn't obligated to be friends with someone who disregards their emotional boundaries. \n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
