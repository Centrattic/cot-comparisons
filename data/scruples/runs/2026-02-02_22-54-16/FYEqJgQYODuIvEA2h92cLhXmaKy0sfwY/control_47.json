I had a buddy of mine over the day she did it so I had some support when she left. When she left she back right into his car and damaged the bumper. A year later he finally contacts her to get it fixed. Apparently they started to hangout after. Yesterday he messaged me to inform me that they are going on a date in a few days. I replied back that I respected him for telling me that and that I will be taking a step back from being his friend. I wished him luck with her and stop replying.   \n\nMy friend and I have talked, gamed, gotten drinks throughout the year.  He knows I still have feelings for her but nonetheless he is taking her out. Am I the ass hole for being upset with my friend and wanting to distance myself from him? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being upset and distancing themselves from a friend who is dating their ex. \n\nFirst, the timeline: the author and their ex broke up a year ago. The ex left their place, and during that time, the ex damaged a friend's car. The friend then waited a year before contacting the ex to fix the damage, leading to them hanging out and eventually dating. The author is upset because their friend is dating their ex, even though they mentioned still having feelings. The friend informed the author about the date, and the author decided to step back from the friendship.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author is still emotionally involved with their ex, the friend acted after a year, and the author is now cutting off the friend. \n\nFrom an empathy standpoint, the author's feelings are valid. It's hurtful when someone close to you starts dating your ex, especially if you're not over them. The friend did wait a year to contact the ex, but once he did, he continued the relationship. The author's reaction\u2014stepping back\u2014seems like a personal choice based on their emotional state.\n\nThe friend did reach out to the author about the date, which is respectful. The author's response was to distance themselves, which is their right. The question is whether the author is wrong for feeling this way. \n\nIn terms of social norms, people often have different reactions to situations like this. Some might see the author as justified in their feelings, while others might think they should move on. However, the author isn't doing anything harmful to the friend; they're just reducing contact. The friend's actions weren't malicious initially\u2014he waited a year, and the damage to the car was an accident. \n\nConsidering all this, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They're dealing with their emotions and making a choice to protect their well-being. The friend did inform them, which is good, but the author's response is a personal decision. So the answer is B.\n"
