I had a buddy of mine over the day she did it so I had some support when she left. When she left she back right into his car and damaged the bumper. A year later he finally contacts her to get it fixed. Apparently they started to hangout after. Yesterday he messaged me to inform me that they are going on a date in a few days. I replied back that I respected him for telling me that and that I will be taking a step back from being his friend. I wished him luck with her and stop replying.   \n\nMy friend and I have talked, gamed, gotten drinks throughout the year.  He knows I still have feelings for her but nonetheless he is taking her out. Am I the ass hole for being upset with my friend and wanting to distance myself from him? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being upset with their friend who's dating their ex. The situation is that they broke up a year ago, and when the ex left, she backed into their friend's car, damaging the bumper. A year later, the friend contacted her to fix the bumper, and then they started hanging out, leading to a date.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the social norms here. When someone is in a relationship, especially if the breakup hasn't been that long ago (a year), people usually expect others to give them space. The friend waited a year before contacting her, which seems like a reasonable amount of time, but the way he approached it\u2014initially for the bumper repair\u2014might have been a pretense to reconnect. That could be seen as crossing a boundary if the author is still upset about the breakup.\n\nThe author mentions that they and the friend have kept in touch over the year, and the friend knew about their lingering feelings. The friend then proceeds to date the ex, which the author finds hurtful. The author's response was to respect the friend for telling them, then step back from the friendship. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but wants confirmation.\n\nI think the key points are: the timing of the friend contacting the ex a year after the breakup, the fact that the friend continued to be close to the author while he was still interested in the ex, and the author's decision to distance themselves. The act of dating an ex when the other person (author) is still emotionally involved could be seen as insensitive. Even though a year has passed, if the author still has feelings, the friend might have should have considered that and given them more space. The author's reaction is understandable as a form of self-preservation, especially if the friend was aware of their feelings. The friend's actions could be perceived as taking advantage of the situation, given the prior knowledge. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
