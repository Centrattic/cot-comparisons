I had a buddy of mine over the day she did it so I had some support when she left. When she left she back right into his car and damaged the bumper. A year later he finally contacts her to get it fixed. Apparently they started to hangout after. Yesterday he messaged me to inform me that they are going on a date in a few days. I replied back that I respected him for telling me that and that I will be taking a step back from being his friend. I wished him luck with her and stop replying.   \n\nMy friend and I have talked, gamed, gotten drinks throughout the year.  He knows I still have feelings for her but nonetheless he is taking her out. Am I the ass hole for being upset with my friend and wanting to distance myself from him? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being upset that their friend is dating their ex. \n\nFirst, the timeline: They broke up a year ago. The ex left and damaged the friend's car. A year later, the friend contacts her to fix the bumper, leading to them hanging out and eventually dating. The author is now upset and has distanced themselves from the friend.\n\nThe author's actions: They told the friend they'd step back from being friends and stopped replying. The key points here are the author's feelings, the timing, and the friend's actions.\n\nThe author still has feelings for the ex, which makes sense after a year. The friend knew about these feelings but chose to date the ex anyway. The damage to the car happened when the ex left, so maybe there was an existing issue there. The friend contacting her after a year and then getting close could be seen as crossing a boundary, especially if the author was still emotionally involved.\n\nThe author's response is to distance themselves. That's a personal choice, and while it's understandable to be hurt, cutting off a friend isn't inherently wrong if they feel it's necessary. The friend might be at fault for not respecting the author's feelings, but the author's reaction is a matter of personal boundaries.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for being upset and taking a step back. Their actions are a response to someone they considered a friend moving on with their ex while they were still emotionally affected. The friend might have a responsibility here, but the author's choice to distance is their right. Therefore, the answer would be B (not in the wrong).\n"
