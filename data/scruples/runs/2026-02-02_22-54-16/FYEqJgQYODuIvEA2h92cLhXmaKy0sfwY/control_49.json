I had a buddy of mine over the day she did it so I had some support when she left. When she left she back right into his car and damaged the bumper. A year later he finally contacts her to get it fixed. Apparently they started to hangout after. Yesterday he messaged me to inform me that they are going on a date in a few days. I replied back that I respected him for telling me that and that I will be taking a step back from being his friend. I wished him luck with her and stop replying.   \n\nMy friend and I have talked, gamed, gotten drinks throughout the year.  He knows I still have feelings for her but nonetheless he is taking her out.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author's friend is dating their ex. The ex broke up a year ago, and when she left, she damaged the friend's car. The friend waited a year to contact her about fixing the bumper, and now they're dating. The author is upset, told their friend they're stepping back from the friendship, and is wondering if they're the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author still has feelings for their ex, which their friend knew. The friend then pursued a relationship with the ex. The author is cutting off the friend because of that. Is the author justified?\n\nWell, the friend did contact the ex after a year to fix the bumper. But then they started hanging out and dating. The author was friends with the friend before the breakup and had support from them during the breakup. Now, the friend is moving on with someone the author is still emotionally attached to. \n\nThe key points here: The friend was aware of the author's feelings. The author is cutting off the friend because they're dating the ex. The author might feel hurt, betrayed, or like their friend is disrespecting their emotions. The friend's actions could be seen as taking advantage of the situation, but it's not clear if they intended to hurt the author. \n\nThe author's reaction is to step back from the friendship. Is that wrong? If the friend knew the author had feelings, maybe they should have considered that before dating the ex. But maybe the friend thought it was over and they could pursue a relationship. However, the author's feelings are valid. It's their right to distance themselves if the friend's actions are causing emotional pain, especially since the friend was aware of the author's feelings. \n\nThe friend's actions might be seen as crossing a line, especially if they knew the author still had feelings. The author isn't wrong for being upset. It's a personal relationship matter, and the author has the right to protect their emotional well-being. So, the answer is probably that the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
