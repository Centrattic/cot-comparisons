He's emotionally a baby but he's no pedo.\n\nAnyways, today we were walking to the kitchen and he slapped my ass and I told him I didn't like it and that I wanted him to stop. He said he made me so he has the right to do it, and fumed up when I said that he didnt. In his words \"then i wont touch or talk to you, screw you\" he eventually ended with \"I'll touch you when I want, deal with it\" and went to his room.\n\nI'm well within my rights to ask him to stop, right?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

The dad says he made them so he can do it, and gets upset when they ask him to stop.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author mentions that the dad has been doing this since they were a kid, and there's no sexual intent. The dad is described as emotionally immature but not a pedophile. The key issue here is consent and personal boundaries. Even within a family, physical touch without consent is a problem. The author has the right to set boundaries, especially as an adult. The dad's response is dismissive and aggressive, which is not acceptable. The author isn't in the wrong for standing up for themselves. So the answer should be B.\n"
