He's emotionally a baby but he's no pedo.\n\nAnyways, today we were walking to the kitchen and he slapped my ass and I told him I didn't like it and that I wanted him to stop. He said he made me so he has the right to do it, and fumed up when I said that he didnt. In his words \"then i wont touch or talk to you, screw you\" he eventually ended with \"I'll touch you when I want, deal with it\" and went to his room.\n\nI'm well within my rights to ask him to stop, right?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is at fault for not wanting their dad to slap their ass. The situation is that the dad has been doing this since they were a kid, and now the author told him to stop. The dad responded angrily, saying he made them so he can do it, and refused to comply.\n\nFirst, I need to consider personal boundaries. The author is an adult now (13M meaning 13 months since they became an adult?), so they have the right to set boundaries. Even if the dad's intentions aren't sexual, as the author acknowledges, physical contact without consent can be an issue. The dad's argument that he \"made\" them doesn't hold legal or ethical weight. Parents don't have the right to touch their adult children in a way that's unwanted, regardless of past habits.\n\nThe dad's reaction is also concerning. Threating not to talk or touch the author is a form of emotional manipulation. The author is asserting their right to physical autonomy, which is important. The key points here are consent and respect for boundaries. The author is not wrong for standing up for themselves. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
