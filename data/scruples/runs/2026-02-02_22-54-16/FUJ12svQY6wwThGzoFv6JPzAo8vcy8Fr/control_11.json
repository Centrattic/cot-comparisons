He's emotionally a baby but he's no pedo.\n\nAnyways, today we were walking to the kitchen and he slapped my ass and I told him I didn't like it and that I wanted him to stop. He said he made me so he has the right to do it, and fumed up when I said that he didnt. In his words \"then i wont touch or talk to you, screw you\" he eventually ended with \"I'll touch you when I want, deal with it\" and went to his room.\n\nI'm well within my rights to ask him to stop, right?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a father who has been slapping his son's ass since he was a kid, and the son now tells him to stop. The dad responds angrily, claiming he made him so he has the right. The son is asking if he's in the wrong for not wanting the slaps.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The father's action is physical contact\u2014slapping the son's ass. The son is 13 months old? Wait, wait, the original question says [13M], which I think refers to 13 years old, not months. That's a common shorthand in these kinds of posts. So the son is 13 years old, a teenager. The father has been doing this since he was a child, and now the son is objecting. The father is using the argument that he created him, so he has the right, which is a problematic statement.\n\nNow, the question is about whether the son is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). The key here is bodily autonomy. Even in parent-child relationships, a child has the right to say no to unwanted physical contact. The father's actions, even if he claims they're not sexual, could still be considered a violation of the child's personal boundaries once the child expresses discomfort. The fact that the father got angry and said he won't talk to the son is also concerning, indicating a potential power imbalance and emotional manipulation.\n\nLegally and ethically, once a child is old enough to express their preferences, a parent should respect those boundaries. The father's argument that he can do so because he made him is not valid. Parents can't use their authority to justify unwanted touch, especially when the child objects. The son is within his rights to ask for the slapping to stop. The father's response is inappropriate as well, threatening to cut off contact and refusing to respect the son's wishes.\n\nSo, the answer here should be B (No), the author is not in the wrong. He's asserting his right to bodily autonomy, and the father's response is the issue here.\n"
