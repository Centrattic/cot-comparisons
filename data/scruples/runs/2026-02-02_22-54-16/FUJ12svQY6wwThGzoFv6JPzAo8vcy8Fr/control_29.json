He said he made me so he has the right to do it, and fumed up when I said that he didnt.

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is that their dad has been slapping their ass since they were a kid, and now when they asked him to stop, the dad got angry and said things like \"I made you so I have the right\" and \"I'll touch you when I want.\" The user is asking if they're right to not want this and if they're in the wrong for telling their dad to stop.\n\nFirst, I should consider the context. The user mentions it's not sexual and the dad hasn't done anything else, so maybe it's a habitual, non-sexual action. But the key point is the user's discomfort and the dad's reaction. The user is an adult now, 13 months? Wait, wait, that can't be right. Wait, the user said \"13M\" in the question. Oh, that's probably the kid's age, like a 13-month-old baby. Wait, no, the user is the one with the kid? Wait, no, the original question says \"AITA for not wanting my[13M] dad to...\" So maybe the user is a 13-month-old? That doesn't make sense. Wait, maybe the [13M] is a typo. Oh, I think that's a common way people denote the child's age in online forums. Like, in the context of \"All IsFair in Love and Parenting\" type questions. So \"13M\" might mean the child is 13 months old. Wait, but if the user is an adult, then they're talking about their dad and maybe their child? No, the question is about their own dad slapping their ass. Wait, the user is an adult, right? Because they have a child (13M). Wait, but the way it's written is \"My[13M] dad\", which is confusing. Maybe it's a typo. Let me check again. The user says \"AITA for not wanting my[13M] dad to periodically slap my ass?\" So the [13M] is probably a mistake. Maybe they meant their kid is 13 months old, and they have a dad who's been slapping their ass. Or maybe the \"13M\" is their own age, which would be 13 months old, but that's a baby, and the dad slapping their ass as a baby? That still doesn't make sense. Wait, maybe the [13M] is a placeholder for their age, like the child is 13 months old. But the user is talking about their dad. Hmm. Maybe the user is an adult with a 13-month-old child, and their dad is doing this? Or perhaps the user is a parent of a 13-month-old, and their dad is slapping their child's ass. No, the question is about the user's dad slapping their ass. So maybe \"13M\" is a typo for \"13-year-old\" or another age. Let me assume that the user is an adult, maybe 13 years old, but that's a child. Wait, maybe it's supposed to be the user's child's age. For example, if the user is a parent, and their own father (the user's dad) is slapping the user's child's ass. But the way the question is phrased is \"my[13M] dad to periodically slap my ass\" \u2013 \"my ass\" being the user's. So the user is an adult, and their dad is a parent who's been doing this to them. So the user is an adult child of a dad who's been slapping their ass (the user's ass) periodically. The user is 13 years old? That can't be. Wait, maybe the 13M is a mistake. Maybe it's supposed to be \"13-year-old\" or \"30-year-old\". Maybe it's a typo and the user is an adult. Let me go with that. So the user is an adult, and their dad has been slapping their ass since they were a kid. Now, when they ask him to stop, the dad is upset and says he has the right because he made them, etc.\n\nIn terms of boundaries, as an adult, the user has the right to set personal boundaries. Even if the dad's intention is not sexual, any physical contact that makes the adult uncomfortable is something they can ask to stop. The dad's reaction is problematic because he's asserting control and dismissing the user's feelings, which is not healthy. The user isn't in the wrong for wanting to stop the contact and standing up for themselves. The dad should respect the user's wishes, regardless of his reasoning. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
