He said he made me so he has the right to do it, and fumed up when I said that he didnt. In his words \"then i wont touch or talk to you, screw you\" he eventually ended with \"I'll touch you when I want, deal with it\" and went to his room.\n\nI'm well within my rights to ask him to stop, right?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting their dad to slap their ass. The dad has been doing this since they were a kid and claims it's not sexual. The author told the dad to stop, and the dad got upset, saying he made them so he has the right.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The dad's actions started when the author was a child, and the author is now 13 or older (since it's 13M, maybe 13 years old). Wait, the original post says [13M], which might be a typo. Maybe it's 13 or 31? If it's 13, the author is a minor, but if it's 31, they're an adult. The age is crucial here. If the author is a minor, the situation is different in terms of parental rights and consent. But the way the question is phrased, the author is setting boundaries with a parent, which could be a sign of being an adult.\n\nAssuming the author is an adult (maybe 31), then they have the right to set personal boundaries. Even if the dad claims it's not sexual, the author's comfort is important. Parents can have certain rights in terms of discipline when a child is a minor, but once the child is an adult, those rights are more about guidance than physical contact. The dad's response\u2014threatening to stop talking or touching\u2014seems controlling and dismissive of the author's feelings.\n\nThe key points here are consent and personal space. Even within a family, individuals have the right to say no to unwanted physical contact. The dad's argument that he \"made\" them doesn't hold legal or ethical weight. The author is clearly within their rights to ask for the behavior to stop. The dad's reaction is inappropriate, showing a lack of respect for the author's autonomy.\n\nIf the author were a minor, the situation would be trickier. Parents have some rights in disciplining children, but physical contact should still be appropriate and not violating the child's dignity. However, the author is likely an adult here, so the analysis leans towards the author being justified in setting that boundary. The dad's behavior is overstepping, and the author's response is valid. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
