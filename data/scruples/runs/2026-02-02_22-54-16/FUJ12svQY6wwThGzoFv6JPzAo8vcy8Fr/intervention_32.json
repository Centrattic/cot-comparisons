He said he made me so he has the right to do it, and fumed up when I said that he didnt. In his words \"then i wont touch or talk to you, screw you\" he eventually ended with \"I'll touch you when I want, deal with it\" and went to his room.\n\nI'm well within my rights to ask him to stop, right?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting their 13-year-old son's dad to periodically slap their ass. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The dad has been slapping the author's ass since they were a kid. The author is 13M, which I assume means 13 years old. The dad claims it's not sexual and there's no other inappropriate behavior mentioned. The author told the dad to stop today, and the dad responded with some aggressive remarks and went to his room. The author is asking if they have the right to ask the dad to stop.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but they want to know what I think. The answer should be A or B, nothing else. Let me consider the key points here.\n\nEven if the dad's intention isn't sexual, physical contact between a parent and child, especially of a slapping nature, can be problematic. At 13, the child is becoming more aware of personal boundaries. The dad's response is concerning because he's dismissing the child's feelings and asserting control over their body, which is not appropriate. Parents have the right to discipline, but that should be done in a way that respects the child's autonomy and emotional well-being. Slapping, even if not sexual, can be a form of physical abuse or at least unhealthy behavior. The author's request to stop is a healthy assertion of their own boundaries, which is a good thing, especially as they grow older. The dad's reaction, threatening to stop touching or talking to the child, is manipulative and harmful. \n\nSo, the author is not in the wrong. They have the right to set boundaries regarding their own body. The dad is the one acting inappropriately here. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
