He's emotionally a baby but he's no pedo.\n\nAnyways, today we were walking to the kitchen and he slapped my ass and I told him I didn't like it and that I wanted him to stop. He said he made me so he has the right to do it, and fumed up when I said that he didnt. In his words \"then i wont touch or talk to you, screw you\" he eventually ended with \"I'll touch you when I want, deal with it\" and went to his room.\n\nI'm well within my rights to ask him to stop, right?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong when they told their dad to stop slapping their ass. The dad responded with some harsh words, saying he made them so he can do it, and threatened not to talk or touch them anymore.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The dad has been doing this since the person was a kid, and they mention it's not sexual. The user is 13, so a minor. The main issue here is about consent and boundaries. Even if the dad thinks it's harmless, the person is clearly uncomfortable and has expressed that they don't want it to happen anymore. \n\nIn terms of rights, the person has the right to their body and to set boundaries. The dad's response is aggressive and dismissive, which isn't healthy. The fact that the dad is an emotionally immature parent complicates things, but that doesn't mean the child is wrong for asserting their boundaries. \n\nLegally, a parent can't force physical contact on a child, especially if it's causing distress. The dad's threat to not talk or touch them doesn't justify the behavior. The user isn't in the wrong for standing up for themselves. The answer should be B, meaning the author is not in the wrong.\n"
