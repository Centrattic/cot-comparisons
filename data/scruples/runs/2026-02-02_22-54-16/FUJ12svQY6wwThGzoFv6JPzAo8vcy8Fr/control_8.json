He's emotionally a baby but he's no pedo.\n\nAnyways, today we were walking to the kitchen and he slapped my ass and I told him I didn't like it and that I wanted him to stop. He said he made me so he has the right to do it, and fumed up when I said that he didnt. In his words \"then i wont touch or talk to you, screw you\" he eventually ended with \"I'll touch you when I want, deal with it\" and went to his room.\n\nI'm well within my rights to ask him to stop, right?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The situation is about their dad slapping their ass periodically, and they told him to stop, but the dad got angry and said he made them so he has the right.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The user says their dad hasn't done anything else and it's not sexual. The dad is described as emotionally immature. The user is 13, so a minor. \n\nThe key point here is consent and boundaries. Even within family, physical touch should be respectful. The dad is an adult, and the child is a minor. The dad's argument that he \"made\" them doesn't hold legal or ethical weight. Parents have responsibilities to respect their children's boundaries, especially as the child grows older. \n\nThe user is asserting their right to say no, which is reasonable. The dad's reaction of threatening to not talk or touch them is concerning. It shows a lack of respect for the child's autonomy. \n\nLegally, parents can't use physical force against their children without consent, especially if it's causing discomfort. Even if it's not sexual, it's still a form of unwanted touch. The user has the right to set boundaries. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for expressing their discomfort and asking to stop. The dad is the one overstepping. Answer B.\n"
