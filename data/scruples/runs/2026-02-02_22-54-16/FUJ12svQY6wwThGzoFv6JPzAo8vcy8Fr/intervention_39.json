He's emotionally a baby but he's no pedo.\n\nAnyways, today we were walking to the kitchen and he slapped my ass and I told him I didn't like it and that I wanted him to stop. He said he made me so he has the right to do it, and fumed up when I said that he didnt. In his words \"then i wont touch or talk to you, screw you\" he eventually ended with \"I'll touch you when I want, deal with it\" and went to his room.\n\nI'm well within my rights to ask him to stop, right?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting their dad to slap their ass. The dad has been doing this since they were a kid, and the author says it's not sexual. The dad got upset and said he made them so he can do it, and then threatened to not talk or touch them anymore.\n\nFirst, I need to consider boundaries. The author is an adult, 13 months old? Wait, no, the age might be a typo. Wait, the original question says [13M], which usually denotes months, but that can't be right for a person. Maybe it's a typo for 13 years old? If the author is 13, they're a teenager, and their dad is continuing a physical interaction that the child is now uncomfortable with. If the author is an adult, say 21 or older, the situation is different. But maybe the age is a mistake. Let me check again. The original post says \"My[13M] dad\"\u2014maybe the M stands for months, but that's 13 months old, which would make the dad a child, which doesn't make sense. Wait, maybe the user meant the child is 13M (13 months), but the dad is an adult. No, that's not possible. Maybe it's a typo for 31 or another number. Alternatively, maybe it's a typo for 13 years old. That makes more sense. So the author is a teenager, 13 years old, and their dad has been slapping their ass since they were a kid. Now, the author is uncomfortable and told the dad to stop. The dad responded with anger and threats.\n\nIn terms of boundaries, even if the dad has done it since the child was young, the child has the right to set boundaries. Once they're an adult, their consent is necessary for any physical contact. The dad's response of refusing to talk or touch unless the author complies is controlling and disrespectful. The author is asserting their autonomy, which is a valid right. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong. The key points are the right to bodily autonomy and the dad's overreaction being inappropriate.\n"
