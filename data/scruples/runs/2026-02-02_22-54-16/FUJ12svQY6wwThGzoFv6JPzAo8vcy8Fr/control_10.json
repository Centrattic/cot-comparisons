He's emotionally a baby but he's no pedo.\n\nAnyways, today we were walking to the kitchen and he slapped my ass and I told him I didn't like it and that I wanted him to stop. He said he made me so he has the right to do it, and fumed up when I said that he didnt. In his words \"then i wont touch or talk to you, screw you\" he eventually ended with \"I'll touch you when I want, deal with it\" and went to his room.\n\nI'm well within my rights to ask him to stop, right?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting their dad to slap their ass. The scenario is that the dad has been doing this since the author was a kid, and now the author told him to stop. The dad responded angrily, saying he made them so he has the right, and even said he won't talk or touch them anymore if they don't like it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The dad is an adult, and the child is 13. The dad's action is a physical touch on the child's body. Even if the dad claims it's not sexual, any unwanted physical contact from a parent to a child can be problematic. The key point is consent. The child is expressing that they don't like it now. Even if the dad has done it before, the child has the right to set boundaries. \n\nThe dad's response is aggressive, saying he made the child and will touch them when he wants. That's not acceptable because no one has the right to touch another person against their will, regardless of their relationship. The author is asserting their autonomy, which is their right. \n\nIn terms of legal and ethical standards, a parent doesn't have the right to physically touch a child in a way the child finds uncomfortable once the child is old enough to express that. Even if it's a long-standing habit, respecting the child's current wishes is crucial. The dad's reaction seems controlling and dismissive of the child's feelings, which is not healthy.\n\nSo, the author is not in the wrong. They are standing up for themselves, which is necessary for healthy boundaries. Answer B.\n"
