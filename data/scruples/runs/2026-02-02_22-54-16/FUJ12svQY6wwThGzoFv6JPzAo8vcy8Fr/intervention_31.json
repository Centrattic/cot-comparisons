He's emotionally a baby but he's no pedo.\n\nAnyways, today we were walking to the kitchen and he slapped my ass and I told him I didn't like it and that I wanted him to stop. He said he made me so he has the right to do it, and fumed up when I said that he didnt. In his words \"then i wont touch or talk to you, screw you\" he eventually ended with \"I'll touch you when I want, deal with it\" and went to his room.\n\nI'm well within my rights to ask him to stop, right?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person in the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a 13-year-old's dad slapping their ass, and the kid telling them to stop. The dad responds with some not-so-nice comments.\n\nFirst, I need to remember that in many places, children have the right to bodily autonomy. Even though the dad is the parent, no one should touch another person in a way that makes them uncomfortable unless it's necessary for their care. Since the dad isn't doing anything else inappropriate and claims it's not sexual, but the kid is clearly uncomfortable, the kid has the right to set boundaries. \n\nThe dad's reaction is pretty extreme. Saying he won't talk or touch the kid and that he'll do it when he wants crosses into emotional abuse, maybe. Parents can't use their authority to justify harmful or unwanted physical contact. Even if the dad thinks he has the right because he's the parent, that doesn't make it okay. The kid is asserting their boundaries, which is a healthy thing. \n\nSo, the answer should be B. The author isn't in the wrong. They're standing up for themselves, which is right. The dad's behavior is inappropriate, and the kid has every right to ask him to stop.\n"
