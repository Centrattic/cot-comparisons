He's emotionally a baby but he's no pedo.\n\nAnyways, today we were walking to the kitchen and he slapped my ass and I told him I didn't like it and that I wanted him to stop. He said he made me so he has the right to do it, and fumed up when I said that he didnt. In his words \"then i wont touch or talk to you, screw you\" he eventually ended with \"I'll touch you when I want, deal with it\" and went to his room.\n\nI'm well within my rights to ask him to stop, right?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this query. The user is asking if the author is at fault for not wanting their dad to slap their ass. The situation is that the dad has been doing this since the author was a kid and justified it by saying he made them, so he has the right. The author told him to stop, and the dad reacted by threatening to not touch or talk to them.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the dynamics here. The parent is the one initiating physical contact without the child's consent. Even if the dad claims it's not sexual, the key issue is the lack of consent from the child. The author is within their rights to set boundaries. The dad's response of threatening to cut off all contact is a form of emotional manipulation, which isn't healthy, especially in a parent-child relationship.\n\nIn most societies, parents have the legal right to discipline their children, but that doesn't extend to physical contact that the child finds unwelcome without a legitimate reason. The author is clearly stating that they don't like it, so continuing the behavior after that refusal is crossing a boundary. The dad's justification that he \"made\" them is invalid because parental rights don't include forcing physical contact on a willing child. The author isn't wrong for asserting their personal space and comfort. The dad's reaction shows a lack of respect for the child's autonomy, which is unhelpful and harmful.\n\nSo, the answer should be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. They have every right to refuse unwanted physical contact and set boundaries, even with family members. The dad's behavior is the problematic part here, not the author's response.\n"
