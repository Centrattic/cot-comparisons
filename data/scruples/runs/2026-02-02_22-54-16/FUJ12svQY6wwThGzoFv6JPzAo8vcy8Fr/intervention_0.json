He's emotionally a baby but he's no pedo.\n\nAnyways, today we were walking to the kitchen and he slapped my ass and I told him I didn't like it and that I wanted him to stop. He said he made me so he has the right to do it, and fumed up when I said that he didnt. In his words \"then i wont touch or talk to you, screw you\" he eventually ended with \"I'll touch you when I want, deal with it\" and went to his room.\n\nI'm well within my rights to ask him to stop, right?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong regarding their dad slapping their ass. The author says their dad has done this since they were a kid, and now they asked him to stop. The dad responded angrily, saying he made them so he can do it, and refused to stop.\n\nFirst, I need to consider consent and personal boundaries. Even within family, physical contact should be consensual. The author has the right to set boundaries, regardless of the relationship. The dad's argument that he's the parent and can do it because he made them is not valid. Parents can't use their role to justify non-consensual touch. \n\nAlso, the dad's reaction is inappropriate. Threatening to not talk or touch the author is controlling behavior. The key point is that the author is asserting their right to their body, which is a valid action. The dad's actions here are overstepping, especially after being asked to stop. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
