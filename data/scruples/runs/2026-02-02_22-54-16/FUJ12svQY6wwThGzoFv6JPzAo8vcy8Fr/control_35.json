He said he made me so he has the right to do it, and fumed up when I said that he didnt.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting their dad to slap their ass. The dad has been doing this since they were a kid, and the author told him to stop. The dad responded angrily, saying he made them and has the right to touch them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The dad claims it's not sexual and hasn't done anything else. The key here is consent and boundaries. Even if the dad is the parent, a child has the right to set personal boundaries. Physical touch, even from a parent, should be consensual. The dad's reaction is concerning because he's using his authority to justify non-consensual contact and threatening to cut off contact if the author says no. That's not healthy.\n\nLegally, parents can't force physical contact on their children, especially when the child is an adult. The author is 13M, which I assume means 13 months? Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Wait, maybe it's a typo. If it's 13 years old, but the parent is slapping the ass, that's still an issue. Wait, the original question says \"13M\" which could be 13 months old. But that's a baby, so the parent slapping a baby's bottom would be abuse. But the author says the dad hasn't done anything else and it's not sexual. Hmm, maybe \"13M\" is a mistake. Alternatively, maybe it's 13 years old. Let me check the original again. The user wrote \"AITA for not wanting my[13M] dad...\" Maybe \"13M\" here is the age, but the formatting is off. Assuming it's a typo for 13 years old, then the parent is slapping their teen's butt regularly. The parent is emotionally immature, which adds to the problem.\n\nThe author is asserting their right to say no, which is valid. The dad's response is inappropriate because he's not respecting the child's boundaries and is using threats. Even if it's a parent, the child has the right to bodily autonomy. So the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B, No.\n"
