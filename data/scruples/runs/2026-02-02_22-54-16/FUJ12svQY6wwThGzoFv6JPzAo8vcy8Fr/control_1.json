He's emotionally a baby but he's no pedo.\n\nAnyways, today we were walking to the kitchen and he slapped my ass and I told him I didn't like it and that I wanted him to stop. He said he made me so he has the right to do it, and fumed up when I said that he didnt. In his words \"then i wont touch or talk to you, screw you\" he eventually ended with \"I'll touch you when I want, deal with it\" and went to his room.\n\nI'm well within my rights to ask him to stop, right?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting their dad to slap their ass. The dad says he made them so he has the right to do it. The author told their dad to stop, and the dad reacted angrily, saying he'll touch them when he wants.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author mentions that the dad has been doing this since they were a kid, and there's no sexual intent. But the key point here is the author's right to set boundaries. Even if it's a long-standing habit, the child has the right to say no. The dad's response of refusing to interact and asserting control is problematic. \n\nIn terms of rights, in most modern contexts, parents do have some authority, but they also need to respect their child's autonomy. Physical touch, even if not sexual, should not be forced. The author is asserting their personal space, which is a valid right. The dad's reaction of refusing to communicate unless the author complies is manipulative and crosses into emotional abuse territory. \n\nLegally, parents can't force a child into physical contact against their will. Even if there's no sexual element, it's about consent and respect. The author is within their rights to ask for the behavior to stop. The dad's argument that he \"made\" them doesn't override the child's right to their own body. So, the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
