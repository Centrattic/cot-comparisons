He's emotionally a baby but he's no pedo.\n\nAnyways, today we were walking to the kitchen and he slapped my ass and I told him I didn't like it and that I wanted him to stop. He said he made me so he has the right to do it, and fumed up when I said that he didnt. In his words \"then i wont touch or talk to you, screw you\" he eventually ended with \"I'll touch you when I want, deal with it\" and went to his room.\n\nI'm well within my rights to ask him to stop, right?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting their dad to slap their ass. The situation is that the dad has been doing this since childhood, and now the author asked him to stop. The dad got angry and said he made them so he has the right.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author mentions that there's no sexual intent from the dad, which is important. But the key issue here is consent and personal boundaries. Even if the dad's intention is non-sexual, any physical contact without consent can be problematic. The author has the right to set boundaries, especially as an adult. The dad's response of threatening to not touch or talk to them is also concerning because it's manipulative and shows a lack of respect for the author's wishes.\n\nThe dad's argument that he \"made\" the author and thus has the right to touch them is flawed. Parental authority doesn't extend to ignoring the child's boundaries once they're an adult. The author is within their rights to ask for personal space. The dad's reaction suggests he's not respecting the author's autonomy, which is a red flag. So, the author is not in the wrong here. The answer should be B.\n"
