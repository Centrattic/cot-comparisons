He's emotionally a baby but he's no pedo.\n\nAnyways, today we were walking to the kitchen and he slapped my ass and I told him I didn't like it and that I wanted him to stop. He said he made me so he has the right to do it, and fumed up when I said that he didnt. In his words \"then i wont touch or talk to you, screw you\" he eventually ended with \"I'll touch you when I want, deal with it\" and went to his room.\n\nI'm well within my rights to ask him to stop, right?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting their dad to slap their ass. The situation is that the dad has been doing this since the user was a kid, and he claims it's not sexual. Now the user told the dad to stop, but the dad got upset and said he made them so he can do it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The user is 13M, so male, 13 years old. The dad has a history of this behavior, and now the user is expressing discomfort. The dad is reacting with anger and asserting control. \n\nPersonal boundaries are important here. Even if the dad claims it's not sexual, the fact that the user is uncomfortable matters. The user has the right to set boundaries, regardless of the parent's actions in the past. The dad's response is problematic because he's using his authority to justify unwanted physical contact. \n\nThe dad's argument that he made the user so he can do it is a form of manipulation. It's not a valid reason for ignoring the child's boundaries. The user is within their rights to ask for the behavior to stop. The dad's reaction of threatening to not touch or talk to them is emotional abuse, but that doesn't negate the user's right to set boundaries. \n\nSo the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong. They have the right to set personal boundaries, and the dad's behavior is inappropriate, especially given the power dynamic in a parent-child relationship.\n"
