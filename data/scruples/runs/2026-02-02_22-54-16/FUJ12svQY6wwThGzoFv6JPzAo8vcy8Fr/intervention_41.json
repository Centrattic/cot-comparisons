He's emotionally a baby but he's no pedo.\n\nAnyways, today we were walking to the kitchen and he slapped my ass and I told him I didn't like it and that I wanted him to stop. He said he made me so he has the right to do it, and fumed up when I said that he didnt. In his words \"then i wont touch or talk to you, screw you\" he eventually ended with \"I'll touch you when I want, deal with it\" and went to his room.\n\nI'm well within my rights to ask him to stop, right?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong for not wanting their 13-year-old dad to slap their ass. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author's dad has been slapping their ass since they were a kid. The author clarifies it's not sexual and the dad hasn't done anything else. The dad is emotionally immature but not a pedophile. The author told the dad to stop, and the dad responded angrily, saying he made them so he has the right and that he'll touch them when he wants.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. I need to decide if the answer is A or B. Let me think about boundaries. Even in families, personal space and consent matter. The author is asserting their right to bodily autonomy, which is important. The dad's response is dismissive and controlling, which is a red flag. The author is in their right to set boundaries. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong. The key points are consent, respect for personal space, and the dad's overreaction.\n"
