He said he made me so he has the right to do it, and fumed up when I said that he didnt. In his words \"then i wont touch or talk to you, screw you\" he eventually ended with \"I'll touch you when I want, deal with it\" and went to his room.\n\nI'm well within my rights to ask him to stop, right?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting their dad to slap their ass. The dad has been doing this since they were a kid, and the author told him to stop. The dad responded angrily, claiming he made the author and has the right.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is 13M, so a minor. The dad is their parent. The issue is about physical contact\u2014specifically, the parent slapping the child's ass. The author is asserting their boundaries by asking to stop, which is a personal right. The dad is reacting negatively, using threats like not talking or touching the child, which could be emotionally abusive.\n\nFrom a rights perspective, every person has the right to bodily autonomy. Even within a family, respecting someone's boundaries is important. The dad's response, especially the threats, seems over the line. He's not respecting the child's comfort and is using his authority as a parent to justify the behavior, which is problematic.\n\nAlso, the author clarified that there's no sexual intent, but that doesn't make the act appropriate. Parents should respect their children's feelings and boundaries. The dad's reaction of anger and withdrawal could be emotionally harmful to the child. The author is standing up for themselves, which is a healthy boundary to set.\n\nHowever, sometimes in parent-child relationships, cultural or traditional practices might involve physical contact. But regardless of that, if the child is uncomfortable, the parent should respect that. The dad's argument that he made the child and thus has the right is invalid. Parental authority doesn't override the child's right to feel safe and respected.\n\nIn conclusion, the author is not in the wrong. They have every right to ask for their boundaries to be respected. The dad's behavior and response are the issues here. So the answer should be B.\n"
