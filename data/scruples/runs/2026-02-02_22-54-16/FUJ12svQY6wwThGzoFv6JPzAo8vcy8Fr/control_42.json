      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a 13-year-old whose dad has been slapping their ass periodically, and the kid told the dad to stop. The dad then got angry and said he made them so he can do it whenever. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and social aspects. The child is 13, so they are a minor. In many places, any form of physical contact that's non-consensual or could be considered inappropriate from an adult to a minor can be a sensitive issue. Even if the dad claims it's not sexual, the act of slapping a child's ass, even if done in a playful manner, can be seen as a form of physical abuse or at least a violation of the child's personal space and consent.\n\nThe dad's response is concerning. Saying things like \"I made you so I have the right\" and \"I'll touch you when I want\" is a clear disregard for the child's autonomy. The child is expressing their discomfort, which is a valid right. The dad's reaction\u2014threatening to not talk or touch them\u2014could be considered emotional abuse as well. \n\nLegally, parents do have some authority over their children, but there are limits. Physical punishment that's not for discipline or that's done in a way that's degrading or harmful can cross into abuse. Even if it's not sexual, the child's right to bodily autonomy is important. The child is within their rights to ask for such behavior to stop, especially if it makes them uncomfortable. \n\nSocially, there's a growing awareness about consent and personal boundaries, even within families. What might have been considered a normal or playful gesture in the past is now seen as potentially harmful. The dad's insistence on continuing despite the child's objection shows a lack of respect for the child's feelings and boundaries. \n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author is not in the wrong. They have every right to ask for their space and to set boundaries. The responsibility lies with the parent to respect those boundaries. The dad's behavior is problematic and needs addressing, possibly through counseling or other means to ensure a healthy environment for the child.\n"
