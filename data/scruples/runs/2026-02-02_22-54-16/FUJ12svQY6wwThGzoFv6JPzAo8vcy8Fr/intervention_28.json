He's emotionally a baby but he's no pedo.\n\nAnyways, today we were walking to the kitchen and he slapped my ass and I told him I didn't like it and that I wanted him to stop. He said he made me so he has the right to do it, and fumed up when I said that he didnt. In his words \"then i wont touch or talk to you, screw you\" he eventually ended with \"I'll touch you when I want, deal with it\" and went to his room.\n\nI'm well within my rights to ask him to stop, right?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author's dad slapping their ass periodically, and the author telling their dad to stop. The dad responded angrily, claiming he made them so he can touch them, and said he'll touch them when he wants.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author mentions that their dad has done this since they were a kid, and clarifies it's not sexual. The dad is described as emotionally immature but not a pedophile. The author is 13, so a minor, and their dad is a parent. The key issue here is consent and personal boundaries.\n\nThe author is asserting their right to not want physical contact. Even if the dad claims it's a longstanding habit, the child has the right to set boundaries. The dad's response is dismissive and authoritarian, which is problematic. Parents can't just do whatever they want to their children, even if it's not sexual. The child should be able to express discomfort without being threatened with being ignored.\n\nIn terms of legal rights, children have the right to bodily autonomy. Parents have the legal responsibility to respect their child's boundaries once those boundaries are communicated. The dad's reaction is not appropriate; threatening to stop talking or touching the child is emotional abuse. The author is correct in stating their rights, so they're not in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
