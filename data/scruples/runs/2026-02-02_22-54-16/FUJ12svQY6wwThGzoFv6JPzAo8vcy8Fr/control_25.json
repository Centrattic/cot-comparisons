He's emotionally a baby but he's no pedo.\n\nAnyways, today we were walking to the kitchen and he slapped my ass and I told him I didn't like it and that I wanted him to stop. He said he made me so he has the right to do it, and fumed up when I said that he didnt. In his words \"then i wont touch or talk to you, screw you\" he eventually ended with \"I'll touch you when I want, deal with it\" and went to his room.\n\nI'm well within my rights to ask him to stop, right?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking whether the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for not wanting their dad to slap their ass. The dad has been doing this since they were a kid, and the person finally told him to stop. The dad responded angrily, saying he made them so he has the right, and said he won't talk or touch them unless they deal with it.\n\nHmm. First, I need to consider the context. The author mentions that the dad's actions aren't sexual and there's no other inappropriate behavior. The key issue here is consent and personal boundaries. Even within a family, physical touch should be consensual. The author is an adult now (13M probably means 13 months, but maybe it's 13 years? Wait, 13 months would be a baby, but the context suggests they're older. Maybe it's 13 months since they turned 18? Not sure. Maybe a typo. Let's assume they're an adult for the sake of this.)\n\nThe dad's argument that he \"made\" them doesn't justify non-consensual touch. Parents have a responsibility to respect their adult children's boundaries. The author is asserting their right to say no, which is valid. The dad's reaction is concerning because he's threatening to cut off contact, which isn't healthy. The author isn't in the wrong for setting a boundary. So the answer should be B, No.\n"
