He's emotionally a baby but he's no pedo.\n\nAnyways, today we were walking to the kitchen and he slapped my ass and I told him I didn't like it and that I wanted him to stop. He said he made me so he has the right to do it, and fumed up when I said that he didnt. In his words \"then i wont touch or talk to you, screw you\" he eventually ended with \"I'll touch you when I want, deal with it\" and went to his room.\n\nI'm well within my rights to ask him to stop, right?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting their dad to slap their ass. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The dad has been slapping the author's ass since they were a kid. The author is 13, and they mention it's not sexual, just the dad being emotionally immature. The author told their dad to stop, and the dad got upset, saying he made them so he can do it, and then threatened to not touch or talk to them. The author is asking if they're in the wrong for objecting.\n\nI need to consider consent and boundaries. Even in a parent-child relationship, physical touch should be consensual. The author is clearly stating they don't want the touch, so the dad's actions without consent are an issue. The dad's response is also problematic because he's using his authority as a parent to justify non-consensual contact, which isn't right. The author has the right to set boundaries, regardless of the parent's actions. So the answer should be B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
