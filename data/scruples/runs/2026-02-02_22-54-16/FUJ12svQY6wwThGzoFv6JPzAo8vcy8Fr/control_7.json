He's emotionally a baby but he's no pedo.\n\nAnyways, today we were walking to the kitchen and he slapped my ass and I told him I didn't like it and that I wanted him to stop. He said he made me so he has the right to do it, and fumed up when I said that he didnt. In his words \"then i wont touch or talk to you, screw you\" he eventually ended with \"I'll touch you when I want, deal with it\" and went to his room.\n\nI'm well within my rights to ask him to stop, right?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author not wanting their 13-year-old dad to slap their ass. The dad says he made them so he has the right, and gets angry when they ask him to stop.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are consent and boundaries. The author is clearly uncomfortable with the physical contact, even though the dad claims it's not sexual and hasn't done anything else. The dad's response is pretty hostile, saying he'll stop talking or touching them, which is a form of emotional manipulation.\n\nIn most contexts, especially within families, respecting someone's personal space and boundaries is important. Even if the parent is acting out of a sense of authority, the child has the right to express discomfort and set limits. The dad's reaction is dismissive and controlling, which is not healthy. The author isn't in the wrong for asserting their boundaries. So the answer should be B, No.\n"
