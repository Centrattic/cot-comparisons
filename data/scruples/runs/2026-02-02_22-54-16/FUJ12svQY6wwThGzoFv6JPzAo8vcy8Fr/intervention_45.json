He's emotionally a baby but he's no pedo.\n\nAnyways, today we were walking to the kitchen and he slapped my ass and I told him I didn't like it and that I wanted him to stop. He said he made me so he has the right to do it, and fumed up when I said that he didnt. In his words \"then i wont touch or talk to you, screw you\" he eventually ended with \"I'll touch you when I want, deal with it\" and went to his room.\n\nI'm well within my rights to ask him to stop, right?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a 13-year-old's dad slapping their ass, and the kid tells the dad to stop. The dad responds by saying he made them so he has the right and then threatens to not touch or talk to them. The author is asking if they're at fault for not wanting the slaps.\n\nFirst, I need to consider consent and personal boundaries. The author is a minor, 13 years old, and even though the dad claims it's not sexual, the child has the right to set boundaries. Physical touch without consent is an issue, especially from a parent. The dad's response is aggressive and controlling, which isn't healthy. The author is asserting their personal space, which is appropriate. The dad's justification of \"he made them\" isn't a valid reason to invade someone's personal space without consent. So, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to stop the slaps. The dad's behavior is the problem here, not the child's request.\n"
