He's emotionally a baby but he's no pedo.\n\nAnyways, today we were walking to the kitchen and he slapped my ass and I told him I didn't like it and that I wanted him to stop. He said he made me so he has the right to do it, and fumed up when I said that he didnt. In his words \"then i wont touch or talk to you, screw you\" he eventually ended with \"I'll touch you when I want, deal with it\" and went to his room.\n\nI'm well within my rights to ask him to stop, right?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting their dad to slap their ass. Let me break this down. The dad has been doing this since they were a kid, and the author says it's not sexual. The dad gets angry when told to stop, saying he made them so he can touch them. The author is asking if they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider consent and boundaries. Even if the dad is the parent, the child has the right to set personal boundaries. Physical touch should always be consensual. The dad's argument that he \"made\" them doesn't hold water legally or ethically. Parents don't have the right to touch in ways that the child finds uncomfortable once they express that discomfort.\n\nThen there's the dad's reaction\u2014threatening not to touch or talk to the author. That's emotional manipulation. The author is standing up for themselves, which is healthy. They're asserting their boundaries, which is correct. The dad's behavior is overstepping, and the author isn't wrong for wanting to stop it. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
