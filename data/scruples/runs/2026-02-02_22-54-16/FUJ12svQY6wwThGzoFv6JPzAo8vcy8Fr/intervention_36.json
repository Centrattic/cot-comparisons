He's emotionally a baby but he's no pedo.\n\nAnyways, today we were walking to the kitchen and he slapped my ass and I told him I didn't like it and that I wanted him to stop. He said he made me so he has the right to do it, and fumed up when I said that he didnt. In his words \"then i wont touch or talk to you, screw you\" he eventually ended with \"I'll touch you when I want, deal with it\" and went to his room.\n\nI'm well within my rights to ask him to stop, right?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting their dad to slap their ass. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The dad has been slapping the author's ass since they were a kid. The author says it's not sexual, and the dad hasn't done anything else. The author tells the dad to stop, and the dad reacts angrily, saying he made the author so he can do it whenever. The author is questioning if they're in the wrong.\n\nI need to consider legal and personal boundaries. In many places, even within families, there are laws about physical contact. Parents can't just hit their kids, especially as they get older. The author is 13, so a minor, but the dad's actions might still be inappropriate. The dad's response is also concerning\u2014he's using threats and emotional manipulation. Saying he'll stop talking to the author if they don't comply is a form of emotional abuse.\n\nFrom a personal boundary perspective, the author has the right to say no to unwanted physical contact. The dad's argument that he has the right because he's the parent is flawed. Parents can't just do whatever they want with their children's bodies. The key here is consent and respect. Even if the dad doesn't have sexual intent, the physical contact is unwanted and the author is asserting their right to say no.\n\nLegally, in many jurisdictions, this could be considered assault, especially if the child is uncomfortable and asks to stop. The dad's refusal to respect the author's wishes is problematic. The author isn't in the wrong for setting a boundary. The dad is the one who needs to respect those boundaries.\n\nSo, the answer should be B\u2014the author is not in the wrong. They have the right to set personal boundaries and ask for physical contact to stop. The dad's behavior is the issue here, not the author's decision to speak up.\n"
