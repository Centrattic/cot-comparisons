He's emotionally a baby but he's no pedo.\n\nAnyways, today we were walking to the kitchen and he slapped my ass and I told him I didn't like it and that I wanted him to stop. He said he made me so he has the right to do it, and fumed up when I said that he didnt. In his words \"then i wont touch or talk to you, screw you\" he eventually ended with \"I'll touch you when I want, deal with it\" and went to his room.\n\nI'm well within my rights to ask him to stop, right?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author of the question is in the wrong for not wanting their dad to slap their ass. The dad has been doing this since they were a kid, and the author told him to stop. The dad responded with some strong words, saying he made them so he can do it, and that he'll touch them when he wants.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author mentions that the dad isn't acting in a sexual way and there's no other inappropriate behavior. But the key issue here is consent and personal boundaries. Even if the dad has done this for years, the author has the right to set boundaries. The dad's response is pretty controlling and dismissive of the author's feelings. Saying things like \"I made you so I have the right\" is a form of emotional manipulation. \n\nIn terms of rights, in most legal and ethical frameworks, any physical contact without consent is an issue. Since the author is clearly stating they don't want it, the dad's actions are violating their personal space. The dad's reaction being aggressive and refusing to respect that boundary is problematic. So, the author is standing up for themselves, which is the right thing to do. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
