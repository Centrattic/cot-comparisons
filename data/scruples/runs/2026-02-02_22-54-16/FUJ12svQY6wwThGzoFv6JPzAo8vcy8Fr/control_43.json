He's emotionally a baby but he's no pedo.\n\nAnyways, today we were walking to the kitchen and he slapped my ass and I told him I didn't like it and that I wanted him to stop. He said he made me so he has the right to do it, and fumed up when I said that he didnt. In his words \"then i wont touch or talk to you, screw you\" he eventually ended with \"I'll touch you when I want, deal with it\" and went to his room.\n\nI'm well within my rights to ask him to stop, right?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the person in the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a 13-year-old (assuming the \"13M\" is 13 months, but that doesn't make sense for a dad. Maybe it's 13 years old? The age might be a typo, but the key part is the dad slapping their ass. The user says it's not sexual and the dad hasn't done anything else. The dad gets angry when the person asks him to stop, saying he made them so he has the right, and then threatens to not talk or touch them.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is in the wrong. The core issue is consent and respect for personal boundaries. Even if the dad's actions are not sexual, the person has the right to set their boundaries. The dad's response is dismissive and aggressive, using threats. The author is expressing their discomfort, which is valid. The dad's argument that he has the right because he \"made\" them is not a valid reason to violate someone's personal space. The author is within their rights to ask for the behavior to stop. The answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
