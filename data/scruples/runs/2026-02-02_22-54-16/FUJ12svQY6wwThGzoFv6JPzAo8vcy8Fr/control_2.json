He's emotionally a baby but he's no pedo.\n\nAnyways, today we were walking to the kitchen and he slapped my ass and I told him I didn't like it and that I wanted him to stop. He said he made me so he has the right to do it, and fumed up when I said that he didnt. In his words \"then i wont touch or talk to you, screw you\" he eventually ended with \"I'll touch you when I want, deal with it\" and went to his room.\n\nI'm well within my rights to ask him to stop, right?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for not wanting their dad to slap their ass. The dad has been doing this since they were a kid, and now the son is 13 and told his dad to stop. The dad responded angrily, saying he made him so he has the right.\n\nFirst, I need to consider boundaries and consent. Even within families, physical touch should be respected. Just because someone is a parent doesn't mean they can touch their child in ways the child finds uncomfortable. The son is setting a boundary, which is healthy. The dad's reaction is concerning because he's asserting that he can do it without consent, which isn't okay.\n\nThe dad's argument that he made him so he can touch him is invalid. Parental rights don't extend to non-consensual physical contact, especially if it's making the child uncomfortable. The son has every right to say no. The fact that the dad refuses to respect that boundary and threatens to stop interacting is also problematic.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. They're asserting their personal space and boundaries. The dad is the one who needs to change his behavior. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
