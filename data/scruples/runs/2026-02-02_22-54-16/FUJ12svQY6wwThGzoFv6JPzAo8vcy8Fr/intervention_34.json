He's emotionally a baby but he's no pedo.\n\nAnyways, today we were walking to the kitchen and he slapped my ass and I told him I didn't like it and that I wanted him to stop. He said he made me so he has the right to do it, and fumed up when I said that he didnt. In his words \"then i wont touch or talk to you, screw you\" he eventually ended with \"I'll touch you when I want, deal with it\" and went to his room.\n\nI'm well within my rights to ask him to stop, right?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting their dad to slap their ass. The dad has been doing this since they were a kid, and the author says it's not sexual. But now the author is 13 and has told the dad to stop. The dad responded angrily, saying he made them so he can do it, and threatened to stop talking or touching them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The dad's action is physical contact that the child is now objecting to. Even if it's not sexual, the child has the right to set boundaries. The dad's response is pretty harsh\u2014threatening to cut off contact. That's concerning because it's a parent being abusive with their authority.\n\nThe author is clearly within their rights to say no to unwanted touch. Even if the dad is emotionally immature, he shouldn't be using threats or physical contact that the child doesn't consent to. The fact that it's a parent-child relationship doesn't change the fact that the child's autonomy matters. The dad's behavior is controlling and dismissive of the child's feelings. So the author isn't in the wrong here. The answer should be B.\n"
