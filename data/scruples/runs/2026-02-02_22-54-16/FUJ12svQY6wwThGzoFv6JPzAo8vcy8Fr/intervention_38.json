He's emotionally a baby but he's no pedo.\n\nAnyways, today we were walking to the kitchen and he slapped my ass and I told him I didn't like it and that I wanted him to stop. He said he made me so he has the right to do it, and fumed up when I said that he didnt. In his words \"then i wont touch or talk to you, screw you\" he eventually ended with \"I'll touch you when I want, deal with it\" and went to his room.\n\nI'm well within my rights to ask him to stop, right?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

The dad has been doing this since the author was a kid, and he claims it's not sexual. The author told him to stop, and the dad got angry, saying he made the author so he has the right. The author is asking if they're right to be upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The dad's behavior is physical contact without consent, even if it's been going on for a long time. Just because it's been normalized in their relationship doesn't make it okay. The author has the right to set boundaries. The dad's response of threatening not to talk or touch them is emotional manipulation. The key points are consent and the right to personal space. The author isn't in the wrong for asserting their boundaries. The dad's justification (\"I made you\") is a flawed argument that doesn't negate the author's right to say no. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
