He's emotionally a baby but he's no pedo.\n\nAnyways, today we were walking to the kitchen and he slapped my ass and I told him I didn't like it and that I wanted him to stop. He said he made me so he has the right to do it, and fumed up when I said that he didnt. In his words \"then i wont touch or talk to you, screw you\" he eventually ended with \"I'll touch you when I want, deal with it\" and went to his room.\n\nI'm well within my rights to ask him to stop, right?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting their 13-year-old's dad to periodically slap their ass. The dad has been doing this since they were a kid, and the author says it's not sexual. But when they asked him to stop, the dad got angry and said he made them so he can do it, and other things like \"I'll touch you when I want.\"\n\nFirst, I need to consider boundaries and consent. Even within families, physical touch should be respectful and consensual. The author is setting a boundary, which is important. The dad's reaction seems to be about control and not respecting the child's autonomy. As a parent, you can't just do whatever you want to your child's body. The child has the right to say no to unwanted touch, regardless of the parent's reasoning.\n\nThe age here is 13, so the child is a teenager. At that age, personal boundaries become more important. The dad's argument that he made them doesn't hold up. Parents have the responsibility to respect their children's growing autonomy. The fact that the dad is emotionally immature (\"emotionally a baby\") might explain his behavior, but that doesn't justify it. The child is within their rights to ask for it to stop, especially when the parent's response is to withhold affection and communication as punishment. That's not healthy.\n\nSo the answer should be B. The author is not in the wrong. They have the right to their own comfort and to set boundaries. The dad's actions are inappropriate, and the author's response is valid.\n"
