He's emotionally a baby but he's no pedo.\n\nAnyways, today we were walking to the kitchen and he slapped my ass and I told him I didn't like it and that I wanted him to stop. He said he made me so he has the right to do it, and fumed up when I said that he didnt. In his words \"then i wont touch or talk to you, screw you\" he eventually ended with \"I'll touch you when I want, deal with it\" and went to his room.\n\nI'm well within my rights to ask him to stop, right?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting their dad to slap their ass. The dad has been doing this since they were a kid, and the author told him to stop. The dad responded with some strong words, saying he made them so he can do it, and that he'll touch them when he wants.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The dad claims it's not sexual and there's no other inappropriate behavior mentioned. However, the author is 13, so they're a minor. Even if the dad isn't being sexual, physical contact like slapping someone's ass can be seen as inappropriate, especially between parent and child. It could make the child uncomfortable, and the child has the right to set boundaries. \n\nThe dad's reaction is concerning. Saying things like \"I won't touch or talk to you\" or \"I'll touch you when I want\" could be a form of emotional manipulation or abuse. The parent should respect the child's boundaries. Even if the dad thinks he has the right because he's the parent, the child's comfort and consent matter. \n\nLegally, a parent has authority, but that doesn't mean they can use physical contact in a way that's degrading or makes the child uncomfortable. The author is within their rights to ask for it to stop. The dad's response is dismissive and controlling, which is problematic. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. They're expressing their feelings and setting a boundary. The dad should have listened instead of being confrontational. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
