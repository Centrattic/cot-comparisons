He's emotionally a baby but he's no pedo.\n\nAnyways, today we were walking to the kitchen and he slapped my ass and I told him I didn't like it and that I wanted him to stop. He said he made me so he has the right to do it, and fumed up when I said that he didnt. In his words \"then i wont touch or talk to you, screw you\" he eventually ended with \"I'll touch you when I want, deal with it\" and went to his room.\n\nI'm well within my rights to ask him to stop, right?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

The dad has been doing this since they were a kid, and claims he made them so he has the right. The author told their dad to stop, and the dad got angry and said he'd touch them when he wants. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The user mentions it's not sexual, but the dad is emotionally a baby. The key issue here is consent and boundaries. Even if the dad is the parent, the child has the right to set personal boundaries. The dad's behavior crosses a line by asserting control against the child's wishes. The author is asserting their right to bodily autonomy, which is important. The dad's response is dismissive and authoritarian, which isn't healthy. So, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
