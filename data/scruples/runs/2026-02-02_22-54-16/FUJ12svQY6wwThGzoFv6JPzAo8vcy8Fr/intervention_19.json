He's emotionally a baby but he's no pedo.\n\nAnyways, today we were walking to the kitchen and he slapped my ass and I told him I didn't like it and that I wanted him to stop. He said he made me so he has the right to do it, and fumed up when I said that he didnt. In his words \"then i wont touch or talk to you, screw you\" he eventually ended with \"I'll touch you when I want, deal with it\" and went to his room.\n\nI'm well within my rights to ask him to stop, right?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting their father to slap their ass. The father has been doing this since the author was a child, and he claims he made them so he has the right. The author told him to stop, but the father responded angrily and said he'll touch them when he wants.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The father says it's not sexual and hasn't done anything else. But the author is now 13, so they have a right to their own body autonomy. Even if the father thinks it's harmless, the author is clearly uncomfortable, which is valid. \n\nParental rights do include some level of physical affection, but there's a line when it becomes unwanted or uncomfortable for the child, especially as they grow older. The father's response is problematic because he's dismissing the child's feelings and asserting control, which can be harmful. \n\nThe key points here are consent and the child's right to set boundaries. Even if the father's intention is not malicious, the act of slapping the child's ass without consent is inappropriate, especially when the child objects. The father's reaction also shows a lack of respect for the child's boundaries, which is a red flag. \n\nSo, the author is not in the wrong for asserting their boundaries. The father is overstepping and not respecting their child's wishes. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
