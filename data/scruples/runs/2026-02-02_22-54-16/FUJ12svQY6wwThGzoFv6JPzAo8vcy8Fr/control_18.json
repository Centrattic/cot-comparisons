He's emotionally a baby but he's no pedo.\n\nAnyways, today we were walking to the kitchen and he slapped my ass and I told him I didn't like it and that I wanted him to stop. He said he made me so he has the right to do it, and fumed up when I said that he didnt. In his words \"then i wont touch or talk to you, screw you\" he eventually ended with \"I'll touch you when I want, deal with it\" and went to his room.\n\nI'm well within my rights to ask him to stop, right?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting their 13-year-old son's dad to slap their ass. The dad has been doing this since they were a kid and claims he made them so he can. The author told the dad to stop, and the dad got angry and said he'll touch when he wants.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The dad is the biological father, and he's been doing this since the author was a child. The user clarifies it's not sexual, and the dad hasn't done anything else inappropriate. But the author now feels uncomfortable and wants to stop.\n\nNow, in terms of rights, personal boundaries are important. Even in a parent-child relationship, respecting personal space and consent matters. The dad's argument that he \"made\" them doesn't hold legally or ethically. Parents don't have the right to physically touch their children in ways that the child finds uncomfortable, especially as they grow older and establish their own boundaries.\n\nThe dad's response\u2014threatening to not talk or touch the author\u2014is concerning. It shows a lack of respect for the author's autonomy. The fact that the author is 13 and in middle school, they might be more aware of their personal space and boundaries. The dad's behavior could be seen as overstepping, even if it's been a long-standing habit.\n\nLegally, while parents have certain rights, they don't have unlimited authority. Physical contact that's unwanted, even if not sexual, can be considered harassment if it's persistent and intrusive. The author is within their rights to set boundaries.\n\nHowever, there's a cultural aspect to consider. In some families, physical affection like slapping the ass might be common. But that doesn't make it right if it's causing discomfort. The key here is the author's right to say no. The dad's reaction\u2014threatening to cut off contact\u2014shows he's not respecting the author's wishes, which is a problem.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is not in the wrong. They have the right to ask for personal space and to refuse physical contact. The dad's behavior is inappropriate, and the author is justified in their stance.\n"
