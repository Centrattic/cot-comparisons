He's emotionally a baby but he's no pedo.\n\nAnyways, today we were walking to the kitchen and he slapped my ass and I told him I didn't like it and that I wanted him to stop. He said he made me so he has the right to do it, and fumed up when I said that he didnt. In his words \"then i wont touch or talk to you, screw you\" he eventually ended with \"I'll touch you when I want, deal with it\" and went to his room.\n\nI'm well within my rights to ask him to stop, right?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong for not wanting their dad to slap their ass. The dad has been doing this since the author was a kid, and the author is 13. The dad then got angry and said he made them so he has the right, and threatened not to talk or touch them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is a minor, 13 years old, and they're setting boundaries with their parent. The parent is an adult, and while they claim it's not sexual, the act of slapping a child's ass can be seen as a boundary issue. The author is asserting their autonomy by asking the dad to stop, which is a healthy behavior for a teenager to develop. The dad's reaction seems to be dismissing the child's feelings and asserting control, which is problematic.\n\nLegally, a parent has authority over their children, but that doesn't mean they can violate their child's personal space without consent. Physical touch from a parent should respect the child's comfort level. The dad's response is authoritarian and dismissive, not considering the child's feelings. The author is in the right to express discomfort and set boundaries. The dad's justification that he \"made\" the author doesn't grant the right to touch them in ways they find uncomfortable. The author's action is about self-respect and personal boundaries, which are important for healthy development.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author is not in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
