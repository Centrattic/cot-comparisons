He said he made me so he has the right to do it, and fumed up when I said that he didnt.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author's dad has been slapping their ass periodically since they were a kid. The dad claims he made them so he has the right, but the author told him to stop. The dad then threatened not to talk or touch them unless he wanted to.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is wrong for asking their dad to stop. The key points here are consent and personal boundaries. Even within families, physical touch should be consensual. The dad's argument that he has the right because he's the parent is problematic because consent can't be assumed based on parent-child relationships. The author is asserting their right to their body, which is valid.\n\nThe dad's response\u2014threatening to cut off contact and refusing to respect the child's wishes\u2014shows a lack of respect for the child's autonomy. This is an issue, especially since the parent is supposed to model healthy boundaries. Emotional immaturity might play a role here, but that doesn't excuse the behavior.\n\nThe author is not in the wrong for setting a boundary. They have the right to say no to unwanted physical contact, regardless of the parent's actions. The dad's reaction is more indicative of his own issues rather than the child's wrongdoing. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
