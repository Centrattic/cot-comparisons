He's emotionally a baby but he's no pedo.\n\nAnyways, today we were walking to the kitchen and he slapped my ass and I told him I didn't like it and that I wanted him to stop. He said he made me so he has the right to do it, and fumed up when I said that he didnt. In his words \"then i wont touch or talk to you, screw you\" he eventually ended with \"I'll touch you when I want, deal with it\" and went to his room.\n\nI'm well within my rights to ask him to stop, right?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting their dad to slap their ass. The situation is that the dad has been doing this since they were a kid, and the author told them to stop. The dad got angry and said he made them so he can do it whenever.\n\nFirst, I need to consider consent and personal boundaries. Even within a family, physical touch without consent can be an issue. The author is an adult now, so their autonomy is important. The dad's argument that he made them doesn't hold legal or ethical weight. Parents have a responsibility to respect their adult children's boundaries. The dad's reaction, threatening to not talk or touch them, seems controlling and disrespectful. The author is standing up for themselves, which is a positive action. There's no mention of any sexual intent from the dad, so it's not about that. The key here is respecting personal space and the right to say no. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
