He's emotionally a baby but he's no pedo.\n\nAnyways, today we were walking to the kitchen and he slapped my ass and I told him I didn't like it and that I wanted him to stop. He said he made me so he has the right to do it, and fumed up when I said that he didnt. In his words \"then i wont touch or talk to you, screw you\" he eventually ended with \"I'll touch you when I want, deal with it\" and went to his room.\n\nI'm well within my rights to ask him to stop, right?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong regarding their dad slapping their ass. The situation is that the dad has been doing this since the user was a kid, and the user is now 13. The dad's justification is that he made them, so he has the right, and he gets upset when the user asks him to stop.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of the child. At 13, the user is a minor, but their body autonomy is still important. Even if the father's intentions aren't sexual, physical contact without consent is a boundary issue. The father's reaction\u2014threatening not to talk or touch the child\u2014is concerning. It shows a lack of respect for the child's feelings and boundaries.\n\nIn many contexts, touching another person without their consent can be considered a violation, regardless of the intent. The father's argument that he has the right because he's the parent doesn't hold up. Parents do have certain rights, but they also have a responsibility to respect their children's boundaries and well-being. The fact that the dad is acting emotionally immature adds to the problem.\n\nThe user is asserting their right to set boundaries, which is a healthy part of growing up. The father's response is dismissive and aggressive, which could be harmful. Legally, parents can't physically abuse their children, but even non-abusive physical contact without consent might be an issue in some jurisdictions. However, the main point here is about personal boundaries and respect.\n\nSo, considering all that, the user isn't in the wrong. They're expressing their discomfort and asking for their space, which is valid. The father is the one overstepping by not respecting the child's wishes. Therefore, the answer should be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
