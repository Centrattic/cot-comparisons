He said he made me so he has the right to do it, and fumed up when I said that he didnt. In his words \"then i wont touch or talk to you, screw you\" he eventually ended with \"I'll touch you when I want, deal with it\" and went to his room.\n\nI'm well within my rights to ask him to stop, right?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see here. The user is asking if the person who wrote the question is in the wrong. The situation is that their dad has been slapping their ass since they were a kid, and when the author asked to stop, the dad got angry and said he can touch them whenever.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author mentions the dad hasn't done anything else and it's not sexual. So, the issue is about unwanted physical contact. The author is 13M, so maybe around 13 years old? Wait, the age might be important. Wait, no, the [13M] probably refers to 13 months? But that doesn't make sense. Wait, maybe it's a typo. Wait, the original question might be from a 13-year-old male, which is possible. But the dad's behavior is an issue.\n\nThe key points here are consent and boundaries. The author is asserting their right to not want to be touched. Even if the dad claims he made them, that doesn't give him the right to impose physical contact. The dad's response of threatening to not touch or talk to them if they ask to stop is a power move, which is problematic. \n\nIn terms of legal and social norms, a parent can't use physical contact in a way that the child finds uncomfortable, especially once the child has expressed not wanting it. Even if the parent is being controlling or emotionally immature, the child is within their rights to set boundaries. \n\nSo, the author is not in the wrong. They're standing up for themselves. The dad's behavior is inappropriate, and he shouldn't use threats to enforce his actions. The answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
