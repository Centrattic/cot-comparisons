He's emotionally a baby but he's no pedo.\n\nAnyways, today we were walking to the kitchen and he slapped my ass and I told him I didn't like it and that I wanted him to stop. He said he made me so he has the right to do it, and fumed up when I said that he didnt. In his words \"then i wont touch or talk to you, screw you\" he eventually ended with \"I'll touch you when I want, deal with it\" and went to his room.\n\nI'm well within my rights to ask him to stop, right?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting their dad to slap their ass. The dad has been doing this since they were a child, and the author has now told him to stop. The dad responded with anger, saying he made them so he can do it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider personal boundaries. The author is clearly stating that they don't like the physical contact. Even if the dad claims it's not sexual, the fact that the son is uncomfortable is important. Everyone has the right to set boundaries about their body, regardless of familial relationships.\n\nNext, the dad's response is concerning. Telling someone he'll stop talking or touching them unless they comply isn't healthy. Threatening to cut off contact or communication is a form of coercion and isn't acceptable. The dad's argument that he \"made\" the author gives him the right to touch them is flawed. Parental rights don't extend to violating a child's personal boundaries, especially when the child is an adult.\n\nThe key points here are consent and respect for personal space. The author has every right to ask their dad to stop. The dad's reaction shows a lack of respect for the author's autonomy, which is a red flag in their relationship. The author isn't in the wrong for asserting their boundaries. So the answer should be B.\n"
