He's emotionally a baby but he's no pedo.\n\nAnyways, today we were walking to the kitchen and he slapped my ass and I told him I didn't like it and that I wanted him to stop. He said he made me so he has the right to do it, and fumed up when I said that he didnt. In his words \"then i wont touch or talk to you, screw you\" he eventually ended with \"I'll touch you when I want, deal with it\" and went to his room.\n\nI'm well within my rights to ask him to stop, right?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

The dad has been slapping the kid's ass since they were a kid, but the author says it's not sexual. Now they're 13, and they told their dad to stop. The dad got angry and said he made them, so he can do it, and even threatened to stop talking to them.\n\nThe main question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nI need to consider boundaries and consent. Even in families, physical touch should be consensual. The author has the right to set boundaries. The dad's reaction is problematic because he's using a threat and claiming authority as a parent to justify non-consensual touch. \n\nAlso, the dad's statement \"I'll touch you when I want\" is a violation of the child's autonomy. The author is within their rights to express discomfort and ask for it to stop. The dad's anger and threats are not appropriate responses. \n\nSo, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
