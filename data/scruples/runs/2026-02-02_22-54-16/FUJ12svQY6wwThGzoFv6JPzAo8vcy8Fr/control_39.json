He's emotionally a baby but he's no pedo.\n\nAnyways, today we were walking to the kitchen and he slapped my ass and I told him I didn't like it and that I wanted him to stop. He said he made me so he has the right to do it, and fumed up when I said that he didnt. In his words \"then i wont touch or talk to you, screw you\" he eventually ended with \"I'll touch you when I want, deal with it\" and went to his room.\n\nI'm well within my rights to ask him to stop, right?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the author of this post is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation carefully.\n\nThe author is a 13-year-old male, but since the post is about their dad, maybe that's a typo? Wait, no, the age is 13M, which could mean 13 months? That doesn't make sense. Maybe it's a typo. But regardless, the main issue is the dad slapping their ass periodically, and the author telling him to stop, which led to an argument.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is in the wrong for objecting to the physical contact. The key points are: the dad has been doing this since the author was a kid, claims it's not sexual, and the author has now asked him to stop. The dad responded with threats to not touch or talk to the author, asserting he made the author so he has the right.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. From a personal boundaries perspective, even within a family, a person has the right to say no to unwanted physical contact. The dad's argument that he made the author and thus has a right to touch them is incorrect. Parental rights don't extend to violating a child's personal boundaries. The author has the right to set boundaries, and the dad's response is dismissive and inappropriate.\n\nI should also consider if there's any cultural context where this is normal, but the post doesn't mention that. The author is clear that they don't like it and want it to stop. The dad's reaction is aggressive and controlling, which is a red flag. So, the author is not in the wrong for asserting their boundaries. The answer should be B.\n"
