He's emotionally a baby but he's no pedo.\n\nAnyways, today we were walking to the kitchen and he slapped my ass and I told him I didn't like it and that I wanted him to stop. He said he made me so he has the right to do it, and fumed up when I said that he didnt. In his words \"then i wont touch or talk to you, screw you\" he eventually ended with \"I'll touch you when I want, deal with it\" and went to his room.\n\nI'm well within my rights to ask him to stop, right?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting their father to slap their ass. The father has been doing this since they were a kid, and the author made it clear they don't like it now. The father's response was to say he made them so he has the right and then to cut off contact.\n\nFirst, personal boundaries. The author is setting a boundary by telling their dad to stop. That's their right. Even if the dad has done it before, it's okay for the author to change their comfort level. The dad's reaction is pretty extreme, threatening to stop touching or talking to them. That's not healthy. \n\nThe dad's argument that he made them so he has the right is problematic. No one has the right to touch another person without consent, regardless of the relationship. The author is asserting their autonomy, which is valid. The dad's response shows a lack of respect for the author's boundaries, which is an issue.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. They have the right to their body and to set boundaries. The dad's behavior, especially after being told to stop, is the issue here. Answer B.\n"
