He's emotionally a baby but he's no pedo.\n\nAnyways, today we were walking to the kitchen and he slapped my ass and I told him I didn't like it and that I wanted him to stop. He said he made me so he has the right to do it, and fumed up when I said that he didnt. In his words \"then i wont touch or talk to you, screw you\" he eventually ended with \"I'll touch you when I want, deal with it\" and went to his room.\n\nI'm well within my rights to ask him to stop, right?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a dad who's been slapping their ass since they were a kid, and the author finally told him to stop. The dad reacted by saying he made them so he can do it and threatened not to talk or touch them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is 13, so a minor. The parent has a responsibility to respect their child's boundaries. Even if the parent thinks it's harmless, the child's right to set boundaries is important. The parent's response was aggressive and disrespectful, using threats. That's not okay. The parent shouldn't use such language or behavior, especially when the child is expressing discomfort. The parent's argument that they have the right because they \"made\" them doesn't hold up. Parents don't have the right to physically touch a child against their will once the child is old enough to express discomfort. So the author is right to stand up for themselves. The parent is the one in the wrong here. The answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
