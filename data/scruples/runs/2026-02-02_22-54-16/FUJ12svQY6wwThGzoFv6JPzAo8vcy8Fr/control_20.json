He said he made me so he has the right to do it, and fumed up when I said that he didnt. In his words \"then i wont touch or talk to you, screw you\" he eventually ended with \"I'll touch you when I want, deal with it\" and went to his room.\n\nI'm well within my rights to ask him to stop, right?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a dad slapping his 13-year-old son's ass periodically, and the son tells him to stop. The dad responds with a threat to not touch or talk to him.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the dad's actions are appropriate. The user mentions that the dad says it's not sexual and there's no other inappropriate behavior. However, even if the intent is non-sexual, physical contact without consent can still be an issue. The son is 13, which is a minor, and parents have some authority, but there are boundaries in terms of personal space and consent.\n\nThe son is expressing his discomfort, which is valid. When someone says they don't want certain physical contact, the parent should respect that. The dad's response, threatening to stop touching or talking to him, is problematic. It's using emotional manipulation and not respecting the child's boundaries. That could be seen as a power imbalance and not healthy communication.\n\nLegally, parents do have some rights over their children, but physical contact should still be respectful. Depending on the jurisdiction, there might be laws about physical punishment or inappropriate touching. Even if not illegal, it's about respect and the child's autonomy.\n\nThe fact that the dad is emotionally immature might explain his reaction, but that doesn't justify it. The son is standing up for himself, which is a healthy way to set boundaries. The author is not in the wrong for asserting their comfort. The dad's response is unreasonable. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
