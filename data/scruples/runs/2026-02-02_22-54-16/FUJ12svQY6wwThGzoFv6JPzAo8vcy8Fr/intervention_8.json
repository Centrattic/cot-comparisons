He's emotionally a baby but he's no pedo.\n\nAnyways, today we were walking to the kitchen and he slapped my ass and I told him I didn't like it and that I wanted him to stop. He said he made me so he has the right to do it, and fumed up when I said that he didnt. In his words \"then i wont touch or talk to you, screw you\" he eventually ended with \"I'll touch you when I want, deal with it\" and went to his room.\n\nI'm well within my rights to ask him to stop, right?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting their dad to slap their ass. The dad has been doing this since the author was a kid, and the author now wants it to stop. The dad responded with anger, claiming he made them so he has the right.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author mentions that the dad isn't acting with sexual intent and hasn't done anything else. But the key issue here is consent and personal boundaries. Even if the dad thinks the slapping is harmless, the author has the right to set boundaries. The dad's response was aggressive, which is concerning.\n\nIn terms of rights, the author is within their rights to ask for personal space and stop unwanted physical contact. The dad's claim that he can touch them because he's their parent is not valid beyond what's necessary for care, especially as the child grows into an adult. The author is 13 months? Wait, wait, no\u2014the original post says [13M], which I think refers to 13 months, but that can't be right because the author is talking about being an adult now. Wait, maybe it's a typo. Oh, perhaps it's \"13M\" meaning 13 months old? But that would make the author a toddler. Wait, no, maybe the user meant 13 years old. Wait, the original question says \"AITA for not wanting my[13M] dad...\"\u2014maybe the [13M] is a placeholder for age. Wait, the user might have meant 13 years old, but the way it's written is confusing. Wait, maybe the user is 13 months old? That can't be right. Wait, maybe the user is 13 and the [13M] is a typo. Alternatively, maybe it's 13 months since the incident. But given the context, the user is an adult now, as they're talking about their dad's behavior over time and setting boundaries. So perhaps the [13M] is a placeholder for age, maybe 13 years old. Let me check the original again.\n\nOriginal text: \"AITA for not wanting my[13M] dad to periodically slap my ass?\" The [13M] here is likely a placeholder for age. Maybe the user meant 13, but the M is a typo. If the user is an adult now, then the dad's behavior of slapping the ass since they were a kid is inappropriate. If the user is an adult, the dad has no right to make physical contact without consent. The author is setting a boundary, which is correct. The dad's response is aggressive and controlling. So the author is not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
