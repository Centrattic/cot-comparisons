He said he made me so he has the right to do it, and fumed up when I said that he didnt. In his words \"then i wont touch or talk to you, screw you\" he eventually ended with \"I'll touch you when I want, deal with it\" and went to his room.\n\nI'm well within my rights to ask him to stop, right?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting their dad to slap their ass periodically. The dad has been doing this since they were a kid and claims it's not sexual. When the author asked him to stop, the dad got angry and said he made them so he has the right.\n\nFirst, I need to consider consent and personal boundaries. Even in family relationships, physical boundaries are important. The author is an adult now (13 months mentioned, but probably 13 years old? Wait, wait, the original says \"13M\"\u2014maybe that's a typo. Wait, no, the user's initial message says \"My[13M] dad\"\u2014probably a typo for \"My 13-year-old\" or \"My dad is 13 months\"? Wait, that doesn't make sense. Wait, the original question is in the context of a Reddit-style \"Am I the Asshole\" post. The user wrote \"AITA for not wanting my[13M] dad...\"\u2014probably \"13M\" is a typo for \"13-year-old\" or \"my 13-year-old dad\"? That doesn't make sense. Wait, maybe it's a typo for \"my 13-month-old\" but that's also odd. Wait, maybe the user meant \"my 40-year-old\" or something else? Hmm. Maybe \"13M\" is a typo for \"my 13-year-old dad\"\u2014but a 13-year-old dad would be a teenager. Maybe the user is 13 months old? That also doesn't make sense. Maybe the user intended to write \"my 13-year-old\" but made a typo. Let me check the original text again.\n\nOriginal text: \"AITA for not wanting my[13M] dad to periodically slap my ass?\" The [13M] is probably a placeholder, maybe the user meant their age. Wait, maybe \"13M\" is \"13 months\"? That would mean the user is 13 months old, which is a baby. But the dad is slapping their ass periodically since they were a kiddo. If the user is an adult now, maybe they're 20 or so. But the \"13M\" is confusing. Maybe it's a typo, like \"my 30-year-old dad\" or something. Alternatively, maybe \"13M\" is \"my 13-month-old\" but that would be a baby. Maybe the user meant \"my 13-year-old\" but mistyped. Let's assume that the user is an adult, maybe 18+ years old, and the dad has been slapping their ass since they were a child. The key issue is the dad's behavior and the author's response.\n\nThe dad's argument is that he made them (as in he's their father) so he has the right to do it. The author is setting a boundary by asking him to stop, which is a reasonable action. The dad's response is to become angry and say he'll stop talking to them, which is not acceptable. Parents shouldn't use threats to enforce certain behaviors, especially when their actions involve physical contact that the child now finds uncomfortable.\n\nEven if the dad's intentions aren't sexual, the physical touch needs to be consensual. As the child grows into an adult, they have the right to set their own boundaries. The author is not in the wrong for asserting those boundaries. The dad is overstepping by not respecting the author's wishes and using threats. So the correct answer is B: the author is not in the wrong.\n"
