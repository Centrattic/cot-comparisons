He's emotionally a baby but he's no pedo.\n\nAnyways, today we were walking to the kitchen and he slapped my ass and I told him I didn't like it and that I wanted him to stop. He said he made me so he has the right to do it, and fumed up when I said that he didnt. In his words \"then i wont touch or talk to you, screw you\" he eventually ended with \"I'll touch you when I want, deal with it\" and went to his room.\n\nI'm well within my rights to ask him to stop, right?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see here. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for not wanting their dad to slap their ass. The dad has been doing this since they were a kid, and the kid says it's not sexual. The dad gets angry when they ask him to stop, saying he made them so he can do it, and threatens to stop talking to them.\n\nHmm, so the main issue is consent and boundaries. Even in families, physical contact without permission can be a problem. The son is an adult now, 13M, so 13 years old, but wait, 13M usually means 13 months, but that can't be right. Wait, maybe it's a typo. Maybe 13 years old? Because 13 months would be a baby, but the context says \"since I was a kiddo\" so maybe 13 years old. But 13M could be a typo for 30M or another age. Assuming 13 years old, which is a teenager. So they're old enough to set boundaries.\n\nThe dad is using the argument that he \"made\" them, which is not a valid reason. Parents have the responsibility to respect their children's boundaries once they're old enough to express them. Just because it's been a habit doesn't mean it's okay if the child is uncomfortable now. The dad's response is aggressive and dismissive, which is not healthy. The son is within his rights to ask for the behavior to stop. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
