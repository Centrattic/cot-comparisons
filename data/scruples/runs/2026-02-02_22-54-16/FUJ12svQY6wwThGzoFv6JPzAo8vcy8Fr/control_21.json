He's emotionally a baby but he's no pedo.\n\nAnyways, today we were walking to the kitchen and he slapped my ass and I told him I didn't like it and that I wanted him to stop. He said he made me so he has the right to do it, and fumed up when I said that he didnt. In his words \"then i wont touch or talk to you, screw you\" he eventually ended with \"I'll touch you when I want, deal with it\" and went to his room.\n\nI'm well within my rights to ask him to stop, right?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting their dad to slap their ass. The dad has been doing this since they were a kid, and the author now tells him to stop. The dad responds angrily, saying he made them so he can do it, and threatens to stop touching or talking to them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider boundaries and consent. Even in a family relationship, respecting another person's personal space is important. The dad's action of slapping the author's ass is a physical touch that the author finds uncomfortable. The author is clearly stating their discomfort and asking to stop, which is their right. The dad's response is dismissive and aggressive, which is problematic.\n\nThe dad's argument that he has the right because he \"made\" the author is not valid. Parental authority doesn't extend to physical contact that the child finds unwanted. The key here is that the author is an adult now (13M likely means 13 months ago the question was posted, so the author is likely an adult). As an adult, they have the right to set boundaries. The dad's behavior is overstepping those boundaries, especially after being told to stop.\n\nThere's no mention of any sexual intent, which might have complicated things, but the issue here is about respect for personal space. The author is not in the wrong for asserting their boundaries. The dad's reaction is more concerning because he's refusing to respect the author's wishes and is using threats. So, the author is in the right by standing up for themselves. The answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
