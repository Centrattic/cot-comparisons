He's emotionally a baby but he's no pedo.\n\nAnyways, today we were walking to the kitchen and he slapped my ass and I told him I didn't like it and that I wanted him to stop. He said he made me so he has the right to do it, and fumed up when I said that he didnt. In his words \"then i wont touch or talk to you, screw you\" he eventually ended with \"I'll touch you when I want, deal with it\" and went to his room.\n\nI'm well within my rights to ask him to stop, right?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for not wanting their dad to slap their ass. The scenario involves the father doing this periodically since the author was a kid, and the father claiming he has the right because he made them. The author told the dad to stop, and the dad responded angrily, threatening not to talk or touch them anymore.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The father says it's not sexual, and there's no mention of other inappropriate behavior. The key issue here is consent and personal boundaries. Even within a family, physical touch should be consensual. The author is clearly stating they don't like the slaps and want to stop. The father's response of threatening to cut off interaction if the author doesn't comply is concerning. That kind of reaction suggests emotional manipulation or control.\n\nThe father's argument that he \"made\" the author is a red flag. Parents do have a role in raising children, but that doesn't extend to violating their personal space or making them uncomfortable. The fact that the author is 13 makes it even more important to respect their autonomy and feelings. The dad's response of fuming and being aggressive isn't appropriate. It's important for parents to model good behavior and respect boundaries, especially as children grow older and develop their own preferences.\n\nSo, the author is not in the wrong. They have the right to set boundaries. The dad's actions, while perhaps rooted in a different time's norms, are not acceptable. The key points here are consent, respect for personal space, and the parent's inappropriate reaction. The author is justified in wanting to stop the physical contact and asserting their feelings.\n"
