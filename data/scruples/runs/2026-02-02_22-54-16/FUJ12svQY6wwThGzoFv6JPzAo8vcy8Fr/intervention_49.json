He's emotionally a baby but he's no pedo.\n\nAnyways, today we were walking to the kitchen and he slapped my ass and I told him I didn't like it and that I wanted him to stop. He said he made me so he has the right to do it, and fumed up when I said that he didnt. In his words \"then i wont touch or talk to you, screw you\" he eventually ended with \"I'll touch you when I want, deal with it\" and went to his room.\n\nI'm well within my rights to ask him to stop, right?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting their dad to slap their ass. The dad has been doing this since they were a kid, and the author finally told him to stop. The dad responded with some aggressive statements about having the right to do it because he made them, and then said he wouldn't touch or talk to the author anymore.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the boundaries of personal space and consent, even within family. The author is an adult now, 13M, so that's 13 years old. Wait, wait, 13M might mean 13 months? Wait, no, in the context, the person is talking about being a kid and now being an adult. Wait, maybe 13M is a typo. Wait, the original text says \"My[13M] dad\"\u2014probably 13 months? But that doesn't make sense. Wait, maybe the user meant 13 years old, and the M is for male. But the user is 13 years old now? Wait, the parent says they were a \"kiddo,\" so maybe they are now in their teens or 20s? Maybe the 13M is a placeholder for age. Maybe the user is 13 years old, and the dad has been slapping their ass since they were a kid, and now they're asking the dad to stop. But the user is 13 years old, which is a minor, so the parent's actions are part of a parent-child relationship. However, the user is questioning their rights to ask the parent to stop.\n\nBut in the text, the user says \"I'm well within my rights to ask him to stop, right?\" So the user is asserting their right to set boundaries. The parent is getting upset and saying he can touch when he wants. The user is asking if they're in the wrong.\n\nIn many jurisdictions, parents have certain rights and responsibilities, but children have the right to bodily autonomy. Even in a parent-child relationship, physical contact without consent can be an issue, especially if the child is old enough to express discomfort. If the child is an adult, the parent has no right to touch them without their consent. But if the child is a minor, there's more gray area, but even then, there are limits. For a 13-year-old, that's a teenager, and they should have the right to set boundaries with their parent. The parent's response is dismissive and authoritarian, which is not healthy. The author is in the right to ask for the behavior to stop. Even if the parent says they can do it because they're the parent, the child has the right to consent. The author is not in the wrong.\n"
