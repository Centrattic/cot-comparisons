He's emotionally a baby but he's no pedo.\n\nAnyways, today we were walking to the kitchen and he slapped my ass and I told him I didn't like it and that I wanted him to stop. He said he made me so he has the right to do it, and fumed up when I said that he didnt. In his words \"then i wont touch or talk to you, screw you\" he eventually ended with \"I'll touch you when I want, deal with it\" and went to his room.\n\nI'm well within my rights to ask him to stop, right?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the post is wrong for not wanting their dad to slap their ass. The dad has been doing this since they were a kid, and the author finally told him to stop. The dad responded angrily, saying he made them so he can do it, and threatened not to talk or touch them anymore unless they comply.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is 13M, so they're a teenager. The dad's actions are physical and could be seen as a boundary issue, even if the dad claims it's not sexual. The author is asserting their comfort and boundaries, which is important for healthy relationships. \n\nLegally, while parents do have some rights, they also need to respect their children's autonomy. If a child feels uncomfortable with physical contact, the parent should respect that. The dad's response is aggressive and dismissive, which is concerning. The author is standing up for themselves, which is a positive action. \n\nHowever, some might argue that the dad's actions were meant as playful or affectionate. But even in that case, consent is key. The author has the right to say no. The dad overstepped by not respecting their request and using threats. \n\nLooking at the dynamics, the dad's behavior is emotionally immature, as mentioned. The author is trying to set boundaries, which is healthy. So, the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
