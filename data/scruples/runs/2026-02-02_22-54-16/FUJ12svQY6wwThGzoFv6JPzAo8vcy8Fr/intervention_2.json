He's emotionally a baby but he's no pedo.\n\nAnyways, today we were walking to the kitchen and he slapped my ass and I told him I didn't like it and that I wanted him to stop. He said he made me so he has the right to do it, and fumed up when I said that he didnt. In his words \"then i wont touch or talk to you, screw you\" he eventually ended with \"I'll touch you when I want, deal with it\" and went to his room.\n\nI'm well within my rights to ask him to stop, right?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting their dad to slap their ass. The dad has been doing this since they were a kid, and the author finally asked him to stop. The dad responded negatively and said he made them so he can do it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider consent and personal boundaries. Even within a family, physical touch without consent can be an issue. The key here is that the author is an adult now (13M probably means 13 months old? Wait, no, maybe it's 13 years old? Or maybe \"13M\" is a typo. Wait, the user says \"13M\" but that might be a mistake. Wait, the original question says \"my[13M] dad\"\u2014probably a typo for 36 years old? Maybe the user meant \"my [age] dad\"\u2014but the original is unclear. Wait, the user wrote \"AITA for not wanting my[13M] dad...\"\u2014maybe that's a placeholder for age? Like the user's dad is 36? Or maybe it's a formatting error. Maybe it's supposed to be \"13-year-old\" but that doesn't make sense. Maybe \"13M\" is a typo for 36? Not sure. But regardless, the main point is the author is an adult now.\n\nThe key points: The author is setting boundaries by asking their dad to stop a physical action. The dad is using his role as a parent to justify the touch, but the author is asserting their right to personal space. Legally and ethically, parents don't have the right to touch adult children in ways that the adult child finds uncomfortable, even if it's been a long-standing habit. The dad's reaction is dismissive and authoritarian, which isn't healthy, especially if the adult child is capable of making their own decisions. The author is correct in stating their boundaries. So the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
