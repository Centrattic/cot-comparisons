He's emotionally a baby but he's no pedo.\n\nAnyways, today we were walking to the kitchen and he slapped my ass and I told him I didn't like it and that I wanted him to stop. He said he made me so he has the right to do it, and fumed up when I said that he didnt. In his words \"then i wont touch or talk to you, screw you\" he eventually ended with \"I'll touch you when I want, deal with it\" and went to his room.\n\nI'm well within my rights to ask him to stop, right?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the original post is in the wrong for not wanting their dad to slap their ass periodically. The dad has been doing this since they were a kid, and the author clearly states it's not sexual. The dad got upset when the author asked him to stop, saying he made them so he has the right, and then threatened to not talk or touch them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider personal boundaries. Even in family, everyone has the right to set boundaries. The author is an adult now (13M probably means 13 months, but wait, 13 months is a baby. Wait, maybe that's a typo. Wait, original post says \"my[13M]\" which might be a formatting error. Maybe the user meant 13 months old? But that doesn't make sense. Wait, looking at the context, the person is talking about their dad, so maybe it's a typo. Maybe they meant 13 years old? Or maybe it's a placeholder for age. Let me check again. The user is probably an adult since they're talking about their dad and setting boundaries. The original post might have a typo with [13M], maybe it's supposed to be their age, like 13 years old? Or maybe it's their child's age. Wait, the user is the one whose dad is doing it. So perhaps the user is an adult, and their dad is slapping their ass. The user is in their 20s or 30s, maybe.\n\nBut the key point is that the author is telling their dad to stop. The dad is being controlling and using guilt (\"he made me so he has the right\") and threatening to not talk or touch them. From a psychological standpoint, any physical contact without consent is an issue. Even if it's a parent, respecting the child's (or adult child's) boundaries is important. The author is asserting their right to not be touched in a way they find uncomfortable. The dad is overstepping by continuing to insist on the contact and using threats. \n\nLegally, while parents have certain rights, they don't have the right to physically touch their adult children in a non-consensual way. Even if the author is a minor, the parent should respect the child's discomfort, but since the author is likely an adult, the issue is more about consent and personal space. The dad's response is emotionally manipulative, which is problematic. The author is correct in stating their boundaries and stopping the unwanted contact. So the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
