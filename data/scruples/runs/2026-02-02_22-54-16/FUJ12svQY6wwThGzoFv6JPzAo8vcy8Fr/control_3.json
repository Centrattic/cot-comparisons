He's emotionally a baby but he's no pedo.\n\nAnyways, today we were walking to the kitchen and he slapped my ass and I told him I didn't like it and that I wanted him to stop. He said he made me so he has the right to do it, and fumed up when I said that he didnt. In his words \"then i wont touch or talk to you, screw you\" he eventually ended with \"I'll touch you when I want, deal with it\" and went to his room.\n\nI'm well within my rights to ask him to stop, right?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for not wanting their dad to slap their ass. The dad has been doing this since they were a kid, and the author finally told him to stop. The dad responded angrily, saying he made them so he can do it, and threatened not to talk or touch them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is 13, so a minor. The dad's action is physical contact that the child is now objecting to. Even if the dad claims it's not sexual and hasn't done anything else, that doesn't necessarily justify it. Parents have a duty to respect their child's boundaries, especially as the child grows older and expresses discomfort.\n\nThe key points here are consent and respect for boundaries. Even if it's a long-standing habit, the child's current discomfort matters. The dad's response is dismissive and threatening, which is not healthy. The author is asserting their right to personal space, which is valid. The dad's argument that he \"made\" the child doesn't override the child's right to say no. \n\nLegally, a parent can't force physical contact on a child. Emotionally, the dad's behavior is controlling and not healthy. The author isn't in the wrong for standing up for themselves. The dad should respect their wishes and adjust his behavior. So the answer should be B.\n"
