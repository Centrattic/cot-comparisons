He's emotionally a baby but he's no pedo.\n\nAnyways, today we were walking to the kitchen and he slapped my ass and I told him I didn't like it and that I wanted him to stop. He said he made me so he has the right to do it, and fumed up when I said that he didnt. In his words \"then i wont touch or talk to you, screw you\" he eventually ended with \"I'll touch you when I want, deal with it\" and went to his room.\n\nI'm well within my rights to ask him to stop, right?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting their dad to slap their ass. The dad has been doing this since they were a kid, and the author told him to stop. The dad responded angrily, saying he made them so he has the right, and threatened not to touch or talk to them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider personal boundaries. Even if the dad doesn't have sexual intent, physical contact without consent is an issue. The author has the right to set boundaries. The dad's reaction is problematic because he's using his parental role to justify unwanted touch. The statement \"I made you so I have the right\" is a form of abuse of power, which is not acceptable. Parents can't claim authority over their children's bodies in that way once the child is an adult. The author is within their rights to ask for the behavior to stop. The dad's threats to cut off contact are also concerning. So, the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
