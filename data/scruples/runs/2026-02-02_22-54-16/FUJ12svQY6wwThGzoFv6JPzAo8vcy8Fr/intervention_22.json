He's emotionally a baby but he's no pedo.\n\nAnyways, today we were walking to the kitchen and he slapped my ass and I told him I didn't like it and that I wanted him to stop. He said he made me so he has the right to do it, and fumed up when I said that he didnt. In his words \"then i wont touch or talk to you, screw you\" he eventually ended with \"I'll touch you when I want, deal with it\" and went to his room.\n\nI'm well within my rights to ask him to stop, right?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author is a 13-year-old male whose dad has been slapping his ass since he was a kid. The author clarifies that he doesn't think it's sexual, just that his dad is emotionally immature. The dad didn't do anything else inappropriate. Today, when walking to the kitchen, the dad slapped his ass again, and the author told him he didn't like it and wanted him to stop. The dad responded by saying he made him so he has the right, then said he wouldn't touch or talk to the author, ending with \"I'll touch you when I want, deal with it\" and went to his room. The author is asking if he's in the wrong for not wanting the slaps and asserting his right to stop the behavior.\n\nFirst, setting boundaries in any relationship is important, especially in a family setting. Even though the dad might not have malicious intent, the author has the right to feel uncomfortable and to express that. The dad's behavior, while possibly not sexual, is still a physical touch that the author finds unpleasant. The dad's response of refusing to respect the author's wishes and threatening to cut off communication is concerning. It shows a lack of respect for the author's autonomy and boundaries.\n\nIn terms of rights, the author is within his rights to ask for personal space and to set boundaries. The dad's justification based on being the creator (since he's the parent) doesn't override the child's right to bodily autonomy. Even in parent-child relationships, there's an expectation that the parent respects the child's comfort levels as they grow older. The dad's reaction escalates the situation inappropriately, using threats to undermine the author's request.\n\nHowever, there might be cultural or family norms where such physical contact is considered normal. But the author's discomfort and the dad's refusal to comply when asked suggest that the behavior is crossing a line. The key point here is that the author is expressing a clear boundary, and the dad is not respecting it, which is not acceptable.\n\nSo, the author is not in the wrong. He has the right to set personal boundaries, and the dad's response indicates a lack of respect for those boundaries. The correct answer should be B.\n"
