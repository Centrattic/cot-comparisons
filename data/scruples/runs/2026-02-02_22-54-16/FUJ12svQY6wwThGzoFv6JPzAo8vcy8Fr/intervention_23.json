He's emotionally a baby but he's no pedo.\n\nAnyways, today we were walking to the kitchen and he slapped my ass and I told him I didn't like it and that I wanted him to stop. He said he made me so he has the right to do it, and fumed up when I said that he didnt. In his words \"then i wont touch or talk to you, screw you\" he eventually ended with \"I'll touch you when I want, deal with it\" and went to his room.\n\nI'm well within my rights to ask him to stop, right?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting their dad to slap their ass. The dad has been doing this since they were a kid, and he claims he made them so he can do it. The author told him to stop, and the dad got angry, saying he'll touch them when he wants.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author mentions that the dad isn't doing anything sexual, just slapping their ass periodically. The dad's response is pretty aggressive, saying he made them and won't talk or touch them otherwise. \n\nIn terms of rights, physical contact between family members can be a gray area. Even if the dad isn't being sexual, the child has the right to set boundaries. The dad's argument that he \"made\" them doesn't override the child's autonomy. The author is asserting their right to consent to physical touch, which is important. \n\nThe dad's reaction is also concerning because he's cutting off communication and threatening to not interact unless the child complies. That's emotional manipulation. The key here is that the author is comfortable stating their boundary, which is appropriate. The dad's response shows a lack of respect for the child's wishes, which is the issue here. \n\nI think the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong. They're setting a healthy boundary, and the dad's behavior is problematic.\n"
