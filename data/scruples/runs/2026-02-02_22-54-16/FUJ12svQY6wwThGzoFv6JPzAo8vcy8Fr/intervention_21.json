He's emotionally a baby but he's no pedo.\n\nAnyways, today we were walking to the kitchen and he slapped my ass and I told him I didn't like it and that I wanted him to stop. He said he made me so he has the right to do it, and fumed up when I said that he didnt. In his words \"then i wont touch or talk to you, screw you\" he eventually ended with \"I'll touch you when I want, deal with it\" and went to his room.\n\nI'm well within my rights to ask him to stop, right?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for not wanting their dad to slap their ass. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the context: The dad has been slapping the author's ass since they were a kid, and the author is now 13. The dad claims it's not sexual and hasn't done anything else. The author told the dad they didn't like it and wanted him to stop. The dad responded with anger, saying he made them so he has the right, and that he'll touch them when he wants. The author is asking if they're in the wrong.\n\nI need to consider the dynamics here. The dad is an adult and the author is a minor. Even though the dad is the parent, the child has the right to set boundaries. Physical touch, even if not sexual, can be unwanted. The key points are consent and respect for personal space. The dad's response is dismissive and threatening, which isn't healthy. The author is standing up for themselves, which is appropriate. In any relationship, especially within a family, respecting each other's comfort is important. The dad's behavior is overstepping, and the author is correct in asserting their boundaries. The answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
