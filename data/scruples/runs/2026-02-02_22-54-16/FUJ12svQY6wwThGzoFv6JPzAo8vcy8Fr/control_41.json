He's emotionally a baby but he's no pedo.\n\nAnyways, today we were walking to the kitchen and he slapped my ass and I told him I didn't like it and that I wanted him to stop. He said he made me so he has the right to do it, and fumed up when I said that he didnt. In his words \"then i wont touch or talk to you, screw you\" he eventually ended with \"I'll touch you when I want, deal with it\" and went to his room.\n\nI'm well within my rights to ask him to stop, right?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a 13-year-old's dad slapping their ass periodically, and the kid telling the dad to stop. The dad responds with threats and anger. The question is if the author is wrong for not wanting this physical contact.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The dad is an adult, and the child is a minor. The dad claims he made the child, so he has the right. But the kid is setting a boundary. Even if the dad says it's not sexual, the key point is consent. Since the child is a minor, their consent is not valid in such interactions. Also, any form of physical contact without consent from the child could be problematic.\n\nIn many contexts, parents have certain rights, but they don't have the right to touch their child in a way that the child finds uncomfortable or unwanted, especially in a public setting like walking to the kitchen. The dad's reaction is also concerning because he's threatening to stop all interaction, which is a form of emotional manipulation. The author is standing up for themselves, which is a healthy boundary. The dad's behavior might indicate a lack of respect for the child's autonomy.\n\nLegally, while parents have authority, they also have a responsibility to respect their children's well-being. Physical contact that's unwanted, even if not sexual, could be seen as abusive. The answer would likely be B, the author is not in the wrong. They have the right to set boundaries and request to be treated with respect.\n"
