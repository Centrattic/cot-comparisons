He's emotionally a baby but he's no pedo.\n\nAnyways, today we were walking to the kitchen and he slapped my ass and I told him I didn't like it and that I wanted him to stop. He said he made me so he has the right to do it, and fumed up when I said that he didnt. In his words \"then i wont touch or talk to you, screw you\" he eventually ended with \"I'll touch you when I want, deal with it\" and went to his room.\n\nI'm well within my rights to ask him to stop, right?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a 13-year-old's dad slapping their ass periodically, and the kid tells the dad to stop. The dad responds by saying he made them so he has the right and threatens to stop touching or talking to them. The author is asking if they're in the wrong for wanting the dad to stop.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age. The person is 13, so a minor. Physical contact between a parent and child can be a sensitive area. The dad's actions are slapping the ass, and he claims it's not sexual. The kid is uncomfortable and sets a boundary. The dad's reaction is aggressive and dismissive.\n\nIn many cultures, parents do things like this as a form of affection or discipline, but the key here is consent and the child's comfort. Even if the parent thinks it's harmless, the child's right to set boundaries should be respected. The dad's response is authoritarian and doesn't acknowledge the child's feelings. The child is within their rights to express discomfort and ask to stop. The answer is likely B, the author is not in the wrong. The dad is overstepping by not respecting the boundary and reacting negatively.\n"
