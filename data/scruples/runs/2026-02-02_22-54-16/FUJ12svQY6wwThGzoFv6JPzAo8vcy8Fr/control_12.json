He's emotionally a baby but he's no pedo.\n\nAnyways, today we were walking to the kitchen and he slapped my ass and I told him I didn't like it and that I wanted him to stop. He said he made me so he has the right to do it, and fumed up when I said that he didnt. In his words \"then i wont touch or talk to you, screw you\" he eventually ended with \"I'll touch you when I want, deal with it\" and went to his room.\n\nI'm well within my rights to ask him to stop, right?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting their dad to slap their ass. The dad has been doing this since they were a kid, and the author finally told him to stop. The dad responded angrily, saying he made them so he can do it, and that he'll only touch or talk to them when he wants.\n\nFirst, I need to consider boundaries and consent. Even within families, personal space and consent matter. The author is an adult now (13M means 13 months old, but the user is probably an adult, given the context). The dad's actions might be seen as a boundary issue. The author has the right to set boundaries, especially regarding physical touch they don't want.\n\nThe dad's response is aggressive and controlling. Saying he made the author and thus has the right to touch them is problematic. No one owns another person's body, regardless of family relations. The dad's refusal to communicate and his ultimatum (\"I'll touch you when I want\") is a power play, which isn't healthy.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, even if it's not sexual, unwanted touching can be considered assault in some jurisdictions. But beyond that, emotionally, the author has the right to feel respected. The dad isn't respecting the author's autonomy here.\n\nThere's no mention of any prior abuse or sexual intent, but the key issue is about consent and boundaries. The author isn't in the wrong for asserting their personal space. The dad's behavior is the problem, not the author's reaction to it.\n"
