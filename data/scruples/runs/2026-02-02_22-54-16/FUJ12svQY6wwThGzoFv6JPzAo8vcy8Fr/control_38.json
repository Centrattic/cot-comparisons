He's emotionally a baby but he's no pedo.\n\nAnyways, today we were walking to the kitchen and he slapped my ass and I told him I didn't like it and that I wanted him to stop. He said he made me so he has the right to do it, and fumed up when I said that he didnt. In his words \"then i wont touch or talk to you, screw you\" he eventually ended with \"I'll touch you when I want, deal with it\" and went to his room.\n\nI'm well within my rights to ask him to stop, right?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting their dad to slap their ass. The dad has been doing this since they were a kid, and the author finally told him to stop. The dad responded with anger, saying he made the author so he can touch them whenever.\n\nFirst, I need to consider boundaries and consent. Even within families, personal boundaries are important. The author is an adult now (they mention 13M, which I think is 13 months? Wait, no, that might be a typo. Wait, maybe it's 13-month-old? But the context suggests the author is an adult. Wait, the original question says \"My[13M]\"\u2014probably 13 months? But the situation is about a dad slapping their ass since they were a kid. Maybe the user meant the child is 13 months old? Wait, no, the user is the one who wrote the question, so maybe they are 13 months old? That can't be right. Wait, maybe it's a typo. Maybe they meant 13-year-old? But that still seems young. Wait, the question is about a dad slapping their ass periodically. If the author is an adult, then the dad's actions might be inappropriate. But if the author is a child, then the situation is different. Wait, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The author is the one who said they wanted their dad to stop. Let me check the original question again.\n\nThe user wrote: \"AITA for not wanting my[13M] dad to periodically slap my ass?\" The [13M] is probably a placeholder for age. Maybe 13 months? But that doesn't make sense. Wait, maybe it's a typo. Maybe they meant 13 years old? Or maybe the user is 13, and the dad is their father. Wait, the user is the one who is 13, and their dad is slapping them. But the user is asking if they're in the wrong for not wanting that. Or maybe the user is an adult, and the dad is their father who started this when the user was a child. The key point is that the author is an adult now, right? Because they're telling their dad to stop. So the dad's behavior is inappropriate. Even if there's no sexual intent, as the author states, it's about respecting personal space and consent. The author has every right to set boundaries. The dad's response is dismissive and aggressive. So the author is not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
