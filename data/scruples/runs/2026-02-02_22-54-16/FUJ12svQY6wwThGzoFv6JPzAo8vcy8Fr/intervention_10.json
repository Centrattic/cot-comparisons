He's emotionally a baby but he's no pedo.\n\nAnyways, today we were walking to the kitchen and he slapped my ass and I told him I didn't like it and that I wanted him to stop. He said he made me so he has the right to do it, and fumed up when I said that he didnt. In his words \"then i wont touch or talk to you, screw you\" he eventually ended with \"I'll touch you when I want, deal with it\" and went to his room.\n\nI'm well within my rights to ask him to stop, right?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a dad who has been slapping their ass since they were a kid, and the author told their dad to stop. The dad responded angrily, saying he made them so he can do it, and then threatened to not talk to them. The author is asking if they're in the wrong for setting that boundary.\n\nFirst, I need to consider consent and personal boundaries. Even in family relationships, it's important to respect each other's autonomy. The author is an adult now (13M probably means 13 months old, but the person is an adult, so maybe 13 years old when the dad started? Wait, no, the age might be different. Wait, the original text says \"13M\" which could be 13 months, but that doesn't make sense with being a kid. Maybe it's a typo for 13 years old? Or maybe the user is 13 years old now? Wait, the context is a parent slapping them since they were a kid, so if the person is now an adult, that makes more sense. Let me check the original text again: \"My[13M] dad has been slapping my ass periodically since I was a kiddo...\" Maybe the 13M is a typo for 13-year-old male. So the person is an adult, perhaps 20 or older, and their dad has been doing this since childhood. Now the author is an adult, and they're setting a boundary. \n\nIn that case, the author has a right to set boundaries. The dad's behavior, even if he claims it's not sexual, is a form of physical contact that the adult child now finds uncomfortable. The author is within their rights to ask their dad to stop. The dad's response is controlling and abusive, using threats to assert dominance. The key here is that as an adult, the child has the right to bodily autonomy. Even if the dad is acting out of habit or a misguided sense of closeness, the adult child's comfort and consent matter.\n\nSo the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong. They have every right to ask their dad to stop touching them in a way they find inappropriate now that they're an adult.\n"
