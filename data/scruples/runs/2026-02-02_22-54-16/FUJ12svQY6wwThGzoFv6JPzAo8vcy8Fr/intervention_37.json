He's emotionally a baby but he's no pedo.\n\nAnyways, today we were walking to the kitchen and he slapped my ass and I told him I didn't like it and that I wanted him to stop. He said he made me so he has the right to do it, and fumed up when I said that he didnt. In his words \"then i wont touch or talk to you, screw you\" he eventually ended with \"I'll touch you when I want, deal with it\" and went to his room.\n\nI'm well within my rights to ask him to stop, right?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for not wanting their 13-year-old son's dad to slap their ass. The situation is that the dad has been doing this since the author was a kid, and now the author told him to stop. The dad got upset and said things like \"I made you so I can touch you\" and refused to comply.\n\nFirst, I need to consider consent and personal boundaries. The author is an adult now (13M means 13 months, but wait, maybe that's a typo? Wait, the original post says \"My[13M]\" which probably means the author is 13 months old? That can't be right. Wait, maybe it's supposed to be \"My [13-year-old] son\"? No, the context says the author is talking about their own dad. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the original post says \"AITA for not wanting my[13M] dad to...\" Hmm, maybe there's a typo here. Maybe \"13M\" is supposed to be the author's age, like 13 months? That wouldn't make sense because they're talking about their dad. Maybe it's a typo for 13-year-old? Or maybe \"13M\" is a username or something. Maybe the user is an adult, and their dad has been slapping their ass since they were a kid. The key point is that the author is an adult now, and they don't want the dad to continue this behavior. \n\nThe dad's response was dismissive and aggressive, which is problematic. The author asserting their right to set boundaries is important. Physical touch, even if not sexual, without consent can be an issue. The dad's justification that he made them so he can touch them is not a valid reason. Parents have rights, but they don't have unlimited rights, especially when the child is an adult. The author is within their rights to ask for personal space and stop unwanted physical contact. The dad's reaction is concerning because he's refusing to respect the author's wishes and is using threats. \n\nIn terms of legal and ethical standards, adults have the right to control their own bodies. The author's action in telling the dad to stop is appropriate. The dad's behavior crosses a line by not respecting the author's boundaries. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong here. The answer should be B.\n"
