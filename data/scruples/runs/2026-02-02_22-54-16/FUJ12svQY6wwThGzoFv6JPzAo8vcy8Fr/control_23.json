He's emotionally a baby but he's no pedo.\n\nAnyways, today we were walking to the kitchen and he slapped my ass and I told him I didn't like it and that I wanted him to stop. He said he made me so he has the right to do it, and fumed up when I said that he didnt. In his words \"then i wont touch or talk to you, screw you\" he eventually ended with \"I'll touch you when I want, deal with it\" and went to his room.\n\nI'm well within my rights to ask him to stop, right?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting their dad to slap their ass. The situation is that the dad has been doing this since they were a kid, and now the author told him to stop. The dad responded with some pretty strong reactions, saying he made them so he can touch them whenever.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author mentions that the dad isn't acting with any sexual intent, just that he's emotionally immature. But the key issue here is consent and personal boundaries. Even if it's a longstanding habit, the adult child has the right to their own body and can set boundaries. The dad's response is aggressive and dismissive, which is concerning.\n\nLegally, a parent doesn't have the right to touch an adult child in any way that the child doesn't consent to. So the author is well within their rights to ask for the behavior to stop. The dad's reaction, especially threatening to not touch or talk to them, is a form of manipulation and emotional control, which isn't acceptable.\n\nEmotionally, the author is asserting their autonomy, which is important. The dad's behavior is overstepping, especially when the child has clearly communicated they don't like it. The author isn't in the wrong for setting that boundary. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
