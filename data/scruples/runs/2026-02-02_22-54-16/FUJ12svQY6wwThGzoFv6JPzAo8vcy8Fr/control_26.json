He's emotionally a baby but he's no pedo.\n\nAnyways, today we were walking to the kitchen and he slapped my ass and I told him I didn't like it and that I wanted him to stop. He said he made me so he has the right to do it, and fumed up when I said that he didnt. In his words \"then i wont touch or talk to you, screw you\" he eventually ended with \"I'll touch you when I want, deal with it\" and went to his room.\n\nI'm well within my rights to ask him to stop, right?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting their dad to slap their ass. The dad has been doing this since they were a kid, and the author finally told him to stop. The dad responded angrily, saying he made them so he can do it and that he'll only touch them when he wants.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author mentions that the dad isn't acting in a sexual way and hasn't done anything else inappropriate. But the issue here is about personal boundaries. Even if the dad's intentions aren't sexual, the act of slapping someone's ass without consent is a violation of personal space. The author has the right to set boundaries, regardless of the relationship. \n\nThe dad's response is a red flag. He's being controlling and aggressive, saying he'll stop talking or touching them unless they comply. That's not healthy. The author standing up for themselves by asking to stop is the right thing to do. The dad's argument that he made them doesn't hold weight because consent and respect are still required in any relationship. \n\nAlso, the fact that the author is 13 makes it more concerning. At that age, children are still learning about personal boundaries, and parents should model appropriate behavior. The dad's actions and response could be harmful, even if he's not a pedophile. The author isn't in the wrong for asserting their discomfort. They're taking a stand for their own comfort and safety. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer is B. The author is not in the wrong. They have the right to set boundaries and the dad's behavior is the issue here.\n"
