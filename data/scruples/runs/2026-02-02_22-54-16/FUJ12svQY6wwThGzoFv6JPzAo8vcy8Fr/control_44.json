He's emotionally a baby but he's no pedo.\n\nAnyways, today we were walking to the kitchen and he slapped my ass and I told him I didn't like it and that I wanted him to stop. He said he made me so he has the right to do it, and fumed up when I said that he didnt. In his words \"then i wont touch or talk to you, screw you\" he eventually ended with \"I'll touch you when I want, deal with it\" and went to his room.\n\nI'm well within my rights to ask him to stop, right?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking if the author (their son, a 13-year-old) is in the wrong for not wanting their dad to slap their ass. The dad says he made them, so he has the right, and threatens not to talk or touch them if they don't comply.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age here. The son is 13, so a minor. In many places, parents have certain rights and responsibilities, but those rights aren't absolute. Physical contact between parent and child can be a gray area, but when it comes to consent, even for minors, there's a line. The son is expressing discomfort, which is valid. The dad's response\u2014threatening to stop talking or touching unless the son complies\u2014seems controlling.\n\nThe dad's justification that he \"made\" them doesn't hold legal or ethical weight. Parents can't use that as a reason to impose unwanted physical contact. Even if there's no sexual intent, the child's right to bodily autonomy matters. The son is within his rights to set boundaries. The dad's threatening behavior is concerning and not appropriate. So the answer should be B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
