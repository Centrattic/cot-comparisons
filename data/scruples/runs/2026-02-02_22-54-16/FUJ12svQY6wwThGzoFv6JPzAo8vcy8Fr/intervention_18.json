He's emotionally a baby but he's no pedo.\n\nAnyways, today we were walking to the kitchen and he slapped my ass and I told him I didn't like it and that I wanted him to stop. He said he made me so he has the right to do it, and fumed up when I said that he didnt. In his words \"then i wont touch or talk to you, screw you\" he eventually ended with \"I'll touch you when I want, deal with it\" and went to his room.\n\nI'm well within my rights to ask him to stop, right?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) question is in the wrong for not wanting their father to slap their ass. The father has been doing this since the author was a child, and the author now wants it to stop. The father responded with anger, saying he made them so he can do it, and then threatened to not touch or talk to them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The father claims it's not sexual and there's no other inappropriate behavior mentioned. The author is 13M, which I assume means 13 months old? Wait, that can't be right. Wait, no, in AITA posts, \"13M\" usually stands for \"13 Months\" but that would be a baby. But the situation involves a dad giving a slap on the ass, which is more common with older children. Maybe \"13M\" is a typo? Maybe they meant 13 years old. That makes more sense. Otherwise, a 13-month-old can't be walking to the kitchen and having a conversation about it. So probably the author is 13 years old.\n\nBut the father's behavior of slapping the ass periodically might be part of a physical affection or discipline. However, the author is now expressing discomfort. Even if it's not sexual, the father's actions might be seen as overstepping. The key here is consent and personal boundaries. The author has every right to say they don't like it and want it to stop. The father's response, threatening to not touch or talk to them, is abusive. Using his authority as a parent to justify physical contact without consent is problematic. The father should respect the child's wishes. Even if it's a longstanding habit, the child's right to set boundaries is important. So the author is not in the wrong for asserting their boundaries. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
