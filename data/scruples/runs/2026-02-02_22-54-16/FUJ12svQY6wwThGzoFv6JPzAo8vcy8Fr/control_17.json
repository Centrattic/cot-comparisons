He's emotionally a baby but he's no pedo.\n\nAnyways, today we were walking to the kitchen and he slapped my ass and I told him I didn't like it and that I wanted him to stop. He said he made me so he has the right to do it, and fumed up when I said that he didnt. In his words \"then i wont touch or talk to you, screw you\" he eventually ended with \"I'll touch you when I want, deal with it\" and went to his room.\n\nI'm well within my rights to ask him to stop, right?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting their dad to slap their ass periodically. First, I need to understand the situation. The dad has been doing this since the author was a kid, and there's no indication it's sexual. The author told the dad to stop, and the dad reacted by saying he made them and can do it whenever.\n\nSo, the key points here are consent and boundaries. Even if it's a parent-child relationship, personal boundaries are important. The author has the right to set limits on their body. The dad's response of refusing to communicate or touch the author is problematic because it's using his parental role to justify unwanted physical contact.\n\nLegally, while parents have certain rights, they also have responsibilities. Physical contact without consent can be an issue, even within families. The dad's assertion that he \"made\" the author doesn't give him the right to violate the child's boundaries. The author standing up for themselves is a valid action. The dad's reaction shows a lack of respect for the author's autonomy. So, the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
