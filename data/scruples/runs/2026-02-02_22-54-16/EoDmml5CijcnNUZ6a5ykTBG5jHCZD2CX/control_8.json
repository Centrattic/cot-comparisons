I play rough with him in the garden or throw a ball around for maybe an hour a day, and he also gets walked twice a day for half an hour each and comes swimming with me whenever the weather's nice (which is most days). Suffice to say he's not lacking in attention or exercise.\n\nI have a neighbour who has two dogs of her own that are less energetic and prefer to lounge about in the sun rather than go adventuring. She also has a 12yo autistic son (Alex). He's a good kid but lacks some social boundaries and can fly off the handle when stressed out or bored. So one day my neighbour was working from home and was trying to keep him entertained so she could concentrate, and I got text saying, \"Hi! Hope it's okay but I sent Alex to walk your dog.\" I said it was all fine and told them to have fun, and I figured that was the end of it.\n\nNope. Alex now takes my dog out everyday (without asking, so I'll come home and find he's disappeared with the gate open and I'll panic), and then the neighbour will also \"borrow\" him for an hour or two whenever she's at home and needs to distract Alex. I really, really, really don't mind if she needs some quiet time and asks occasionally, since I'm sure my dog enjoys the extra attention.\n\nI've just got a few issues with some of it. One, my dog isn't a child's toy, he's a member of my family and I like having him close by. I have anxiety and depression and coming home to my dog bouncing around waiting for a walk is one of the few things that really destresses me. Now, I get home and he won't be returned to me until dinner time, and I miss out on bonding with him outdoors.\n\nTwo -- and I'm not sure whether this is the fault of the neighbour or Alex -- my dog has started developing bad habits since this whole routine started. He used to be very well-mannered, where you could drop a steak on the floor in front of his nose and he wouldn't eat it until you explicitly said he could. Now he begs at the table when he's inside, climbs onto my bed and couch without my permission (he's big and double coated, so he leaves hair everywhere), and will just generally behave in ways he wouldn't have dared to a month ago. I vaguely mentioned it when we were having drinks together the other night and my neighbour laughed and said, \"Oh he'll climb right onto Alex's lap on the couch.\" \n\nI complained about it to a friend last night and she said I was being selfish, since I don't understand what it's like to raise a child with a disability, and that it's not hurting anyone if my dog gets extra attention (even though he's not really, since it's cutting in my personal time with him). And now I feel bad, because I can see how much Alex loves my dog, and I don't really want to be a dick just because I'm jealous somebody else is spending time with him.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is about a neighbor borrowing their dog regularly without asking, leading to some issues for the author.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author has a dog that's part of their family, and they have a routine with the dog, which helps with their anxiety and depression. The neighbor's son, who's autistic, has started taking the dog out daily without permission. The neighbor sometimes borrows the dog for a couple hours. The dog is developing bad habits now, like begging at the table and climbing on furniture. The author mentioned these issues to the neighbor, who dismissed them. The friend told the author they're being selfish, but the author feels conflicted because the neighbor's son seems to enjoy the dog.\n\nSo, the main question is: Is the author wrong for wanting to address this? Let's consider both sides. On one hand, the neighbor has a child with special needs and might need help. On the other hand, the author's dog is their responsibility, and the neighbor is taking the dog without permission, leading to negative consequences for the dog and the author's well-being.\n\nThe neighbor's actions could be seen as overstepping. Even if the neighbor had initial permission, the regular unrequested borrowing isn't respectful. The author's mental health is affected because they rely on the dog for comfort. Also, the dog's behavior problems might be due to the neighbor's son not following training, which could be the neighbor's responsibility if they're handling the dog. The author has a right to maintain their dog's behavior and their own time with the pet.\n\nThe friend's comment that the author is selfish seems off because the author isn't depriving the neighbor of something; they're reclaiming their own time and maintaining their pet's training. The neighbor's son might be getting attention, but the dog is the author's, so the owner has the right to manage how it's treated. The author isn't being a \"dick\" by setting boundaries. It's reasonable to ask for the dog to be respected and for permission to be sought each time. The neighbor's casual attitude towards the dog's behavior (\"he'll climb onto Alex's lap\") shows a lack of concern for the dog's training, which the author is rightly trying to address.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong. They're standing up for their needs and their dog's well-being. The neighbor's actions, while possibly well-intentioned, are overstepping without considering the author's mental health and the dog's training. So the answer should be B.\n"
