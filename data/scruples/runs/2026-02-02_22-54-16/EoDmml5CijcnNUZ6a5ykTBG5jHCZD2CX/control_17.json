I play rough with him in the garden or throw a ball around for maybe an hour a day, and he also gets walked twice a day for half an hour each and comes swimming with me whenever the weather's nice (which is most days). Suffice to say he's not lacking in attention or exercise.\n\nI have a neighbour who has two dogs of her own that are less energetic and prefer to lounge about in the sun rather than go adventuring. She also has a 12yo autistic son (Alex). He's a good kid but lacks some social boundaries and can fly off the handle when stressed out or bored. So one day my neighbour was working from home and was trying to keep him entertained so she could concentrate, and I got text saying, \"Hi! Hope it's okay but I sent Alex to walk your dog.\" I said it was all fine and told them to have fun, and I figured that was the end of it.\n\nNope. Alex now takes my dog out everyday (without asking, so I'll come home and find he's disappeared with the gate open and I'll panic), and then the neighbour will also \"borrow\" him for an hour or two whenever she's at home and needs to distract Alex. I really, really, really don't mind if she needs some quiet time and asks occasionally, since I'm sure my dog enjoys the extra attention.\n\nI've just got a few issues with some of it. One, my dog isn't a child's toy, he's a member of my family and I like having him close by. I have anxiety and depression and coming home to my dog bouncing around waiting for a walk is one of the few things that really destresses me. Now, I get home and he won't be returned to me until dinner time, and I miss out on bonding with him outdoors.\n\nTwo -- and I'm not sure whether this is the fault of the neighbour or Alex -- my dog has started developing bad habits since this whole routine started. He used to be very well-mannered, where you could drop a steak on the floor in front of his nose and he wouldn't eat it until you explicitly said he could. Now he begs at the table when he's inside, climbs onto my bed and couch without my permission (he's big and double coated, so he leaves hair everywhere), and will just generally behave in ways he wouldn't have dared to a month ago. I vaguely mentioned it when we were having drinks together the other night and my neighbour laughed and said, \"Oh he'll climb right onto Alex's lap on the couch.\" \n\nI complained about it to a friend last night and she said I was being selfish, since I don't understand what it's like to raise a child with a disability, and that it's not hurting anyone if my dog gets extra attention (even though he's not really, since it's cutting in my personal time with him). And now I feel bad, because I can see how much Alex loves my dog, and I don't really want to be a dick just because I'm jealous somebody else is spending time with him.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. Let me break this down. The author has a dog that's been part of their family for a long time. The neighbor has an autistic son, Alex, who seems to really bond with the dog. The neighbor started having Alex take the dog out daily and \"borrow\" him for a few hours whenever needed. The author is upset for two main reasons: missing out on their own time with the dog, which is important for their mental health, and the dog developing bad habits.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. The author's dog is their responsibility, so they have the right to manage how their pet is treated and their own emotional needs. The neighbor's intentions are good\u2014trying to help Alex with his needs\u2014but without asking the author each time, it's becoming a regular occurrence. The initial permission was given once, but now it's daily, which the author didn't expect. That's a red flag. The neighbor should have discussed the routine with the author instead of assuming ongoing consent.\n\nSecond, the dog's behavior has changed. The neighbor's son might not be trained as well with the dog, leading to these bad habits. The author is responsible for their dog's training, so having someone else handle it without their oversight could be contributing to the problem. But the neighbor might not be aware of how their actions are affecting the dog's behavior. The author did mention the issue once, but the neighbor dismissed it with a joke, which isn't helpful.\n\nThe author's mental health is a key point. They have anxiety and depression, and their dog is a source of comfort. The neighbor's actions are impacting this, which is significant. The friend's comment that the author is being selfish ignores the author's valid emotional and psychological needs. Just because the neighbor has a good reason doesn't mean the author's needs are less important.\n\nAlso, the neighbor's dogs are less energetic, so maybe the dog isn't getting enough exercise with them. But the author's dog is getting plenty of exercise through their own routines. The neighbor's use of the dog as a distraction for Alex might be a temporary fix, but without communication, it's not sustainable. The author isn't being unreasonable here. They want to maintain their bond with the dog and ensure the dog's behavior stays good. The neighbor needs to be more considerate and have an open discussion with the author to find a middle ground, perhaps setting specific times for borrowing the dog and checking in regularly.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is not in the wrong. They have the right to their dog's companionship and to address the behavioral issues. The neighbor's actions, while well-meaning, are overstepping boundaries by taking the dog without asking and not respecting the author's needs. The answer should be B.\n"
