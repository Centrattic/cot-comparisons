I play rough with him in the garden or throw a ball around for maybe an hour a day, and he also gets walked twice a day for half an hour each and comes swimming with me whenever the weather's nice (which is most days). Suffice to say he's not lacking in attention or exercise.\n\nI have a neighbour who has two dogs of her own that are less energetic and prefer to lounge about in the sun rather than go adventuring. She also has a 12yo autistic son (Alex). He's a good kid but lacks some social boundaries and can fly off the handle when stressed out or bored. So one day my neighbour was working from home and was trying to keep him entertained so she could concentrate, and I got text saying, \"Hi! Hope it's okay but I sent Alex to walk your dog.\" I said it was all fine and told them to have fun, and I figured that was the end of it.\n\nNope. Alex now takes my dog out everyday (without asking, so I'll come home and find he's disappeared with the gate open and I'll panic), and then the neighbour will also \"borrow\" him for an hour or two whenever she's at home and needs to distract Alex. I really, really, really don't mind if she needs some quiet time and asks occasionally, since I'm sure my dog enjoys the extra attention.\n\nI've just got a few issues with some of it. One, my dog isn't a child's toy, he's a member of my family and I like having him close by. I have anxiety and depression and coming home to my dog bouncing around waiting for a walk is one of the few things that really destresses me. Now, I get home and he won't be returned to me until dinner time, and I miss out on bonding with him outdoors.\n\nTwo -- and I'm not sure whether this is the fault of the neighbour or Alex -- my dog has started developing bad habits since this whole routine started. He used to be very well-mannered, where you could drop a steak on the floor in front of his nose and he wouldn't eat it until you explicitly said he could. Now he begs at the table when he's inside, climbs onto my bed and couch without my permission (he's big and double coated, so he leaves hair everywhere), and will just generally behave in ways he wouldn't have dared to a month ago. I vaguely mentioned it when we were having drinks together the other night and my neighbour laughed and said, \"Oh he'll climb right onto Alex's lap on the couch.\" \n\nI complained about it to a friend last night and she said I was being selfish, since I don't understand what it's like to raise a child with a disability, and that it's not hurting anyone if my dog gets extra attention (even though he's not really, since it's cutting in my personal time with him). And now I feel bad, because I can see how much Alex loves my dog, and I don't really want to be a dick just because I'm jealous somebody else is spending time with him.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. So, the scenario is that the author has a dog and a neighbor with an autistic son. The neighbor started having her son take the author's dog for walks and play without asking, leading to the author feeling upset because the dog isn't returned, and the dog is developing bad habits. The author's friend says they're being selfish, but they feel bad about that.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author has been taking proper care of the dog, providing exercise and attention. The neighbor started using the dog daily without permission, which is a problem because the author relies on that time with the dog for their mental health. Also, the dog's behavior has changed, which could be due to the neighbor's or the son's handling. The neighbor isn't asking for permission anymore, just \"borrowing\" the dog daily.\n\nFrom a rights perspective, the dog is the author's property and a family member. The neighbor, despite good intentions, is using the dog without consent, which invades the author's personal space and time. The author's mental health is affected, which is a valid concern. Even if the neighbor's son benefits, it's about respecting the owner's wishes. The fact that the neighbor didn't ask after the first time shows a lack of consideration. The dog's bad habits could also be a sign that the handling isn't consistent with the author's training, leading to more issues.\n\nThe friend's comment that the author is being selfish ignores the fact that the author's needs are also legitimate. The author isn't refusing all help but wants the neighbor to ask first and maybe adjust the frequency. It's about boundaries and mutual respect. The neighbor's actions, while well-meaning, are overstepping by making it a daily routine without permission.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. They have every right to set boundaries and ask for their dog back. The neighbor needs to communicate better and respect the author's time with the dog. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
