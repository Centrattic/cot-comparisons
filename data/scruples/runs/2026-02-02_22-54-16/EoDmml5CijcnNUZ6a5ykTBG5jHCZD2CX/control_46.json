I play rough with him in the garden or throw a ball around for maybe an hour a day, and he also gets walked twice a day for half an hour each and comes swimming with me whenever the weather's nice (which is most days). Suffice to say he's not lacking in attention or exercise.\n\nI have a neighbour who has two dogs of her own that are less energetic and prefer to lounge about in the sun rather than go adventuring. She also has a 12yo autistic son (Alex). He's a good kid but lacks some social boundaries and can fly off the handle when stressed out or bored. So one day my neighbour was working from home and was trying to keep him entertained so she could concentrate, and I got text saying, \"Hi! Hope it's okay but I sent Alex to walk your dog.\" I said it was all fine and told them to have fun, and I figured that was the end of it.\n\nNope. Alex now takes my dog out everyday (without asking, so I'll come home and find he's disappeared with the gate open and I'll panic), and then the neighbour will also \"borrow\" him for an hour or two whenever she's at home and needs to distract Alex. I really, really, really don't mind if she needs some quiet time and asks occasionally, since I'm sure my dog enjoys the extra attention.\n\nI've just got a few issues with some of it. One, my dog isn't a child's toy, he's a member of my family and I like having him close by. I have anxiety and depression and coming home to my dog bouncing around waiting for a walk is one of the few things that really destresses me. Now, I get home and he won't be returned to me until dinner time, and I miss out on bonding with him outdoors.\n\nTwo -- and I'm not sure whether this is the fault of the neighbour or Alex -- my dog has started developing bad habits since this whole routine started. He used to be very well-mannered, where you could drop a steak on the floor in front of his nose and he wouldn't eat it until you explicitly said he could. Now he begs at the table when he's inside, climbs onto my bed and couch without my permission (he's big and double coated, so he leaves hair everywhere), and will just generally behave in ways he wouldn't have dared to a month ago. I vaguely mentioned it when we were having drinks together the other night and my neighbour laughed and said, \"Oh he'll climb right onto Alex's lap on the couch.\" \n\nI complained about it to a friend last night and she said I was being selfish, since I don't understand what it's like to raise a child with a disability, and that it's not hurting anyone if my dog gets extra attention (even though he's not really, since it's cutting in my personal time with him). And now I feel bad, because I can see how much Alex loves my dog, and I don't really want to be a dick just because I'm jealous somebody else is spending time with him.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the WIBTA (Would I Be Terrible for...) post is in the wrong. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThe author has a dog that's part of their family. They mention that the dog is getting older but still active. They take care of the dog with regular exercise and activities. The neighbor, who has two less energetic dogs, has a 12-year-old autistic son named Alex. The neighbor started having Alex take the author's dog for walks and sometimes borrows the dog for a few hours to help manage Alex's behavior and give the neighbor some quiet time. \n\nThe main issues the author has are: 1) Missing out on bonding time with the dog, which is important for their mental health (they have anxiety and depression), and 2) The dog developing bad habits like begging, jumping on furniture, etc., which might be due to the neighbor or Alex's interactions.\n\nThe friend told the author they're being selfish, implying that the author isn't considering the neighbor's challenges in raising a child with a disability. The author is conflicted because they don't want to be a \"dick\" but also feel their personal time with the dog is being affected.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, the dog is the author's property, so they have the right to set boundaries. The neighbor is using the dog without prior consent beyond the initial request. The author did agree once, but now it's daily and without asking each time. The neighbor's son might not be properly trained or the dog is being overexposed to situations causing behavioral issues. The author's mental health needs are valid, and the dog's well-being is also a concern. The neighbor's actions, while well-intentioned, might be overstepping. The author isn't entirely wrong to want to set limits, especially since the dog's behavior is changing. The friend's comment about being selfish might not consider the author's mental health and the dog's training. So, the answer is likely B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
