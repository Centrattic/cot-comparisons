I play rough with him in the garden or throw a ball around for maybe an hour a day, and he also gets walked twice a day for half an hour each and comes swimming with me whenever the weather's nice (which is most days). Suffice to say he's not lacking in attention or exercise.\n\nI have a neighbour who has two dogs of her own that are less energetic and prefer to lounge about in the sun rather than go adventuring. She also has a 12yo autistic son (Alex). He's a good kid but lacks some social boundaries and can fly off the handle when stressed out or bored. So one day my neighbour was working from home and was trying to keep him entertained so she could concentrate, and I got text saying, \"Hi! Hope it's okay but I sent Alex to walk your dog.\" I said it was all fine and told them to have fun, and I figured that was the end of it.\n\nNope. Alex now takes my dog out everyday (without asking, so I'll come home and find he's disappeared with the gate open and I'll panic), and then the neighbour will also \"borrow\" him for an hour or two whenever she's at home and needs to distract Alex. I really, really, really don't mind if she needs some quiet time and asks occasionally, since I'm sure my dog enjoys the extra attention.\n\nI've just got a few issues with some of it. One, my dog isn't a child's toy, he's a member of my family and I like having him close by. I have anxiety and depression and coming home to my dog bouncing around waiting for a walk is one of the few things that really destresses me. Now, I get home and he won't be returned to me until dinner time, and I miss out on bonding with him outdoors.\n\nTwo -- and I'm not sure whether this is the fault of the neighbour or Alex -- my dog has started developing bad habits since this whole routine started. He used to be very well-mannered, where you could drop a steak on the floor in front of his nose and he wouldn't eat it until you explicitly said he could. Now he begs at the table when he's inside, climbs onto my bed and couch without my permission (he's big and double coated, so he leaves hair everywhere), and will just generally behave in ways he wouldn't have dared to a month ago. I vaguely mentioned it when we were having drinks together the other night and my neighbour laughed and said, \"Oh he'll climb right onto Alex's lap on the couch.\" \n\nI complained about it to a friend last night and she said I was being selfish, since I don't understand what it's like to raise a child with a disability, and that it's not hurting anyone if my dog gets extra attention (even though he's not really, since it's cutting in my personal time with him). And now I feel bad, because I can see how much Alex loves my dog, and I don't really want to be a dick just because I'm jealous somebody else is spending time with him.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for wanting their neighbor to stop \"borrowing\" their dog to distract the neighbor's autistic son. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation from both perspectives. The author has a dog that's been part of their family for a long time and provides them emotional support, given they have anxiety and depression. The neighbor's son, Alex, is autistic and sometimes gets stressed or bored, so the neighbor sends him to walk the author's dog or borrows it when she's home. The author mentions that the dog used to be well-behaved but now has bad habits like begging and climbing onto furniture. They also feel it's encroaching on their personal time with the dog, which is important for their mental health.\n\nThe neighbor's actions started as a one-time request but have become a daily occurrence. The author initially said it was okay, but now the situation has escalated. The friend advised that it's not hurting anyone and that the author is being selfish, which makes them feel guilty. The author is conflicted because they see how much Alex enjoys the dog but also need their own time with it.\n\nNow, considering the ethics here. The dog is a family member and a source of comfort for the author. The neighbor, while trying to help her son, is using the dog without consistent permission beyond the initial one. The author's mental health is tied to their time with the dog, which is being disrupted. The bad behavior of the dog might be due to changes in environment or training, which the author is responsible for managing, but the neighbor's actions could be contributing. \n\nThe key points are: the neighbor is using the dog without asking each time, the author's emotional well-being is affected, and the dog's behavior is changing. The neighbor may not realize the impact on the author's mental health and the dog's training. The author's right to have their dog around for personal stress relief is a factor. The friend's comment about not understanding raising a child with a disability adds another layer, but that's more about the friend's perspective than the neighbor's.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the neighbor should have discussed the frequency and duration of borrowing the dog, especially after the initial permission. The author has the right to set boundaries for their own well-being and their pet's needs. So, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to address this. The neighbor might be inconsiderate without realizing it, but the author's feelings and mental health are valid. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
