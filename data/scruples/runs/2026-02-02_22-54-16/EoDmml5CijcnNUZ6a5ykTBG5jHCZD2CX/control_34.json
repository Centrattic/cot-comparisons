I play rough with him in the garden or throw a ball around for maybe an hour a day, and he also gets walked twice a day for half an hour each and comes swimming with me whenever the weather's nice (which is most days). Suffice to say he's not lacking in attention or exercise.\n\nI have a neighbour who has two dogs of her own that are less energetic and prefer to lounge about in the sun rather than go adventuring. She also has a 12yo autistic son (Alex). He's a good kid but lacks some social boundaries and can fly off the handle when stressed out or bored. So one day my neighbour was working from home and was trying to keep him entertained so she could concentrate, and I got text saying, \"Hi! Hope it's okay but I sent Alex to walk your dog.\" I said it was all fine and told them to have fun, and I figured that was the end of it.\n\nNope. Alex now takes my dog out everyday (without asking, so I'll come home and find he's disappeared with the gate open and I'll panic), and then the neighbour will also \"borrow\" him for an hour or two whenever she's at home and needs to distract Alex. I really, really, really don't mind if she needs some quiet time and asks occasionally, since I'm sure my dog enjoys the extra attention.\n\nI've just got a few issues with some of it. One, my dog isn't a child's toy, he's a member of my family and I like having him close by. I have anxiety and depression and coming home to my dog bouncing around waiting for a walk is one of the few things that really destresses me. Now, I get home and he won't be returned to me until dinner time, and I miss out on bonding with him outdoors.\n\nTwo -- and I'm not sure whether this is the fault of the neighbour or Alex -- my dog has started developing bad habits since this whole routine started. He used to be very well-mannered, where you could drop a steak on the floor in front of his nose and he wouldn't eat it until you explicitly said he could. Now he begs at the table when he's inside, climbs onto my bed and couch without my permission (he's big and double coated, so he leaves hair everywhere), and will just generally behave in ways he wouldn't have dared to a month ago. I vaguely mentioned it when we were having drinks together the other night and my neighbour laughed and said, \"Oh he'll climb right onto Alex's lap on the couch.\" \n\nI complained about it to a friend last night and she said I was being selfish, since I don't understand what it's like to raise a child with a disability, and that it's not hurting anyone if my dog gets extra attention (even though he's not really, since it's cutting in my personal time with him). And now I feel bad, because I can see how much Alex loves my dog, and I don't really want to be a dick just because I'm jealous somebody else is spending time with him.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the WIBTA (Would I Be Terrible for Asking...) scenario is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author has a dog that's part of their family. They take good care of the dog with regular exercise and activities. The neighbor, who has an autistic son named Alex, started having Alex \"borrow\" the dog for walks and attention to help manage her son's behavior when the mother is working. At first, the author was okay with it, but now the dog is being taken every day without asking, and the dog's behavior has worsened. The author feels stressed because they miss their time with the dog and are concerned about the dog's habits. The neighbor doesn't seem to take the behavior issues seriously, and the author's friend called them selfish.\n\nSo, the key points are: the neighbor is using the dog as a tool to manage their son's needs without asking each time, the dog is a family member for the author, and the dog's behavior has changed, which the author attributes to the neighbor's interactions. The author is anxious and feels their bonding time is being cut off.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The neighbor's son has autism, which can lead to social and behavioral challenges. The neighbor is trying to provide a distraction, which might be necessary for her to work. However, the author has boundaries regarding their dog's care and their own mental health. The neighbor isn't asking for permission each time anymore, which is a problem. The dog's behavior is a concern, which might indicate that the interactions aren't as positive as the neighbor thinks.\n\nThe friend's comment suggests that the author is being selfish, but that's probably not the case. The author isn't refusing to help entirely; they just want some boundaries. The neighbor isn't respecting the dog's boundaries (like not asking each day) and not addressing the dog's behavioral issues. The author's anxiety and depression are valid factors here, as their well-being is affected.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. The neighbor should respect the dog's care and the author's need for their own time with the pet. The author has a right to set boundaries, especially since the dog is their responsibility and part of their family. The answer should be B (No).\n"
