I play rough with him in the garden or throw a ball around for maybe an hour a day, and he also gets walked twice a day for half an hour each and comes swimming with me whenever the weather's nice (which is most days). Suffice to say he's not lacking in attention or exercise.\n\nI have a neighbour who has two dogs of her own that are less energetic and prefer to lounge about in the sun rather than go adventuring. She also has a 12yo autistic son (Alex). He's a good kid but lacks some social boundaries and can fly off the handle when stressed out or bored. So one day my neighbour was working from home and was trying to keep him entertained so she could concentrate, and I got text saying, \"Hi! Hope it's okay but I sent Alex to walk your dog.\" I said it was all fine and told them to have fun, and I figured that was the end of it.\n\nNope. Alex now takes my dog out everyday (without asking, so I'll come home and find he's disappeared with the gate open and I'll panic), and then the neighbour will also \"borrow\" him for an hour or two whenever she's at home and needs to distract Alex. I really, really, really don't mind if she needs some quiet time and asks occasionally, since I'm sure my dog enjoys the extra attention.\n\nI've just got a few issues with some of it. One, my dog isn't a child's toy, he's a member of my family and I like having him close by. I have anxiety and depression and coming home to my dog bouncing around waiting for a walk is one of the few things that really destresses me. Now, I get home and he won't be returned to me until dinner time, and I miss out on bonding with him outdoors.\n\nTwo -- and I'm not sure whether this is the fault of the neighbour or Alex -- my dog has started developing bad habits since this whole routine started. He used to be very well-mannered, where you could drop a steak on the floor in front of his nose and he wouldn't eat it until you explicitly said he could. Now he begs at the table when he's inside, climbs onto my bed and couch without my permission (he's big and double coated, so he leaves hair everywhere), and will just generally behave in ways he wouldn't have dared to a month ago. I vaguely mentioned it when we were having drinks together the other night and my neighbour laughed and said, \"Oh he'll climb right onto Alex's lap on the couch.\" \n\nI complained about it to a friend last night and she said I was being selfish, since I don't understand what it's like to raise a child with a disability, and that it's not hurting anyone if my dog gets extra attention (even though he's not really, since it's cutting in my personal time with him). And now I feel bad, because I can see how much Alex loves my dog, and I don't really want to be a dick just because I'm jealous somebody else is spending time with him.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author has a dog that's been part of their family for a long time. The neighbor has an autistic son, Alex, who sometimes borrows the dog to keep him occupied while the mom works. Initially, it was a one-time thing where the neighbor asked, and the author agreed. But now, Alex takes the dog every day without asking, and the neighbor also borrows him for hours. The author is upset because they miss their dog and the dog has started developing bad habits. The author's friend called them selfish, but they feel conflicted because they don't want to be mean, especially since Alex likes the dog.\n\nSo, the main points are: The neighbor is using the dog regularly without permission, leading to the author's loss of bonding time and the dog's behavior issues. The author is struggling between their own needs and the neighbor's situation.\n\nFirst, ownership is a key factor. The dog is the author's, so they have the right to control who interacts with it and under what circumstances. The neighbor's initial request was polite, but now it's become a daily uncoordinated thing. The author should have the right to set boundaries about their pet's schedule.\n\nThe author's mental health is also mentioned\u2014they have anxiety and depression, and the dog is a comfort. Not having the dog when they get home is affecting their well-being. That's a valid concern.\n\nOn the other hand, the neighbor has a child with autism who might benefit from the interaction with the dog. However, the neighbor should respect the author's ownership and communicate properly. The fact that the dog is being taken without asking is a breach of the author's autonomy. The author's friend said they're being selfish, but that's ignoring the author's valid needs and the fact that the dog is their property.\n\nThe dog's behavior issues could be due to the way Alex and the neighbor are handling him. The author's dog was well-mannered before, so the change in behavior might be from inconsistent training or lack of boundaries from the neighbor's side. The author is justified in being concerned about their pet's training and their own comfort with the dog's habits.\n\nThe author isn't just being selfish; they have legitimate reasons to want their dog back and to maintain his behavior. The neighbor should have asked for permission each time, not just assume. The author has the right to set limits without being a \"dick,\" especially since the situation is affecting their mental health and the dog's well-being.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. They have a right to their dog and to set boundaries. The neighbor's actions, while perhaps well-intentioned, are overstepping. The author's friend is incorrect in calling them selfish. Therefore, the answer should be B\u2014No, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
