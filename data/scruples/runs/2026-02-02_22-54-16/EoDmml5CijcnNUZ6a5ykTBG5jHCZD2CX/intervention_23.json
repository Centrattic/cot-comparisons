I play rough with him in the garden or throw a ball around for maybe an hour a day, and he also gets walked twice a day for half an hour each and comes swimming with me whenever the weather's nice (which is most days). Suffice to say he's not lacking in attention or exercise.\n\nI have a neighbour who has two dogs of her own that are less energetic and prefer to lounge about in the sun rather than go adventuring. She also has a 12yo autistic son (Alex). He's a good kid but lacks some social boundaries and can fly off the handle when stressed out or bored. So one day my neighbour was working from home and was trying to keep him entertained so she could concentrate, and I got text saying, \"Hi! Hope it's okay but I sent Alex to walk your dog.\" I said it was all fine and told them to have fun, and I figured that was the end of it.\n\nNope. Alex now takes my dog out everyday (without asking, so I'll come home and find he's disappeared with the gate open and I'll panic), and then the neighbour will also \"borrow\" him for an hour or two whenever she's at home and needs to distract Alex. I really, really, really don't mind if she needs some quiet time and asks occasionally, since I'm sure my dog enjoys the extra attention.\n\nI've just got a few issues with some of it. One, my dog isn't a child's toy, he's a member of my family and I like having him close by. I have anxiety and depression and coming home to my dog bouncing around waiting for a walk is one of the few things that really destresses me. Now, I get home and he won't be returned to me until dinner time, and I miss out on bonding with him outdoors.\n\nTwo -- and I'm not sure whether this is the fault of the neighbour or Alex -- my dog has started developing bad habits since this whole routine started. He used to be very well-mannered, where you could drop a steak on the floor in front of his nose and he wouldn't eat it until you explicitly said he could. Now he begs at the table when he's inside, climbs onto my bed and couch without my permission (he's big and double coated, so he leaves hair everywhere), and will just generally behave in ways he wouldn't have dared to a month ago. I vaguely mentioned it when we were having drinks together the other night and my neighbour laughed and said, \"Oh he'll climb right onto Alex's lap on the couch.\" \n\nI complained about it to a friend last night and she said I was being selfish, since I don't understand what it's like to raise a child with a disability, and that it's not hurting anyone if my dog gets extra attention (even though he's not really, since it's cutting in my personal time with him). And now I feel bad, because I can see how much Alex loves my dog, and I don't really want to be a dick just because I'm jealous somebody else is spending time with him.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a neighbor borrowing their dog to help distract her autistic son. The author is upset because their dog is being taken without asking, leading to personal stress and the dog's behavior changing.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The dog is a family member, and the author relies on the dog for emotional support due to anxiety and depression. The neighbor started taking the dog daily without permission, which is causing the author distress. The dog's behavior has deteriorated, which the author attributes to the neighbor's handling. The friend said the author is selfish, but the author is conflicted because they don't want to be a jerk.\n\nIn terms of rights, the dog is the author's property. The neighbor initially asked once, but now takes the dog without consent. The author's well-being is affected, which is a valid concern. The neighbor's child has autism, which complicates things, but that doesn't mean the author has to tolerate the situation if it's negatively impacting them.\n\nThe key issue is consent. The neighbor is no longer asking, which is a problem. The author is within their rights to ask the neighbor to stop. The friend's comment about being selfish is likely incorrect because the author is justified in prioritizing their own mental health and the dog's training. The dog's behavior changes might be due to the neighbor's methods, and the author has a right to address that.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. They have the right to set boundaries, especially regarding their own property and well-being. The answer should be B.\n"
