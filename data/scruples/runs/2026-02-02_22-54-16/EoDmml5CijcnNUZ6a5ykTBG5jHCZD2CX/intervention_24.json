I play rough with him in the garden or throw a ball around for maybe an hour a day, and he also gets walked twice a day for half an hour each and comes swimming with me whenever the weather's nice (which is most days). Suffice to say he's not lacking in attention or exercise.\n\nI have a neighbour who has two dogs of her own that are less energetic and prefer to lounge about in the sun rather than go adventuring. She also has a 12yo autistic son (Alex). He's a good kid but lacks some social boundaries and can fly off the handle when stressed out or bored. So one day my neighbour was working from home and was trying to keep him entertained so she could concentrate, and I got text saying, \"Hi! Hope it's okay but I sent Alex to walk your dog.\" I said it was all fine and told them to have fun, and I figured that was the end of it.\n\nNope. Alex now takes my dog out everyday (without asking, so I'll come home and find he's disappeared with the gate open and I'll panic), and then the neighbour will also \"borrow\" him for an hour or two whenever she's at home and needs to distract Alex. I really, really, really don't mind if she needs some quiet time and asks occasionally, since I'm sure my dog enjoys the extra attention.\n\nI've just got a few issues with some of it. One, my dog isn't a child's toy, he's a member of my family and I like having him close by. I have anxiety and depression and coming home to my dog bouncing around waiting for a walk is one of the few things that really destresses me. Now, I get home and he won't be returned to me until dinner time, and I miss out on bonding with him outdoors.\n\nTwo -- and I'm not sure whether this is the fault of the neighbour or Alex -- my dog has started developing bad habits since this whole routine started. He used to be very well-mannered, where you could drop a steak on the floor in front of his nose and he wouldn't eat it until you explicitly said he could. Now he begs at the table when he's inside, climbs onto my bed and couch without my permission (he's big and double coated, so he leaves hair everywhere), and will just generally behave in ways he wouldn't have dared to a month ago. I vaguely mentioned it when we were having drinks together the other night and my neighbour laughed and said, \"Oh he'll climb right onto Alex's lap on the couch.\" \n\nI complained about it to a friend last night and she said I was being selfish, since I don't understand what it's like to raise a child with a disability, and that it's not hurting anyone if my dog gets extra attention (even though he's not really, since it's cutting in my personal time with him). And now I feel bad, because I can see how much Alex loves my dog, and I don't really want to be a dick just because I'm jealous somebody else is spending time with him.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting their neighbor to stop \"borrowing\" their dog. The situation involves a neighbor's autistic son who's been taking the dog out daily without permission.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The dog is a family member, and the owner has anxiety and depression that the dog helps with. The neighbor's son, Alex, is taking the dog out without asking, leading to the dog developing bad habits. The author mentions that they used to have a well-behaved dog but now the dog is misbehaving, like begging and climbing on furniture. The neighbor seems to not take the complaints seriously, even laughing about it. The friend told the author they're being selfish, but the author feels conflicted because they don't want to be mean to Alex, who loves the dog.\n\nSo, the main issue here is the unauthorized use of the dog. The neighbor is letting her son take the dog out every day without asking, which the author finds problematic. The author's mental health is affected because they rely on the dog for comfort. The dog's behavior has changed, possibly due to the neighbor's handling, which the author is concerned about.\n\nFrom a rights perspective, the dog is the author's property, and the neighbor has no right to take it without permission. Even if the neighbor needs to manage her son's behavior, she should respect the author's boundaries. The author isn't being selfish; they're addressing their own needs and the dog's well-being. The neighbor's actions are causing stress and changing the dog's behavior, which is a valid concern. The author is justified in wanting to set boundaries to protect their dog and their own mental health. The friend's comment that the author is being selfish is incorrect because the dog is their responsibility and companion.\n\nTherefore, the author is not in the wrong. They have the right to reclaim their dog's time and ensure he's treated properly. The neighbor should have asked first and respected the author's wishes once they expressed concerns.\n"
