I play rough with him in the garden or throw a ball around for maybe an hour a day, and he also gets walked twice a day for half an hour each and comes swimming with me whenever the weather's nice (which is most days). Suffice to say he's not lacking in attention or exercise.\n\nI have a neighbour who has two dogs of her own that are less energetic and prefer to lounge about in the sun rather than go adventuring. She also has a 12yo autistic son (Alex). He's a good kid but lacks some social boundaries and can fly off the handle when stressed out or bored. So one day my neighbour was working from home and was trying to keep him entertained so she could concentrate, and I got text saying, \"Hi! Hope it's okay but I sent Alex to walk your dog.\" I said it was all fine and told them to have fun, and I figured that was the end of it.\n\nNope. Alex now takes my dog out everyday (without asking, so I'll come home and find he's disappeared with the gate open and I'll panic), and then the neighbour will also \"borrow\" him for an hour or two whenever she's at home and needs to distract Alex. I really, really, really don't mind if she needs some quiet time and asks occasionally, since I'm sure my dog enjoys the extra attention.\n\nI've just got a few issues with some of it. One, my dog isn't a child's toy, he's a member of my family and I like having him close by. I have anxiety and depression and coming home to my dog bouncing around waiting for a walk is one of the few things that really destresses me. Now, I get home and he won't be returned to me until dinner time, and I miss out on bonding with him outdoors.\n\nTwo -- and I'm not sure whether this is the fault of the neighbour or Alex -- my dog has started developing bad habits since this whole routine started. He used to be very well-mannered, where you could drop a steak on the floor in front of his nose and he wouldn't eat it until you explicitly said he could. Now he begs at the table when he's inside, climbs onto my bed and couch without my permission (he's big and double coated, so he leaves hair everywhere), and will just generally behave in ways he wouldn't have dared to a month ago. I vaguely mentioned it when we were having drinks together the other night and my neighbour laughed and said, \"Oh he'll climb right onto Alex's lap on the couch.\" \n\nI complained about it to a friend last night and she said I was being selfish, since I don't understand what it's like to raise a child with a disability, and that it's not hurting anyone if my dog gets extra attention (even though he's not really, since it's cutting in my personal time with him). And now I feel bad, because I can see how much Alex loves my dog, and I don't really want to be a dick just because I'm jealous somebody else is spending time with him.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the WIBTA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a neighbor's son, Alex, who is autistic, using the author's dog daily without permission to help manage his own needs, and the author is upset about it. \n\nFirst, the key points. The author owns the dog and has a close bond with him. The dog is an emotional support for the author, especially with their anxiety and depression. The neighbor's son is using the dog without asking each time, leading to the dog's new behaviors and the author missing out on quality time.\n\nThe neighbor's actions are about accommodating Alex's needs. The neighbor might be trying to help Alex with social boundaries and stress, but she's doing it without the author's ongoing consent. The author mentions that the neighbor \"borrows\" the dog daily without asking, which is a problem because the owner's input isn't considered. \n\nThe author's friend called them selfish, but that's a judgment. The author is also experiencing negative effects: the dog's behavior changes and loss of personal time. The dog's new behaviors might be due to different handling by Alex. The author has a right to their dog's behavior and their own emotional well-being.\n\nThe neighbor isn't asking each time, which is a breach of the original agreement. The initial request was okay, but daily unannounced borrowing isn't. The author isn't being selfish; they're trying to communicate their needs. The author's feelings are valid, especially since the dog is part of their family and mental health support.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. They're standing up for their needs and the dog's well-being. The neighbor's lack of communication and the uncontrolled access are the main issues here. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
