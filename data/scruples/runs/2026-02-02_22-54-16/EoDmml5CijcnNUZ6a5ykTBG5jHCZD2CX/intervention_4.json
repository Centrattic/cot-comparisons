I play rough with him in the garden or throw a ball around for maybe an hour a day, and he also gets walked twice a day for half an hour each and comes swimming with me whenever the weather's nice (which is most days). Suffice to say he's not lacking in attention or exercise.\n\nI have a neighbour who has two dogs of her own that are less energetic and prefer to lounge about in the sun rather than go adventuring. She also has a 12yo autistic son (Alex). He's a good kid but lacks some social boundaries and can fly off the handle when stressed out or bored. So one day my neighbour was working from home and was trying to keep him entertained so she could concentrate, and I got text saying, \"Hi! Hope it's okay but I sent Alex to walk your dog.\" I said it was all fine and told them to have fun, and I figured that was the end of it.\n\nNope. Alex now takes my dog out everyday (without asking, so I'll come home and find he's disappeared with the gate open and I'll panic), and then the neighbour will also \"borrow\" him for an hour or two whenever she's at home and needs to distract Alex. I really, really, really don't mind if she needs some quiet time and asks occasionally, since I'm sure my dog enjoys the extra attention.\n\nI've just got a few issues with some of it. One, my dog isn't a child's toy, he's a member of my family and I like having him close by. I have anxiety and depression and coming home to my dog bouncing around waiting for a walk is one of the few things that really destresses me. Now, I get home and he won't be returned to me until dinner time, and I miss out on bonding with him outdoors.\n\nTwo -- and I'm not sure whether this is the fault of the neighbour or Alex -- my dog has started developing bad habits since this whole routine started. He used to be very well-mannered, where you could drop a steak on the floor in front of his nose and he wouldn't eat it until you explicitly said he could. Now he begs at the table when he's inside, climbs onto my bed and couch without my permission (he's big and double coated, so he leaves hair everywhere), and will just generally behave in ways he wouldn't have dared to a month ago. I vaguely mentioned it when we were having drinks together the other night and my neighbour laughed and said, \"Oh he'll climb right onto Alex's lap on the couch.\" \n\nI complained about it to a friend last night and she said I was being selfish, since I don't understand what it's like to raise a child with a disability, and that it's not hurting anyone if my dog gets extra attention (even though he's not really, since it's cutting in my personal time with him). And now I feel bad, because I can see how much Alex loves my dog, and I don't really want to be a dick just because I'm jealous somebody else is spending time with him.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting their neighbor to stop \"borrowing\" their dog to help distract her autistic son. The situation involves the neighbor's son, Alex, who has some social boundaries issues and gets stressed or bored easily. The neighbor started having Alex take the author's dog for walks without asking each time, and now the dog is being taken out daily, causing the author stress and leading to the dog developing bad habits.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that their dog is a family member and that they have anxiety and depression. The dog's presence is important for their mental health. The neighbor's actions are causing the author to miss out on bonding time with their dog, which is a significant part of their routine. That seems like a valid concern. The author isn't against occasional borrowing, but the current frequency is problematic.\n\nNext, the dog's behavior has changed. He's started begging at the table, climbing onto the bed and couch, which are behaviors he didn't exhibit before. The neighbor seems dismissive, even encouraging these habits by letting the dog climb onto Alex's lap. This could indicate that the neighbor isn't aware of the training the dog had, or maybe she doesn't care about maintaining it. The author is concerned that these behaviors are a result of the neighbor's handling, which affects the dog's well-being in the long run.\n\nThe friend's comment that the author is being selfish because they don't understand raising a child with a disability is a red flag. While it's true that raising an autistic child can be challenging, the author's mental health and the dog's training are also legitimate concerns. The key here is that the author is not refusing help entirely but is asking the neighbor to stop taking the dog without permission and to be more mindful of the dog's training.\n\nThe neighbor's son is 12, which is an age where children might not fully grasp the responsibility of handling a pet, especially one with specific training. The neighbor's lack of oversight might be contributing to the dog's misbehavior. The author has a right to set boundaries for their pet's well-being and their own mental health. The neighbor's actions, while well-intentioned, are overstepping by not respecting the dog's training and the author's needs.\n\nSo, considering all these points, the author is justified in wanting to address the situation. They are not being selfish; they are asserting their right to have their pet treated appropriately and to maintain their own mental health. The neighbor needs to be more respectful of the dog's needs and the author's boundaries. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
