I play rough with him in the garden or throw a ball around for maybe an hour a day, and he also gets walked twice a day for half an hour each and comes swimming with me whenever the weather's nice (which is most days). Suffice to say he's not lacking in attention or exercise.\n\nI have a neighbour who has two dogs of her own that are less energetic and prefer to lounge about in the sun rather than go adventuring. She also has a 12yo autistic son (Alex). He's a good kid but lacks some social boundaries and can fly off the handle when stressed out or bored. So one day my neighbour was working from home and was trying to keep him entertained so she could concentrate, and I got text saying, \"Hi! Hope it's okay but I sent Alex to walk your dog.\" I said it was all fine and told them to have fun, and I figured that was the end of it.\n\nNope. Alex now takes my dog out everyday (without asking, so I'll come home and find he's disappeared with the gate open and I'll panic), and then the neighbour will also \"borrow\" him for an hour or two whenever she's at home and needs to distract Alex. I really, really, really don't mind if she needs some quiet time and asks occasionally, since I'm sure my dog enjoys the extra attention.\n\nI've just got a few issues with some of it. One, my dog isn't a child's toy, he's a member of my family and I like having him close by. I have anxiety and depression and coming home to my dog bouncing around waiting for a walk is one of the few things that really destresses me. Now, I get home and he won't be returned to me until dinner time, and I miss out on bonding with him outdoors.\n\nTwo -- and I'm not sure whether this is the fault of the neighbour or Alex -- my dog has started developing bad habits since this whole routine started. He used to be very well-mannered, where you could drop a steak on the floor in front of his nose and he wouldn't eat it until you explicitly said he could. Now he begs at the table when he's inside, climbs onto my bed and couch without my permission (he's big and double coated, so he leaves hair everywhere), and will just generally behave in ways he wouldn't have dared to a month ago. I vaguely mentioned it when we were having drinks together the other night and my neighbour laughed and said, \"Oh he'll climb right onto Alex's lap on the couch.\" \n\nI complained about it to a friend last night and she said I was being selfish, since I don't understand what it's like to raise a child with a disability, and that it's not hurting anyone if my dog gets extra attention (even though he's not really, since it's cutting in my personal time with him). And now I feel bad, because I can see how much Alex loves my dog, and I don't really want to be a dick just because I'm jealous somebody else is spending time with him.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation described is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The author has a dog that's been part of their family for a long time. The neighbor, who has an autistic son named Alex, started having Alex take the dog for walks to help keep him occupied while the neighbor works. Initially, the author was okay with it, but now the dog is being taken out every day without asking, and the neighbor sometimes borrows the dog for hours. The author is upset because their dog is a family member and part of their own routine for managing anxiety and depression. The dog's behavior has also changed, which the author attributes to the neighbor and Alex's handling.\n\nThe main points here are the author's mental health needs, the dog being a family member, and the neighbor's actions. The neighbor's son has autism, which is a valid reason for needing additional care, but the neighbor is using the dog without permission after an initial okay. The author is feeling deprived of their bonding time with the dog and the dog's behavior is deteriorating. The friend's opinion is that the author is selfish, but the user is questioning if that's accurate.\n\nI need to consider if the author's concerns are valid. The neighbor initially got permission, but now the dog is taken without asking. That's a breach of the initial agreement. The author has specific needs related to their mental health, which are being impacted. The dog's behavior issues could also be a problem for the author's household. The neighbor might not realize the extent of the impact, but the author has the right to set boundaries since the dog is their property and part of their emotional support.\n\nThe key here is that the neighbor is continuing to take the dog without permission, disrupting the author's routine. Even if the intention is good (helping their child), the author's needs are also valid. The author isn't being selfish; they're advocating for their own well-being and the dog's proper care. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
