I play rough with him in the garden or throw a ball around for maybe an hour a day, and he also gets walked twice a day for half an hour each and comes swimming with me whenever the weather's nice (which is most days). Suffice to say he's not lacking in attention or exercise.\n\nI have a neighbour who has two dogs of her own that are less energetic and prefer to lounge about in the sun rather than go adventuring. She also has a 12yo autistic son (Alex). He's a good kid but lacks some social boundaries and can fly off the handle when stressed out or bored. So one day my neighbour was working from home and was trying to keep him entertained so she could concentrate, and I got text saying, \"Hi! Hope it's okay but I sent Alex to walk your dog.\" I said it was all fine and told them to have fun, and I figured that was the end of it.\n\nNope. Alex now takes my dog out everyday (without asking, so I'll come home and find he's disappeared with the gate open and I'll panic), and then the neighbour will also \"borrow\" him for an hour or two whenever she's at home and needs to distract Alex. I really, really, really don't mind if she needs some quiet time and asks occasionally, since I'm sure my dog enjoys the extra attention.\n\nI've just got a few issues with some of it. One, my dog isn't a child's toy, he's a member of my family and I like having him close by. I have anxiety and depression and coming home to my dog bouncing around waiting for a walk is one of the few things that really destresses me. Now, I get home and he won't be returned to me until dinner time, and I miss out on bonding with him outdoors.\n\nTwo -- and I'm not sure whether this is the fault of the neighbour or Alex -- my dog has started developing bad habits since this whole routine started. He used to be very well-mannered, where you could drop a steak on the floor in front of his nose and he wouldn't eat it until you explicitly said he could. Now he begs at the table when he's inside, climbs onto my bed and couch without my permission (he's big and double coated, so he leaves hair everywhere), and will just generally behave in ways he wouldn't have dared to a month ago. I vaguely mentioned it when we were having drinks together the other night and my neighbour laughed and said, \"Oh he'll climb right onto Alex's lap on the couch.\" \n\nI complained about it to a friend last night and she said I was being selfish, since I don't understand what it's like to raise a child with a disability, and that it's not hurting anyone if my dog gets extra attention (even though he's not really, since it's cutting in my personal time with him). And now I feel bad, because I can see how much Alex loves my dog, and I don't really want to be a dick just because I'm jealous somebody else is spending time with him.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the scenario is in the wrong for wanting their neighbor to stop \"borrowing\" their dog without permission. \n\nFirst, the author's dog is a family member who's part of their routine and helps with their mental health. The neighbor's son, who has autism, has started taking the dog daily without asking, leading to the dog's behavior problems and the author losing their bonding time. The neighbor isn't always asking, just doing it whenever she feels like she needs quiet time. \n\nThe key points here are consent and boundaries. The author gave initial permission once, but now the neighbor is using the dog daily without asking. That's a problem because the author didn't give ongoing permission for daily use. The neighbor's son doesn't have the authority to take the dog on his own. \n\nAlso, the dog's behavior is deteriorating. The author mentioned specific issues like begging and climbing on furniture, which were not present before. The neighbor seems dismissive, even laughing at the problem. This suggests a lack of consideration for the dog's well-being, which is part of the author's responsibility. \n\nThe friend called the author selfish, but the author's needs are valid. They rely on the dog for emotional support, and their mental health is affected. The neighbor's convenience shouldn't override the author's rights and the dog's well-being. \n\nEven though the neighbor has a child with special needs, that doesn't mean the author has to sacrifice their own needs or the dog's training. The neighbor should be finding other ways to support her son without overstepping boundaries. \n\nSo, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). They have a right to set boundaries, especially when their mental health and the dog's behavior are at stake. The neighbor isn't respecting initial consent and is causing harm. The author is justified in asking for the situation to stop.\n"
