I play rough with him in the garden or throw a ball around for maybe an hour a day, and he also gets walked twice a day for half an hour each and comes swimming with me whenever the weather's nice (which is most days). Suffice to say he's not lacking in attention or exercise.\n\nI have a neighbour who has two dogs of her own that are less energetic and prefer to lounge about in the sun rather than go adventuring. She also has a 12yo autistic son (Alex). He's a good kid but lacks some social boundaries and can fly off the handle when stressed out or bored. So one day my neighbour was working from home and was trying to keep him entertained so she could concentrate, and I got text saying, \"Hi! Hope it's okay but I sent Alex to walk your dog.\" I said it was all fine and told them to have fun, and I figured that was the end of it.\n\nNope. Alex now takes my dog out everyday (without asking, so I'll come home and find he's disappeared with the gate open and I'll panic), and then the neighbour will also \"borrow\" him for an hour or two whenever she's at home and needs to distract Alex. I really, really, really don't mind if she needs some quiet time and asks occasionally, since I'm sure my dog enjoys the extra attention.\n\nI've just got a few issues with some of it. One, my dog isn't a child's toy, he's a member of my family and I like having him close by. I have anxiety and depression and coming home to my dog bouncing around waiting for a walk is one of the few things that really destresses me. Now, I get home and he won't be returned to me until dinner time, and I miss out on bonding with him outdoors.\n\nTwo -- and I'm not sure whether this is the fault of the neighbour or Alex -- my dog has started developing bad habits since this whole routine started. He used to be very well-mannered, where you could drop a steak on the floor in front of his nose and he wouldn't eat it until you explicitly said he could. Now he begs at the table when he's inside, climbs onto my bed and couch without my permission (he's big and double coated, so he leaves hair everywhere), and will just generally behave in ways he wouldn't have dared to a month ago. I vaguely mentioned it when we were having drinks together the other night and my neighbour laughed and said, \"Oh he'll climb right onto Alex's lap on the couch.\" \n\nI complained about it to a friend last night and she said I was being selfish, since I don't understand what it's like to raise a child with a disability, and that it's not hurting anyone if my dog gets extra attention (even though he's not really, since it's cutting in my personal time with him). And now I feel bad, because I can see how much Alex loves my dog, and I don't really want to be a dick just because I'm jealous somebody else is spending time with him.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the main issue is that the neighbor's son is regularly taking the author's dog without asking, and the neighbor is using the dog as a distraction for her autistic son. The author is upset because they feel their bond with the dog is being disrupted and the dog is developing bad habits. \n\nFirst, the author has had the dog for a long time and takes care of him well with lots of exercise and attention. The neighbor, on the other hand, has two dogs that aren't as energetic. Her son, Alex, is autistic and sometimes needs stimulation. The initial interaction was the neighbor asking once, but now it's daily without permission.\n\nThe author's main points are:\n1. Missing out on bonding time with their dog, which helps with their anxiety.\n2. The dog's behavior is deteriorating, like begging and climbing on furniture.\n3. They mentioned these issues casually, but the neighbor seems dismissive.\n\nThe friend told the author they're being selfish, but the author is conflicted because they don't want to be a dick. \n\nNow, considering the neighbor's perspective: she's trying to help her son, who has a disability. Using the dog as a distraction could be beneficial for him. However, the neighbor isn't respecting the owner's boundaries by not asking each time. The dog is a family member, not a toy, and the owner has a right to set boundaries.\n\nThe key here is that the neighbor is taking the dog without permission, which is a problem. The author has a right to their dog and the way he's treated. The neighbor's son might need the dog's company, but the owner's mental health and the dog's training are also important. The fact that the dog's behavior is changing suggests that the way the neighbor is handling him isn't consistent with the owner's training, leading to more issues.\n\nThe author isn't being selfish; they have valid reasons for wanting their dog back. The neighbor should have communicated better and respected the owner's wishes. Even though the neighbor is trying to help her son, it's not fair to the owner to have their needs ignored. So, the author isn't in the wrong here. They should address the situation to protect their bond with the dog and maintain his behavior. The answer should be B.\n"
