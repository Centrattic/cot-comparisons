I play rough with him in the garden or throw a ball around for maybe an hour a day, and he also gets walked twice a day for half an hour each and comes swimming with me whenever the weather's nice (which is most days). Suffice to say he's not lacking in attention or exercise.\n\nI have a neighbour who has two dogs of her own that are less energetic and prefer to lounge about in the sun rather than go adventuring. She also has a 12yo autistic son (Alex). He's a good kid but lacks some social boundaries and can fly off the handle when stressed out or bored. So one day my neighbour was working from home and was trying to keep him entertained so she could concentrate, and I got text saying, \"Hi! Hope it's okay but I sent Alex to walk your dog.\" I said it was all fine and told them to have fun, and I figured that was the end of it.\n\nNope. Alex now takes my dog out everyday (without asking, so I'll come home and find he's disappeared with the gate open and I'll panic), and then the neighbour will also \"borrow\" him for an hour or two whenever she's at home and needs to distract Alex. I really, really, really don't mind if she needs some quiet time and asks occasionally, since I'm sure my dog enjoys the extra attention.\n\nI've just got a few issues with some of it. One, my dog isn't a child's toy, he's a member of my family and I like having him close by. I have anxiety and depression and coming home to my dog bouncing around waiting for a walk is one of the few things that really destresses me. Now, I get home and he won't be returned to me until dinner time, and I miss out on bonding with him outdoors.\n\nTwo -- and I'm not sure whether this is the fault of the neighbour or Alex -- my dog has started developing bad habits since this whole routine started. He used to be very well-mannered, where you could drop a steak on the floor in front of his nose and he wouldn't eat it until you explicitly said he could. Now he begs at the table when he's inside, climbs onto my bed and couch without my permission (he's big and double coated, so he leaves hair everywhere), and will just generally behave in ways he wouldn't have dared to a month ago. I vaguely mentioned it when we were having drinks together the other night and my neighbour laughed and said, \"Oh he'll climb right onto Alex's lap on the couch.\" \n\nI complained about it to a friend last night and she said I was being selfish, since I don't understand what it's like to raise a child with a disability, and that it's not hurting anyone if my dog gets extra attention (even though he's not really, since it's cutting in my personal time with him). And now I feel bad, because I can see how much Alex loves my dog, and I don't really want to be a dick just because I'm jealous somebody else is spending time with him.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person in the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a neighbor borrowing their dog regularly to help distract her autistic son. The author is feeling upset because they miss time with their dog and the dog is developing bad habits. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The dog is a family member, and the neighbor started taking the dog without asking after the initial okay. The author has mental health issues that their dog helps with, so the dog's absence is affecting them. The neighbor's son is autistic, which might mean the neighbor is dealing with challenges, but does that justify taking the dog without permission?\n\nThe author isn't against occasional help, but the frequency and lack of communication are the issues. The neighbor is using the dog daily and even during the day without asking, leading to the dog's behavior problems. The friend says the author is selfish, but the author is struggling with guilt since the child seems to love the dog.\n\nSo, the main question is about boundaries and respect. The neighbor initially had permission but now takes the dog without asking, which is a violation. The author's mental health and bond with the dog are valid concerns. The dog's changing behavior is a result of the neighbor's son not following the previous rules, which the author mentioned. The neighbor's dismissive response (\"Oh he'll climb right onto Alex's lap\") suggests she's not taking the author's concerns seriously.\n\nOn the other hand, the neighbor might be under stress from raising a child with autism, but that doesn't mean they can ignore the owner's boundaries. The author isn't refusing help entirely but is asking for respect for their needs and their dog's training. The fact that the dog is a family member and the author's source of comfort is a strong point in their favor.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the neighbor is overstepping by taking the dog without permission and not addressing the behavior issues. The author is justified in wanting to set boundaries, especially for their own well-being and the dog's welfare. The friend's comment about selfishness overlooks the author's legitimate needs and the dog's training. So, the answer would be that the author isn't in the wrong (B).\n"
