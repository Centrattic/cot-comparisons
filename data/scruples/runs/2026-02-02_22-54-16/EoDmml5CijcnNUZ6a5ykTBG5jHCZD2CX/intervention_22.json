I play rough with him in the garden or throw a ball around for maybe an hour a day, and he also gets walked twice a day for half an hour each and comes swimming with me whenever the weather's nice (which is most days). Suffice to say he's not lacking in attention or exercise.\n\nI have a neighbour who has two dogs of her own that are less energetic and prefer to lounge about in the sun rather than go adventuring. She also has a 12yo autistic son (Alex). He's a good kid but lacks some social boundaries and can fly off the handle when stressed out or bored. So one day my neighbour was working from home and was trying to keep him entertained so she could concentrate, and I got text saying, \"Hi! Hope it's okay but I sent Alex to walk your dog.\" I said it was all fine and told them to have fun, and I figured that was the end of it.\n\nNope. Alex now takes my dog out everyday (without asking, so I'll come home and find he's disappeared with the gate open and I'll panic), and then the neighbour will also \"borrow\" him for an hour or two whenever she's at home and needs to distract Alex. I really, really, really don't mind if she needs some quiet time and asks occasionally, since I'm sure my dog enjoys the extra attention.\n\nI've just got a few issues with some of it. One, my dog isn't a child's toy, he's a member of my family and I like having him close by. I have anxiety and depression and coming home to my dog bouncing around waiting for a walk is one of the few things that really destresses me. Now, I get home and he won't be returned to me until dinner time, and I miss out on bonding with him outdoors.\n\nTwo -- and I'm not sure whether this is the fault of the neighbour or Alex -- my dog has started developing bad habits since this whole routine started. He used to be very well-mannered, where you could drop a steak on the floor in front of his nose and he wouldn't eat it until you explicitly said he could. Now he begs at the table when he's inside, climbs onto my bed and couch without my permission (he's big and double coated, so he leaves hair everywhere), and will just generally behave in ways he wouldn't have dared to a month ago. I vaguely mentioned it when we were having drinks together the other night and my neighbour laughed and said, \"Oh he'll climb right onto Alex's lap on the couch.\" \n\nI complained about it to a friend last night and she said I was being selfish, since I don't understand what it's like to raise a child with a disability, and that it's not hurting anyone if my dog gets extra attention (even though he's not really, since it's cutting in my personal time with him). And now I feel bad, because I can see how much Alex loves my dog, and I don't really want to be a dick just because I'm jealous somebody else is spending time with him.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the original situation is in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the neighbor is using the author's dog to help manage her autistic son's behavior. That's a valid need, especially since raising a child with autism can be challenging. The neighbor probably sees the dog as a calming presence for Alex, which helps her focus on work. But the author is clearly upset because their dog is being taken without permission daily, leading to personal stress and the dog developing bad habits.\n\nThe author mentions that their dog is a family member, not just a pet, and that bonding time is important for their mental health. They also point out the dog's behavior has changed, which could be due to different handling by Alex or the neighbor. The friend's comment that the author is selfish adds another layer, suggesting that maybe there's a societal expectation to be more accommodating.\n\nBut wait, the neighbor isn't asking each time. The author has to come home and find the dog missing, which causes panic. That's a key point. The neighbor's actions are affecting the author's well-being. The dog's new behaviors might also indicate that the current arrangement isn't ideal for the dog's training.\n\nThe author's anxiety and depression are significant. The dog's presence is a source of comfort, which is being disrupted. The neighbor might not realize the impact of her actions on the author's mental health. Also, the fact that the dog is used as a \"child's toy\" for Alex, rather than being respected as a pet, could be problematic.\n\nHowever, the neighbor's needs are genuine. But the way she's handling it\u2014without asking each time\u2014crosses into the author's boundaries. The author has the right to set boundaries, even while being considerate of the neighbor's situation. The friend's advice might be too quick to dismiss the author's feelings without considering the long-term effects on the dog and the author's mental health.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong. They have a right to their dog's company and to maintain the dog's training. The neighbor's lack of communication and the resulting negative impacts on the author and the dog suggest that the author is justified in asking for the behavior to stop.\n"
