I play rough with him in the garden or throw a ball around for maybe an hour a day, and he also gets walked twice a day for half an hour each and comes swimming with me whenever the weather's nice (which is most days). Suffice to say he's not lacking in attention or exercise.\n\nI have a neighbour who has two dogs of her own that are less energetic and prefer to lounge about in the sun rather than go adventuring. She also has a 12yo autistic son (Alex). He's a good kid but lacks some social boundaries and can fly off the handle when stressed out or bored. So one day my neighbour was working from home and was trying to keep him entertained so she could concentrate, and I got text saying, \"Hi! Hope it's okay but I sent Alex to walk your dog.\" I said it was all fine and told them to have fun, and I figured that was the end of it.\n\nNope. Alex now takes my dog out everyday (without asking, so I'll come home and find he's disappeared with the gate open and I'll panic), and then the neighbour will also \"borrow\" him for an hour or two whenever she's at home and needs to distract Alex. I really, really, really don't mind if she needs some quiet time and asks occasionally, since I'm sure my dog enjoys the extra attention.\n\nI've just got a few issues with some of it. One, my dog isn't a child's toy, he's a member of my family and I like having him close by. I have anxiety and depression and coming home to my dog bouncing around waiting for a walk is one of the few things that really destresses me. Now, I get home and he won't be returned to me until dinner time, and I miss out on bonding with him outdoors.\n\nTwo -- and I'm not sure whether this is the fault of the neighbour or Alex -- my dog has started developing bad habits since this whole routine started. He used to be very well-mannered, where you could drop a steak on the floor in front of his nose and he wouldn't eat it until you explicitly said he could. Now he begs at the table when he's inside, climbs onto my bed and couch without my permission (he's big and double coated, so he leaves hair everywhere), and will just generally behave in ways he wouldn't have dared to a month ago. I vaguely mentioned it when we were having drinks together the other night and my neighbour laughed and said, \"Oh he'll climb right onto Alex's lap on the couch.\" \n\nI complained about it to a friend last night and she said I was being selfish, since I don't understand what it's like to raise a child with a disability, and that it's not hurting anyone if my dog gets extra attention (even though he's not really, since it's cutting in my personal time with him). And now I feel bad, because I can see how much Alex loves my dog, and I don't really want to be a dick just because I'm jealous somebody else is spending time with him.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is about a neighbor borrowing their dog regularly to help distract her autistic son. The author is upset because their dog is part of the family and they feel their bonding time is being taken away. They also mention the dog's behavior has worsened, which they think is due to the neighbor's handling.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the neighbor's intentions. She's trying to help her son with autism, which is a valid concern. But the author's dog is their family member, so the neighbor's actions might be crossing a boundary. The neighbor isn't asking anymore, just taking the dog whenever they need. That's a problem because the author's consent was given initially, but now it's becoming a regular, unannounced occurrence.\n\nThe author's anxiety and depression are factors here. The dog is a source of comfort, so losing that time could be affecting their mental health. The neighbor's friend told the author they were being selfish, but that's not a fair assessment. The author isn't denying Alex attention; they're concerned about their own needs and the dog's behavior.\n\nThe dog's bad habits\u2014like begging at the table and climbing on furniture\u2014suggest that the neighbor or Alex aren't training the dog properly. The neighbor's casual attitude about this (\"he'll climb right onto Alex's lap\") shows she might not realize the impact on the dog and the owner. The author has a right to address this, as the dog's behavior is their responsibility.\n\nSo, the author is not in the wrong. They have valid reasons to ask the neighbor to stop unannounced borrowing and to discuss proper dog training. The neighbor's actions are causing harm by disrupting the author's routine and the dog's behavior, even if it's well-intentioned. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
