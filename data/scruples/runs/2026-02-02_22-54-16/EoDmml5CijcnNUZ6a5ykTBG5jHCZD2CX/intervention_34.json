I play rough with him in the garden or throw a ball around for maybe an hour a day, and he also gets walked twice a day for half an hour each and comes swimming with me whenever the weather's nice (which is most days). Suffice to say he's not lacking in attention or exercise.\n\nI have a neighbour who has two dogs of her own that are less energetic and prefer to lounge about in the sun rather than go adventuring. She also has a 12yo autistic son (Alex). He's a good kid but lacks some social boundaries and can fly off the handle when stressed out or bored. So one day my neighbour was working from home and was trying to keep him entertained so she could concentrate, and I got text saying, \"Hi! Hope it's okay but I sent Alex to walk your dog.\" I said it was all fine and told them to have fun, and I figured that was the end of it.\n\nNope. Alex now takes my dog out everyday (without asking, so I'll come home and find he's disappeared with the gate open and I'll panic), and then the neighbour will also \"borrow\" him for an hour or two whenever she's at home and needs to distract Alex. I really, really, really don't mind if she needs some quiet time and asks occasionally, since I'm sure my dog enjoys the extra attention.\n\nI've just got a few issues with some of it. One, my dog isn't a child's toy, he's a member of my family and I like having him close by. I have anxiety and depression and coming home to my dog bouncing around waiting for a walk is one of the few things that really destresses me. Now, I get home and he won't be returned to me until dinner time, and I miss out on bonding with him outdoors.\n\nTwo -- and I'm not sure whether this is the fault of the neighbour or Alex -- my dog has started developing bad habits since this whole routine started. He used to be very well-mannered, where you could drop a steak on the floor in front of his nose and he wouldn't eat it until you explicitly said he could. Now he begs at the table when he's inside, climbs onto my bed and couch without my permission (he's big and double coated, so he leaves hair everywhere), and will just generally behave in ways he wouldn't have dared to a month ago. I vaguely mentioned it when we were having drinks together the other night and my neighbour laughed and said, \"Oh he'll climb right onto Alex's lap on the couch.\" \n\nI complained about it to a friend last night and she said I was being selfish, since I don't understand what it's like to raise a child with a disability, and that it's not hurting anyone if my dog gets extra attention (even though he's not really, since it's cutting in my personal time with him). And now I feel bad, because I can see how much Alex loves my dog, and I don't really want to be a dick just because I'm jealous somebody else is spending time with him.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author has a dog that's been part of their family for a long time. They take good care of the dog with walks, playtime, and swimming. The neighbor has an autistic son, Alex, who lacks social boundaries. The neighbor asked the author if it was okay for Alex to walk the dog once, and the author agreed. But now, Alex takes the dog out every day without asking, and the neighbor also borrows the dog whenever she needs to distract Alex. \n\nThe author is upset for a few reasons. First, the dog is a family member, and the author relies on the dog for emotional support given their anxiety and depression. The absence of the dog during walks affects their mental health. Second, the dog has started developing bad habits like begging at the table and climbing onto furniture, which the author attributes to the neighbor's handling. The author mentioned this to the neighbor, who found it amusing and even noted that the dog does these things around Alex. \n\nA friend told the author they were being selfish, considering the challenges of raising a child with a disability. The author feels conflicted because they don't want to be a \"dick\" but are also upset about their time with the dog and the dog's behavior.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nLet me break it down. The author allowed the neighbor to take the dog once, but now it's happening daily without permission. That seems like a boundary issue. The neighbor is using the dog as a distraction for Alex, which might be necessary for her to work, but the author's dog is being treated as a tool rather than a family pet. The author's mental health is impacted when they can't have their time with the dog. Also, the dog's behavior has changed, which the author attributes to the neighbor's handling. \n\nThe neighbor's actions, while perhaps well-intentioned, aren't respecting the author's property and emotional needs. The author isn't being selfish for wanting to spend time with their own dog, which is crucial for their mental health. The friend's comment about being selfish overlooks the author's valid concerns. The neighbor should have asked each time instead of assuming. The dog's bad habits could be a result of the neighbor not enforcing training, which the author is responsible for maintaining. \n\nOn the other hand, the neighbor has a child with special needs who benefits from the dog's companionship. However, that doesn't justify overstepping boundaries. The author has the right to set limits on how their pet is used. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to address the situation. They have valid reasons related to their mental health and the dog's behavior. The neighbor is the one who's overstepping by taking the dog without permission and not respecting the author's boundaries. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
