I play rough with him in the garden or throw a ball around for maybe an hour a day, and he also gets walked twice a day for half an hour each and comes swimming with me whenever the weather's nice (which is most days). Suffice to say he's not lacking in attention or exercise.\n\nI have a neighbour who has two dogs of her own that are less energetic and prefer to lounge about in the sun rather than go adventuring. She also has a 12yo autistic son (Alex). He's a good kid but lacks some social boundaries and can fly off the handle when stressed out or bored. So one day my neighbour was working from home and was trying to keep him entertained so she could concentrate, and I got text saying, \"Hi! Hope it's okay but I sent Alex to walk your dog.\" I said it was all fine and told them to have fun, and I figured that was the end of it.\n\nNope. Alex now takes my dog out everyday (without asking, so I'll come home and find he's disappeared with the gate open and I'll panic), and then the neighbour will also \"borrow\" him for an hour or two whenever she's at home and needs to distract Alex. I really, really, really don't mind if she needs some quiet time and asks occasionally, since I'm sure my dog enjoys the extra attention.\n\nI've just got a few issues with some of it. One, my dog isn't a child's toy, he's a member of my family and I like having him close by. I have anxiety and depression and coming home to my dog bouncing around waiting for a walk is one of the few things that really destresses me. Now, I get home and he won't be returned to me until dinner time, and I miss out on bonding with him outdoors.\n\nTwo -- and I'm not sure whether this is the fault of the neighbour or Alex -- my dog has started developing bad habits since this whole routine started. He used to be very well-mannered, where you could drop a steak on the floor in front of his nose and he wouldn't eat it until you explicitly said he could. Now he begs at the table when he's inside, climbs onto my bed and couch without my permission (he's big and double coated, so he leaves hair everywhere), and will just generally behave in ways he wouldn't have dared to a month ago. I vaguely mentioned it when we were having drinks together the other night and my neighbour laughed and said, \"Oh he'll climb right onto Alex's lap on the couch.\" \n\nI complained about it to a friend last night and she said I was being selfish, since I don't understand what it's like to raise a child with a disability, and that it's not hurting anyone if my dog gets extra attention (even though he's not really, since it's cutting in my personal time with him). And now I feel bad, because I can see how much Alex loves my dog, and I don't really want to be a dick just because I'm jealous somebody else is spending time with him.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to ask their neighbor to stop \"borrowing\" their dog to distract her autistic son. \n\nFirst, the author has a dog that's part of their family. They take good care of the dog with exercise and attention. The neighbor's son, Alex, is autistic and sometimes gets stressed. The neighbor started having Alex take the dog out, which the author initially agreed to once, but now it's daily without asking. The author is upset because they miss their dog and the dog is developing bad habits. The friend told the author they're being selfish.\n\nSo, the key points here: the author's dog is their family member, and the neighbor is using the dog to manage their son's behavior. The author is experiencing stress from not having their dog and the dog's behavior problems. The neighbor isn't asking anymore but just takes the dog, which is an issue. The friend's comment suggests the author should be more understanding of the neighbor's situation.\n\nBut the author's main concern is about their own well-being and their dog's behavior. The dog is a family member, and the author's mental health relies on having the dog's company. The neighbor's actions are causing both emotional and practical problems for the author. The neighbor might be using the dog as a replacement for proper support for Alex, which might not be the best solution. Also, the dog's new behaviors could be due to lack of training or boundaries when with Alex. \n\nThe author isn't just being selfish; they have valid reasons for wanting their dog back. The neighbor isn't respecting the author's boundaries by taking the dog without asking. Even though the neighbor has a good reason, the author's rights as the dog's owner are important. The friend's judgment is a bit one-sided. So the author isn't in the wrong here. They're trying to balance their needs with the neighbor's situation, but their own needs are legitimate. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
