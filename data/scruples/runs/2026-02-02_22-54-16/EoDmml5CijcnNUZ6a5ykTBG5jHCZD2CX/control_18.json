I play rough with him in the garden or throw a ball around for maybe an hour a day, and he also gets walked twice a day for half an hour each and comes swimming with me whenever the weather's nice (which is most days). Suffice to say he's not lacking in attention or exercise.\n\nI have a neighbour who has two dogs of her own that are less energetic and prefer to lounge about in the sun rather than go adventuring. She also has a 12yo autistic son (Alex). He's a good kid but lacks some social boundaries and can fly off the handle when stressed out or bored. So one day my neighbour was working from home and was trying to keep him entertained so she could concentrate, and I got text saying, \"Hi! Hope it's okay but I sent Alex to walk your dog.\" I said it was all fine and told them to have fun, and I figured that was the end of it.\n\nNope. Alex now takes my dog out everyday (without asking, so I'll come home and find he's disappeared with the gate open and I'll panic), and then the neighbour will also \"borrow\" him for an hour or two whenever she's at home and needs to distract Alex. I really, really, really don't mind if she needs some quiet time and asks occasionally, since I'm sure my dog enjoys the extra attention.\n\nI've just got a few issues with some of it. One, my dog isn't a child's toy, he's a member of my family and I like having him close by. I have anxiety and depression and coming home to my dog bouncing around waiting for a walk is one of the few things that really destresses me. Now, I get home and he won't be returned to me until dinner time, and I miss out on bonding with him outdoors.\n\nTwo -- and I'm not sure whether this is the fault of the neighbour or Alex -- my dog has started developing bad habits since this whole routine started. He used to be very well-mannered, where you could drop a steak on the floor in front of his nose and he wouldn't eat it until you explicitly said he could. Now he begs at the table when he's inside, climbs onto my bed and couch without my permission (he's big and double coated, so he leaves hair everywhere), and will just generally behave in ways he wouldn't have dared to a month ago. I vaguely mentioned it when we were having drinks together the other night and my neighbour laughed and said, \"Oh he'll climb right onto Alex's lap on the couch.\" \n\nI complained about it to a friend last night and she said I was being selfish, since I don't understand what it's like to raise a child with a disability, and that it's not hurting anyone if my dog gets extra attention (even though he's not really, since it's cutting in my personal time with him). And now I feel bad, because I can see how much Alex loves my dog, and I don't really want to be a dick just because I'm jealous somebody else is spending time with him.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the WIBTA post is in the wrong. Let me go through the details carefully.\n\nThe author has a dog that's been part of their family for a long time. They give the dog a lot of exercise and attention. Their neighbor has an autistic son named Alex who's been using the dog as a distraction without asking each time. The neighbor sends Alex to walk the dog daily and occasionally keeps the dog for hours. The author is upset because they miss time with their dog and the dog has developed bad habits like begging and climbing on furniture. They mentioned this to the neighbor, who laughed and seemed okay with the behavior. The author's friend told them they're being selfish, not considering the challenges of raising a special needs child.\n\nFirst, the neighbor is borrowing the dog without prior permission after the first time. The author initially agreed once but now the neighbor is doing it daily, which the author didn't consent to. So that's a boundary issue. The neighbor isn't respecting the author's property and the dog's care. The dog is a family member, not a toy. The author has anxiety and relies on the dog for emotional support, which is being disrupted. The dog's behavior is changing, possibly due to the neighbor's handling. The author's friend's reaction is dismissive, but that doesn't negate the author's valid concerns.\n\nThe neighbor's son might not realize the dog isn't a toy, but the neighbor should be supervising and ensuring the dog isn't overused. The author isn't being selfish; they have legitimate reasons. They\u2019re not stopping the neighbor when needed but are concerned about the frequency and lack of prior consent. The neighbor isn't considering the impact on the author's mental health and the dog's behavior. So the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
