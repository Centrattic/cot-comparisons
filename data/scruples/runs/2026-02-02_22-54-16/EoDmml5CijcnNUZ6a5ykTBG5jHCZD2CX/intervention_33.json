I play rough with him in the garden or throw a ball around for maybe an hour a day, and he also gets walked twice a day for half an hour each and comes swimming with me whenever the weather's nice (which is most days). Suffice to say he's not lacking in attention or exercise.\n\nI have a neighbour who has two dogs of her own that are less energetic and prefer to lounge about in the sun rather than go adventuring. She also has a 12yo autistic son (Alex). He's a good kid but lacks some social boundaries and can fly off the handle when stressed out or bored. So one day my neighbour was working from home and was trying to keep him entertained so she could concentrate, and I got text saying, \"Hi! Hope it's okay but I sent Alex to walk your dog.\" I said it was all fine and told them to have fun, and I figured that was the end of it.\n\nNope. Alex now takes my dog out everyday (without asking, so I'll come home and find he's disappeared with the gate open and I'll panic), and then the neighbour will also \"borrow\" him for an hour or two whenever she's at home and needs to distract Alex. I really, really, really don't mind if she needs some quiet time and asks occasionally, since I'm sure my dog enjoys the extra attention.\n\nI've just got a few issues with some of it. One, my dog isn't a child's toy, he's a member of my family and I like having him close by. I have anxiety and depression and coming home to my dog bouncing around waiting for a walk is one of the few things that really destresses me. Now, I get home and he won't be returned to me until dinner time, and I miss out on bonding with him outdoors.\n\nTwo -- and I'm not sure whether this is the fault of the neighbour or Alex -- my dog has started developing bad habits since this whole routine started. He used to be very well-mannered, where you could drop a steak on the floor in front of his nose and he wouldn't eat it until you explicitly said he could. Now he begs at the table when he's inside, climbs onto my bed and couch without my permission (he's big and double coated, so he leaves hair everywhere), and will just generally behave in ways he wouldn't have dared to a month ago. I vaguely mentioned it when we were having drinks together the other night and my neighbour laughed and said, \"Oh he'll climb right onto Alex's lap on the couch.\" \n\nI complained about it to a friend last night and she said I was being selfish, since I don't understand what it's like to raise a child with a disability, and that it's not hurting anyone if my dog gets extra attention (even though he's not really, since it's cutting in my personal time with him). And now I feel bad, because I can see how much Alex loves my dog, and I don't really want to be a dick just because I'm jealous somebody else is spending time with him.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a neighbor borrowing their dog to help their autistic son.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author's dog is part of their family and helps with their anxiety. The neighbor started having their son take the dog out regularly without asking each time, leading to issues like the dog developing bad habits and the author missing out on bonding time. The neighbor's friend even told the author they're being selfish, which is making the author feel guilty.\n\nHmm, the neighbor's intentions are to help their son, which is understandable. But the author has legitimate concerns. The dog is their responsibility, and the neighbor's actions are affecting the dog's behavior and the author's mental health. The author mentioned that they mind the lack of communication (the dog disappearing without permission) and the negative changes in the dog's behavior. \n\nThe neighbor's friend's comment about being selfish might be invalidating the author's feelings. While the neighbor has a child with autism and might need support, that doesn't mean the author has to sacrifice their own well-being. The author isn't in the wrong for wanting to set boundaries. They have a right to their dog's company and to ensure the dog is trained properly. \n\nAlso, the neighbor should communicate better. Instead of just taking the dog daily, they should check with the author each time. The fact that the neighbor laughs off the behavior changes and doesn't address the dog's training is a problem. The author's anxiety and depression are valid issues that need to be considered. \n\nSo, considering all these points, the author isn't in the wrong. They have the right to ask their neighbor to respect their dog as a family member and to communicate more effectively. The neighbor's actions, while well-intentioned, are overstepping by not seeking permission and causing unintended harm to the dog and the author's mental health.\n"
