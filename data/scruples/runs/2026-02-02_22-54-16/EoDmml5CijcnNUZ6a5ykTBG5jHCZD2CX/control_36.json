I play rough with him in the garden or throw a ball around for maybe an hour a day, and he also gets walked twice a day for half an hour each and comes swimming with me whenever the weather's nice (which is most days). Suffice to say he's not lacking in attention or exercise.\n\nI have a neighbour who has two dogs of her own that are less energetic and prefer to lounge about in the sun rather than go adventuring. She also has a 12yo autistic son (Alex). He's a good kid but lacks some social boundaries and can fly off the handle when stressed out or bored. So one day my neighbour was working from home and was trying to keep him entertained so she could concentrate, and I got text saying, \"Hi! Hope it's okay but I sent Alex to walk your dog.\" I said it was all fine and told them to have fun, and I figured that was the end of it.\n\nNope. Alex now takes my dog out everyday (without asking, so I'll come home and find he's disappeared with the gate open and I'll panic), and then the neighbour will also \"borrow\" him for an hour or two whenever she's at home and needs to distract Alex. I really, really, really don't mind if she needs some quiet time and asks occasionally, since I'm sure my dog enjoys the extra attention.\n\nI've just got a few issues with some of it. One, my dog isn't a child's toy, he's a member of my family and I like having him close by. I have anxiety and depression and coming home to my dog bouncing around waiting for a walk is one of the few things that really destresses me. Now, I get home and he won't be returned to me until dinner time, and I miss out on bonding with him outdoors.\n\nTwo -- and I'm not sure whether this is the fault of the neighbour or Alex -- my dog has started developing bad habits since this whole routine started. He used to be very well-mannered, where you could drop a steak on the floor in front of his nose and he wouldn't eat it until you explicitly said he could. Now he begs at the table when he's inside, climbs onto my bed and couch without my permission (he's big and double coated, so he leaves hair everywhere), and will just generally behave in ways he wouldn't have dared to a month ago. I vaguely mentioned it when we were having drinks together the other night and my neighbour laughed and said, \"Oh he'll climb right onto Alex's lap on the couch.\" \n\nI complained about it to a friend last night and she said I was being selfish, since I don't understand what it's like to raise a child with a disability, and that it's not hurting anyone if my dog gets extra attention (even though he's not really, since it's cutting in my personal time with him). And now I feel bad, because I can see how much Alex loves my dog, and I don't really want to be a dick just because I'm jealous somebody else is spending time with him.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in their situation with the neighbor and their dog. The author's dog is being \"borrowed\" by the neighbor's son, Alex, who is autistic. The author has several issues with this: the dog is now getting into bad habits, they miss their bonding time, and the neighbor isn't even asking anymore. Their friend said they're being selfish, but the author feels conflicted.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the situation from both sides. The neighbor has an autistic son who needs distraction, and the dog seems to provide that. The neighbor might not realize the impact on the author's dog's behavior and their own needs. However, the author is the owner of the dog, so they have the right to set boundaries. \n\nThe key points here are that the neighbor is taking the dog without asking, leading to the dog developing bad habits, and the author is losing their bonding time. The friend's comment about being selfish is probably not considering the author's mental health and the dog's training issues. The author is not being selfish here; they're advocating for their own well-being and their pet's proper training. The neighbor's actions, while perhaps well-intentioned, are overstepping by taking the dog without permission and causing unintended consequences. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The author has valid reasons to set boundaries, especially regarding their mental health and the dog's training. The neighbor's actions, though possibly out of necessity, need to consider the owner's needs as well. The author isn't being inconsiderate; they're addressing legitimate issues arising from the situation.\n"
