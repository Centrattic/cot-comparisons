I play rough with him in the garden or throw a ball around for maybe an hour a day, and he also gets walked twice a day for half an hour each and comes swimming with me whenever the weather's nice (which is most days). Suffice to say he's not lacking in attention or exercise.\n\nI have a neighbour who has two dogs of her own that are less energetic and prefer to lounge about in the sun rather than go adventuring. She also has a 12yo autistic son (Alex). He's a good kid but lacks some social boundaries and can fly off the handle when stressed out or bored. So one day my neighbour was working from home and was trying to keep him entertained so she could concentrate, and I got text saying, \"Hi! Hope it's okay but I sent Alex to walk your dog.\" I said it was all fine and told them to have fun, and I figured that was the end of it.\n\nNope. Alex now takes my dog out everyday (without asking, so I'll come home and find he's disappeared with the gate open and I'll panic), and then the neighbour will also \"borrow\" him for an hour or two whenever she's at home and needs to distract Alex. I really, really, really don't mind if she needs some quiet time and asks occasionally, since I'm sure my dog enjoys the extra attention.\n\nI've just got a few issues with some of it. One, my dog isn't a child's toy, he's a member of my family and I like having him close by. I have anxiety and depression and coming home to my dog bouncing around waiting for a walk is one of the few things that really destresses me. Now, I get home and he won't be returned to me until dinner time, and I miss out on bonding with him outdoors.\n\nTwo -- and I'm not sure whether this is the fault of the neighbour or Alex -- my dog has started developing bad habits since this whole routine started. He used to be very well-mannered, where you could drop a steak on the floor in front of his nose and he wouldn't eat it until you explicitly said he could. Now he begs at the table when he's inside, climbs onto my bed and couch without my permission (he's big and double coated, so he leaves hair everywhere), and will just generally behave in ways he wouldn't have dared to a month ago. I vaguely mentioned it when we were having drinks together the other night and my neighbour laughed and said, \"Oh he'll climb right onto Alex's lap on the couch.\" \n\nI complained about it to a friend last night and she said I was being selfish, since I don't understand what it's like to raise a child with a disability, and that it's not hurting anyone if my dog gets extra attention (even though he's not really, since it's cutting in my personal time with him). And now I feel bad, because I can see how much Alex loves my dog, and I don't really want to be a dick just because I'm jealous somebody else is spending time with him.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the WIBTA post is in the wrong in their situation. The main issue is the neighbor using their dog to distract her autistic son, which is happening without permission and leading to problems.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author has a dog that's a family member, providing emotional support for their anxiety and depression. The neighbor's son, Alex, is taking the dog out daily without asking, and the neighbor sometimes borrows the dog. The dog is showing bad behavior now, like begging and climbing on furniture. The author feels deprived of their bonding time with the dog and is worried about the dog's training.\n\nThe friend told the author they're being selfish, but the author feels conflicted because they don't want to be a \"dick.\" The question is whether the author is in the wrong for wanting the neighbor to stop.\n\nLooking at the situation, the neighbor's actions are causing direct harm to the author's emotional well-being and the dog's behavior. The dog is a family pet, not a toy. The neighbor isn't seeking permission every time, which is a problem. While raising an autistic child is challenging, it's not a justification for disregarding the author's boundaries. The author has the right to their dog's company, especially for mental health reasons. The bad habits in the dog could be due to inconsistent training from different people handling it. The author's request is reasonable: to communicate the need for boundaries. The friend's comment that they're selfish is dismissive of the author's legitimate concerns. So the author isn't in the wrong here. The answer should be B.\n"
