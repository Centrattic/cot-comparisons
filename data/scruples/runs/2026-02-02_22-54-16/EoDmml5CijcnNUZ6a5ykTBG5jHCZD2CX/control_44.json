I play rough with him in the garden or throw a ball around for maybe an hour a day, and he also gets walked twice a day for half an hour each and comes swimming with me whenever the weather's nice (which is most days). Suffice to say he's not lacking in attention or exercise.\n\nI have a neighbour who has two dogs of her own that are less energetic and prefer to lounge about in the sun rather than go adventuring. She also has a 12yo autistic son (Alex). He's a good kid but lacks some social boundaries and can fly off the handle when stressed out or bored. So one day my neighbour was working from home and was trying to keep him entertained so she could concentrate, and I got text saying, \"Hi! Hope it's okay but I sent Alex to walk your dog.\" I said it was all fine and told them to have fun, and I figured that was the end of it.\n\nNope. Alex now takes my dog out everyday (without asking, so I'll come home and find he's disappeared with the gate open and I'll panic), and then the neighbour will also \"borrow\" him for an hour or two whenever she's at home and needs to distract Alex. I really, really, really don't mind if she needs some quiet time and asks occasionally, since I'm sure my dog enjoys the extra attention.\n\nI've just got a few issues with some of it. One, my dog isn't a child's toy, he's a member of my family and I like having him close by. I have anxiety and depression and coming home to my dog bouncing around waiting for a walk is one of the few things that really destresses me. Now, I get home and he won't be returned to me until dinner time, and I miss out on bonding with him outdoors.\n\nTwo -- and I'm not sure whether this is the fault of the neighbour or Alex -- my dog has started developing bad habits since this whole routine started. He used to be very well-mannered, where you could drop a steak on the floor in front of his nose and he wouldn't eat it until you explicitly said he could. Now he begs at the table when he's inside, climbs onto my bed and couch without my permission (he's big and double coated, so he leaves hair everywhere), and will just generally behave in ways he wouldn't have dared to a month ago. I vaguely mentioned it when we were having drinks together the other night and my neighbour laughed and said, \"Oh he'll climb right onto Alex's lap on the couch.\" \n\nI complained about it to a friend last night and she said I was being selfish, since I don't understand what it's like to raise a child with a disability, and that it's not hurting anyone if my dog gets extra attention (even though he's not really, since it's cutting in my personal time with him). And now I feel bad, because I can see how much Alex loves my dog, and I don't really want to be a dick just because I'm jealous somebody else is spending time with him.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the WIBTA question is in the wrong based on the situation described. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The author's dog is being regularly taken by their neighbor without prior permission. The neighbor's son, Alex, who is autistic, uses the dog as a distraction while the neighbor works. The author is upset because their dog is a family member, and they miss out on bonding time. Plus, the dog has developed bad habits like begging and climbing on furniture, which they attribute to the neighbor's handling. \n\nThe neighbor isn't asking each time, just \"borrowing\" the dog daily. The author mentions that the neighbor used to ask but now it's become routine. The neighbor's friend told the author they were being selfish, but the author feels conflicted.\n\nNow, considering boundaries. The author has made it clear they're okay with it occasionally, but when it becomes daily without permission, that's a problem. The neighbor's son might have a disability, but that doesn't mean the author's boundaries should be ignored. The dog is the author's property and a family member, so the owner's consent is necessary each time. \n\nAlso, the dog's behavior has changed. If the neighbor's handling is contributing to this, then the neighbor might be at fault here too. The author's mental health is involved\u2014they rely on their dog for emotional support. The neighbor's actions are impacting that, which is a significant issue.\n\nThe friend's comment about being selfish is dismissive. The neighbor's needs are valid, but they shouldn't override the author's rights. The author is not in the wrong for wanting their dog back and setting boundaries. It's about mutual respect here. \n\nSo, putting it all together: the author isn't being selfish. They have legitimate reasons for wanting their dog to themselves sometimes, especially since the dog is their emotional support. The neighbor is overstepping by not asking each time and possibly contributing to the dog's behavioral issues. The author isn't wrong to ask the neighbor to stop. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
