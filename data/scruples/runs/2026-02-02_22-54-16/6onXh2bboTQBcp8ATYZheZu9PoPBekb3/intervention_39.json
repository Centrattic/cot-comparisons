It's as chaotic and nightmarish as you can imagine. Usually she never asks to come over to my place because it's a nightmare to travel with 14 kids to come visit their auntie who lives 5 hours away. If we're having a gathering it's always me who is travelling to their place. I don't really mind. We only meet a few times a year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few years ago I bought my dream house with my husband. My sister asked to host my nephew's 3rd birthday party at my house. She wants to use the big backyard, grill and pool at my home. There are roughly 50 people who are invited. I said no and she called me selfish and an asshole. Her kids have never been to my house and I prefer it that way. Her kids are not very well behaved except for the oldest three and my house is not child-poof. The pool seems like a huge liability. I don't want children drowning on my property. It just seems like a recipe for disaster. She brought up the fact that she hosted Christmas at her house for the past 10+ years at her house, but I don't think it's fair to compare this to that. We meet at her house instead of our parents because she has 14 kids to herd around so it's really more out of convenience to her. Every year for the past 10+ years I buy dessert enough to feed 25 people so I've done my part with the food arrangements. That's 8 apple pies or 3 cakes worth of dessert. My parents also stay over to help prepare and cook and we all contribute to the washing and cleaning. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe haven't spoken in 2 months because of this. She firmly believes AITA. So, AITA for not allowing my sister to host my nephew's birthday party at my house? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post (the author) is in the wrong for not letting their sister host a kid's birthday party at their house.\n\nFirst, the sister has 14 kids, which is a lot. The author bought a dream house, and the sister wanted to use the backyard, grill, and pool for a party with 50 guests. The author refused, citing safety concerns about the pool and the potential chaos from 14 kids. The sister called them selfish and an asshole, leading to a two-month silence.\n\nSo, the key points here are the safety of the pool and the number of children. The author mentions their house isn't child-proof, which could be a valid safety issue. Also, hosting 50 people in a house that's not designed for that many might be overwhelming. The sister's kids aren't well-behaved except for the oldest three, which adds to the concern.\n\nThe sister's argument is that she's hosted Christmas for 10+ years at her place, but the author points out that meeting at their parents' house is more convenient because of the 14 kids. The author has contributed to the past events by bringing desserts, so they feel they've done their part.\n\nNow, considering the author's reasons: safety and practicality. The pool is a liability, and with 14 kids, even if it's just the birthday party, there's a risk of injury or accident. The author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing safety. Also, the sister should have considered the author's concerns before making the request. The number of guests (50) is another factor; the author's home might not be suitable for such a large gathering. \n\nThe sister's reaction seems harsh. Calling the author selfish and an asshole without considering the legitimate safety issues is problematic. The author isn't obligated to let her host the party, especially given their prior agreement to meet at the sister's place due to logistics. \n\nIn terms of fairness, the author isn't in the wrong. They have valid reasons for declining, and the sister's comparison to past Christmas events doesn't hold because the circumstances are different. The author has contributed in other ways, which the sister might not be acknowledging. \n\nSo, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
