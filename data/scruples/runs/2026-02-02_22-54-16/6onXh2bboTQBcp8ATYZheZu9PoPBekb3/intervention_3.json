It's as chaotic and nightmarish as you can imagine. Usually she never asks to come over to my place because it's a nightmare to travel with 14 kids to come visit their auntie who lives 5 hours away. If we're having a gathering it's always me who is travelling to their place. I don't really mind. We only meet a few times a year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few years ago I bought my dream house with my husband. My sister asked to host my nephew's 3rd birthday party at my house. She wants to use the big backyard, grill and pool at my home. There are roughly 50 people who are invited. I said no and she called me selfish and an asshole. Her kids have never been to my house and I prefer it that way. Her kids are not very well behaved except for the oldest three and my house is not child-poof. The pool seems like a huge liability. I don't want children drowning on my property. It just seems like a recipe for disaster. She brought up the fact that she hosted Christmas at her house for the past 10+ years at her house, but I don't think it's fair to compare this to that. We meet at her house instead of our parents because she has 14 kids to herd around so it's really more out of convenience to her. Every year for the past 10+ years I buy dessert enough to feed 25 people so I've done my part with the food arrangements. That's 8 apple pies or 3 cakes worth of dessert. My parents also stay over to help prepare and cook and we all contribute to the washing and cleaning. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe haven't spoken in 2 months because of this. She firmly believes AITA. So, AITA for not allowing my sister to host my nephew's birthday party at my house? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for not letting their sister host a birthday party at their house. The sister has 14 kids, which is a lot, and the author bought a dream house they don't want to risk. The sister was upset and called them selfish, leading to a two-month silence.\n\nFirst, the author's reasons: safety concerns (pool liability, house not child-proof), the chaos of 14 kids plus 50 guests, and past arrangements where they've met at the sister's house with contributions. The sister's argument is that she's hosted Christmas there for years, but the author points out that's different because the sister's house is more convenient for her large family. The author also mentions they contribute to the Christmas events with food, so maybe they feel they've already given enough.\n\nThe key points here are the author's right to set boundaries for their property and safety versus the sister feeling slighted. The sister's behavior (calling names, not considering the author's concerns) seems harsh. Hosting a party with that many kids in someone else's home is risky, especially with a pool. The author isn't blocking all interactions but is setting a boundary for safety and property. The sister's history of hosting at her own home with help from family suggests that the burden isn't entirely on the author. The author's refusal isn't about being selfish but about protecting their home and preventing potential disasters. The sister's reaction might stem from feeling her needs aren't being considered, but the author's reasons are valid. So, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
