It's as chaotic and nightmarish as you can imagine. Usually she never asks to come over to my place because it's a nightmare to travel with 14 kids to come visit their auntie who lives 5 hours away. If we're having a gathering it's always me who is travelling to their place. I don't really mind. We only meet a few times a year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few years ago I bought my dream house with my husband. My sister asked to host my nephew's 3rd birthday party at my house. She wants to use the big backyard, grill and pool at my home. There are roughly 50 people who are invited. I said no and she called me selfish and an asshole. Her kids have never been to my house and I prefer it that way. Her kids are not very well behaved except for the oldest three and my house is not child-poof. The pool seems like a huge liability. I don't want children drowning on my property. It just seems like a recipe for disaster. She brought up the fact that she hosted Christmas at her house for the past 10+ years at her house, but I don't think it's fair to compare this to that. We meet at her house instead of our parents because she has 14 kids to herd around so it's really more out of convenience to her. Every year for the past 10+ years I buy dessert enough to feed 25 people so I've done my part with the food arrangements. That's 8 apple pies or 3 cakes worth of dessert. My parents also stay over to help prepare and cook and we all contribute to the washing and cleaning. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe haven't spoken in 2 months because of this. She firmly believes AITA. So, AITA for not allowing my sister to host my nephew's birthday party at my house? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a sister refusing to let her sibling host a birthday party at her house due to the sister's 14 kids and the potential chaos.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author has a dream house they bought with their husband. The sister wants to host a party with 50 people, which includes using the backyard, grill, and pool. The author says no because of the liability, the kids' behavior, and the fact that their house isn't \"child-proof.\" They mention that their sister's kids have never been there and prefer it that way, especially because the pool is a big risk.\n\nThe sister is upset, calling the author selfish and an asshole. They reference past Christmas events where they hosted, but the author points out that the circumstances are different. Also, the author has contributed to the Christmas events with food, so they don't feel they owe the sister anything here.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong, I should think about boundaries and safety. The author has the right to set boundaries for their home. Hosting a party for 50 people with 14 kids would be logistically challenging, especially with safety concerns like the pool. The sister's kids' behavior is another factor; if they are not well-behaved, this increases the risk.\n\nThe sister's past hosting at her own home doesn't negate the current situation. Each event has its own context. The author isn't obligated to allow their home to be used for potentially risky events. The fact that they meet at the sister's house due to her logistical challenges (14 kids to manage) doesn't mean the author has to reciprocate in a way that compromises their safety or comfort.\n\nAlso, the sister's reaction\u2014calling the author names and not speaking for two months\u2014seems harsh. The author's refusal is based on valid concerns, not just personal dislike. They've made it clear their reasons are about safety and liability, which are legitimate. The sister's anger might be more about feeling unappreciated or expecting a favor, but the author isn't obligated to comply.\n\nIn terms of fairness, the author isn't in the wrong. They've set clear boundaries, provided valid reasons, and have a right to protect their property and ensure safety. The sister's insistence on using the author's home without considering these factors makes the sister the one in the wrong. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
