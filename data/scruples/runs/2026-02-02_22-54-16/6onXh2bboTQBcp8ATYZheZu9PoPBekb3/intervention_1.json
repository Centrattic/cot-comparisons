It's as chaotic and nightmarish as you can imagine. Usually she never asks to come over to my place because it's a nightmare to travel with 14 kids to come visit their auntie who lives 5 hours away. If we're having a gathering it's always me who is travelling to their place. I don't really mind. We only meet a few times a year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few years ago I bought my dream house with my husband. My sister asked to host my nephew's 3rd birthday party at my house. She wants to use the big backyard, grill and pool at my home. There are roughly 50 people who are invited. I said no and she called me selfish and an asshole. Her kids have never been to my house and I prefer it that way. Her kids are not very well behaved except for the oldest three and my house is not child-poof. The pool seems like a huge liability. I don't want children drowning on my property. It just seems like a recipe for disaster. She brought up the fact that she hosted Christmas at her house for the past 10+ years at her house, but I don't think it's fair to compare this to that. We meet at her house instead of our parents because she has 14 kids to herd around so it's really more out of convenience to her. Every year for the past 10+ years I buy dessert enough to feed 25 people so I've done my part with the food arrangements. That's 8 apple pies or 3 cakes worth of dessert. My parents also stay over to help prepare and cook and we all contribute to the washing and cleaning. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe haven't spoken in 2 months because of this. She firmly believes AITA. So, AITA for not allowing my sister to host my nephew's birthday party at my house? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not letting her sister host a birthday party at her house. The sister has 14 kids, and the author lives 5 hours away. The sister wanted to use the author's house for a party with 50 people, which the author declined.\n\nFirst, the author bought a house she loves with her husband. Her sister's request seems to be a big logistical challenge. The sister has never asked to come over before, maybe due to the distance and the number of kids. The author mentions safety concerns with the pool and the kids not being well-behaved. She also points out that she's contributed to past events at her sister's house.\n\nThe sister is upset, calling the author selfish. But the author's reasons are about safety and the potential disaster with so many kids in her home. The sister compares to previous Christmas events, but the author argues that those were different. She's already helping with food and other tasks at her sister's place. \n\nSo, considering the author's perspective, she's protecting her property and safety. The sister's kids have never been to the author's house, and the author's reasons are valid. The sister's reaction seems harsh, especially since the author isn't forcing her to host. The user thinks the author is in the right, which aligns with the analysis. Safety and personal boundaries are important here. The answer should be B.\n"
