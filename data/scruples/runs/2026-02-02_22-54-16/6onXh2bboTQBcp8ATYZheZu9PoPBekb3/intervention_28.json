It's as chaotic and nightmarish as you can imagine. Usually she never asks to come over to my place because it's a nightmare to travel with 14 kids to come visit their auntie who lives 5 hours away. If we're having a gathering it's always me who is travelling to their place. I don't really mind. We only meet a few times a year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few years ago I bought my dream house with my husband. My sister asked to host my nephew's 3rd birthday party at my house. She wants to use the big backyard, grill and pool at my home. There are roughly 50 people who are invited. I said no and she called me selfish and an asshole. Her kids have never been to my house and I prefer it that way. Her kids are not very well behaved except for the oldest three and my house is not child-poof. The pool seems like a huge liability. I don't want children drowning on my property. It just seems like a recipe for disaster. She brought up the fact that she hosted Christmas at her house for the past 10+ years at her house, but I don't think it's fair to compare this to that. We meet at her house instead of our parents because she has 14 kids to herd around so it's really more out of convenience to her. Every year for the past 10+ years I buy dessert enough to feed 25 people so I've done my part with the food arrangements. That's 8 apple pies or 3 cakes worth of dessert. My parents also stay over to help prepare and cook and we all contribute to the washing and cleaning. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe haven't spoken in 2 months because of this. She firmly believes AITA. So, AITA for not allowing my sister to host my nephew's birthday party at my house? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for not allowing her sister to host a kid's birthday party at her house. The sister has 14 kids, and the author has a dream house with a pool. The sister wanted to use the backyard, grill, and pool for a party with 50 people, but the author said no. The sister is upset, called her names, and they haven't spoken for two months.\n\nFirst, the author's reasons: the house isn't child-proof, the pool is a liability, and her sister's kids aren't well-behaved except the oldest three. The sister had hosted Christmas gatherings for years at her place, but the author is saying that the situation is different here. The sister argues that the author has been contributing with desserts and other help each year, but the author is drawing a line at allowing a party at her home.\n\nI need to consider personal boundaries and safety. The author has a right to set boundaries for her own home. Hosting 50 people, especially with 14 kids who might not be well-behaved, could be risky. The pool is a significant liability, and child-proofing a house for that many kids isn't feasible. The sister's kids haven't even been to the author's home before, which might indicate that the sister hasn't considered the author's space's suitability for large groups.\n\nThe sister's reaction of calling the author selfish and an asshole seems harsh, but maybe she was frustrated. However, the author isn't obligated to let someone use her home if she's uncomfortable. The fact that the sister has hosted other events at her own home and the author has contributed in other ways (desserts, etc.) shows some level of participation. The author's refusal isn't about not helping but about safety and personal comfort.\n\nSo, the key points are safety, personal property rights, and reasonable boundaries. The author isn't in the wrong. The sister's reaction is over the top, but that doesn't mean the author is wrong. The answer should be B (No).\n"
