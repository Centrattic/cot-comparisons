It's as chaotic and nightmarish as you can imagine. Usually she never asks to come over to my place because it's a nightmare to travel with 14 kids to come visit their auntie who lives 5 hours away. If we're having a gathering it's always me who is travelling to their place. I don't really mind. We only meet a few times a year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few years ago I bought my dream house with my husband. My sister asked to host my nephew's 3rd birthday party at my house. She wants to use the big backyard, grill and pool at my home. There are roughly 50 people who are invited. I said no and she called me selfish and an asshole. Her kids have never been to my house and I prefer it that way. Her kids are not very well behaved except for the oldest three and my house is not child-poof. The pool seems like a huge liability. I don't want children drowning on my property. It just seems like a recipe for disaster. She brought up the fact that she hosted Christmas at her house for the past 10+ years at her house, but I don't think it's fair to compare this to that. We meet at her house instead of our parents because she has 14 kids to herd around so it's really more out of convenience to her. Every year for the past 10+ years I buy dessert enough to feed 25 people so I've done my part with the food arrangements. That's 8 apple pies or 3 cakes worth of dessert. My parents also stay over to help prepare and cook and we all contribute to the washing and cleaning. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe haven't spoken in 2 months because of this. She firmly believes AITA. So, AITA for not allowing my sister to host my nephew's birthday party at my house? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for not allowing their sister to host a birthday party at their house. The author has 14 nieces and nephews, and their sister wanted to host a party with about 50 guests. The author declined, citing the chaos, liability of the pool, and that their house isn't child-proof. The sister called them selfish, and they haven't spoken in two months.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the main points. The author has a valid concern about safety, especially with a pool and 50 kids. Their house isn't set up for that many children, and they mentioned the kids aren't well-behaved except for the oldest three. The sister had hosted Christmas before, but that's a different scenario. The author also mentions contributing to the previous events by providing dessert. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, they have the right to set boundaries for their home. Allowing such a large group could be dangerous and stressful. The sister might feel hurt, but the author's reasons are practical. The sister's reaction seems harsh, but maybe she felt it was a reasonable request. However, the author didn't have to say no, but they did have a legitimate reason. So, maybe the author isn't in the wrong because they can control their own property and safety. But did they handle it poorly? They just said no, perhaps without offering alternatives? But the sister might not appreciate that. Still, the answer is likely B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
