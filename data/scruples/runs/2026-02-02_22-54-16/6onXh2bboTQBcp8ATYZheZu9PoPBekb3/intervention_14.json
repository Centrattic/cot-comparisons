It's as chaotic and nightmarish as you can imagine. Usually she never asks to come over to my place because it's a nightmare to travel with 14 kids to come visit their auntie who lives 5 hours away. If we're having a gathering it's always me who is travelling to their place. I don't really mind. We only meet a few times a year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few years ago I bought my dream house with my husband. My sister asked to host my nephew's 3rd birthday party at my house. She wants to use the big backyard, grill and pool at my home. There are roughly 50 people who are invited. I said no and she called me selfish and an asshole. Her kids have never been to my house and I prefer it that way. Her kids are not very well behaved except for the oldest three and my house is not child-poof. The pool seems like a huge liability. I don't want children drowning on my property. It just seems like a recipe for disaster. She brought up the fact that she hosted Christmas at her house for the past 10+ years at her house, but I don't think it's fair to compare this to that. We meet at her house instead of our parents because she has 14 kids to herd around so it's really more out of convenience to her. Every year for the past 10+ years I buy dessert enough to feed 25 people so I've done my part with the food arrangements. That's 8 apple pies or 3 cakes worth of dessert. My parents also stay over to help prepare and cook and we all contribute to the washing and cleaning. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe haven't spoken in 2 months because of this. She firmly believes AITA. So, AITA for not allowing my sister to host my nephew's birthday party at my house? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not letting her sister host a birthday party at her house.\n\nFirst, the sister has 14 kids, which is a lot. The author bought her dream house and doesn't want the chaos of 14 kids, plus 50 guests. Safety is a concern with the pool and the house not being child-proof. The sister called her selfish, but the author has valid reasons for her refusal.\n\nThe sister hosted Christmas for years, but the author points out that the circumstances are different. The author has contributed to the past events by bringing desserts and helping with clean-up. The sister's kids haven't even been to the author's house before, so there's no prior history of them being there.\n\nThe author is setting boundaries for her own home, which is her right. The sister's reaction might be harsh, but the author's concerns about safety and chaos are legitimate. The fact that they haven't spoken in two months shows the tension, but the author's stance seems justified based on the reasons given.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. She's protecting her property and safety.\n"
