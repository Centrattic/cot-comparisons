It's as chaotic and nightmarish as you can imagine. Usually she never asks to come over to my place because it's a nightmare to travel with 14 kids to come visit their auntie who lives 5 hours away. If we're having a gathering it's always me who is travelling to their place. I don't really mind. We only meet a few times a year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few years ago I bought my dream house with my husband. My sister asked to host my nephew's 3rd birthday party at my house. She wants to use the big backyard, grill and pool at my home. There are roughly 50 people who are invited. I said no and she called me selfish and an asshole. Her kids have never been to my house and I prefer it that way. Her kids are not very well behaved except for the oldest three and my house is not child-poof. The pool seems like a huge liability. I don't want children drowning on my property. It just seems like a recipe for disaster. She brought up the fact that she hosted Christmas at her house for the past 10+ years at her house, but I don't think it's fair to compare this to that. We meet at her house instead of our parents because she has 14 kids to herd around so it's really more out of convenience to her. Every year for the past 10+ years I buy dessert enough to feed 25 people so I've done my part with the food arrangements. That's 8 apple pies or 3 cakes worth of dessert. My parents also stay over to help prepare and cook and we all contribute to the washing and cleaning. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe haven't spoken in 2 months because of this. She firmly believes AITA. So, AITA for not allowing my sister to host my nephew's birthday party at my house? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not letting their sister host a birthday party at their house. The sister has 14 kids, which is a lot. The author bought their dream house and is worried about the chaos, especially with the pool and safety. They said no, and the sister is upset, calling them selfish.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the reasons the author gave. They mentioned safety concerns with the pool and that their house isn't \"child-proof.\" Also, they prefer that the sister's kids don't come to their house because of the behavior issues except for the oldest three. The sister hosted Christmas for 10 years, but the author says it's not a fair comparison because the Christmas gatherings were at the sister's house, which is more convenient for her.\n\nThe key points here are the safety issues and the author's right to set boundaries for their own property. The sister's kids have never been to the author's house, so maybe the author is justified in wanting to keep it that way. The sister is upset because she felt it was a favor, but the author might feel that their home isn't suitable for such a large, chaotic event. Also, the sister has a history of hosting big events at her own home, so maybe she should continue doing that.\n\nI should also think about the fact that the author has been contributing to the Christmas gatherings by bringing desserts and helping with cleanup, so they might feel they've already done their part. The sister's reaction of calling the author an asshole seems harsh, especially if the author's reasons are valid. The author isn't obligated to let others use their home, especially when there are safety concerns. \n\nBut maybe there's a cultural expectation here. In some cases, family might expect to use each other's homes for events. However, the author has a valid reason related to safety and the nature of their home. The sister might be overstepping by assuming the author would allow it without considering the author's circumstances. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. They have legitimate concerns about safety and the suitability of their home for such an event. The sister might need to respect the author's decision and find another venue. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
