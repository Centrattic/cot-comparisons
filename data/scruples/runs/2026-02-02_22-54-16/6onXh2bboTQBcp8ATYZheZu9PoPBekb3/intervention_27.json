It's as chaotic and nightmarish as you can imagine. Usually she never asks to come over to my place because it's a nightmare to travel with 14 kids to come visit their auntie who lives 5 hours away. If we're having a gathering it's always me who is travelling to their place. I don't really mind. We only meet a few times a year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few years ago I bought my dream house with my husband. My sister asked to host my nephew's 3rd birthday party at my house. She wants to use the big backyard, grill and pool at my home. There are roughly 50 people who are invited. I said no and she called me selfish and an asshole. Her kids have never been to my house and I prefer it that way. Her kids are not very well behaved except for the oldest three and my house is not child-poof. The pool seems like a huge liability. I don't want children drowning on my property. It just seems like a recipe for disaster. She brought up the fact that she hosted Christmas at her house for the past 10+ years at her house, but I don't think it's fair to compare this to that. We meet at her house instead of our parents because she has 14 kids to herd around so it's really more out of convenience to her. Every year for the past 10+ years I buy dessert enough to feed 25 people so I've done my part with the food arrangements. That's 8 apple pies or 3 cakes worth of dessert. My parents also stay over to help prepare and cook and we all contribute to the washing and cleaning. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe haven't spoken in 2 months because of this. She firmly believes AITA. So, AITA for not allowing my sister to host my nephew's birthday party at my house? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" story did the right thing by not letting their sister host a birthday party at their house. So, first, I need to understand the situation.\n\nThe author bought their dream home with their husband. Their sister has 14 kids, which they describe as chaotic. The sister wanted to host a 3rd birthday party at the author's house for 50 people. The author refused, citing the chaos of the kids, the house not being \"child-proof,\" the pool's liability, and their preference to avoid the kids coming to their home. The sister called them selfish and an asshole, and they haven't talked in two months.\n\nThe author argues that they usually go to the sister's house for gatherings because it's more convenient, given the sister's situation. They also mention contributing to the Christmas events by bringing dessert and others helping with prep and cleaning. The sister is comparing the two situations, but the author feels it's different because hosting at their house would be a disaster.\n\nNow, I need to determine if the author is in the wrong. Let's break down the key points:\n\n1. **Safety Concerns**: The author mentions the house isn't child-proof and the pool is a liability. This is a valid safety issue, especially with 14 kids running around. Parents have a responsibility to ensure their property is safe for others' children.\n\n2. **Previous Contributions**: The author has been contributing to the family gatherings (Christmas) by bringing dessert and others help with the work. This shows they've contributed in the past, which might support their refusal now as they have their own limits.\n\n3. **Travel Distance**: The sister's house is 5 hours away, making it more practical for the author to travel to the sister's house rather than the other way around. The author doesn't mind traveling to the sister's place for gatherings, but the sister now wants to reverse this.\n\n4. **Personal Preference**: The author doesn't want the sister's kids coming to their house, except for the oldest three. This is a personal boundary, which can be valid. They might not feel comfortable with younger, less behaved kids in their home.\n\n5. **Comparison to Christmas Hosting**: The sister argues that the author has hosted Christmas for years, but the author points out that those are different circumstances. Christmas at the sister's house is more about convenience due to her having 14 kids, whereas hosting a birthday at the author's house would be a different scenario with a much larger guest list (50 people) and potential safety issues.\n\n6. **Communication and Conflict**: The sister's reaction was to call the author selfish and an asshole, which suggests she feels hurt or that her needs were disregarded. However, the author's refusal is based on practical and safety concerns.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's often about balancing personal boundaries with family obligations. The author is protecting their home and safety, which is their right. The sister's request might be reasonable in a different context, but given the specific circumstances (size of the kids, safety, personal boundaries), the author's refusal seems justified. The sister's comparison to past events might not be fair if the situations are indeed different. The author isn't obligated to host family events on their property, especially with the risks involved. They've contributed in other ways, so the refusal isn't solely about selfishness but also about managing their own resources and safety.\n\nTherefore, the author is not in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
