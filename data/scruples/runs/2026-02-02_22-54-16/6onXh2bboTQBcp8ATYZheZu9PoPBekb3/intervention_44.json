It's as chaotic and nightmarish as you can imagine. Usually she never asks to come over to my place because it's a nightmare to travel with 14 kids to come visit their auntie who lives 5 hours away. If we're having a gathering it's always me who is travelling to their place. I don't really mind. We only meet a few times a year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few years ago I bought my dream house with my husband. My sister asked to host my nephew's 3rd birthday party at my house. She wants to use the big backyard, grill and pool at my home. There are roughly 50 people who are invited. I said no and she called me selfish and an asshole. Her kids have never been to my house and I prefer it that way. Her kids are not very well behaved except for the oldest three and my house is not child-poof. The pool seems like a huge liability. I don't want children drowning on my property. It just seems like a recipe for disaster. She brought up the fact that she hosted Christmas at her house for the past 10+ years at her house, but I don't think it's fair to compare this to that. We meet at her house instead of our parents because she has 14 kids to herd around so it's really more out of convenience to her. Every year for the past 10+ years I buy dessert enough to feed 25 people so I've done my part with the food arrangements. That's 8 apple pies or 3 cakes worth of dessert. My parents also stay over to help prepare and cook and we all contribute to the washing and cleaning. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe haven't spoken in 2 months because of this. She firmly believes AITA. So, AITA for not allowing my sister to host my nephew's birthday party at my house? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is \"in the wrong\" for not allowing their sister to host a birthday party at their house. The sister has 14 kids, which is a lot, and the author's house is their dream home. They declined the request because of the potential chaos, liability from the pool, and the fact that the sister's kids aren't well-behaved. The sister called them selfish and they haven't spoken in two months.\n\nFirst, the user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. I need to evaluate the situation objectively. The key points are:\n\n1. The sister has 14 kids, which is a significant number. Managing that many children in someone else's house, especially with a pool, could be risky. The author mentions the pool as a liability, which is a valid safety concern. Childproofing a house for that many kids isn't easy, and the risk of accidents is real.\n\n2. The sister's kids aren't well-behaved except for the oldest three. That adds to the potential for damage or disruption. The author's house is a personal space, and they might not want strangers (even family) kids running around causing chaos.\n\n3. The sister previously hosted big gatherings (like Christmas) at her home for years. The user mentions that they contribute to those events by bringing dessert and others help with cooking and cleaning. But when it comes to hosting a birthday at the author's house, the situation is different because it's their personal space and they have specific concerns.\n\n4. The sister is upset and called the author names, which is harsh. However, the author's reasons seem practical and safety-oriented. The sister might feel slighted, but the author has the right to set boundaries for their home.\n\n5. The distance is a factor too\u20145 hours away. The sister hasn't visited the author's house before, which might mean they aren't familiar with the space or the author's rules. The author prefers to visit the sister's place, which makes sense given the travel distance and the sister's need for a central location for her large family.\n\nConsidering all these points, the author's decision is understandable. They are protecting their property and safety. The sister's reaction is extreme, but the author isn't obligated to host such a large event with potential risks. The fact that they have a history of contributing to the sister's events shows they aren't uncooperative in general. The key here is the balance between family obligations and personal boundaries. The author's home is their sanctuary, and they have the right to decide who uses it and under what conditions. The sister's request was unreasonable given the circumstances, so the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
