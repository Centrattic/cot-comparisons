It's as chaotic and nightmarish as you can imagine. Usually she never asks to come over to my place because it's a nightmare to travel with 14 kids to come visit their auntie who lives 5 hours away. If we're having a gathering it's always me who is travelling to their place. I don't really mind. We only meet a few times a year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few years ago I bought my dream house with my husband. My sister asked to host my nephew's 3rd birthday party at my house. She wants to use the big backyard, grill and pool at my home. There are roughly 50 people who are invited. I said no and she called me selfish and an asshole. Her kids have never been to my house and I prefer it that way. Her kids are not very well behaved except for the oldest three and my house is not child-poof. The pool seems like a huge liability. I don't want children drowning on my property. It just seems like a recipe for disaster. She brought up the fact that she hosted Christmas at her house for the past 10+ years at her house, but I don't think it's fair to compare this to that. We meet at her house instead of our parents because she has 14 kids to herd around so it's really more out of convenience to her. Every year for the past 10+ years I buy dessert enough to feed 25 people so I've done my part with the food arrangements. That's 8 apple pies or 3 cakes worth of dessert. My parents also stay over to help prepare and cook and we all contribute to the washing and cleaning. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe haven't spoken in 2 months because of this. She firmly believes AITA. So, AITA for not allowing my sister to host my nephew's birthday party at my house? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person in the story is wrong for not letting their sister host the birthday party at their house. Let me break down the details.\n\nFirst, the sister has 14 kids. That's a lot. The author mentions that their sister never asks to come over to their place because it's a 5-hour drive. The author usually visits the sister's place instead. They meet a few times a year. So the sister isn't exactly a regular guest at the author's home.\n\nThen, the sister asked to host a birthday party at the author's house for the nephew. The author says no, and the sister gets upset, calling them selfish. The author's reasons are: the sister's kids are not well-behaved except for the oldest three, the house isn't child-proof, the pool is a liability, and they don't want children drowning on their property. The sister had hosted Christmas for 10+ years, but the author thinks it's not the same. The author also points out they contribute by bringing dessert and others help with cooking and cleaning.\n\nSo, the key factors here are the safety concerns and the sister's history of not bringing her kids to the author's house. The author bought their dream house and wants to maintain it without the chaos of 14 kids. The sister's request might seem like a one-time thing, but the author has valid safety reasons. The sister's argument about past Christmas events doesn't account for the different scale of a birthday party with 50 people. Also, the author has contributed to family gatherings in other ways, so maybe they're not being selfish.\n\nBut wait, could the author have said yes but with conditions? Maybe setting up the pool as a closed area or having a lifeguard. However, the author's main concern is liability. If there's an accident, they could be held responsible. That's a legitimate worry. Also, the sister didn't ask before, so maybe this is a new request that's out of the blue. The sister's kids haven't been to the author's house, so the author isn't used to handling their behavior there.\n\nThe sister's reaction seems harsh. Calling someone an asshole over this might be overreacting, especially if the author had valid safety concerns. The author's reasons seem more about safety and maintaining their home rather than just self-interest. Plus, the sister's Christmas gatherings might have been managed differently because they were in her own home where she could control the environment more.\n\nSo, balancing both sides: the author has a right to protect their property and safety, and the sister's request was for a potentially high-risk situation. The author isn't in the wrong here. The sister might need to respect the author's boundaries, especially considering the unique circumstances. Therefore, the answer should be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
