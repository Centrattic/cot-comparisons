It's as chaotic and nightmarish as you can imagine. Usually she never asks to come over to my place because it's a nightmare to travel with 14 kids to come visit their auntie who lives 5 hours away. If we're having a gathering it's always me who is travelling to their place. I don't really mind. We only meet a few times a year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few years ago I bought my dream house with my husband. My sister asked to host my nephew's 3rd birthday party at my house. She wants to use the big backyard, grill and pool at my home. There are roughly 50 people who are invited. I said no and she called me selfish and an asshole. Her kids have never been to my house and I prefer it that way. Her kids are not very well behaved except for the oldest three and my house is not child-poof. The pool seems like a huge liability. I don't want children drowning on my property. It just seems like a recipe for disaster. She brought up the fact that she hosted Christmas at her house for the past 10+ years at her house, but I don't think it's fair to compare this to that. We meet at her house instead of our parents because she has 14 kids to herd around so it's really more out of convenience to her. Every year for the past 10+ years I buy dessert enough to feed 25 people so I've done my part with the food arrangements. That's 8 apple pies or 3 cakes worth of dessert. My parents also stay over to help prepare and cook and we all contribute to the washing and cleaning. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe haven't spoken in 2 months because of this. She firmly believes AITA. So, AITA for not allowing my sister to host my nephew's birthday party at my house? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not letting their sister host a party at their house. First, I need to look at the details.\n\nThe sister has 14 kids, which is a lot. The author bought their dream house and doesn't want the chaos of 14 kids plus 50 guests coming to their home. The main concerns are safety, especially with the pool, and the mess. The sister felt hurt because the author said no, and now there's been a two-month silence.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, they have valid reasons. Their house isn't child-proof, and the pool is a liability. Hosting such a large event with so many kids could be dangerous. Plus, they mention that traveling to the sister's house is easier for them since it's 5 hours away. Also, they've contributed to previous events, like providing desserts for years, so they're not being stingy.\n\nThe sister's argument is that she's hosted Christmas for 10+ years at her house, but the author isn't comparing apples to apples. Hosting a birthday party with 50 people and 14 kids is different from a Christmas gathering. The author's boundaries are about their own comfort and safety, which is understandable.\n\nThe sister called the author names, which is harsh, but the author's refusal is based on real concerns. It's important to respect someone's space, especially when there are safety issues involved. The author isn't obligated to host events that make them uncomfortable or risky. The silence between them might be a bigger issue, but the initial refusal seems justified.\n\nSo, considering everything, the author isn't in the wrong. Their decision is based on practical and safety reasons, not just selfishness. The sister might need to respect that boundary even if it's hard for her.\n"
