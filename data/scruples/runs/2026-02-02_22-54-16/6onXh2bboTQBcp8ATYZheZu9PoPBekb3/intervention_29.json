It's as chaotic and nightmarish as you can imagine. Usually she never asks to come over to my place because it's a nightmare to travel with 14 kids to come visit their auntie who lives 5 hours away. If we're having a gathering it's always me who is travelling to their place. I don't really mind. We only meet a few times a year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few years ago I bought my dream house with my husband. My sister asked to host my nephew's 3rd birthday party at my house. She wants to use the big backyard, grill and pool at my home. There are roughly 50 people who are invited. I said no and she called me selfish and an asshole. Her kids have never been to my house and I prefer it that way. Her kids are not very well behaved except for the oldest three and my house is not child-poof. The pool seems like a huge liability. I don't want children drowning on my property. It just seems like a recipe for disaster. She brought up the fact that she hosted Christmas at her house for the past 10+ years at her house, but I don't think it's fair to compare this to that. We meet at her house instead of our parents because she has 14 kids to herd around so it's really more out of convenience to her. Every year for the past 10+ years I buy dessert enough to feed 25 people so I've done my part with the food arrangements. That's 8 apple pies or 3 cakes worth of dessert. My parents also stay over to help prepare and cook and we all contribute to the washing and cleaning. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe haven't spoken in 2 months because of this. She firmly believes AITA. So, AITA for not allowing my sister to host my nephew's birthday party at my house? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person in the AITA scenario is in the wrong for not letting their sister host a birthday party at their house. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The sister has 14 kids, which the author finds chaotic. They usually visit their sister's place because traveling with all the kids is a hassle. Now, the sister wants to host a 3rd birthday party at the author's house, with 50 people invited. The author says no, mainly because their house isn't child-proof and the pool is a liability. They also mention that the sister's kids aren't well-behaved except for the oldest three. The sister is upset, calls the author selfish, and they haven't spoken in two months.\n\nThe author argues that their house isn't suitable, especially with the pool, and they don't want the responsibility. The sister brings up hosting Christmas for 10+ years, but the author points out that setup is different because of the number of kids and the convenience. The author has contributed to food and helped with cleaning before.\n\nNow, to decide if the author is in the wrong. The key factors here are the author's reasons for saying no. They have valid concerns about safety (child-proofing, pool liability) and the chaos of 14 kids plus 50 guests. The sister's request is a major event that could pose risks to the author's property and safety. The sister's kids aren't well-behaved, which adds to the concern. The author has a right to set boundaries, especially regarding their own home's safety. The sister's reaction seems harsh, calling the author names, which might indicate she's being defensive. The author isn't refusing all the time; they've hosted other events in the past with their own contributions, but this particular event is too much. \n\nHowever, the sister might feel it's a tradition and that the author is being selfish. But the author's reasons are legitimate. They bought the house as their dream home, so they have the right to protect it. The fact that the sister's kids have never been to the house before and the author prefers it that way suggests the author has boundaries they're trying to maintain. The sister's argument about previous Christmas events isn't directly comparable because the scale and nature of the events are different. The author isn't refusing all help but is declining based on specific, valid concerns.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author's decision seems reasonable. They're prioritizing safety and their own comfort, which is their right. The sister's reaction is perhaps disproportionate, but the author isn't in the wrong for setting these boundaries.\n"
