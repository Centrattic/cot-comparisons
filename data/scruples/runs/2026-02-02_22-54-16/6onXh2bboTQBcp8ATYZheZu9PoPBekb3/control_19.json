It's as chaotic and nightmarish as you can imagine. Usually she never asks to come over to my place because it's a nightmare to travel with 14 kids to come visit their auntie who lives 5 hours away. If we're having a gathering it's always me who is travelling to their place. I don't really mind. We only meet a few times a year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few years ago I bought my dream house with my husband. My sister asked to host my nephew's 3rd birthday party at my house. She wants to use the big backyard, grill and pool at my home. There are roughly 50 people who are invited. I said no and she called me selfish and an asshole. Her kids have never been to my house and I prefer it that way. Her kids are not very well behaved except for the oldest three and my house is not child-poof. The pool seems like a huge liability. I don't want children drowning on my property. It just seems like a recipe for disaster. She brought up the fact that she hosted Christmas at her house for the past 10+ years at her house, but I don't think it's fair to compare this to that. We meet at her house instead of our parents because she has 14 kids to herd around so it's really more out of convenience to her. Every year for the past 10+ years I buy dessert enough to feed 25 people so I've done my part with the food arrangements. That's 8 apple pies or 3 cakes worth of dessert. My parents also stay over to help prepare and cook and we all contribute to the washing and cleaning. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe haven't spoken in 2 months because of this. She firmly believes AITA. So, AITA for not allowing my sister to host my nephew's birthday party at my house? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the given situation is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). I need to figure out the answer based on the details provided.\n\nFirst, the person is an aunt with a sister who has 14 kids. The sister wanted to host a birthday party at the aunt's house, but the aunt refused. The sister is upset and called her selfish and an asshole, leading to a two-month silence. The aunt's reasons include the chaos of 14 kids, the house not being \"child-proof,\" liability concerns with the pool, and the fact that her sister's kids are mostly not well-behaved except the oldest three. The sister argues that she's hosted Christmas there for 10 years, but the aunt points out that they usually meet at the sister's house because of the convenience for her large family. The aunt also mentions contributing to food and helping with cleaning in past events.\n\nSo, the key points here are the number of children, the distance (5 hours away), the aunt's new house which isn't set up for such a large group, and the liability issues. The sister is upset because she feels the aunt is being selfish, but the aunt is concerned about safety and the stress of hosting such a big event. \n\nI think the aunt isn't in the wrong because she has valid reasons. Hosting 14 kids plus 50 guests is a huge responsibility, especially for someone who isn't used to it. The pool liability is a real concern. The sister's argument about past Christmas events might not be relevant because that was a different scenario. Also, the aunt has been accommodating by traveling to their place and contributing in other ways. The sister should respect the aunt's boundaries regarding her home. So the answer is B.\n"
