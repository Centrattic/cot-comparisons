It's as chaotic and nightmarish as you can imagine. Usually she never asks to come over to my place because it's a nightmare to travel with 14 kids to come visit their auntie who lives 5 hours away. If we're having a gathering it's always me who is travelling to their place. I don't really mind. We only meet a few times a year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few years ago I bought my dream house with my husband. My sister asked to host my nephew's 3rd birthday party at my house. She wants to use the big backyard, grill and pool at my home. There are roughly 50 people who are invited. I said no and she called me selfish and an asshole. Her kids have never been to my house and I prefer it that way. Her kids are not very well behaved except for the oldest three and my house is not child-poof. The pool seems like a huge liability. I don't want children drowning on my property. It just seems like a recipe for disaster. She brought up the fact that she hosted Christmas at her house for the past 10+ years at her house, but I don't think it's fair to compare this to that. We meet at her house instead of our parents because she has 14 kids to herd around so it's really more out of convenience to her. Every year for the past 10+ years I buy dessert enough to feed 25 people so I've done my part with the food arrangements. That's 8 apple pies or 3 cakes worth of dessert. My parents also stay over to help prepare and cook and we all contribute to the washing and cleaning. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe haven't spoken in 2 months because of this. She firmly believes AITA. So, AITA for not allowing my sister to host my nephew's birthday party at my house? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for not allowing their sister to host a birthday party at their house. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author has a sister with 14 kids, which they describe as chaotic. The sister wanted to host a 3rd birthday party with 50 people at the author's house, using the backyard, grill, and pool. The author declined, citing safety concerns (like the pool being a liability) and discomfort with having the sister's kids over, as they're not well-behaved except the oldest three. The sister got upset, called the author selfish, and they haven't spoken in two months.\n\nThe author mentions that in the past, they've helped out with Christmas gatherings at the sister's house, buying a lot of desserts and helping with the work. But this time, it's different because of the specific risks involved. The key points here are the size of the event, the safety concerns, and the author's personal boundaries.\n\nNow, considering if the author is wrong. The sister's perspective is that she's hosted big events before, and the author is refusing this time. But the author has valid reasons: the pool is a danger, their house isn't child-proof, and managing 50 people with 14 kids could be overwhelming. The author also points out that the sister's kids have never been to their house before, which might be a factor in their hesitation. \n\nThe sister's reaction seems harsh, especially calling the author an asshole. The author isn't obligated to host just because the sister has hosted before. The main question is whether the author's refusal is reasonable given the circumstances. Since they provided specific safety concerns and the event's scale, it seems like a reasonable decision. The sister's comparing past events isn't necessarily a fair comparison because each situation is different. \n\nAlso, the author mentions that the sister's kids aren't well-behaved, which adds to the liability. The author's home isn't set up to handle that many children, so it's a valid concern. The sister might feel hurt, but the author's priority is their own home's safety and comfort. The fact that they've contributed to past events (like Christmas) doesn't obligate them to host this particular event, especially with the unique risks involved.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's reasons are justified, and their decision to decline isn't unreasonable. The sister's reaction is probably more about feeling slighted rather than the author being in the wrong. Therefore, the answer should be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
