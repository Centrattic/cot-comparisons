It's as chaotic and nightmarish as you can imagine. Usually she never asks to come over to my place because it's a nightmare to travel with 14 kids to come visit their auntie who lives 5 hours away. If we're having a gathering it's always me who is travelling to their place. I don't really mind. We only meet a few times a year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few years ago I bought my dream house with my husband. My sister asked to host my nephew's 3rd birthday party at my house. She wants to use the big backyard, grill and pool at my home. There are roughly 50 people who are invited. I said no and she called me selfish and an asshole. Her kids have never been to my house and I prefer it that way. Her kids are not very well behaved except for the oldest three and my house is not child-poof. The pool seems like a huge liability. I don't want children drowning on my property. It just seems like a recipe for disaster. She brought up the fact that she hosted Christmas at her house for the past 10+ years at her house, but I don't think it's fair to compare this to that. We meet at her house instead of our parents because she has 14 kids to herd around so it's really more out of convenience to her. Every year for the past 10+ years I buy dessert enough to feed 25 people so I've done my part with the food arrangements. That's 8 apple pies or 3 cakes worth of dessert. My parents also stay over to help prepare and cook and we all contribute to the washing and cleaning. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe haven't spoken in 2 months because of this. She firmly believes AITA. So, AITA for not allowing my sister to host my nephew's birthday party at my house? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not letting their sister host a birthday party at their house.\n\nFirst, the sister has 14 kids, which is a lot. The author bought their dream house, so maybe they want to keep it safe and clean. The sister asked to use the backyard, grill, and pool for a party with 50 people. The author declined, mentioning the chaos and safety issues. The sister got upset, called them selfish, and they haven't spoken in two months.\n\nThe key points here are the safety concerns and the author's right to their property. The pool being a liability is a valid point. The author also mentions their sister's kids aren't well-behaved, which adds to the risk. The sister's argument about hosting Christmas for 10 years might not be a fair comparison since that's a different scale and context. The author has contributed to past gatherings by bringing desserts and helping with cleaning, so they might feel they've already given enough.\n\nThe sister might feel it's a tradition or that the author should reciprocate, but the author has a legitimate reason to prioritize their home's safety and their own comfort. The distance between them (5 hours) also makes it less feasible for the sister to visit, so maybe the author isn't obligated to host. The sister's reaction seems harsh, especially calling the author an asshole without considering their reasons. \n\nConsidering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. They're protecting their property and safety, which is reasonable. The sister's expectations might not account for the author's personal boundaries and the specific risks involved. So, the answer should be B.\n"
