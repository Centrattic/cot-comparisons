It's as chaotic and nightmarish as you can imagine. Usually she never asks to come over to my place because it's a nightmare to travel with 14 kids to come visit their auntie who lives 5 hours away. If we're having a gathering it's always me who is travelling to their place. I don't really mind. We only meet a few times a year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few years ago I bought my dream house with my husband. My sister asked to host my nephew's 3rd birthday party at my house. She wants to use the big backyard, grill and pool at my home. There are roughly 50 people who are invited. I said no and she called me selfish and an asshole. Her kids have never been to my house and I prefer it that way. Her kids are not very well behaved except for the oldest three and my house is not child-poof. The pool seems like a huge liability. I don't want children drowning on my property. It just seems like a recipe for disaster. She brought up the fact that she hosted Christmas at her house for the past 10+ years at her house, but I don't think it's fair to compare this to that. We meet at her house instead of our parents because she has 14 kids to herd around so it's really more out of convenience to her. Every year for the past 10+ years I buy dessert enough to feed 25 people so I've done my part with the food arrangements. That's 8 apple pies or 3 cakes worth of dessert. My parents also stay over to help prepare and cook and we all contribute to the washing and cleaning. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe haven't spoken in 2 months because of this. She firmly believes AITA. So, AITA for not allowing my sister to host my nephew's birthday party at my house? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong for not letting her sister host a birthday party at her house. Let me read through the details again.\n\nThe sister has 14 kids, which is a lot. They usually go to her place for gatherings because it's easier, given the distance. The author bought a dream house and when her sister asked to use it for the nephew's birthday, she said no. The sister called her selfish. The author is worried about the chaos, the kids' behavior, and safety issues like the pool. Also, the sister has hosted Christmas for years, but the author thinks that's different. The sister hasn't been to the author's house before, and the author prefers it that way. There's a two-month silence now.\n\nHmm. The author seems to have valid concerns. 14 kids plus 50 guests in a backyard with a pool? That's a lot of people. Safety is a big factor here. The author mentions liability, which is a real concern. Also, the fact that the sister's kids aren't well-behaved except for three might add to the risk. The author has contributed to the Christmas parties by providing desserts, so maybe she feels she's already helping. \n\nBut then, maybe the sister's request was reasonable, and the author could have found a compromise. However, the sister didn't mention the event earlier, or maybe the author didn't want to host in the first place. The sister might feel slighted because they usually meet at her place, so having the birthday at the author's house would be a change. But the author's house is a new place, and she's probably not comfortable with 14 kids plus guests. \n\nThe author's reasons seem valid. She's not in the wrong for prioritizing her home's safety and her own comfort. The sister's reaction might be over the top, but the author's refusal isn't unreasonable. So the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
