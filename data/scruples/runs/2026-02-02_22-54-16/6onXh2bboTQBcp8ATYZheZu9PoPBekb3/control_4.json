It's as chaotic and nightmarish as you can imagine. Usually she never asks to come over to my place because it's a nightmare to travel with 14 kids to come visit their auntie who lives 5 hours away. If we're having a gathering it's always me who is travelling to their place. I don't really mind. We only meet a few times a year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few years ago I bought my dream house with my husband. My sister asked to host my nephew's 3rd birthday party at my house. She wants to use the big backyard, grill and pool at my home. There are roughly 50 people who are invited. I said no and she called me selfish and an asshole. Her kids have never been to my house and I prefer it that way. Her kids are not very well behaved except for the oldest three and my house is not child-poof. The pool seems like a huge liability. I don't want children drowning on my property. It just seems like a recipe for disaster. She brought up the fact that she hosted Christmas at her house for the past 10+ years at her house, but I don't think it's fair to compare this to that. We meet at her house instead of our parents because she has 14 kids to herd around so it's really more out of convenience to her. Every year for the past 10+ years I buy dessert enough to feed 25 people so I've done my part with the food arrangements. That's 8 apple pies or 3 cakes worth of dessert. My parents also stay over to help prepare and cook and we all contribute to the washing and cleaning. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe haven't spoken in 2 months because of this. She firmly believes AITA. So, AITA for not allowing my sister to host my nephew's birthday party at my house? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for not letting their sister host a birthday party at their house.\n\nFirst, I need to look at both sides. The author has a dream house and is concerned about liability because their sister has 14 kids, which they find chaotic. The sister wanted to use the backyard, grill, and pool for a party with 50 people. The author said no, and now there's a two-month silence.\n\nThe sister is upset and called the author selfish. The author's reasoning includes safety concerns (pool liability, not child-proof), previous experience with the sister's kids being unruly (except the oldest three), and the fact that their house isn't set up for handling such a large group. They also mention that they usually go to the sister's house for gatherings, so maybe this isn't an unfair request? But the sister had hosted Christmas for 10 years, but the author points out that the comparison isn't fair because the reasons for hosting are different.\n\nThe sister's argument might be that she's relying on her sister for hosting, but the author has valid concerns about safety and the stress of having 14 kids plus 50 guests. The author has contributed to previous events by bringing dessert and helping with cleaning, so maybe they feel they've already given enough.\n\nI need to consider if the author's refusal was reasonable. The pool is a safety issue, and the number of kids could make supervision difficult. The author isn't obligated to host, especially if they have clear reasons. The sister might feel hurt, but the author's primary responsibility is to their own home and family's safety. The sister's kids have never been to the house, so maybe the author isn't being selfish but protecting their property and peace of mind. The sister might not have considered the author's perspective, leading to the conflict. So, the author isn't in the wrong here.\n"
