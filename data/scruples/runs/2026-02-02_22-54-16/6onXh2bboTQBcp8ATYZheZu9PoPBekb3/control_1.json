It's as chaotic and nightmarish as you can imagine. Usually she never asks to come over to my place because it's a nightmare to travel with 14 kids to come visit their auntie who lives 5 hours away. If we're having a gathering it's always me who is travelling to their place. I don't really mind. We only meet a few times a year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few years ago I bought my dream house with my husband. My sister asked to host my nephew's 3rd birthday party at my house. She wants to use the big backyard, grill and pool at my home. There are roughly 50 people who are invited. I said no and she called me selfish and an asshole. Her kids have never been to my house and I prefer it that way. Her kids are not very well behaved except for the oldest three and my house is not child-poof. The pool seems like a huge liability. I don't want children drowning on my property. It just seems like a recipe for disaster. She brought up the fact that she hosted Christmas at her house for the past 10+ years at her house, but I don't think it's fair to compare this to that. We meet at her house instead of our parents because she has 14 kids to herd around so it's really more out of convenience to her. Every year for the past 10+ years I buy dessert enough to feed 25 people so I've done my part with the food arrangements. That's 8 apple pies or 3 cakes worth of dessert. My parents also stay over to help prepare and cook and we all contribute to the washing and cleaning. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe haven't spoken in 2 months because of this. She firmly believes AITA. So, AITA for not allowing my sister to host my nephew's birthday party at my house? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for not allowing their sister to host a birthday party at their house. The sister has 14 kids, and the author bought a dream house. The sister wanted to use the backyard, grill, and pool for the party, but the author said no. The sister called them selfish and they haven't spoken in two months.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The sister has a lot of kids, which makes traveling to the author's house difficult. The author prefers not having the sister's kids at their house because of safety concerns, especially with the pool. The sister had hosted Christmas at her house for years, but this is different because of the pool and the number of children. The author mentions contributing food and helping with clean-up, so they feel they've done their part.\n\nIs the author wrong? Well, they have the right to set boundaries about their personal property. Safety is a big factor here\u201414 kids plus 50 guests in a backyard with a pool could be dangerous. The sister might feel slighted, but the author isn't obligated to let others use their home for potentially risky events. The sister's reaction might be harsh, but the author's decision is about their own comfort and safety. The fact that they haven't spoken in two months suggests the sister is still upset, but the author's stance seems reasonable given the circumstances. So, the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
