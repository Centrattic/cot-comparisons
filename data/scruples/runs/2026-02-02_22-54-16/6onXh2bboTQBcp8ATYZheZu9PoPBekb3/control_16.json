It's as chaotic and nightmarish as you can imagine. Usually she never asks to come over to my place because it's a nightmare to travel with 14 kids to come visit their auntie who lives 5 hours away. If we're having a gathering it's always me who is travelling to their place. I don't really mind. We only meet a few times a year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few years ago I bought my dream house with my husband. My sister asked to host my nephew's 3rd birthday party at my house. She wants to use the big backyard, grill and pool at my home. There are roughly 50 people who are invited. I said no and she called me selfish and an asshole. Her kids have never been to my house and I prefer it that way. Her kids are not very well behaved except for the oldest three and my house is not child-poof. The pool seems like a huge liability. I don't want children drowning on my property. It just seems like a recipe for disaster. She brought up the fact that she hosted Christmas at her house for the past 10+ years at her house, but I don't think it's fair to compare this to that. We meet at her house instead of our parents because she has 14 kids to herd around so it's really more out of convenience to her. Every year for the past 10+ years I buy dessert enough to feed 25 people so I've done my part with the food arrangements. That's 8 apple pies or 3 cakes worth of dessert. My parents also stay over to help prepare and cook and we all contribute to the washing and cleaning. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe haven't spoken in 2 months because of this. She firmly believes AITA. So, AITA for not allowing my sister to host my nephew's birthday party at my house? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is in the wrong for not allowing their sister to host a birthday party at their house.\n\nFirst, the sister has 14 kids, which is a lot. The author has a dream house and is concerned about safety, especially with the pool and the number of kids. The sister wanted to use the big backyard, grill, and pool for a party with 50 people. The author refused and now the sister is upset, calling them selfish. They haven't spoken in two months.\n\nI need to consider both sides. The author's reasons are about safety and liability. Their house isn't child-proof, and the pool could be dangerous. Also, they don't want their kids to be around the 14 kids, maybe because of behavior issues. The sister had hosted Christmas for 10 years, but the author points out that those were different circumstances\u2014maybe the parents stayed over and helped, but a birthday party with 50 people is a different scale.\n\nThe sister might feel it's unfair because they usually go to her place, so she expected them to make an exception. But the author has a right to their own home's safety and comfort. The main points here are about personal boundaries, safety concerns, and liability. The author is setting a boundary to protect their property and possibly their own children. The sister's reaction seems harsh, especially since the author explained their reasons. Also, the sister's claim about hosting Christmas might not be a valid comparison because the situations are different in terms of number of attendees and setup.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. They made a reasonable decision based on their own circumstances and safety. The sister's calling them names and cutting off communication might be her overreacting. Therefore, the answer should be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
