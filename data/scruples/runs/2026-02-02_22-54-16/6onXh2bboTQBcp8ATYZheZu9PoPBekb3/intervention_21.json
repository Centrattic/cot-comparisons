It's as chaotic and nightmarish as you can imagine. Usually she never asks to come over to my place because it's a nightmare to travel with 14 kids to come visit their auntie who lives 5 hours away. If we're having a gathering it's always me who is travelling to their place. I don't really mind. We only meet a few times a year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few years ago I bought my dream house with my husband. My sister asked to host my nephew's 3rd birthday party at my house. She wants to use the big backyard, grill and pool at my home. There are roughly 50 people who are invited. I said no and she called me selfish and an asshole. Her kids have never been to my house and I prefer it that way. Her kids are not very well behaved except for the oldest three and my house is not child-poof. The pool seems like a huge liability. I don't want children drowning on my property. It just seems like a recipe for disaster. She brought up the fact that she hosted Christmas at her house for the past 10+ years at her house, but I don't think it's fair to compare this to that. We meet at her house instead of our parents because she has 14 kids to herd around so it's really more out of convenience to her. Every year for the past 10+ years I buy dessert enough to feed 25 people so I've done my part with the food arrangements. That's 8 apple pies or 3 cakes worth of dessert. My parents also stay over to help prepare and cook and we all contribute to the washing and cleaning. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe haven't spoken in 2 months because of this. She firmly believes AITA. So, AITA for not allowing my sister to host my nephew's birthday party at my house? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for not allowing their sister to host a birthday party at their house. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author has a sister with 14 kids. The sister usually doesn't ask to come to the author's place because it's a 5-hour trip. The author is okay with traveling to their sister's house for gatherings, which makes sense. Now, the sister wants to host a 3rd birthday party at the author's house with 50 people. The author says no, and the sister is upset, calling them selfish. The author's reasons are that the house isn't child-proof, the pool is a liability, and they don't want kids drowning there. Also, the sister's kids aren't well-behaved except the oldest three. They haven't spoken in two months, and the sister thinks the author is the one at fault.\n\nI need to determine if the author is in the wrong. The user thinks the author isn't, but wants my perspective. Let's see. The key points here are the author's reasons for declining. The main ones are the potential safety issues (pool liability, lack of child-proofing), and the general chaos of 14 kids plus 50 guests. The sister has hosted Christmas for years, but the author is making a distinction here between a holiday gathering and a birthday party that might be more unruly. Also, the author mentions contributing to food in the past, so they have a history of helping, but this is a different kind of request.\n\nThe author's house is their dream home, which they might have just bought. Hosting such a large party with many children, especially if they're not well-behaved, could be stressful and risky. The pool is a valid safety concern. The sister's approach might be considering the author's home as a resource they can use, but the author has the right to set boundaries. The sister's reaction of calling them an asshole and the 2-month silence might be her overreacting, but the author's refusal is based on legitimate concerns. \n\nIn terms of fairness, the sister has always hosted the gatherings at her place, which makes sense given the logistics of 14 kids. The author might feel that this time was an exception, but the safety and comfort of their own home are important. The sister might not be considering the author's perspective, expecting them to accommodate without understanding the risks involved. \n\nSo, the author's reasons are about safety and the impracticality of hosting such a large group with many young children. The sister's insistence could be seen as inconsiderate of the author's boundaries and the specific challenges involved. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong here. The answer should be B.\n"
