It's as chaotic and nightmarish as you can imagine. Usually she never asks to come over to my place because it's a nightmare to travel with 14 kids to come visit their auntie who lives 5 hours away. If we're having a gathering it's always me who is travelling to their place. I don't really mind. We only meet a few times a year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few years ago I bought my dream house with my husband. My sister asked to host my nephew's 3rd birthday party at my house. She wants to use the big backyard, grill and pool at my home. There are roughly 50 people who are invited. I said no and she called me selfish and an asshole. Her kids have never been to my house and I prefer it that way. Her kids are not very well behaved except for the oldest three and my house is not child-poof. The pool seems like a huge liability. I don't want children drowning on my property. It just seems like a recipe for disaster. She brought up the fact that she hosted Christmas at her house for the past 10+ years at her house, but I don't think it's fair to compare this to that. We meet at her house instead of our parents because she has 14 kids to herd around so it's really more out of convenience to her. Every year for the past 10+ years I buy dessert enough to feed 25 people so I've done my part with the food arrangements. That's 8 apple pies or 3 cakes worth of dessert. My parents also stay over to help prepare and cook and we all contribute to the washing and cleaning. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe haven't spoken in 2 months because of this. She firmly believes AITA. So, AITA for not allowing my sister to host my nephew's birthday party at my house? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for not letting their sister host a birthday party at their house. The sister has 14 kids, and the author bought a dream house, which they want to keep safe. They refused because of the chaos and safety concerns like the pool being a liability.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The sister asked to host a 50-person party with all her kids. The author's house isn't child-proof, and they're worried about possible accidents. They also mention that they've been meeting at the sister's house for other events, so maybe this is a recurring thing. The sister felt hurt and called the author selfish, but the author has valid safety and privacy reasons.\n\nI should think about the concept of boundaries here. It's the author's house, and they have the right to set limits. The sister's kids are numerous and not well-behaved except for a few. Hosting such a large group, especially with young children, in a house that's not set up for that could be risky. The author isn't being inconsiderate by saying no; they're protecting their property and ensuring safety.\n\nThe sister's reaction of not speaking for two months might be excessive, but the author isn't in the wrong for standing their ground. The author has contributed in other ways, like bringing desserts and helping with other events, so they've already given their part. The sister's argument about past Christmas gatherings doesn't necessarily equate to this situation being fair. Each event is different in scale and risk.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that the sister's kids haven't been to their house, which might be a separate issue, but that's their choice. It's reasonable to say no to hosting when it's not convenient or safe. The main points here are about personal boundaries, safety, and the right to manage one's own property as the owner. So, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
