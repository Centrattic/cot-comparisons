It's as chaotic and nightmarish as you can imagine. Usually she never asks to come over to my place because it's a nightmare to travel with 14 kids to come visit their auntie who lives 5 hours away. If we're having a gathering it's always me who is travelling to their place. I don't really mind. We only meet a few times a year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few years ago I bought my dream house with my husband. My sister asked to host my nephew's 3rd birthday party at my house. She wants to use the big backyard, grill and pool at my home. There are roughly 50 people who are invited. I said no and she called me selfish and an asshole. Her kids have never been to my house and I prefer it that way. Her kids are not very well behaved except for the oldest three and my house is not child-poof. The pool seems like a huge liability. I don't want children drowning on my property. It just seems like a recipe for disaster. She brought up the fact that she hosted Christmas at her house for the past 10+ years at her house, but I don't think it's fair to compare this to that. We meet at her house instead of our parents because she has 14 kids to herd around so it's really more out of convenience to her. Every year for the past 10+ years I buy dessert enough to feed 25 people so I've done my part with the food arrangements. That's 8 apple pies or 3 cakes worth of dessert. My parents also stay over to help prepare and cook and we all contribute to the washing and cleaning. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe haven't spoken in 2 months because of this. She firmly believes AITA. So, AITA for not allowing my sister to host my nephew's birthday party at my house? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for not letting her sister host a birthday party at her house. The sister has 14 kids, which is a lot, and the author is concerned about safety and chaos. \n\nFirst, the sister asked to use the backyard, grill, and pool for a party with 50 people. The author refused, and the sister is upset, leading to a 2-month silence. The author mentions that her house isn't child-proof and the pool is a liability. She also points out that in the past, family gatherings have been at the sister's house, and she's contributed with desserts and help.\n\nThe key points here are the sister's request versus the author's reasons. The author has valid concerns about safety, especially with a pool and many children. It's understandable that she doesn't want her property to be a liability. Plus, the sister's kids haven't even been to the house before, so maybe the author is worried about their behavior in a new environment. \n\nThe sister's argument about hosting Christmas for 10 years might not be a fair comparison because the scale (50 people vs. annual Christmas gatherings) and the specific risks might differ. The author has contributed in other ways, so not hosting the party doesn't mean she's being selfish. She's setting boundaries for her own home's safety and comfort. \n\nOn the flip side, the sister might feel slighted, especially if she thinks the author is prioritizing convenience or being controlling. But given the circumstances, the author's reasons seem legitimate. She's not obligated to host, especially with the potential risks involved. \n\nSo, based on this, I think the author isn't in the wrong. Her decision is based on valid safety concerns and personal boundaries. The sister's reaction is harsh, but the author's stance is reasonable.\n"
