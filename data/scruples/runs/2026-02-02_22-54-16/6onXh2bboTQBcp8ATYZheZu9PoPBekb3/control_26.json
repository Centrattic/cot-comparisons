It's as chaotic and nightmarish as you can imagine. Usually she never asks to come over to my place because it's a nightmare to travel with 14 kids to come visit their auntie who lives 5 hours away. If we're having a gathering it's always me who is travelling to their place. I don't really mind. We only meet a few times a year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few years ago I bought my dream house with my husband. My sister asked to host my nephew's 3rd birthday party at my house. She wants to use the big backyard, grill and pool at my home. There are roughly 50 people who are invited. I said no and she called me selfish and an asshole. Her kids have never been to my house and I prefer it that way. Her kids are not very well behaved except for the oldest three and my house is not child-poof. The pool seems like a huge liability. I don't want children drowning on my property. It just seems like a recipe for disaster. She brought up the fact that she hosted Christmas at her house for the past 10+ years at her house, but I don't think it's fair to compare this to that. We meet at her house instead of our parents because she has 14 kids to herd around so it's really more out of convenience to her. Every year for the past 10+ years I buy dessert enough to feed 25 people so I've done my part with the food arrangements. That's 8 apple pies or 3 cakes worth of dessert. My parents also stay over to help prepare and cook and we all contribute to the washing and cleaning. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe haven't spoken in 2 months because of this. She firmly believes AITA. So, AITA for not allowing my sister to host my nephew's birthday party at my house? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a sister not allowing her sister to host a birthday party at her house. Let me break down the details.\n\nFirst, the author's sister has 14 kids. That's a lot, and the author mentions that traveling there is a nightmare. They usually only meet a few times a year, with the author traveling to the sister's place. Now, the sister wants to host a birthday party at the author's house with 50 people. The author is worried about the chaos, the kids not being well-behaved, and the safety issues with the pool.\n\nThe sister is upset, called the author selfish and an asshole. The author argues that their house isn't child-proof, and the pool is a liability. They also mention that the sister had hosted Christmas for 10+ years, but the author points out it's different because of the kids. The author also contributes food each year, so they don't think they owe more.\n\nNow, considering all this, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. The sister's request is for a party at the author's home, which is a personal space. The author has valid concerns about the number of kids, their behavior, and safety. The sister's reaction seems harsh, especially since the author explained their reasons. The fact that the author doesn't want her kids at their house even under normal circumstances adds to the justification. Also, the sister's history of hosting large gatherings doesn't necessarily make this a fair comparison because the author's house might not be equipped for that.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the sister feels that the author is being selfish, but the author has a right to set boundaries for their home. It's their property, and they can choose who can use it and under what conditions. The sister's kids haven't been there before, which might be a factor. The author's contribution to past events shows they're not entirely avoiding responsibility, but this is a different scenario.\n\nSo, considering the author's reasons and the right to control their own property, the answer is likely that the author is not in the wrong. The sister's reaction seems disproportionate, and the author has valid safety and comfort concerns.\n"
