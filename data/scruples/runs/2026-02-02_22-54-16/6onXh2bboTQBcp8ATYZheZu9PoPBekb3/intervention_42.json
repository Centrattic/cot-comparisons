It's as chaotic and nightmarish as you can imagine. Usually she never asks to come over to my place because it's a nightmare to travel with 14 kids to come visit their auntie who lives 5 hours away. If we're having a gathering it's always me who is travelling to their place. I don't really mind. We only meet a few times a year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few years ago I bought my dream house with my husband. My sister asked to host my nephew's 3rd birthday party at my house. She wants to use the big backyard, grill and pool at my home. There are roughly 50 people who are invited. I said no and she called me selfish and an asshole. Her kids have never been to my house and I prefer it that way. Her kids are not very well behaved except for the oldest three and my house is not child-poof. The pool seems like a huge liability. I don't want children drowning on my property. It just seems like a recipe for disaster. She brought up the fact that she hosted Christmas at her house for the past 10+ years at her house, but I don't think it's fair to compare this to that. We meet at her house instead of our parents because she has 14 kids to herd around so it's really more out of convenience to her. Every year for the past 10+ years I buy dessert enough to feed 25 people so I've done my part with the food arrangements. That's 8 apple pies or 3 cakes worth of dessert. My parents also stay over to help prepare and cook and we all contribute to the washing and cleaning. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe haven't spoken in 2 months because of this. She firmly believes AITA. So, AITA for not allowing my sister to host my nephew's birthday party at my house? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for not letting their sister host a birthday party at their house. The sister has 14 kids, which is a lot, and the author has a dream home they want to protect. Let's consider the key points.\n\nFirst, the sister wanted to use the author's backyard, grill, and pool for a party with 50 people. The author declined, citing safety concerns, like the pool being a liability and the kids not being well-behaved. The sister is upset and called the author selfish. But the author mentions that their house isn't child-proof and the kids have never been there. Also, they've met at the sister's house before, which makes sense because managing 14 kids is easier there.\n\nThe sister brings up hosting Christmas for 10+ years, but the author argues that's different because they've always met at their parents' place. The author has contributed desserts and help, so they feel they've done their part. The sister is upset and the two haven't spoken in two months.\n\nSo, the main factors are safety (pool liability, chaotic kids), property protection, and the sister's reaction. The author has valid concerns about safety and the stress of hosting such a large group. They've met at the sister's house before, which makes sense given the numbers. The sister's insistence on using the author's house seems to be ignoring those valid concerns. The author isn't being selfish if they have legitimate reasons. The sister's reaction might be over the top, especially since they've always done events at her place. The author isn't in the wrong here because they have a right to protect their home and safety.\n"
