It's as chaotic and nightmarish as you can imagine. Usually she never asks to come over to my place because it's a nightmare to travel with 14 kids to come visit their auntie who lives 5 hours away. If we're having a gathering it's always me who is travelling to their place. I don't really mind. We only meet a few times a year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few years ago I bought my dream house with my husband. My sister asked to host my nephew's 3rd birthday party at my house. She wants to use the big backyard, grill and pool at my home. There are roughly 50 people who are invited. I said no and she called me selfish and an asshole. Her kids have never been to my house and I prefer it that way. Her kids are not very well behaved except for the oldest three and my house is not child-poof. The pool seems like a huge liability. I don't want children drowning on my property. It just seems like a recipe for disaster. She brought up the fact that she hosted Christmas at her house for the past 10+ years at her house, but I don't think it's fair to compare this to that. We meet at her house instead of our parents because she has 14 kids to herd around so it's really more out of convenience to her. Every year for the past 10+ years I buy dessert enough to feed 25 people so I've done my part with the food arrangements. That's 8 apple pies or 3 cakes worth of dessert. My parents also stay over to help prepare and cook and we all contribute to the washing and cleaning. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe haven't spoken in 2 months because of this. She firmly believes AITA. So, AITA for not allowing my sister to host my nephew's birthday party at my house? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for not allowing their sister to host a birthday party at their house.\n\nFirst, the key points from the scenario: The author has a dream house they bought with their husband. Their sister has 14 kids and wanted to host a 3rd birthday party at the author's house with 50 guests. The author refused, citing safety concerns (pool liability, unruly kids) and that their house isn't child-proof. The sister is upset, called the author selfish, and they haven't spoken in two months.\n\nThe author's reasoning: They don't want their sister's kids (except the oldest three) in their home because of behavior issues. They also mention the pool as a safety hazard. Their house isn't child-proof, which adds to the risk. The sister hosted Christmas for 10 years at her place, but the author feels it's different because the party requires the backyard, grill, and pool, which aren't safe for 14 kids and 50 guests.\n\nThe sister's argument: She's hosted the Christmas gatherings at her house, so the author is being selfish by not offering their home for the birthday. She claims the author isn't contributing enough, but the author mentions buying desserts for the past 10 years and their parents helping with prep.\n\nNow, considering the ethics here. The author has the right to set boundaries for their own home. Safety is a major concern, especially with a pool and 14 kids. The sister's kids haven't been to the author's house before, and the author prefers it that way. The sister is using past hosting as a reason, but the situations are different (Christmas vs. birthday, different numbers of guests, different setups). The author isn't obligated to host, especially when it's not safe. The sister's reaction seems harsh, calling the author an asshole over a refusal that's based on valid safety concerns. The author has contributed in other ways (desserts, parents helping), so the sister's argument about contribution might not hold as strongly.\n\nPossible counterarguments: Maybe the author should be more accommodating as family. But the sister's request was for a specific event that poses significant risks. The author isn't refusing all family gatherings; they meet a few times a year, mostly at the sister's house. The sister's hosting Christmas is a different scale and setup. The author's refusal is about safety and personal comfort, which are valid reasons.\n\nSo, the author is not in the wrong. They have the right to prioritize their home's safety and their own comfort. The sister's reaction is disproportionate given the valid concerns. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
