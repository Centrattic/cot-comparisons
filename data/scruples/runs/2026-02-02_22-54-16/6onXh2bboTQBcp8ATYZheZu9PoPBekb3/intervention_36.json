It's as chaotic and nightmarish as you can imagine. Usually she never asks to come over to my place because it's a nightmare to travel with 14 kids to come visit their auntie who lives 5 hours away. If we're having a gathering it's always me who is travelling to their place. I don't really mind. We only meet a few times a year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few years ago I bought my dream house with my husband. My sister asked to host my nephew's 3rd birthday party at my house. She wants to use the big backyard, grill and pool at my home. There are roughly 50 people who are invited. I said no and she called me selfish and an asshole. Her kids have never been to my house and I prefer it that way. Her kids are not very well behaved except for the oldest three and my house is not child-poof. The pool seems like a huge liability. I don't want children drowning on my property. It just seems like a recipe for disaster. She brought up the fact that she hosted Christmas at her house for the past 10+ years at her house, but I don't think it's fair to compare this to that. We meet at her house instead of our parents because she has 14 kids to herd around so it's really more out of convenience to her. Every year for the past 10+ years I buy dessert enough to feed 25 people so I've done my part with the food arrangements. That's 8 apple pies or 3 cakes worth of dessert. My parents also stay over to help prepare and cook and we all contribute to the washing and cleaning. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe haven't spoken in 2 months because of this. She firmly believes AITA. So, AITA for not allowing my sister to host my nephew's birthday party at my house? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for not letting their sister host her kid's birthday at their house. The sister has 14 kids, which is a lot, and the author bought a dream house. The sister wanted to use the backyard, grill, and pool for a 50-person party, but the author said no. The sister called them selfish, and they haven't spoken in two months.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the reasons the author gave. The main points are safety concerns: the pool as a liability, the house not being child-proof, and the chaos of 14 kids. Also, they mention that they usually visit their sister's place, not the other way around. The sister is upset because she's hosting Christmas there every year, but the author argues that's different because of the convenience for her.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, the sister's request is for a large party at a house that's not set up for it. The author has valid safety concerns, especially with the pool and the number of kids. It's their home, and they have the right to set boundaries. The sister's previous hosting of Christmas might be a point, but the author points out that they contribute by bringing desserts and others help with cooking. The sister's 14 kids make it so that hosting at her place is more practical. The author isn't being selfish; they're prioritizing safety and their own home's conditions.\n\nThe sister's reaction of calling them an asshole seems harsh. The author isn't obligated to let someone use their home for a party that poses risks. The fact that they usually visit the sister's place doesn't mean they have to host. The user says they think the author isn't wrong, which makes sense. So the answer is B.\n"
