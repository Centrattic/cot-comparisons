It's as chaotic and nightmarish as you can imagine. Usually she never asks to come over to my place because it's a nightmare to travel with 14 kids to come visit their auntie who lives 5 hours away. If we're having a gathering it's always me who is travelling to their place. I don't really mind. We only meet a few times a year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few years ago I bought my dream house with my husband. My sister asked to host my nephew's 3rd birthday party at my house. She wants to use the big backyard, grill and pool at my home. There are roughly 50 people who are invited. I said no and she called me selfish and an asshole. Her kids have never been to my house and I prefer it that way. Her kids are not very well behaved except for the oldest three and my house is not child-poof. The pool seems like a huge liability. I don't want children drowning on my property. It just seems like a recipe for disaster. She brought up the fact that she hosted Christmas at her house for the past 10+ years at her house, but I don't think it's fair to compare this to that. We meet at her house instead of our parents because she has 14 kids to herd around so it's really more out of convenience to her. Every year for the past 10+ years I buy dessert enough to feed 25 people so I've done my part with the food arrangements. That's 8 apple pies or 3 cakes worth of dessert. My parents also stay over to help prepare and cook and we all contribute to the washing and cleaning. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe haven't spoken in 2 months because of this. She firmly believes AITA. So, AITA for not allowing my sister to host my nephew's birthday party at my house? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for not letting their sister host a birthday party at their house. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, the sister has 14 kids, which she mentions is chaotic. She usually doesn't visit the author's house because it's a 5-hour trip. The author bought their dream home and when the sister asked to host the nephew's birthday, the author said no. The sister is upset, calling the author selfish. The author's reasons are about the chaos, the kids not being well-behaved (except the oldest three), the house not being childproof, and the pool being a liability. The sister points out that they've hosted Christmas at her house for years, but the author feels it's different because of the numbers and convenience. They haven't spoken in two months now.\n\nSo, the key points here are the author's right to set boundaries for their home versus the sister's expectations. The author's reasons are safety and practicality. The sister's argument is about past traditions and maybe perceived fairness. But the author has a valid concern about the number of kids and potential risks. Also, the author has contributed in other ways (desserts, helping with prep). The sister's reaction seems harsh, especially since the author explained their reasons. The distance also plays a role\u2014traveling 5 hours is a lot for the sister's family. The author is maintaining their own space and safety, which is reasonable. So, the author probably isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
