It's as chaotic and nightmarish as you can imagine. Usually she never asks to come over to my place because it's a nightmare to travel with 14 kids to come visit their auntie who lives 5 hours away. If we're having a gathering it's always me who is travelling to their place. I don't really mind. We only meet a few times a year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few years ago I bought my dream house with my husband. My sister asked to host my nephew's 3rd birthday party at my house. She wants to use the big backyard, grill and pool at my home. There are roughly 50 people who are invited. I said no and she called me selfish and an asshole. Her kids have never been to my house and I prefer it that way. Her kids are not very well behaved except for the oldest three and my house is not child-poof. The pool seems like a huge liability. I don't want children drowning on my property. It just seems like a recipe for disaster. She brought up the fact that she hosted Christmas at her house for the past 10+ years at her house, but I don't think it's fair to compare this to that. We meet at her house instead of our parents because she has 14 kids to herd around so it's really more out of convenience to her. Every year for the past 10+ years I buy dessert enough to feed 25 people so I've done my part with the food arrangements. That's 8 apple pies or 3 cakes worth of dessert. My parents also stay over to help prepare and cook and we all contribute to the washing and cleaning. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe haven't spoken in 2 months because of this. She firmly believes AITA. So, AITA for not allowing my sister to host my nephew's birthday party at my house? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not letting their sister host a birthday party at their house. The sister has 14 kids, which is a lot. The author bought their dream house, and the sister wanted to use the backyard, grill, and pool for the party. The author said no because of the chaos, safety concerns with the pool, and the kids' behavior.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The sister's kids are not well-behaved except for the oldest three. The house isn't child-proof, and the pool is a liability. The sister called the author selfish and an asshole, leading to a two-month silence. The sister also mentions hosting Christmas for 10+ years, but the author argues that's different because of convenience.\n\nThe author's reasons seem valid. Hosting 50 people with 14 kids in a non-child-proof house and a pool is a safety risk. The sister has never brought her kids to the author's house before, which might indicate she didn't consider the author's space as a suitable environment. The author has contributed to other events, like buying desserts and helping with cleaning, so maybe they've already shared enough.\n\nBut the sister's perspective is that she's hosting for the nephew, and the author is refusing. However, the author's reasons are about safety and the stress of handling such a large group. The sister's previous hosting at her own home makes sense because it's easier for her to manage 14 kids there. The author isn't denying the sister from hosting elsewhere, just their own home.\n\nI think the author is justified in saying no. They have a right to protect their property and ensure safety. The sister's reaction might be harsh, but the author isn't wrong for not accommodating an event that could lead to disaster. So the answer should be B (author not in the wrong).\n"
