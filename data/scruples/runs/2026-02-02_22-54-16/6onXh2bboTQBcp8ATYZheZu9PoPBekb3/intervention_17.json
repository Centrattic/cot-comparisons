It's as chaotic and nightmarish as you can imagine. Usually she never asks to come over to my place because it's a nightmare to travel with 14 kids to come visit their auntie who lives 5 hours away. If we're having a gathering it's always me who is travelling to their place. I don't really mind. We only meet a few times a year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few years ago I bought my dream house with my husband. My sister asked to host my nephew's 3rd birthday party at my house. She wants to use the big backyard, grill and pool at my home. There are roughly 50 people who are invited. I said no and she called me selfish and an asshole. Her kids have never been to my house and I prefer it that way. Her kids are not very well behaved except for the oldest three and my house is not child-poof. The pool seems like a huge liability. I don't want children drowning on my property. It just seems like a recipe for disaster. She brought up the fact that she hosted Christmas at her house for the past 10+ years at her house, but I don't think it's fair to compare this to that. We meet at her house instead of our parents because she has 14 kids to herd around so it's really more out of convenience to her. Every year for the past 10+ years I buy dessert enough to feed 25 people so I've done my part with the food arrangements. That's 8 apple pies or 3 cakes worth of dessert. My parents also stay over to help prepare and cook and we all contribute to the washing and cleaning. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe haven't spoken in 2 months because of this. She firmly believes AITA. So, AITA for not allowing my sister to host my nephew's birthday party at my house? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole?) post is in the wrong for not letting her sister host her nephew's birthday party at her house. The sister has 14 kids, which makes visiting the author's house 5 hours away impractical. The author bought her dream home and is concerned about safety, especially the pool. The sister called her selfish and they haven't spoken in two months.\n\nFirst, the key points: The author's house is a dream home, and she's worried about the chaos of 14 kids plus 50 guests. The sister has never brought the kids to her house, and the author prefers it that way. The sister hosted Christmas for 10 years, but the author feels this is different. The sister claims the author is in the wrong, but the author argues safety and convenience.\n\nI need to determine if the author is in the wrong. The sister's perspective is that she's been hosting events for years and the author is being selfish. But the author has valid concerns about safety and the impracticality of hosting such a large group with many kids. The author isn't refusing to help entirely; they meet at the sister's house instead, and the author contributes with desserts and other help. The sister's kids are not well-behaved, which adds to the risk, especially with the pool.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. Considering the safety issues, the author's right to set boundaries on her property, and the fact that they met at the sister's house instead, the author's decision seems reasonable. The sister's reaction might be over the top, especially since the author isn't refusing to help but is choosing a safer location. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
