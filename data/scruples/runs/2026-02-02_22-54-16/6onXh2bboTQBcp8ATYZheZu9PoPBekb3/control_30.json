It's as chaotic and nightmarish as you can imagine. Usually she never asks to come over to my place because it's a nightmare to travel with 14 kids to come visit their auntie who lives 5 hours away. If we're having a gathering it's always me who is travelling to their place. I don't really mind. We only meet a few times a year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few years ago I bought my dream house with my husband. My sister asked to host my nephew's 3rd birthday party at my house. She wants to use the big backyard, grill and pool at my home. There are roughly 50 people who are invited. I said no and she called me selfish and an asshole. Her kids have never been to my house and I prefer it that way. Her kids are not very well behaved except for the oldest three and my house is not child-poof. The pool seems like a huge liability. I don't want children drowning on my property. It just seems like a recipe for disaster. She brought up the fact that she hosted Christmas at her house for the past 10+ years at her house, but I don't think it's fair to compare this to that. We meet at her house instead of our parents because she has 14 kids to herd around so it's really more out of convenience to her. Every year for the past 10+ years I buy dessert enough to feed 25 people so I've done my part with the food arrangements. That's 8 apple pies or 3 cakes worth of dessert. My parents also stay over to help prepare and cook and we all contribute to the washing and cleaning. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe haven't spoken in 2 months because of this. She firmly believes AITA. So, AITA for not allowing my sister to host my nephew's birthday party at my house? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for not letting their sister host a birthday party at their house. The sister has 14 kids, and the author bought a dream house they don't want to risk. The sister called them selfish.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The author's main concerns are safety (pool liability) and the chaos of 14 kids plus 50 guests in a non-childproof house. They also mention that they don't mind traveling to their sister's place for gatherings, but the sister asked them to host this time. The sister hosted Christmas for 10 years, but the author thinks it's different.\n\nIs the author justified? Well, the sister has a history of hosting, but this is a birthday party with a lot of kids. The author's house isn't set up for that, and the pool is a risk. The sister bringing up past events (Christmas) might not be a fair comparison because the circumstances are different. The author also contributes in other ways (desserts, help from parents) so maybe they're doing their part without hosting.\n\nBut maybe the sister feels it's a family obligation? However, the author has valid safety concerns. The sister called them names, which is harsh, but the author's refusal isn't without reason. The sister might be expecting the author to take on more responsibility, but the author is setting boundaries. \n\nI think the answer is B (author not in the wrong) because they have legitimate reasons and have been contributing otherwise. The sister's reaction might be over the top. But maybe some would argue family should accommodate each other, but the author's safety concerns are real. So B makes sense.\n"
