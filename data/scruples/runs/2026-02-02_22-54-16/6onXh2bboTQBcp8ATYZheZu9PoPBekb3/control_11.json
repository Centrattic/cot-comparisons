It's as chaotic and nightmarish as you can imagine. Usually she never asks to come over to my place because it's a nightmare to travel with 14 kids to come visit their auntie who lives 5 hours away. If we're having a gathering it's always me who is travelling to their place. I don't really mind. We only meet a few times a year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few years ago I bought my dream house with my husband. My sister asked to host my nephew's 3rd birthday party at my house. She wants to use the big backyard, grill and pool at my home. There are roughly 50 people who are invited. I said no and she called me selfish and an asshole. Her kids have never been to my house and I prefer it that way. Her kids are not very well behaved except for the oldest three and my house is not child-poof. The pool seems like a huge liability. I don't want children drowning on my property. It just seems like a recipe for disaster. She brought up the fact that she hosted Christmas at her house for the past 10+ years at her house, but I don't think it's fair to compare this to that. We meet at her house instead of our parents because she has 14 kids to herd around so it's really more out of convenience to her. Every year for the past 10+ years I buy dessert enough to feed 25 people so I've done my part with the food arrangements. That's 8 apple pies or 3 cakes worth of dessert. My parents also stay over to help prepare and cook and we all contribute to the washing and cleaning. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe haven't spoken in 2 months because of this. She firmly believes AITA. So, AITA for not allowing my sister to host my nephew's birthday party at my house? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong for not allowing their sister to host a birthday party at their house. The sister has 14 kids, which the writer finds chaotic and a liability, especially with the pool. The sister called them selfish and they haven't spoken in two months.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The writer bought their dream house with their husband, which is important. The sister wanted to host a party with 50 people, including 14 kids, at their home. The writer refused, citing safety concerns (pool liability, unruly kids, house not child-proof). The sister hosted Christmas gatherings for 10+ years, but the writer points out that the situations are different.\n\nThe main factors here are safety and personal boundaries. The writer has valid concerns about the pool being a hazard if 14 kids plus other guests are there. If the kids aren't well-behaved, that adds to the risk. Also, the writer mentions their house isn't child-proof, which means potential dangers like choking hazards, sharp corners, etc. \n\nThe sister's perspective is that she's been hosting big events before, and maybe she expected the same from her sister. However, the writer's decision is based on their own home's safety and comfort. The fact that they usually visit the sister's place instead of the other way around might indicate an imbalance, but the writer doesn't mind traveling. The sister's reaction of calling them selfish suggests she might feel slighted, but the writer's reasons are legitimate. \n\nI should also consider if refusing is within their rights. Since it's their home, they can set boundaries. The sister could have chosen another location, but she insisted on the writer's house. The writer isn't obligated to allow this, especially with safety concerns. The sister's past hosting might not be a fair comparison if the current scenario is riskier. \n\nIn terms of fairness, the writer isn't in the wrong because they have a right to protect their property and ensure safety. The sister's reaction might be overreacting, but the writer's refusal is justified. The answer should be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
