It's as chaotic and nightmarish as you can imagine. Usually she never asks to come over to my place because it's a nightmare to travel with 14 kids to come visit their auntie who lives 5 hours away. If we're having a gathering it's always me who is travelling to their place. I don't really mind. We only meet a few times a year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few years ago I bought my dream house with my husband. My sister asked to host my nephew's 3rd birthday party at my house. She wants to use the big backyard, grill and pool at my home. There are roughly 50 people who are invited. I said no and she called me selfish and an asshole. Her kids have never been to my house and I prefer it that way. Her kids are not very well behaved except for the oldest three and my house is not child-poof. The pool seems like a huge liability. I don't want children drowning on my property. It just seems like a recipe for disaster. She brought up the fact that she hosted Christmas at her house for the past 10+ years at her house, but I don't think it's fair to compare this to that. We meet at her house instead of our parents because she has 14 kids to herd around so it's really more out of convenience to her. Every year for the past 10+ years I buy dessert enough to feed 25 people so I've done my part with the food arrangements. That's 8 apple pies or 3 cakes worth of dessert. My parents also stay over to help prepare and cook and we all contribute to the washing and cleaning. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe haven't spoken in 2 months because of this. She firmly believes AITA. So, AITA for not allowing my sister to host my nephew's birthday party at my house? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong for not letting her sister host a party at her house. The sister has 14 kids, and the author bought a dream house with her husband. The sister wanted to use the big backyard, grill, and pool for a 3-year-old's birthday with 50 guests. The author declined, and now there's a 2-month silence.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that her sister's kids are not well-behaved except for the oldest three. The house isn't child-proof, and the pool is a safety concern. She doesn't want the risk of children drowning. Also, her sister usually hosts big family gatherings at her place, so maybe the author is just setting boundaries here. The user feels the author isn't wrong, but they want validation.\n\nThe sister's argument is that she's hosted Christmas for 10+ years, but the author points out that's different. Maybe the Christmas event is more about family tradition, whereas a birthday party with 50 people at a private home could be more intense. The author also contributes with desserts and other help, so she's not entirely not contributing to family events.\n\nLegally and ethically, the author's right to control her property is a big factor. Allowing 50 people and 14 kids into her home without being prepared for it could lead to liability issues, especially with the pool. The sister's kids have never been there before, so maybe the author is just being cautious. Setting boundaries is important in relationships, and it's her house. The sister might be taking it personally, but the author's reasons are valid. I don't see the author being in the wrong here. Answer B.\n"
