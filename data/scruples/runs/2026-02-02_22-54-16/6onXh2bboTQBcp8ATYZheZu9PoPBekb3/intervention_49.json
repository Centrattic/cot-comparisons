It's as chaotic and nightmarish as you can imagine. Usually she never asks to come over to my place because it's a nightmare to travel with 14 kids to come visit their auntie who lives 5 hours away. If we're having a gathering it's always me who is travelling to their place. I don't really mind. We only meet a few times a year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few years ago I bought my dream house with my husband. My sister asked to host my nephew's 3rd birthday party at my house. She wants to use the big backyard, grill and pool at my home. There are roughly 50 people who are invited. I said no and she called me selfish and an asshole. Her kids have never been to my house and I prefer it that way. Her kids are not very well behaved except for the oldest three and my house is not child-poof. The pool seems like a huge liability. I don't want children drowning on my property. It just seems like a recipe for disaster. She brought up the fact that she hosted Christmas at her house for the past 10+ years at her house, but I don't think it's fair to compare this to that. We meet at her house instead of our parents because she has 14 kids to herd around so it's really more out of convenience to her. Every year for the past 10+ years I buy dessert enough to feed 25 people so I've done my part with the food arrangements. That's 8 apple pies or 3 cakes worth of dessert. My parents also stay over to help prepare and cook and we all contribute to the washing and cleaning. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe haven't spoken in 2 months because of this. She firmly believes AITA. So, AITA for not allowing my sister to host my nephew's birthday party at my house? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author not allowing their sister to host a birthday party at their house. The sister has 14 kids, and the author's house isn't child-proof. The sister is upset and called the author names. They haven't talked in two months.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author bought their dream house and doesn't want the chaos of 14 kids plus a party with 50 people. The sister hosted Christmas for years, but the author points out that the circumstances are different. The sister is using the author's resources (backyard, pool) and there's a liability issue with the pool. The author also mentions that the kids aren't well-behaved, which adds to the risk.\n\nThe sister's argument is that she's always hosted big events at her house, but the author is not obligated to host. The author has contributed in the past with food and help from family, so maybe they feel they've supported enough without hosting. The main issue is the author's right to set boundaries for their own home. \n\nThe sister's reaction seems harsh, calling the author selfish and an asshole. The author isn't being unreasonable by saying no. They have valid concerns about safety and the stress of hosting such a large group. The fact that the sister's kids have never been to the author's house before might mean the author isn't used to dealing with them, adding to the problem. \n\nIn terms of fairness, the author isn't in the wrong for setting limits. They have the right to refuse without feeling guilty. The sister's response and the ongoing silence suggest she's not respecting the author's decision. So the answer should be B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
