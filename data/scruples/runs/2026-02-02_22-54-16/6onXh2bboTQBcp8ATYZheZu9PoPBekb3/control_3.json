It's as chaotic and nightmarish as you can imagine. Usually she never asks to come over to my place because it's a nightmare to travel with 14 kids to come visit their auntie who lives 5 hours away. If we're having a gathering it's always me who is travelling to their place. I don't really mind. We only meet a few times a year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few years ago I bought my dream house with my husband. My sister asked to host my nephew's 3rd birthday party at my house. She wants to use the big backyard, grill and pool at my home. There are roughly 50 people who are invited. I said no and she called me selfish and an asshole. Her kids have never been to my house and I prefer it that way. Her kids are not very well behaved except for the oldest three and my house is not child-poof. The pool seems like a huge liability. I don't want children drowning on my property. It just seems like a recipe for disaster. She brought up the fact that she hosted Christmas at her house for the past 10+ years at her house, but I don't think it's fair to compare this to that. We meet at her house instead of our parents because she has 14 kids to herd around so it's really more out of convenience to her. Every year for the past 10+ years I buy dessert enough to feed 25 people so I've done my part with the food arrangements. That's 8 apple pies or 3 cakes worth of dessert. My parents also stay over to help prepare and cook and we all contribute to the washing and cleaning. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe haven't spoken in 2 months because of this. She firmly believes AITA. So, AITA for not allowing my sister to host my nephew's birthday party at my house? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The question is about a sister not allowing her sister to host a kid's birthday party at her house. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the details. The author has a sister with 14 kids, which is a huge number. They usually meet at the sister's place because it's easier for her to manage the kids. The author bought her dream house, and the sister wanted to host a birthday party there with 50 people. The author refused, and the sister called her selfish. The author's reasons are that the kids aren't well-behaved, the house isn't childproof, and the pool is a liability. They haven't spoken in two months now.\n\nSo, the user wants to know if the author is at fault. The options are A (yes) or B (no). To decide, I should consider the reasons given. The author has a valid concern about safety, especially with 14 kids and a pool. Hosting a party with 50 people at a house not suited for that many children seems risky. The sister's past of hosting big events at her own home doesn't negate the current situation's specific risks. Also, the author mentions contributing to previous events by bringing desserts, so maybe she's already helping. The sister's reaction of calling her an asshole might be harsh, especially if the author's reasons are legitimate. The distance between their houses (5 hours) also makes it impractical for the sister to visit the author's house regularly. \n\nI think the key points here are the safety concerns and the practicality. The author isn't obligated to host such a large event, especially when it's not conducive to her home environment. The sister might feel hurt, but the author's reasons are valid. The author isn't in the wrong here because she's prioritizing her property's safety and avoiding potential disasters. The sister's reaction might be due to feeling slighted, but the author's decision is reasonable. So the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
