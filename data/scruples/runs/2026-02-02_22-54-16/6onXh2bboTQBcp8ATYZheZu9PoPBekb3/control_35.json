It's as chaotic and nightmarish as you can imagine. Usually she never asks to come over to my place because it's a nightmare to travel with 14 kids to come visit their auntie who lives 5 hours away. If we're having a gathering it's always me who is travelling to their place. I don't really mind. We only meet a few times a year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few years ago I bought my dream house with my husband. My sister asked to host my nephew's 3rd birthday party at my house. She wants to use the big backyard, grill and pool at my home. There are roughly 50 people who are invited. I said no and she called me selfish and an asshole. Her kids have never been to my house and I prefer it that way. Her kids are not very well behaved except for the oldest three and my house is not child-poof. The pool seems like a huge liability. I don't want children drowning on my property. It just seems like a recipe for disaster. She brought up the fact that she hosted Christmas at her house for the past 10+ years at her house, but I don't think it's fair to compare this to that. We meet at her house instead of our parents because she has 14 kids to herd around so it's really more out of convenience to her. Every year for the past 10+ years I buy dessert enough to feed 25 people so I've done my part with the food arrangements. That's 8 apple pies or 3 cakes worth of dessert. My parents also stay over to help prepare and cook and we all contribute to the washing and cleaning. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe haven't spoken in 2 months because of this. She firmly believes AITA. So, AITA for not allowing my sister to host my nephew's birthday party at my house? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for not allowing their sister to host a birthday party at their house. Let's break down the details.\n\nFirst, the sister has 14 kids, which is a lot. They live five hours away. The author bought a dream house with her husband. The sister wanted to host a birthday party with 50 people at the author's house, using the backyard, grill, and pool. The author refused, and the sister is upset, calling her selfish. Now they haven't spoken in two months.\n\nThe author's reasons: her house isn't child-proof, the pool is a liability, and her sister's kids aren't well-behaved except the oldest three. She also mentions that in the past, they've met at the sister's house because of the logistics, and she doesn't mind traveling there. The sister brings up hosting Christmas for 10+ years, but the author feels it's a different situation.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, the sister's kids are 14, so bringing them all to a five-hour drive might be impractical. Plus, the author's house isn't set up for that many kids, and safety is a concern with the pool. The author already contributes to the Christmas gatherings by providing dessert and others help with cooking and cleaning. The sister's request seems to be a one-time event (birthday) vs. annual Christmas, which might be a different context.\n\nThe sister is upset because she feels it's unfair, but the author has valid safety and practical concerns. The sister's kids haven't even been to the author's house before, so maybe she's not aware of the setup. The author isn't refusing all gatherings but is setting boundaries for valid reasons. The sister's reaction seems harsh, calling her an asshole without considering the author's perspective.\n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong. She's protecting her home, safety, and personal space. The sister should respect that. So answer B.\n"
