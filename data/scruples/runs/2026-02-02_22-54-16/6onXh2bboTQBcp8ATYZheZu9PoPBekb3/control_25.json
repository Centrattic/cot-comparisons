It's as chaotic and nightmarish as you can imagine. Usually she never asks to come over to my place because it's a nightmare to travel with 14 kids to come visit their auntie who lives 5 hours away. If we're having a gathering it's always me who is travelling to their place. I don't really mind. We only meet a few times a year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few years ago I bought my dream house with my husband. My sister asked to host my nephew's 3rd birthday party at my house. She wants to use the big backyard, grill and pool at my home. There are roughly 50 people who are invited. I said no and she called me selfish and an asshole. Her kids have never been to my house and I prefer it that way. Her kids are not very well behaved except for the oldest three and my house is not child-poof. The pool seems like a huge liability. I don't want children drowning on my property. It just seems like a recipe for disaster. She brought up the fact that she hosted Christmas at her house for the past 10+ years at her house, but I don't think it's fair to compare this to that. We meet at her house instead of our parents because she has 14 kids to herd around so it's really more out of convenience to her. Every year for the past 10+ years I buy dessert enough to feed 25 people so I've done my part with the food arrangements. That's 8 apple pies or 3 cakes worth of dessert. My parents also stay over to help prepare and cook and we all contribute to the washing and cleaning. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe haven't spoken in 2 months because of this. She firmly believes AITA. So, AITA for not allowing my sister to host my nephew's birthday party at my house? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for not letting their sister host a birthday party at their house.\n\nFirst, the sister has 14 kids, which is a lot. The author bought a dream house with their husband, but it's not child-proof. The sister wanted to use the backyard, grill, and pool for a party with 50 people. The author refused, and the sister called them selfish. The sister also mentioned hosting Christmas for 10 years, but the author thinks that's different. They meet at the sister's house because it's easier for her to manage the kids, and the author contributes food each year.\n\nSo, the key points: the author's house isn't child-proof, the pool is a liability, and the sister has a history of chaotic events. The author's refusal is based on safety concerns and personal preference. The sister is upset because she feels it's a tradition and that the author is being unfair. \n\nThe author didn't say yes, but is that wrong? Well, they have valid reasons. They mentioned the safety hazard of the pool, which is a real concern. Also, the sister's kids aren't well-behaved except for three, so maybe the author is justified in not wanting them in their home. The sister's reaction seems harsh, but maybe there's a deeper issue about expectations.\n\nThe sister hosted Christmas for years, but this is a different scenario. The author might not have a duty to host every event, especially when it's a safety risk. Also, the sister didn't have her kids at the author's house before, so maybe the author is right to want to keep it that way. The sister might feel entitled, but the author's reasons are practical. \n\nI think the author is not in the wrong. The decision was based on safety and personal space, which are valid. The sister's anger might be more about feeling rejected than the actual safety issues. So the answer should be B.\n"
