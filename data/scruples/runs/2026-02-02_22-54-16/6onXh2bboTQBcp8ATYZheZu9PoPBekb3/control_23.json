It's as chaotic and nightmarish as you can imagine. Usually she never asks to come over to my place because it's a nightmare to travel with 14 kids to come visit their auntie who lives 5 hours away. If we're having a gathering it's always me who is travelling to their place. I don't really mind. We only meet a few times a year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few years ago I bought my dream house with my husband. My sister asked to host my nephew's 3rd birthday party at my house. She wants to use the big backyard, grill and pool at my home. There are roughly 50 people who are invited. I said no and she called me selfish and an asshole. Her kids have never been to my house and I prefer it that way. Her kids are not very well behaved except for the oldest three and my house is not child-poof. The pool seems like a huge liability. I don't want children drowning on my property. It just seems like a recipe for disaster. She brought up the fact that she hosted Christmas at her house for the past 10+ years at her house, but I don't think it's fair to compare this to that. We meet at her house instead of our parents because she has 14 kids to herd around so it's really more out of convenience to her. Every year for the past 10+ years I buy dessert enough to feed 25 people so I've done my part with the food arrangements. That's 8 apple pies or 3 cakes worth of dessert. My parents also stay over to help prepare and cook and we all contribute to the washing and cleaning. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe haven't spoken in 2 months because of this. She firmly believes AITA. So, AITA for not allowing my sister to host my nephew's birthday party at my house? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not allowing her sister to host her nephew's birthday party at her house. The sister has 14 kids, and the author has a nice house with a backyard, grill, and pool. The sister invited 50 people, which the author likely finds overwhelming. The sister called her selfish and an asshole, and they haven't spoken in two months.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the facts. The author bought her dream house, which probably has personal significance. Hosting a party for 50 people, especially with 14 kids, could be really stressful. The author mentions that her sister's kids aren't well-behaved except the oldest three, and her house isn't child-proof. The pool is a liability concern, which is a valid safety issue. \n\nThe sister hosted Christmas for 10+ years, but the author is comparing that to a birthday party. However, a large family gathering at Christmas might be different from a kids' birthday party. The author has already contributed by bringing dessert each year and the parents help too. \n\nThe sister's request seems to be out of convenience because managing 14 kids is hard. But the author is within her rights to say no. She's not obligated to host the party, especially with the potential risks and stress involved. The sister's reaction of calling her names and breaking communication might be overreacting. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the sister felt it's a one-time thing or that the author should be more accommodating. But the author's reasons are valid\u2014safety, stress, and the house not being suited for a large chaotic event. The fact that they haven't spoken the kids to the house before might also add to the author's concerns. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. She's setting boundaries based on her own capabilities and safety. The sister's reaction is more extreme. The answer should be B.\n"
