It's as chaotic and nightmarish as you can imagine. Usually she never asks to come over to my place because it's a nightmare to travel with 14 kids to come visit their auntie who lives 5 hours away. If we're having a gathering it's always me who is travelling to their place. I don't really mind. We only meet a few times a year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few years ago I bought my dream house with my husband. My sister asked to host my nephew's 3rd birthday party at my house. She wants to use the big backyard, grill and pool at my home. There are roughly 50 people who are invited. I said no and she called me selfish and an asshole. Her kids have never been to my house and I prefer it that way. Her kids are not very well behaved except for the oldest three and my house is not child-poof. The pool seems like a huge liability. I don't want children drowning on my property. It just seems like a recipe for disaster. She brought up the fact that she hosted Christmas at her house for the past 10+ years at her house, but I don't think it's fair to compare this to that. We meet at her house instead of our parents because she has 14 kids to herd around so it's really more out of convenience to her. Every year for the past 10+ years I buy dessert enough to feed 25 people so I've done my part with the food arrangements. That's 8 apple pies or 3 cakes worth of dessert. My parents also stay over to help prepare and cook and we all contribute to the washing and cleaning. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe haven't spoken in 2 months because of this. She firmly believes AITA. So, AITA for not allowing my sister to host my nephew's birthday party at my house? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. So the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not letting their sister host a birthday party at their house. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author has a sister with 14 kids. The sister wanted to host a 3rd birthday party at the author's house, which has a big backyard, grill, and pool. The author refused, and now there's a two-month silence. The sister called them selfish.\n\nThe author's reasons are that their house isn't child-proof, the pool is a liability, and they don't want 14 kids coming over. Also, they mentioned that they usually visit the sister's place for gatherings, which makes sense because it's more convenient for 14 kids. The sister points out she's hosted Christmas for 10 years, but the author thinks that's different.\n\nHmm. So the key points are safety concerns and the potential chaos of 14 kids plus 50 guests. The author has valid safety reasons\u2014pool liability and unchild-proofed house. Also, they didn't want to travel, but they usually go to the sister's place. The sister might feel hurt because they didn't allow the party at the author's home, but the author has legitimate concerns.\n\nI need to consider if the author's refusal was reasonable. The sister's argument is that they've hosted other events before, but a birthday party with 50 people and 14 kids is a bigger event. The author's safety concerns about the pool are significant. Plus, the sister's kids aren't well-behaved, which adds to the risk. The author also mentions that they contribute to other events (desserts, helping with cleaning), so they aren't being entirely selfish.\n\nThe sister's reaction seems harsh, calling the author an asshole, which might be an overreaction. The author's refusal is based on valid safety and practicality reasons, not just selfishness. The sister might be expecting the author to accommodate, but the author has a right to set boundaries, especially regarding their home's safety.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
