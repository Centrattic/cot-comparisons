It's as chaotic and nightmarish as you can imagine. Usually she never asks to come over to my place because it's a nightmare to travel with 14 kids to come visit their auntie who lives 5 hours away. If we're having a gathering it's always me who is travelling to their place. I don't really mind. We only meet a few times a year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few years ago I bought my dream house with my husband. My sister asked to host my nephew's 3rd birthday party at my house. She wants to use the big backyard, grill and pool at my home. There are roughly 50 people who are invited. I said no and she called me selfish and an asshole. Her kids have never been to my house and I prefer it that way. Her kids are not very well behaved except for the oldest three and my house is not child-poof. The pool seems like a huge liability. I don't want children drowning on my property. It just seems like a recipe for disaster. She brought up the fact that she hosted Christmas at her house for the past 10+ years at her house, but I don't think it's fair to compare this to that. We meet at her house instead of our parents because she has 14 kids to herd around so it's really more out of convenience to her. Every year for the past 10+ years I buy dessert enough to feed 25 people so I've done my part with the food arrangements. That's 8 apple pies or 3 cakes worth of dessert. My parents also stay over to help prepare and cook and we all contribute to the washing and cleaning. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe haven't spoken in 2 months because of this. She firmly believes AITA. So, AITA for not allowing my sister to host my nephew's birthday party at my house? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for not letting her sister host a birthday party at her house.\n\nFirst, the sister has 14 kids, which is a huge number. The author mentions that the sister never comes to her house because it's a 5-hour trip and the kids are chaotic. The author usually goes to the sister's place for gatherings. Now, the sister asked to host a 3rd birthday party with 50 people at the author's house. The author said no, and the sister called her selfish. They haven't spoken in two months.\n\nThe author's reasons are about safety: her house isn't childproof, the pool is a liability, and the kids aren't well-behaved except for the oldest three. She also points out that the sister has hosted Christmas there for 10 years, but that's different because the Christmas setup is at the sister's home, which is designed to handle the kids. The author also mentions contributing to food and help from parents, so she feels she's already done her part.\n\nI need to consider if the author is in the wrong. The sister's request was for the author's private property, which the author has the right to control. The author is concerned about safety and the chaos of 14 kids and 50 guests. The sister's children have never been there, which adds to the risk. The author's refusal is based on valid concerns, not just personal preference. The sister's comparison to hosting Christmas doesn't hold because the settings are different. The author isn't obligated to host, especially with the liability involved. The sister's reaction seems harsh, but maybe she felt slighted. However, the author's decision seems reasonable given the circumstances. So, the answer is probably B (not in the wrong).\n"
