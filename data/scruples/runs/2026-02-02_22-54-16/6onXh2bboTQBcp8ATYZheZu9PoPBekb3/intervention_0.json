It's as chaotic and nightmarish as you can imagine. Usually she never asks to come over to my place because it's a nightmare to travel with 14 kids to come visit their auntie who lives 5 hours away. If we're having a gathering it's always me who is travelling to their place. I don't really mind. We only meet a few times a year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few years ago I bought my dream house with my husband. My sister asked to host my nephew's 3rd birthday party at my house. She wants to use the big backyard, grill and pool at my home. There are roughly 50 people who are invited. I said no and she called me selfish and an asshole. Her kids have never been to my house and I prefer it that way. Her kids are not very well behaved except for the oldest three and my house is not child-poof. The pool seems like a huge liability. I don't want children drowning on my property. It just seems like a recipe for disaster. She brought up the fact that she hosted Christmas at her house for the past 10+ years at her house, but I don't think it's fair to compare this to that. We meet at her house instead of our parents because she has 14 kids to herd around so it's really more out of convenience to her. Every year for the past 10+ years I buy dessert enough to feed 25 people so I've done my part with the food arrangements. That's 8 apple pies or 3 cakes worth of dessert. My parents also stay over to help prepare and cook and we all contribute to the washing and cleaning. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe haven't spoken in 2 months because of this. She firmly believes AITA. So, AITA for not allowing my sister to host my nephew's birthday party at my house? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for not allowing their sister to host a birthday party at their house. Let me break down the situation step by step.\n\nFirst, the author has a sister with 14 kids. The sister usually doesn't visit because traveling with that many kids is a hassle, and gatherings are at their place. The author doesn't mind traveling to their sister's home a few times a year. Now, the sister asked to host a 50-person party at the author's new house, which the author declined. The sister called them selfish and an asshole. The author's reasons include the house not being child-proof, the pool being a liability, and previous experience with the kids' behavior.\n\nSo, the key points here are the safety concerns and the author's boundaries. The sister argues that she's hosted big events before, but the author's house is different. The sister also mentions contributing to previous events with desserts, but the author feels they've already helped by attending and contributing in other ways. The sister is upset and they haven't spoken in two months.\n\nI need to assess if the author's refusal is justified. Safety is a big factor here. The pool's liability and the house not being child-proof are valid concerns. Hosting 50 people with 14 kids could indeed be chaotic and dangerous. The author has the right to set boundaries for their own home, especially regarding safety. The sister's past hosting doesn't mitigate the current risks. Also, the author's previous contributions (like desserts) don't obligate them to host another event. The sister's reaction seems harsh given the author's reasons. So, the author isn't in the wrong here.\n"
