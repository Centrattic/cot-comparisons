It's as chaotic and nightmarish as you can imagine. Usually she never asks to come over to my place because it's a nightmare to travel with 14 kids to come visit their auntie who lives 5 hours away. If we're having a gathering it's always me who is travelling to their place. I don't really mind. We only meet a few times a year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few years ago I bought my dream house with my husband. My sister asked to host my nephew's 3rd birthday party at my house. She wants to use the big backyard, grill and pool at my home. There are roughly 50 people who are invited. I said no and she called me selfish and an asshole. Her kids have never been to my house and I prefer it that way. Her kids are not very well behaved except for the oldest three and my house is not child-poof. The pool seems like a huge liability. I don't want children drowning on my property. It just seems like a recipe for disaster. She brought up the fact that she hosted Christmas at her house for the past 10+ years at her house, but I don't think it's fair to compare this to that. We meet at her house instead of our parents because she has 14 kids to herd around so it's really more out of convenience to her. Every year for the past 10+ years I buy dessert enough to feed 25 people so I've done my part with the food arrangements. That's 8 apple pies or 3 cakes worth of dessert. My parents also stay over to help prepare and cook and we all contribute to the washing and cleaning. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe haven't spoken in 2 months because of this. She firmly believes AITA. So, AITA for not allowing my sister to host my nephew's birthday party at my house? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for not letting their sister host a birthday party at their house. The sister has 14 kids and wants to use the dream home's backyard, grill, and pool for a 50-person party. The author says no, and now there's a two-month silence. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author bought a dream house with their husband, which probably means it's important to them. They mention their house isn't child-proof. Having 14 kids plus 50 guests could be a safety issue, especially with the pool. The sister called them selfish, but the author is concerned about liability and the chaos of 14 kids in their home.\n\nThe sister has hosted Christmas for 10+ years at her place, but the author points out that the situations aren't the same. The user might be thinking that the sister is used to hosting big events and expects others to accommodate her. The author's refusal is based on safety and personal comfort, not just being selfish. Also, the author contributes to the Christmas events by buying desserts and helping with cleanup, so they're already making sacrifices.\n\nAnother angle is the convenience factor. The author's house is 5 hours away, so traveling with 14 kids would be a hassle. The author prefers their own space and privacy, which is understandable. The sister's kids aren't well-behaved except for the oldest three, adding to the potential problems.\n\nThe main issue is whether the author had the right to say no. Since the author's home is private property and they have valid safety concerns, they're within their rights to decline. The sister's reaction might stem from feeling unappreciated, but the author isn't obligated to host. The fact that they meet a few times a year and the author doesn't mind traveling to their sister's place also adds context. The author isn't refusing all interactions, just this specific request.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author isn't in the wrong. Their decision is based on personal boundaries, safety, and privacy. The sister's anger might be more about unmet expectations rather than the author acting unkindly. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
