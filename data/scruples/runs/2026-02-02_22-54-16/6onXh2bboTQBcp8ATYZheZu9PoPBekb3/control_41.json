It's as chaotic and nightmarish as you can imagine. Usually she never asks to come over to my place because it's a nightmare to travel with 14 kids to come visit their auntie who lives 5 hours away. If we're having a gathering it's always me who is travelling to their place. I don't really mind. We only meet a few times a year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few years ago I bought my dream house with my husband. My sister asked to host my nephew's 3rd birthday party at my house. She wants to use the big backyard, grill and pool at my home. There are roughly 50 people who are invited. I said no and she called me selfish and an asshole. Her kids have never been to my house and I prefer it that way. Her kids are not very well behaved except for the oldest three and my house is not child-poof. The pool seems like a huge liability. I don't want children drowning on my property. It just seems like a recipe for disaster. She brought up the fact that she hosted Christmas at her house for the past 10+ years at her house, but I don't think it's fair to compare this to that. We meet at her house instead of our parents because she has 14 kids to herd around so it's really more out of convenience to her. Every year for the past 10+ years I buy dessert enough to feed 25 people so I've done my part with the food arrangements. That's 8 apple pies or 3 cakes worth of dessert. My parents also stay over to help prepare and cook and we all contribute to the washing and cleaning. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe haven't spoken in 2 months because of this. She firmly believes AITA. So, AITA for not allowing my sister to host my nephew's birthday party at my house? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong for not allowing her sister to host a birthday party at her house.\n\nFirst, the situation: the sister has 14 kids, which the author finds chaotic. The sister wanted to host a birthday party with 50 guests at the author's home, using the backyard, grill, and pool. The author declined, citing safety concerns (pool liability, house not child-proof) and preferring not to have the kids there. The sister is upset, called her selfish, and they haven't spoken in two months.\n\nI need to analyze if the author is in the wrong. Let's break down the key points. The author has a valid concern about safety. A pool with 14 kids and 50 guests could indeed be dangerous, especially if the kids aren't well-behaved. The author mentions that only the oldest three are well-behaved, implying the others might be disruptive or a risk. Also, the house isn't child-proof, which adds to the liability.\n\nThe sister's argument is that the author has hosted Christmas for 10+ years and contributed to the food. But the author clarifies that those events were at the sister's home, which is more convenient for her to manage 14 kids. Hosting at the author's place would require her to manage the chaos, which is a different scenario. The author isn't refusing to host entirely but is declining a specific request due to valid safety and comfort concerns.\n\nThe sister's reaction is harsh, calling the author selfish. But the author's reasons are about safety and personal comfort, not selfishness. The sister's past hosting doesn't equate to the author being obligated to host under these circumstances. The author has a right to set boundaries for her property and safety.\n\nConsidering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. Her decision is based on reasonable concerns. The sister's reaction is disproportionate given the risks involved. So the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
