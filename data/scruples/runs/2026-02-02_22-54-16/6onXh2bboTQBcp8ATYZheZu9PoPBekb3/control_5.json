It's as chaotic and nightmarish as you can imagine. Usually she never asks to come over to my place because it's a nightmare to travel with 14 kids to come visit their auntie who lives 5 hours away. If we're having a gathering it's always me who is travelling to their place. I don't really mind. We only meet a few times a year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few years ago I bought my dream house with my husband. My sister asked to host my nephew's 3rd birthday party at my house. She wants to use the big backyard, grill and pool at my home. There are roughly 50 people who are invited. I said no and she called me selfish and an asshole. Her kids have never been to my house and I prefer it that way. Her kids are not very well behaved except for the oldest three and my house is not child-poof. The pool seems like a huge liability. I don't want children drowning on my property. It just seems like a recipe for disaster. She brought up the fact that she hosted Christmas at her house for the past 10+ years at her house, but I don't think it's fair to compare this to that. We meet at her house instead of our parents because she has 14 kids to herd around so it's really more out of convenience to her. Every year for the past 10+ years I buy dessert enough to feed 25 people so I've done my part with the food arrangements. That's 8 apple pies or 3 cakes worth of dessert. My parents also stay over to help prepare and cook and we all contribute to the washing and cleaning. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe haven't spoken in 2 months because of this. She firmly believes AITA. So, AITA for not allowing my sister to host my nephew's birthday party at my house? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a sister not allowing her sister to host a birthday party at her house. The key points are:\n\n1. The author has a dream house and her sister wanted to host a 3rd birthday party there with 50 people. The author refused.\n2. The sister has 14 kids, which is a lot, and the author is concerned about the chaos, safety (especially the pool), and the kids' behavior.\n3. They haven't spoken in two months, and the sister thinks the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's reasons. She mentions her house isn't child-proof and the pool is a liability. That's a valid safety concern, especially with 14 kids and 50 guests. She also doesn't want her kids coming over because they're not well-behaved except for the oldest three. Plus, she's made an effort in the past by bringing desserts and helping with Christmas, so maybe she feels she's contributed enough without hosting.\n\nOn the other hand, the sister might feel hurt or rejected because the author is turning down a request to host a family event. The sister might have felt that the author is being selfish, especially since they usually meet at her place. But the author has her reasons related to safety and logistics.\n\nI should check if there's any obligation for the author to host. Since they live 5 hours apart and the author usually travels to her sister's, maybe the sister knew it was a big ask. The author's refusal isn't about the sister's kids necessarily but about the specific event's risks. The sister's reaction of calling her an asshole might be harsh, but maybe the author's response was justified given the circumstances.\n\nAlso, the author's house isn't designed for such an event. Hosting 50 people with 14 kids in a non-child-proof environment is a lot. The liability issues with the pool are a real concern. So, the author isn't necessarily being selfish but is prioritizing safety and comfort.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's reasons seem valid. She's not in the wrong for declining based on safety and practicality. The sister's feelings are hurt, but the author isn't obligated to host under those conditions. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
