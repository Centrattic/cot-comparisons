It's as chaotic and nightmarish as you can imagine. Usually she never asks to come over to my place because it's a nightmare to travel with 14 kids to come visit their auntie who lives 5 hours away. If we're having a gathering it's always me who is travelling to their place. I don't really mind. We only meet a few times a year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few years ago I bought my dream house with my husband. My sister asked to host my nephew's 3rd birthday party at my house. She wants to use the big backyard, grill and pool at my home. There are roughly 50 people who are invited. I said no and she called me selfish and an asshole. Her kids have never been to my house and I prefer it that way. Her kids are not very well behaved except for the oldest three and my house is not child-poof. The pool seems like a huge liability. I don't want children drowning on my property. It just seems like a recipe for disaster. She brought up the fact that she hosted Christmas at her house for the past 10+ years at her house, but I don't think it's fair to compare this to that. We meet at her house instead of our parents because she has 14 kids to herd around so it's really more out of convenience to her. Every year for the past 10+ years I buy dessert enough to feed 25 people so I've done my part with the food arrangements. That's 8 apple pies or 3 cakes worth of dessert. My parents also stay over to help prepare and cook and we all contribute to the washing and cleaning. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe haven't spoken in 2 months because of this. She firmly believes AITA. So, AITA for not allowing my sister to host my nephew's birthday party at my house? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for not letting their sister host a birthday party at their house. The sister has 14 kids, which is a lot, and the writer is concerned about safety and chaos. \n\nFirst, the writer bought their dream home, which they probably want to keep in good condition. Allowing 50 people with 14 kids to use the backyard, pool, and grill could be risky. The writer mentions safety concerns, like the pool being a liability. That's a valid point because kids around pools can be dangerous, and the writer isn't responsible for any accidents.\n\nThe sister is upset and called the writer selfish. But the writer has a right to set boundaries, especially regarding their property. They don't see their sister's kids often, and the previous gatherings were at the sister's house with contributions from the writer. The writer also mentions not wanting the kids in their house because they\u2019re not well-behaved except for the oldest three. That's a personal choice, and they should be allowed to prioritize their own comfort and safety.\n\nThe sister's argument about hosting Christmas for years might not be directly relevant here. Different events have different needs. The birthday has a pool and more kids, which up the risk. The writer has already contributed food in the past, so maybe they don't need to host this time.\n\nThe fact that they haven't spoken in two months shows the sister is holding a grudge, but the writer's decision is about their own home and safety. It seems reasonable for them to say no without being in the wrong. So, the answer is B.\n"
