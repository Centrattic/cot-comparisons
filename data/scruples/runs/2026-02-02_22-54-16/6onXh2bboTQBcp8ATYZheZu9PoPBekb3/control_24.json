It's as chaotic and nightmarish as you can imagine. Usually she never asks to come over to my place because it's a nightmare to travel with 14 kids to come visit their auntie who lives 5 hours away. If we're having a gathering it's always me who is travelling to their place. I don't really mind. We only meet a few times a year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few years ago I bought my dream house with my husband. My sister asked to host my nephew's 3rd birthday party at my house. She wants to use the big backyard, grill and pool at my home. There are roughly 50 people who are invited. I said no and she called me selfish and an asshole. Her kids have never been to my house and I prefer it that way. Her kids are not very well behaved except for the oldest three and my house is not child-poof. The pool seems like a huge liability. I don't want children drowning on my property. It just seems like a recipe for disaster. She brought up the fact that she hosted Christmas at her house for the past 10+ years at her house, but I don't think it's fair to compare this to that. We meet at her house instead of our parents because she has 14 kids to herd around so it's really more out of convenience to her. Every year for the past 10+ years I buy dessert enough to feed 25 people so I've done my part with the food arrangements. That's 8 apple pies or 3 cakes worth of dessert. My parents also stay over to help prepare and cook and we all contribute to the washing and cleaning. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe haven't spoken in 2 months because of this. She firmly believes AITA. So, AITA for not allowing my sister to host my nephew's birthday party at my house? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a sister not allowing another sister to host a birthday party at her house because of the 14 kids and the potential chaos.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author has a dream house, which is important. The sister wants to host a party with 50 people, using the backyard, grill, and pool. The author is worried about safety, especially the pool being a liability. The sister has 14 kids, most of whom aren't well-behaved, and they've never been to the author's house. The sister called the author selfish and an asshole, and they haven't spoken in two months.\n\nThe author mentions that they usually travel to the sister's house for gatherings, so maybe there's a pattern here. The sister's argument is that she hosted Christmas for 10+ years, but the author thinks the situations are different. The author also points out that they contribute with desserts and other help at the sister's house.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, the author is setting boundaries. They have a valid concern about safety, especially with the pool. They also don't want their house to be overwhelmed by 14 kids plus 50 guests. The sister's reaction seems harsh, but maybe the author could have explained their reasons better. However, the sister's demand might be unreasonable given the circumstances. The author isn't obligated to host, especially when it's their own home. They've been considerate by meeting at the sister's place before. The sister's hosting the Christmas event doesn't make the author obligated to host this party. The author's reasons are safety and avoiding chaos, which are legitimate. So, the answer would likely be B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
