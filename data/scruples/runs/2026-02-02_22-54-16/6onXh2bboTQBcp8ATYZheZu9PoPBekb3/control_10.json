It's as chaotic and nightmarish as you can imagine. Usually she never asks to come over to my place because it's a nightmare to travel with 14 kids to come visit their auntie who lives 5 hours away. If we're having a gathering it's always me who is travelling to their place. I don't really mind. We only meet a few times a year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few years ago I bought my dream house with my husband. My sister asked to host my nephew's 3rd birthday party at my house. She wants to use the big backyard, grill and pool at my home. There are roughly 50 people who are invited. I said no and she called me selfish and an asshole. Her kids have never been to my house and I prefer it that way. Her kids are not very well behaved except for the oldest three and my house is not child-poof. The pool seems like a huge liability. I don't want children drowning on my property. It just seems like a recipe for disaster. She brought up the fact that she hosted Christmas at her house for the past 10+ years at her house, but I don't think it's fair to compare this to that. We meet at her house instead of our parents because she has 14 kids to herd around so it's really more out of convenience to her. Every year for the past 10+ years I buy dessert enough to feed 25 people so I've done my part with the food arrangements. That's 8 apple pies or 3 cakes worth of dessert. My parents also stay over to help prepare and cook and we all contribute to the washing and cleaning. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe haven't spoken in 2 months because of this. She firmly believes AITA. So, AITA for not allowing my sister to host my nephew's birthday party at my house? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for not letting their sister host a birthday party at their house.\n\nFirst, the situation: The sister has 14 kids, which the author describes as chaotic. The author bought their dream house and the sister wanted to host a 50-person party there. The author refused, citing safety concerns like the pool and the house not being childproof. The sister got upset, called them names, and they haven't spoken in two months.\n\nI need to consider both sides. The author's reasons for saying no are about safety and comfort. They mention the pool being a liability and the house not being childproof. Also, they've always met at the sister's house before because it's easier for the sister to manage her kids. The sister is arguing that it's about fairness, comparing to past Christmases where they hosted at her place.\n\nBut wait, the sister is asking to use the author's home, which is a big ask. The author has a right to set boundaries, especially regarding safety. The number of kids and the potential chaos could be overwhelming. The sister might feel slighted, but the author's main concern is legitimate. Also, the sister's kids haven't even been to the author's house before, so maybe the author isn't being selfish but protecting their property and safety.\n\nOn the other hand, the sister's argument is that the author is being selfish. But the author points out that they've always come to the sister's place before and contributed with desserts and help. The sister's previous hosting of major events doesn't necessarily obligate the author to host this party. The author's refusal is based on valid safety concerns, not just personal preference.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author is not in the wrong. They have a right to say no to hosting such a large, potentially unsafe event at their home. The sister's reaction might be excessive, but the author's decision is justified.\n"
