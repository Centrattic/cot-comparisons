It's as chaotic and nightmarish as you can imagine. Usually she never asks to come over to my place because it's a nightmare to travel with 14 kids to come visit their auntie who lives 5 hours away. If we're having a gathering it's always me who is travelling to their place. I don't really mind. We only meet a few times a year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few years ago I bought my dream house with my husband. My sister asked to host my nephew's 3rd birthday party at my house. She wants to use the big backyard, grill and pool at my home. There are roughly 50 people who are invited. I said no and she called me selfish and an asshole. Her kids have never been to my house and I prefer it that way. Her kids are not very well behaved except for the oldest three and my house is not child-poof. The pool seems like a huge liability. I don't want children drowning on my property. It just seems like a recipe for disaster. She brought up the fact that she hosted Christmas at her house for the past 10+ years at her house, but I don't think it's fair to compare this to that. We meet at her house instead of our parents because she has 14 kids to herd around so it's really more out of convenience to her. Every year for the past 10+ years I buy dessert enough to feed 25 people so I've done my part with the food arrangements. That's 8 apple pies or 3 cakes worth of dessert. My parents also stay over to help prepare and cook and we all contribute to the washing and cleaning. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe haven't spoken in 2 months because of this. She firmly believes AITA. So, AITA for not allowing my sister to host my nephew's birthday party at my house? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for not letting their sister host a birthday party at their house. Let's break down the details.\n\nFirst, the sister has 14 kids. The writer bought a dream house with their husband. The sister asked to use the backyard, grill, and pool for a birthday party with 50 guests. The writer refused, citing safety concerns and the chaos of 14 kids. The sister is upset, called them selfish, and they haven't spoken in two months.\n\nSo, considering the reasons the writer gave: the house isn't child-proof, the pool could be dangerous, and the number of kids (14) plus 50 guests is a lot. The writer also mentions they usually come to the sister's house for gatherings, not the other way around. The sister hosted Christmas for years, but the writer thinks that's different because it's more convenient for the sister to have everyone at once.\n\nThe sister's argument is that she's hosted before and the writer should allow it. But the writer has valid safety concerns. The pool liability is a big one. If a kid drowned, that would be a tragedy. The writer isn't obligated to host, especially with such a large group and young kids. Also, the sister's kids aren't well-behaved except the oldest three, which adds to the risk.\n\nThe sister called the writer selfish, but the writer's reasoning is about safety and practicality, not just being selfish. They've participated in the Christmas gatherings by contributing desserts and helping, so they aren't avoiding responsibility entirely. The sister might feel entitled because she's done this before, but that doesn't mean the writer has to agree. The writer has the right to set boundaries for their home and safety. The sister's reaction seems harsh, but the writer's stance is understandable. So, the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
