It's as chaotic and nightmarish as you can imagine. Usually she never asks to come over to my place because it's a nightmare to travel with 14 kids to come visit their auntie who lives 5 hours away. If we're having a gathering it's always me who is travelling to their place. I don't really mind. We only meet a few times a year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few years ago I bought my dream house with my husband. My sister asked to host my nephew's 3rd birthday party at my house. She wants to use the big backyard, grill and pool at my home. There are roughly 50 people who are invited. I said no and she called me selfish and an asshole. Her kids have never been to my house and I prefer it that way. Her kids are not very well behaved except for the oldest three and my house is not child-poof. The pool seems like a huge liability. I don't want children drowning on my property. It just seems like a recipe for disaster. She brought up the fact that she hosted Christmas at her house for the past 10+ years at her house, but I don't think it's fair to compare this to that. We meet at her house instead of our parents because she has 14 kids to herd around so it's really more out of convenience to her. Every year for the past 10+ years I buy dessert enough to feed 25 people so I've done my part with the food arrangements. That's 8 apple pies or 3 cakes worth of dessert. My parents also stay over to help prepare and cook and we all contribute to the washing and cleaning. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe haven't spoken in 2 months because of this. She firmly believes AITA. So, AITA for not allowing my sister to host my nephew's birthday party at my house? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again.\n\nThe author says their sister has 14 kids, which is a lot, and that hosting a party at their house would be chaotic. The sister wanted to use the backyard, grill, and pool for a 3-year-old's birthday with 50 guests. The author refused, and the sister called them selfish. The author mentions that their house isn't \"child-proof,\" and they're worried about the pool being a liability. They also point out that they usually go to the sister's house for gatherings and have contributed food in the past. Now they're not talking because of this.\n\nFirst, I should consider the author's reasons for saying no. The main concerns are the number of kids, the size of the event, and the potential safety issues with the pool. Hosting 50 people with 14 kids in a non-child-proof house sounds really overwhelming. The pool being a liability is a valid safety concern\u2014children can drown, and the author isn't responsible for that. Also, the sister's kids aren't well-behaved except for the oldest three, which adds to the stress.\n\nOn the sister's side, she might feel that the author is being selfish because they've hosted other events in the past, like Christmas, and contributed food. But the author points out that Christmas was at the sister's home, which is more convenient for her 14 kids. The author has been willing to travel to the sister's place, but the sister is now asking for the opposite. The author might be setting boundaries about their own home and safety.\n\nIs it fair to compare the Christmas gathering to the birthday party? The author doesn't think so. The Christmas event at the sister's home was a different scenario, and the author contributed there. Now, the sister is asking for the author to host, which is a different dynamic. The author's house is not set up for such a large, chaotic event with young kids and a pool. The author has the right to say no to protect their property and safety.\n\nThe sister calling the author selfish and an asshole might be an overreaction, but the author's refusal is based on valid concerns. The author isn't obligated to host the party, especially when it's a significant burden and potential risk. The sister's expectation might not have considered the author's perspective and the specific challenges involved.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that the sister's kids have never been to their house before, so maybe the author is trying to maintain a boundary to avoid the chaos. The fact that the sister hasn't been to the author's house and the author prefers it that way adds another layer. The author is in their own home and has the right to decide who comes in and under what circumstances.\n\nIn terms of fairness, the author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing their own well-being and safety over the sister's request. The sister's reaction might be harsh, but the author's reasons are justified. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
