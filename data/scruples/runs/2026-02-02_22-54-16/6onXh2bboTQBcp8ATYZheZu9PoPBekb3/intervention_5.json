It's as chaotic and nightmarish as you can imagine. Usually she never asks to come over to my place because it's a nightmare to travel with 14 kids to come visit their auntie who lives 5 hours away. If we're having a gathering it's always me who is travelling to their place. I don't really mind. We only meet a few times a year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few years ago I bought my dream house with my husband. My sister asked to host my nephew's 3rd birthday party at my house. She wants to use the big backyard, grill and pool at my home. There are roughly 50 people who are invited. I said no and she called me selfish and an asshole. Her kids have never been to my house and I prefer it that way. Her kids are not very well behaved except for the oldest three and my house is not child-poof. The pool seems like a huge liability. I don't want children drowning on my property. It just seems like a recipe for disaster. She brought up the fact that she hosted Christmas at her house for the past 10+ years at her house, but I don't think it's fair to compare this to that. We meet at her house instead of our parents because she has 14 kids to herd around so it's really more out of convenience to her. Every year for the past 10+ years I buy dessert enough to feed 25 people so I've done my part with the food arrangements. That's 8 apple pies or 3 cakes worth of dessert. My parents also stay over to help prepare and cook and we all contribute to the washing and cleaning. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe haven't spoken in 2 months because of this. She firmly believes AITA. So, AITA for not allowing my sister to host my nephew's birthday party at my house? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the sister has 14 kids and has never hosted a birthday party at the author's house. The author bought a dream house and the sister asked to use it for the nephew's birthday, which would involve 50 people. The author said no, and the sister got upset, leading to a two-month silence.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the reasons the author gave. The house isn't childproof, the pool is a liability, and the sister's kids aren't well-behaved except for the oldest three. The author also mentions that the sister usually hosts gatherings at her own house because it's more convenient with so many kids. The author's refusal is based on safety concerns and the potential for chaos.\n\nThe sister argues that she's hosted Christmas for 10+ years there and that the author has contributed with desserts. But the author points out that the Christmas gatherings are at the sister's house, which makes sense given the 14 kids. Hosting a birthday at the author's house would mean the author has to manage the chaos of 14 kids plus 50 guests, which is a lot. The pool liability is a real concern; if something happened, the author could be legally responsible.\n\nAlso, the sister has never visited the author's house with her kids, so maybe she's not aware of the specific issues with the property. The author's preference to keep it that way makes sense. The sister's reaction of calling the author selfish might be because she expected the help, but the author's right to set boundaries, especially regarding their own home and safety, seems valid.\n\nThe key points here are personal boundaries, safety, and the balance of responsibility. The author isn't obligated to host others, especially when it involves risks. The sister's past hosting at her own home doesn't negate the author's right to say no in this different scenario. The author has contributed in other ways (desserts), but hosting a party at someone else's house is a different level of commitment. \n\nI think the author is justified in saying no. They have valid safety concerns and a preference to avoid the chaos. The sister's reaction might be harsh, but the author's decision is reasonable. So the answer should be B (No, the author isn't in the wrong).\n"
