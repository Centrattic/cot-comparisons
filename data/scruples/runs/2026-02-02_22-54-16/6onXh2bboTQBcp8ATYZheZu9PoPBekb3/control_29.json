It's as chaotic and nightmarish as you can imagine. Usually she never asks to come over to my place because it's a nightmare to travel with 14 kids to come visit their auntie who lives 5 hours away. If we're having a gathering it's always me who is travelling to their place. I don't really mind. We only meet a few times a year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few years ago I bought my dream house with my husband. My sister asked to host my nephew's 3rd birthday party at my house. She wants to use the big backyard, grill and pool at my home. There are roughly 50 people who are invited. I said no and she called me selfish and an asshole. Her kids have never been to my house and I prefer it that way. Her kids are not very well behaved except for the oldest three and my house is not child-poof. The pool seems like a huge liability. I don't want children drowning on my property. It just seems like a recipe for disaster. She brought up the fact that she hosted Christmas at her house for the past 10+ years at her house, but I don't think it's fair to compare this to that. We meet at her house instead of our parents because she has 14 kids to herd around so it's really more out of convenience to her. Every year for the past 10+ years I buy dessert enough to feed 25 people so I've done my part with the food arrangements. That's 8 apple pies or 3 cakes worth of dessert. My parents also stay over to help prepare and cook and we all contribute to the washing and cleaning. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe haven't spoken in 2 months because of this. She firmly believes AITA. So, AITA for not allowing my sister to host my nephew's birthday party at my house? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The user is asking for an answer between A and B, where A means the author is wrong, and B means they're not.\n\nFirst, let's recap the situation. The author has a sister with 14 kids, which is a lot. They live 5 hours apart, so when they meet, it's usually the author traveling to their sister's place. The sister wanted to host a nephew's birthday at the author's house, but the author said no. The sister got upset, called her names, and they haven't spoken in two months.\n\nThe author's reasons for saying no are safety concerns: the sister's kids aren't well-behaved except for the oldest three, the house isn't child-proof, and the pool could be a liability. Also, the author doesn't want her kids coming to her house ever because they haven't and she prefers it that way. The sister tried to compare it to hosting Christmas for years, but the author argues that's different because the sister needs the space for 14 kids, which is more convenient there.\n\nNow, considering the sister's perspective, she might feel that since they've always met at her house, maybe the author should reciprocate. But the author has valid safety concerns. The sister's kids haven't been to the author's house before, so maybe the author has a right to set boundaries. Also, the author mentions contributing to the Christmas gatherings with desserts and others help with hosting, so maybe she's already helping in other ways.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the sister's request was to host a party that could pose risks. The author isn't obligated to allow that. The sister's reaction might be harsh, but the author's reasons are legitimate. The fact that they haven't spoken in two months is unfortunate, but maybe the sister overreacted. The author isn't being selfish if she's concerned about safety. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
