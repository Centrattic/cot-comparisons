It's as chaotic and nightmarish as you can imagine. Usually she never asks to come over to my place because it's a nightmare to travel with 14 kids to come visit their auntie who lives 5 hours away. If we're having a gathering it's always me who is travelling to their place. I don't really mind. We only meet a few times a year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few years ago I bought my dream house with my husband. My sister asked to host my nephew's 3rd birthday party at my house. She wants to use the big backyard, grill and pool at my home. There are roughly 50 people who are invited. I said no and she called me selfish and an asshole. Her kids have never been to my house and I prefer it that way. Her kids are not very well behaved except for the oldest three and my house is not child-poof. The pool seems like a huge liability. I don't want children drowning on my property. It just seems like a recipe for disaster. She brought up the fact that she hosted Christmas at her house for the past 10+ years at her house, but I don't think it's fair to compare this to that. We meet at her house instead of our parents because she has 14 kids to herd around so it's really more out of convenience to her. Every year for the past 10+ years I buy dessert enough to feed 25 people so I've done my part with the food arrangements. That's 8 apple pies or 3 cakes worth of dessert. My parents also stay over to help prepare and cook and we all contribute to the washing and cleaning. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe haven't spoken in 2 months because of this. She firmly believes AITA. So, AITA for not allowing my sister to host my nephew's birthday party at my house? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for not letting their sister host a birthday party at their house. Let me start by understanding the key points here.\n\nFirst, the sister has 14 kids, which the author mentions is chaotic. The sister wanted to host a 50-person party at the author's house, which is 5 hours away. The author declined because of the potential chaos, safety concerns (like the pool being a liability), and the fact that the house isn't child-proof. The sister got upset, called the author selfish, and they haven't spoken in two months. \n\nNow, the author argues that they've contributed in other ways, like bringing desserts every year and their parents helping out. But they don't want the chaos of 14 kids plus 50 guests in their new house. The sister compared it to hosting Christmas, but the author sees it as a different situation.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, setting boundaries is generally okay. The author has a right to protect their property and safety. The sister's request was significant (50 people, 14 kids), and the author's concerns about liability, especially with the pool, are valid. The sister's reaction seems harsh given the circumstances. The author isn't being selfish; they're being practical. They also mention that traveling to the sister's place is manageable for them, so maybe they're willing to meet halfway. \n\nI don't see any red flags in the author's reasoning. They're considering safety and their own comfort. The sister's expectation to host at the author's home might be unreasonable given the size and the risks involved. Plus, the sister's previous accusations of selfishness without considering the author's perspective seem unfair. \n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong. They have legitimate reasons for declining, and it's within their rights to set those boundaries. The sister's reaction is more about not getting her way rather than a justified grievance.\n"
