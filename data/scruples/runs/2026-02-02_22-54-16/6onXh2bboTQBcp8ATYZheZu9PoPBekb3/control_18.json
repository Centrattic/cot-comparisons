It's as chaotic and nightmarish as you can imagine. Usually she never asks to come over to my place because it's a nightmare to travel with 14 kids to come visit their auntie who lives 5 hours away. If we're having a gathering it's always me who is travelling to their place. I don't really mind. We only meet a few times a year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few years ago I bought my dream house with my husband. My sister asked to host my nephew's 3rd birthday party at my house. She wants to use the big backyard, grill and pool at my home. There are roughly 50 people who are invited. I said no and she called me selfish and an asshole. Her kids have never been to my house and I prefer it that way. Her kids are not very well behaved except for the oldest three and my house is not child-poof. The pool seems like a huge liability. I don't want children drowning on my property. It just seems like a recipe for disaster. She brought up the fact that she hosted Christmas at her house for the past 10+ years at her house, but I don't think it's fair to compare this to that. We meet at her house instead of our parents because she has 14 kids to herd around so it's really more out of convenience to her. Every year for the past 10+ years I buy dessert enough to feed 25 people so I've done my part with the food arrangements. That's 8 apple pies or 3 cakes worth of dessert. My parents also stay over to help prepare and cook and we all contribute to the washing and cleaning. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe haven't spoken in 2 months because of this. She firmly believes AITA. So, AITA for not allowing my sister to host my nephew's birthday party at my house? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not allowing her sister to host the birthday party at her house. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the sister has 14 kids, which is a lot. The author has a dream house with a big backyard, grill, and pool. The sister wanted to host a 50-person party there. The author refused, citing concerns about the chaos, the kids' behavior, and safety issues like the pool being a liability. The sister felt it was unfair and called her names, leading to a 2-month silence.\n\nThe key points here are the author's reasons for declining. She mentions the logistical nightmare of 14 kids coming to her house, which is 5 hours away. They usually meet at the sister's place because it's more convenient. The author also points out that her house isn't \"child-proof,\" and the pool is a safety risk. She's not against helping, as she's contributed desserts for years and the family helps with the event. The sister's argument is that she's hosted Christmas for years, but the author thinks comparing the two is unfair because the scale and setting are different.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. The sister's request was to host a party at the author's home, which is a personal decision. The author is not obligated to allow her home to be used for such an event, especially with the potential risks involved. The sister's past hosting of Christmas doesn't obligate the author to extend the same this time. The author has valid concerns about safety and the stress of managing a large group of children in her home. The sister's reaction seems harsh, but the author's refusal is based on her own boundaries and safety considerations. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. She has the right to set boundaries for her home and prioritize her safety and comfort. The sister's feelings of betrayal might be valid, but the author's reasons are justified. Therefore, the answer should be B."
