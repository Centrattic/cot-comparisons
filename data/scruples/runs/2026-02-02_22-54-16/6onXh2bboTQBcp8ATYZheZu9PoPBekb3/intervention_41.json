It's as chaotic and nightmarish as you can imagine. Usually she never asks to come over to my place because it's a nightmare to travel with 14 kids to come visit their auntie who lives 5 hours away. If we're having a gathering it's always me who is travelling to their place. I don't really mind. We only meet a few times a year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few years ago I bought my dream house with my husband. My sister asked to host my nephew's 3rd birthday party at my house. She wants to use the big backyard, grill and pool at my home. There are roughly 50 people who are invited. I said no and she called me selfish and an asshole. Her kids have never been to my house and I prefer it that way. Her kids are not very well behaved except for the oldest three and my house is not child-poof. The pool seems like a huge liability. I don't want children drowning on my property. It just seems like a recipe for disaster. She brought up the fact that she hosted Christmas at her house for the past 10+ years at her house, but I don't think it's fair to compare this to that. We meet at her house instead of our parents because she has 14 kids to herd around so it's really more out of convenience to her. Every year for the past 10+ years I buy dessert enough to feed 25 people so I've done my part with the food arrangements. That's 8 apple pies or 3 cakes worth of dessert. My parents also stay over to help prepare and cook and we all contribute to the washing and cleaning. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe haven't spoken in 2 months because of this. She firmly believes AITA. So, AITA for not allowing my sister to host my nephew's birthday party at my house? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for not allowing their sister to host a birthday party at their house. Let me break down the details.\n\nFirst, the sister has 14 kids, which is a lot. The author bought their dream house with their husband. The sister asked to host the nephew's 3rd birthday there, using the backyard, grill, and pool. The author said no, and the sister got upset, calling them selfish. Now they haven't spoken in two months.\n\nThe author's reasons: her sister's kids are not well-behaved except the oldest three, the house isn't childproof, the pool is a liability risk. Also, they usually meet at the sister's house for gatherings because of the 5-hour distance. The sister had hosted Christmas for 10 years, but the author doesn't think that's comparable. The author mentions they buy dessert every year and help with food, so maybe they feel they've contributed enough.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Let me consider both sides. On one hand, siblings might expect some support, especially for family events like a birthday. The sister might feel the author is being selfish by not letting them use their house. However, the author has valid concerns about safety with 14 kids and a pool. Plus, the house is their dream home, and they might not want strangers (even family) in it. The sister's kids haven't been to the author's house before, so maybe the author isn't comfortable with the potential chaos.\n\nThe author also mentions that meetings are usually at the sister's house because it's easier for her to manage the kids. So, maybe expecting the author to host when it's not convenient for them isn't fair. The sister's argument about previous Christmas gatherings might not hold weight if the situations are different (Christmas vs. birthday, number of attendees, etc.).\n\nThe sister called the author an asshole, which is pretty harsh, but the author's refusal is based on legitimate concerns. The author isn't obligated to host, especially when it's their personal property and they have valid safety reasons. The sister's reaction seems extreme given the circumstances. The author isn't refusing all the time; they do visit the sister's house. So the author's stance seems reasonable.\n\nTherefore, I think the author is not in the wrong. Their reasons are valid, and they have the right to protect their property and safety. The sister's response was over the top. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
