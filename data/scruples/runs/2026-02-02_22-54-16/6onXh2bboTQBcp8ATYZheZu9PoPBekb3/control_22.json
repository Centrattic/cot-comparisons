It's as chaotic and nightmarish as you can imagine. Usually she never asks to come over to my place because it's a nightmare to travel with 14 kids to come visit their auntie who lives 5 hours away. If we're having a gathering it's always me who is travelling to their place. I don't really mind. We only meet a few times a year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few years ago I bought my dream house with my husband. My sister asked to host my nephew's 3rd birthday party at my house. She wants to use the big backyard, grill and pool at my home. There are roughly 50 people who are invited. I said no and she called me selfish and an asshole. Her kids have never been to my house and I prefer it that way. Her kids are not very well behaved except for the oldest three and my house is not child-poof. The pool seems like a huge liability. I don't want children drowning on my property. It just seems like a recipe for disaster. She brought up the fact that she hosted Christmas at her house for the past 10+ years at her house, but I don't think it's fair to compare this to that. We meet at her house instead of our parents because she has 14 kids to herd around so it's really more out of convenience to her. Every year for the past 10+ years I buy dessert enough to feed 25 people so I've done my part with the food arrangements. That's 8 apple pies or 3 cakes worth of dessert. My parents also stay over to help prepare and cook and we all contribute to the washing and cleaning. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe haven't spoken in 2 months because of this. She firmly believes AITA. So, AITA for not allowing my sister to host my nephew's birthday party at my house? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong for not letting their sister host a birthday party at their house.\n\nFirst, the sister has 14 kids, which the author says is chaotic. The sister never asks to come to the author's house before because it's a 5-hour trip, and gatherings are always at the sister's place. The author doesn't mind visiting their sister's home since they meet a few times a year. Now, the sister wants to host a kid's birthday at the author's new house, which has a backyard, grill, and pool. The author says no, citing safety concerns (pool liability, kids not well-behaved, and the house not being child-proof). The sister got upset, called them selfish, and they haven't spoken in two months.\n\nThe key points here are the author's reasons for saying no. They mentioned the pool being a liability, the kids being unruly, and the house not being child-proof. These are practical and safety concerns. The sister's previous hosting at her own home, which is more suitable for such a large group, especially with 14 kids. The author has been contributing to the Christmas gatherings by bringing desserts and others help with cooking and cleaning. \n\nThe sister might feel hurt because she's used to hosting there, but the author has a right to set boundaries for their own home. It's a large event, and the author's new house isn't equipped to handle 50 people with 14 kids. The distance also plays a role\u2014traveling 5 hours is impractical for a party they usually host at the sister's. The author isn't being asked to host the party, just to allow their property to be used by the sister. The sister's comparison to Christmas might be invalid because those events are at her home, which is more accustomed to such gatherings.\n\nPossible counterarguments: Maybe the sister felt entitled because she's hosted before, but the author's home is different. The author's safety concerns are valid, especially with a pool. Also, the sister's kids not being well-behaved adds to the problem. The author isn't forcing the sister to host; they are declining an offer. The sister might be inconsiderate by not respecting the author's boundaries. \n\nConsidering all this, the answer is likely B (author is not in the wrong). They are prioritizing their own home's safety and their comfort, and it's reasonable to set such boundaries. The sister's reaction seems harsh given the circumstances. The author has provided a valid reason and isn't obligated to host the party at their house, especially when the sister has a suitable place of her own. The fact that they usually meet at the sister's house for convenience supports the author's stance.\n"
