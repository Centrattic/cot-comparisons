It's as chaotic and nightmarish as you can imagine. Usually she never asks to come over to my place because it's a nightmare to travel with 14 kids to come visit their auntie who lives 5 hours away. If we're having a gathering it's always me who is travelling to their place. I don't really mind. We only meet a few times a year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few years ago I bought my dream house with my husband. My sister asked to host my nephew's 3rd birthday party at my house. She wants to use the big backyard, grill and pool at my home. There are roughly 50 people who are invited. I said no and she called me selfish and an asshole. Her kids have never been to my house and I prefer it that way. Her kids are not very well behaved except for the oldest three and my house is not child-poof. The pool seems like a huge liability. I don't want children drowning on my property. It just seems like a recipe for disaster. She brought up the fact that she hosted Christmas at her house for the past 10+ years at her house, but I don't think it's fair to compare this to that. We meet at her house instead of our parents because she has 14 kids to herd around so it's really more out of convenience to her. Every year for the past 10+ years I buy dessert enough to feed 25 people so I've done my part with the food arrangements. That's 8 apple pies or 3 cakes worth of dessert. My parents also stay over to help prepare and cook and we all contribute to the washing and cleaning. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe haven't spoken in 2 months because of this. She firmly believes AITA. So, AITA for not allowing my sister to host my nephew's birthday party at my house? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for not letting their sister host a birthday party at their house. The sister has 14 kids and wants to use the backyard, grill, and pool for a party with 50 people. The author says no because of safety concerns, especially with the pool, and because their house isn't child-proof.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the main points. The author bought their dream house, which means they might have personal space they value. Hosting 50 people, especially with 14 kids, could be overwhelming. The sister's kids aren't well-behaved except for the oldest three, which adds to the risk. The pool being a liability is a valid concern\u2014child safety is a big deal. The sister is upset and called the author names, but the author has reasons based on safety and convenience.\n\nThe sister has hosted Christmas for years, but the author points out that those gatherings are at the sister's house, which is more convenient for her. The author contributes desserts every year, so maybe they've already helped out. The sister's argument about past hosting isn't a fair comparison since the author's house is different in terms of safety and space.\n\nThe author also mentions that their house isn't child-proof, which makes sense because having a house designed as their dream home might not have features to handle many kids. The sister's kids have never been there, so maybe there's a lack of trust or past issues with them being disruptive.\n\nThe key factors here are safety, personal boundaries, and the author's right to control their own property. The sister's reaction might stem from feeling slighted, but the author's reasons are practical and responsible. Not allowing the party doesn't seem like selfishness but a decision based on real concerns. So, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
