It's as chaotic and nightmarish as you can imagine. Usually she never asks to come over to my place because it's a nightmare to travel with 14 kids to come visit their auntie who lives 5 hours away. If we're having a gathering it's always me who is travelling to their place. I don't really mind. We only meet a few times a year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few years ago I bought my dream house with my husband. My sister asked to host my nephew's 3rd birthday party at my house. She wants to use the big backyard, grill and pool at my home. There are roughly 50 people who are invited. I said no and she called me selfish and an asshole. Her kids have never been to my house and I prefer it that way. Her kids are not very well behaved except for the oldest three and my house is not child-poof. The pool seems like a huge liability. I don't want children drowning on my property. It just seems like a recipe for disaster. She brought up the fact that she hosted Christmas at her house for the past 10+ years at her house, but I don't think it's fair to compare this to that. We meet at her house instead of our parents because she has 14 kids to herd around so it's really more out of convenience to her. Every year for the past 10+ years I buy dessert enough to feed 25 people so I've done my part with the food arrangements. That's 8 apple pies or 3 cakes worth of dessert. My parents also stay over to help prepare and cook and we all contribute to the washing and cleaning. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe haven't spoken in 2 months because of this. She firmly believes AITA. So, AITA for not allowing my sister to host my nephew's birthday party at my house? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person who posted the situation) is in the wrong for not allowing their sister to host a birthday party at their house. The sister has 14 kids, and the author feels it's too much stress and a safety hazard. The sister is upset and hasn't spoken to them for two months.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author bought their dream house and is concerned about the 14 kids, their behavior, and the pool's liability. They mention that their sister usually hosts big events at her place, with the author contributing to food and help. The sister is upset, calling the author selfish, but the author has valid concerns about safety and chaos.\n\nI should think about boundaries in family relationships. The author isn't obligated to host such an event, especially given the risks involved. It's their home, and they have the right to set limits. The sister's reaction of not speaking for two months might be overreacting, but the sister's perspective is that she's used to hosting and expected help from the aunt.\n\nHowever, the sister has a history of hosting big events, but this is different because the author's home is not set up for such a large group of children. The author's reasoning about safety and chaos is valid. The sister might feel taken advantage of, but the author isn't the one hosting the Christmas gatherings; the sister does that herself. The author's contribution with food and help seems to show they aren't entirely avoiding responsibility, but they have legitimate reasons for not hosting this time.\n\nSo, considering the author's safety concerns and the fact that it's their home, they aren't in the wrong. The sister's reaction is harsh, but the author isn't obligated to say yes. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
