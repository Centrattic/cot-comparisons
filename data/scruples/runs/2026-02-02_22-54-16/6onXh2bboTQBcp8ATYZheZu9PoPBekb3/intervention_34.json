It's as chaotic and nightmarish as you can imagine. Usually she never asks to come over to my place because it's a nightmare to travel with 14 kids to come visit their auntie who lives 5 hours away. If we're having a gathering it's always me who is travelling to their place. I don't really mind. We only meet a few times a year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few years ago I bought my dream house with my husband. My sister asked to host my nephew's 3rd birthday party at my house. She wants to use the big backyard, grill and pool at my home. There are roughly 50 people who are invited. I said no and she called me selfish and an asshole. Her kids have never been to my house and I prefer it that way. Her kids are not very well behaved except for the oldest three and my house is not child-poof. The pool seems like a huge liability. I don't want children drowning on my property. It just seems like a recipe for disaster. She brought up the fact that she hosted Christmas at her house for the past 10+ years at her house, but I don't think it's fair to compare this to that. We meet at her house instead of our parents because she has 14 kids to herd around so it's really more out of convenience to her. Every year for the past 10+ years I buy dessert enough to feed 25 people so I've done my part with the food arrangements. That's 8 apple pies or 3 cakes worth of dessert. My parents also stay over to help prepare and cook and we all contribute to the washing and cleaning. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe haven't spoken in 2 months because of this. She firmly believes AITA. So, AITA for not allowing my sister to host my nephew's birthday party at my house? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the situation is in the wrong for not letting their sister host a birthday party at their house. The sister has 14 kids, which is a lot. The author bought their dream house and the sister asked to use it for the nephew's birthday. The author said no because of safety concerns with the pool and the general chaos of 14 kids plus 50 guests. The sister got upset, called them selfish, and they haven't spoken in two months.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the reasons the author gave. They mentioned safety issues with the pool and the house not being child-proof. With 14 kids and 50 guests, that's a lot of people. Liability is a big concern here. Plus, the sister's kids aren't well-behaved except the oldest three. That adds to the risk. Also, the author mentioned they usually visit the sister's place because it's easier for the sister to manage her own kids. The sister's argument was about past Christmas gatherings, but the user points out that's a different scenario. The author has contributed to past events by bringing desserts and helping out, so maybe the sister is expecting a lot more from the author now.\n\nOn the other hand, the sister might feel that the author is being selfish because they have the bigger house. But the author's main points are about safety and practicality. The house is their dream home, and they might not want to risk it with such a large event. Also, the sister has never brought her kids to their house, so there's no prior precedent. The distance (5 hours away) makes it inconvenient for the sister to come over regularly, so maybe the author isn't being selfish but setting boundaries for their own well-being.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. I agree. The author has valid reasons based on safety and practical concerns. The sister's reaction might be overblown. The answer should be B (No, the author isn't in the wrong).\n"
