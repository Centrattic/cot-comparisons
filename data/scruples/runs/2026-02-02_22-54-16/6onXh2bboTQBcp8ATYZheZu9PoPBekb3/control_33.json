It's as chaotic and nightmarish as you can imagine. Usually she never asks to come over to my place because it's a nightmare to travel with 14 kids to come visit their auntie who lives 5 hours away. If we're having a gathering it's always me who is travelling to their place. I don't really mind. We only meet a few times a year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few years ago I bought my dream house with my husband. My sister asked to host my nephew's 3rd birthday party at my house. She wants to use the big backyard, grill and pool at my home. There are roughly 50 people who are invited. I said no and she called me selfish and an asshole. Her kids have never been to my house and I prefer it that way. Her kids are not very well behaved except for the oldest three and my house is not child-poof. The pool seems like a huge liability. I don't want children drowning on my property. It just seems like a recipe for disaster. She brought up the fact that she hosted Christmas at her house for the past 10+ years at her house, but I don't think it's fair to compare this to that. We meet at her house instead of our parents because she has 14 kids to herd around so it's really more out of convenience to her. Every year for the past 10+ years I buy dessert enough to feed 25 people so I've done my part with the food arrangements. That's 8 apple pies or 3 cakes worth of dessert. My parents also stay over to help prepare and cook and we all contribute to the washing and cleaning. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe haven't spoken in 2 months because of this. She firmly believes AITA. So, AITA for not allowing my sister to host my nephew's birthday party at my house? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the person (the author) has a sister with 14 kids. The sister wanted to host her nephew's birthday at the author's house, which is 5 hours away. The author said no, and now there's a fallout. The sister called them selfish and an asshole, and they haven't spoken in two months. The author is asking if they're the asshole here.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the reasons the author gave for refusing. They mention that their house isn't \"child-proof,\" there's a pool which they're worried about as a liability, and they don't want their nephew to drown. Also, the author's sister's kids aren't well-behaved except for the oldest three. Plus, the author doesn't mind traveling to their sister's house for gatherings, but the sister coming to theirs would be a 5-hour trip for 14 kids, which is chaotic.\n\nOn the other hand, the sister argues that she's hosted big events at her house before, like Christmas, and the author has contributed to those with food, etc. So maybe the sister feels she's reciprocated by hosting big events at her place and the author should reciprocate here.\n\nBut let's break it down. The author's main concerns are safety and the practicality of hosting 50 people with 14 kids. The pool is a significant liability. If there's a child drowning, that's a huge issue. Also, the author's house isn't child-proof, so maybe there are other hazards. The sister's kids aren't well-behaved, which adds to the risk of things going wrong. Plus, the travel distance for the sister's kids to come to the author's house is 5 hours, which is a big ask when the author's sister lives further away. The author has always met at the sister's house, so maybe breaking that pattern is part of the issue.\n\nThe sister's argument is that she's hosted big events before, but the author points out that those events were at the sister's home, which is more suitable and perhaps safer given the numbers. The author has contributed to previous events by providing dessert, so maybe the sister feels the author isn't doing enough, but the author is avoiding hosting a much larger and more complex event (birthday party with 50 people and a pool) versus a Christmas gathering, which might be more manageable with the sister's own setup.\n\nAlso, the author's house is their dream home, which they bought with their husband. They might not want to risk damage or have the chaos of 14 kids plus 50 guests. The sister's argument that the author is being selfish might stem from not seeing the safety and logistical concerns.\n\nIn terms of fairness, the author isn't obligated to host. The sister asked for a favor, and the author refused, which is their right. The sister's reaction of calling them an asshole and the two months of silence seems harsh, maybe because the sister didn't consider the author's valid concerns. The author's reasons are about safety and practicality, which are legitimate. The sister might be expecting reciprocity, but if the author's home isn't suitable for such an event, then refusing makes sense. The sister's past hosting doesn't negate the author's current situation and risks.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. They had valid reasons to refuse, and the sister's reaction is maybe over the top. The author isn't obligated to host, especially given the risks involved. The sister could have handled the refusal better, but the author isn't the one in the wrong here.\n"
