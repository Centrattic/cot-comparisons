It's as chaotic and nightmarish as you can imagine. Usually she never asks to come over to my place because it's a nightmare to travel with 14 kids to come visit their auntie who lives 5 hours away. If we're having a gathering it's always me who is travelling to their place. I don't really mind. We only meet a few times a year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few years ago I bought my dream house with my husband. My sister asked to host my nephew's 3rd birthday party at my house. She wants to use the big backyard, grill and pool at my home. There are roughly 50 people who are invited. I said no and she called me selfish and an asshole. Her kids have never been to my house and I prefer it that way. Her kids are not very well behaved except for the oldest three and my house is not child-poof. The pool seems like a huge liability. I don't want children drowning on my property. It just seems like a recipe for disaster. She brought up the fact that she hosted Christmas at her house for the past 10+ years at her house, but I don't think it's fair to compare this to that. We meet at her house instead of our parents because she has 14 kids to herd around so it's really more out of convenience to her. Every year for the past 10+ years I buy dessert enough to feed 25 people so I've done my part with the food arrangements. That's 8 apple pies or 3 cakes worth of dessert. My parents also stay over to help prepare and cook and we all contribute to the washing and cleaning. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe haven't spoken in 2 months because of this. She firmly believes AITA. So, AITA for not allowing my sister to host my nephew's birthday party at my house? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (who is an aunt) is in the wrong for not allowing her sister to host her nephew's birthday at her house. The sister has 14 kids, which is a lot, and the aunt has a dream house with a backyard and pool. The sister called the aunt selfish after she declined.\n\nFirst, the aunt's reasons: she's concerned about the chaos of 14 kids plus 50 guests, the liability of the pool, and that her house isn't childproof. Those seem valid safety and practical concerns. The sister had hosted the Christmas gatherings for years, but the aunt is arguing that this situation is different because it's a birthday party with more kids and a pool. The aunt also mentions contributing to the Christmas events with desserts, so maybe she feels she's already helping enough.\n\nThe sister's perspective is that she's been hosting these big events for years, so she might feel entitled to use the aunt's space. But the aunt is clearly not comfortable with the risks and the logistical nightmare. The fact that the sister's kids have never been to the aunt's house might add to the aunt's anxiety about managing them.\n\nThe key points here are consent and personal boundaries. The aunt isn't obligated to host, especially given the potential dangers. The sister's reaction of calling her an asshole is harsh, which might indicate she's hurt but also maybe not considering the aunt's reasons. However, the aunt did offer to go to their house instead, which is a reasonable alternative. \n\nI think the aunt isn't in the wrong because she's prioritizing safety and her own comfort. The sister's kids aren't hers to manage, and the liability of the pool is a real concern. The aunt isn't refusing to help entirely\u2014she's just changing the venue. The sister might need to accept that her aunt has different capacity and resources. So, answer B.\n"
