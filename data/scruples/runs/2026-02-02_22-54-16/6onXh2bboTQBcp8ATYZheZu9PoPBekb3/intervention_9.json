It's as chaotic and nightmarish as you can imagine. Usually she never asks to come over to my place because it's a nightmare to travel with 14 kids to come visit their auntie who lives 5 hours away. If we're having a gathering it's always me who is travelling to their place. I don't really mind. We only meet a few times a year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few years ago I bought my dream house with my husband. My sister asked to host my nephew's 3rd birthday party at my house. She wants to use the big backyard, grill and pool at my home. There are roughly 50 people who are invited. I said no and she called me selfish and an asshole. Her kids have never been to my house and I prefer it that way. Her kids are not very well behaved except for the oldest three and my house is not child-poof. The pool seems like a huge liability. I don't want children drowning on my property. It just seems like a recipe for disaster. She brought up the fact that she hosted Christmas at her house for the past 10+ years at her house, but I don't think it's fair to compare this to that. We meet at her house instead of our parents because she has 14 kids to herd around so it's really more out of convenience to her. Every year for the past 10+ years I buy dessert enough to feed 25 people so I've done my part with the food arrangements. That's 8 apple pies or 3 cakes worth of dessert. My parents also stay over to help prepare and cook and we all contribute to the washing and cleaning. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe haven't spoken in 2 months because of this. She firmly believes AITA. So, AITA for not allowing my sister to host my nephew's birthday party at my house? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not allowing their sister to host a birthday party at their house. The sister has 14 kids, and the author is concerned about the chaos, safety (especially the pool), and the fact that the kids aren't well-behaved. The sister called them selfish and they haven't spoken in two months.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's perspective. They bought their dream house, which they might want to keep in good condition. Hosting a party with 50 people, especially with 14 kids who aren't well-behaved, could lead to damage or accidents. The pool is a liability, and the author doesn't want to take that risk. Also, the sister's kids have never been to the house before, so the author might not feel responsible for accommodating them now.\n\nOn the sister's side, she might feel that the author is not being supportive, especially since they've hosted Christmas for years. But the Christmas gatherings are at her house, which is more convenient for her 14 kids. The author has contributed with desserts and other help, so maybe the sister is expecting more from the author in terms of hosting.\n\nThe key points here are the author's right to control their property and safety concerns versus the sister's expectations based on past interactions. The author has a valid reason to refuse due to the potential risks and the fact that the sister's kids aren't well-behaved. The sister's accusation of selfishness might be unfounded if the author is protecting their property and safety.\n\nAlso, the fact that the sister's kids have never been to the house before suggests that the author hasn't had to accommodate them in the past, so the sister can't reasonably expect the author to host a party now without prior arrangement or consideration. The author's refusal isn't about not wanting to help but about practical and safety reasons.\n\nSo, based on this, the author isn't in the wrong. They have a right to set boundaries for their home and safety. The sister's reaction might be overly harsh, especially if the author explained their reasons clearly. The answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
