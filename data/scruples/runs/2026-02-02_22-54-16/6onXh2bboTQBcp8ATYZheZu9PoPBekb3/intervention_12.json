It's as chaotic and nightmarish as you can imagine. Usually she never asks to come over to my place because it's a nightmare to travel with 14 kids to come visit their auntie who lives 5 hours away. If we're having a gathering it's always me who is travelling to their place. I don't really mind. We only meet a few times a year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few years ago I bought my dream house with my husband. My sister asked to host my nephew's 3rd birthday party at my house. She wants to use the big backyard, grill and pool at my home. There are roughly 50 people who are invited. I said no and she called me selfish and an asshole. Her kids have never been to my house and I prefer it that way. Her kids are not very well behaved except for the oldest three and my house is not child-poof. The pool seems like a huge liability. I don't want children drowning on my property. It just seems like a recipe for disaster. She brought up the fact that she hosted Christmas at her house for the past 10+ years at her house, but I don't think it's fair to compare this to that. We meet at her house instead of our parents because she has 14 kids to herd around so it's really more out of convenience to her. Every year for the past 10+ years I buy dessert enough to feed 25 people so I've done my part with the food arrangements. That's 8 apple pies or 3 cakes worth of dessert. My parents also stay over to help prepare and cook and we all contribute to the washing and cleaning. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe haven't spoken in 2 months because of this. She firmly believes AITA. So, AITA for not allowing my sister to host my nephew's birthday party at my house? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for not allowing their sister to host a kid's birthday party at their house. The sister has 14 kids and the author's house is 5 hours away. The author bought their dream home and didn't want the chaos of 14 kids plus 50 guests. The sister called them selfish and an asshole, and they haven't spoken in two months.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author has a valid concern about safety, especially with a pool and not having child-proofed the house. They also mention preferring not to have the sister's kids over because they're not well-behaved except for the oldest three. The sister had hosted Christmas events for years, but the author points out that those were at the sister's house, which is more suited for large groups. The author has contributed by bringing desserts and helping with cleaning, but the sister's request here is different because it's at the author's home.\n\nLegally and ethically, the author has the right to control who uses their property. The safety concerns about the pool and the potential liability are significant. The sister's reaction might be harsh, but the author's decision is based on their own property and safety. The sister's history of hosting events doesn't negate the author's right to set boundaries, especially with such a large group. The author isn't refusing to meet with their sister; they've accepted gatherings at the sister's place. The conflict arises from the specific request for the author's home, which has different challenges. \n\nSo, the author isn't being selfish just because they said no. They have legitimate reasons related to safety and the practicality of hosting such a large group in their own home. The sister's reaction might be disproportionate, but that doesn't make the author in the wrong. The answer is B.\n"
