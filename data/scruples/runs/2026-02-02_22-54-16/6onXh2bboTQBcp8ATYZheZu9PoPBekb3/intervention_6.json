It's as chaotic and nightmarish as you can imagine. Usually she never asks to come over to my place because it's a nightmare to travel with 14 kids to come visit their auntie who lives 5 hours away. If we're having a gathering it's always me who is travelling to their place. I don't really mind. We only meet a few times a year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few years ago I bought my dream house with my husband. My sister asked to host my nephew's 3rd birthday party at my house. She wants to use the big backyard, grill and pool at my home. There are roughly 50 people who are invited. I said no and she called me selfish and an asshole. Her kids have never been to my house and I prefer it that way. Her kids are not very well behaved except for the oldest three and my house is not child-poof. The pool seems like a huge liability. I don't want children drowning on my property. It just seems like a recipe for disaster. She brought up the fact that she hosted Christmas at her house for the past 10+ years at her house, but I don't think it's fair to compare this to that. We meet at her house instead of our parents because she has 14 kids to herd around so it's really more out of convenience to her. Every year for the past 10+ years I buy dessert enough to feed 25 people so I've done my part with the food arrangements. That's 8 apple pies or 3 cakes worth of dessert. My parents also stay over to help prepare and cook and we all contribute to the washing and cleaning. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe haven't spoken in 2 months because of this. She firmly believes AITA. So, AITA for not allowing my sister to host my nephew's birthday party at my house? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for not letting their sister host a birthday party at their house. The sister has 14 kids, which the author describes as chaotic and a nightmare. The sister wanted to use the author's backyard, grill, and pool for a party with 50 people. The author declined, and the sister is upset, leading to a two-month silence.\n\nFirst, the author's reasoning: their house isn't child-proof, there's a pool which poses a drowning risk, and they don't want to deal with 14 kids. The sister argues that she's hosted Christmas gatherings for 10 years and the author has contributed with desserts each year. The author feels they've done their part by providing desserts and that the sister's request is too much for their home.\n\nI need to consider the key factors here. The author owns their home and has the right to set boundaries about how it's used. Safety is a big concern with a pool and many children. The sister's request could indeed create a liability. The author isn't opposing all gatherings but specifically this one due to the number of kids and the environment. The sister's past hosting doesn't necessarily justify this request, especially if the author's home isn't suited for it. The author also mentions they don't mind traveling to the sister's place, showing they're making an effort to maintain the relationship despite the inconvenience. The sister's reaction seems harsh, calling the author names over a boundary the author is setting. The fact that they haven't spoken in two months might indicate the sister's overreaction. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the sister felt slighted because she's hosted large events before. But the author's home isn't the same as the sister's, which is presumably more accommodating. The author's refusal isn't about favoritism but practicality and safety. The sister not respecting that boundary by continuing to be angry could be her fault. The author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing their home's safety and their own comfort. They've contributed in other ways, so they aren't being selfish. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
