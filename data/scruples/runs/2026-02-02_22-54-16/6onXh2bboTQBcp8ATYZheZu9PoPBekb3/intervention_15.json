It's as chaotic and nightmarish as you can imagine. Usually she never asks to come over to my place because it's a nightmare to travel with 14 kids to come visit their auntie who lives 5 hours away. If we're having a gathering it's always me who is travelling to their place. I don't really mind. We only meet a few times a year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few years ago I bought my dream house with my husband. My sister asked to host my nephew's 3rd birthday party at my house. She wants to use the big backyard, grill and pool at my home. There are roughly 50 people who are invited. I said no and she called me selfish and an asshole. Her kids have never been to my house and I prefer it that way. Her kids are not very well behaved except for the oldest three and my house is not child-poof. The pool seems like a huge liability. I don't want children drowning on my property. It just seems like a recipe for disaster. She brought up the fact that she hosted Christmas at her house for the past 10+ years at her house, but I don't think it's fair to compare this to that. We meet at her house instead of our parents because she has 14 kids to herd around so it's really more out of convenience to her. Every year for the past 10+ years I buy dessert enough to feed 25 people so I've done my part with the food arrangements. That's 8 apple pies or 3 cakes worth of dessert. My parents also stay over to help prepare and cook and we all contribute to the washing and cleaning. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe haven't spoken in 2 months because of this. She firmly believes AITA. So, AITA for not allowing my sister to host my nephew's birthday party at my house? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole?) post is in the wrong for not allowing their sister to host a birthday party at their house. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author has a sister with 14 kids. The sister wanted to host a birthday party for the nephew at the author's house, which is 5 hours away. The author declined, citing the chaos of her sister's kids and the liability of the pool. The sister was upset, called the author names, and they haven't spoken in two months.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author's house is their dream home, they mentioned the kids are not well-behaved except for the oldest three, and the pool is a liability. Also, the sister had previously hosted Christmas gatherings at her home for years, and the author contributed with desserts and other help. The author feels that the sister is not considering the practical issues and the risks involved.\n\nThe author's reasoning seems valid. Hosting a party with 50 people, especially with a large group of kids, at someone's home is a big responsibility. The author is within their rights to set boundaries, especially regarding safety concerns like the pool. The sister's kids being unruly adds to the author's valid concerns. The distance (5 hours) also suggests that traveling there with 14 kids would be a hassle, but the sister is asking the author to host instead of the other way around.\n\nThe sister's reaction seems harsh. Calling someone an asshole over a refusal to host, especially when the author has reasons related to safety and property, might be disproportionate. The fact that they haven't spoken in two months shows the sister is holding a grudge, which might not be justified. The author has contributed in other ways (desserts) and the sister's past hosting of Christmas implies she's used to managing large gatherings, so maybe she should have considered the author's situation.\n\nHowever, maybe the sister felt entitled to use the author's house because of past contributions or the family dynamic. But the author's reasons are practical and safety-related, which are important. The author isn't obligated to host, especially given the potential risks and the fact that it's their home. They have the right to say no.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author is not in the wrong. The answer should be B (No).\n"
