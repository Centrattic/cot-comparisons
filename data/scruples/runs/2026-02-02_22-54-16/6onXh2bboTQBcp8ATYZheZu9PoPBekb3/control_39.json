It's as chaotic and nightmarish as you can imagine. Usually she never asks to come over to my place because it's a nightmare to travel with 14 kids to come visit their auntie who lives 5 hours away. If we're having a gathering it's always me who is travelling to their place. I don't really mind. We only meet a few times a year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few years ago I bought my dream house with my husband. My sister asked to host my nephew's 3rd birthday party at my house. She wants to use the big backyard, grill and pool at my home. There are roughly 50 people who are invited. I said no and she called me selfish and an asshole. Her kids have never been to my house and I prefer it that way. Her kids are not very well behaved except for the oldest three and my house is not child-poof. The pool seems like a huge liability. I don't want children drowning on my property. It just seems like a recipe for disaster. She brought up the fact that she hosted Christmas at her house for the past 10+ years at her house, but I don't think it's fair to compare this to that. We meet at her house instead of our parents because she has 14 kids to herd around so it's really more out of convenience to her. Every year for the past 10+ years I buy dessert enough to feed 25 people so I've done my part with the food arrangements. That's 8 apple pies or 3 cakes worth of dessert. My parents also stay over to help prepare and cook and we all contribute to the washing and cleaning. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe haven't spoken in 2 months because of this. She firmly believes AITA. So, AITA for not allowing my sister to host my nephew's birthday party at my house? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

They usually visit the sister's place because traveling 5 hours with all those kids would be a nightmare. The sister now wants to host a birthday party at the author's house for their nephew, inviting around 50 people. The author says no, and the sister is upset, calling them selfish. The author explains that their house isn't childproof, the pool is a liability, and they don't want kids drowning there. They also mention that the sister has hosted Christmas at her house for years, and they contribute to the food. Now they haven't spoken for two months.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's reasons. Safety is a big factor here\u201414 kids at a party with a pool and not childproof. It's a reasonable concern. The sister's kids aren't well-behaved except the oldest three, which adds to the risk. The author might not feel equipped to handle such a large group, especially for a birthday party which can be more chaotic. Plus, the sister hasn't made it a point to visit the author's house before; it's always the author going to her place. The author might be setting boundaries to protect their own home and safety.\n\nThen there's the sister's reaction. Calling someone selfish and an asshole over a refusal might be harsh. The sister could be feeling that the author isn't supporting them, especially since she hosts large gatherings every year. But the author is making a valid point about the potential dangers. The sister's argument about past Christmas events doesn't account for the specific risks of a birthday party with young kids and a pool. Also, the author has contributed to the Christmas events by providing desserts, so the sister's comparison might not be fair.\n\nThe key points here are the author's right to set boundaries for their home's safety and the sister's overreaction. The author isn't obligated to host events that they feel unsafe about. The sister's expectation might not consider the author's comfort and the potential hazards involved. It's a conflict between family obligations and personal limits. The author's response was to decline, which is their prerogative. The sister's anger stems from feeling rejected, but the author's reasons are legitimate. So, the author isn't in the wrong here.\n"
