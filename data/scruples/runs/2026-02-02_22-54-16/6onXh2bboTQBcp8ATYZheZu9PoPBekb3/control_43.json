It's as chaotic and nightmarish as you can imagine. Usually she never asks to come over to my place because it's a nightmare to travel with 14 kids to come visit their auntie who lives 5 hours away. If we're having a gathering it's always me who is travelling to their place. I don't really mind. We only meet a few times a year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few years ago I bought my dream house with my husband. My sister asked to host my nephew's 3rd birthday party at my house. She wants to use the big backyard, grill and pool at my home. There are roughly 50 people who are invited. I said no and she called me selfish and an asshole. Her kids have never been to my house and I prefer it that way. Her kids are not very well behaved except for the oldest three and my house is not child-poof. The pool seems like a huge liability. I don't want children drowning on my property. It just seems like a recipe for disaster. She brought up the fact that she hosted Christmas at her house for the past 10+ years at her house, but I don't think it's fair to compare this to that. We meet at her house instead of our parents because she has 14 kids to herd around so it's really more out of convenience to her. Every year for the past 10+ years I buy dessert enough to feed 25 people so I've done my part with the food arrangements. That's 8 apple pies or 3 cakes worth of dessert. My parents also stay over to help prepare and cook and we all contribute to the washing and cleaning. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe haven't spoken in 2 months because of this. She firmly believes AITA. So, AITA for not allowing my sister to host my nephew's birthday party at my house? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story (the author) is in the wrong for not letting her sister host a birthday party at her house. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author bought a dream house and has a sister with 14 kids. The sister wanted to host a birthday party at the author's house for the nephew, with 50 people. The author said no, and now they're not talking. The sister is upset and thinks the author is at fault.\n\nSo, the main points here are: the sister has a lot of kids, which is chaotic. The author's house is not child-proof, and there's a pool which is a liability. The sister had previously hosted Christmas parties at her house for years, but the author doesn't think that compares. The author mentions that they usually meet at the sister's place because it's easier for her to manage 14 kids. The author also says they contribute to food and help with cleaning each year.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let me consider both sides. On one hand, the sister might feel that since they usually meet at her place, hosting the party at the author's house would be fair. But the author has valid concerns about safety and the chaos 14 kids could cause. The pool is a big liability, especially with children around. The author's house is a personal space, and hosting 50 people would be stressful. Also, the sister hasn't been to the author's house with her kids before, which might suggest that the sister is aware of the potential issues and still made the request.\n\nThe sister's reaction of calling the author selfish and an asshole seems harsh, especially if the author explained the reasons. The author is setting boundaries, which is something that's important in relationships. The sister might be expecting the author to accommodate without considering the risks and the author's comfort. The author has contributed to previous events, so maybe the sister feels entitled, but the author's refusal is about safety and personal space, not just being selfish.\n\nI think the key factors here are the safety concerns (unchild-proof house, pool) and the author's right to set boundaries. The sister's reaction seems disproportionate if the author had a valid reason. The author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing safety and personal space. So the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
