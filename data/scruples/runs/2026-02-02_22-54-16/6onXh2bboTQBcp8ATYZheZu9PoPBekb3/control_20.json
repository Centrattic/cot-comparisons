It's as chaotic and nightmarish as you can imagine. Usually she never asks to come over to my place because it's a nightmare to travel with 14 kids to come visit their auntie who lives 5 hours away. If we're having a gathering it's always me who is travelling to their place. I don't really mind. We only meet a few times a year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few years ago I bought my dream house with my husband. My sister asked to host my nephew's 3rd birthday party at my house. She wants to use the big backyard, grill and pool at my home. There are roughly 50 people who are invited. I said no and she called me selfish and an asshole. Her kids have never been to my house and I prefer it that way. Her kids are not very well behaved except for the oldest three and my house is not child-poof. The pool seems like a huge liability. I don't want children drowning on my property. It just seems like a recipe for disaster. She brought up the fact that she hosted Christmas at her house for the past 10+ years at her house, but I don't think it's fair to compare this to that. We meet at her house instead of our parents because she has 14 kids to herd around so it's really more out of convenience to her. Every year for the past 10+ years I buy dessert enough to feed 25 people so I've done my part with the food arrangements. That's 8 apple pies or 3 cakes worth of dessert. My parents also stay over to help prepare and cook and we all contribute to the washing and cleaning. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe haven't spoken in 2 months because of this. She firmly believes AITA. So, AITA for not allowing my sister to host my nephew's birthday party at my house? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not letting their sister host a kid's birthday party at their home. The sister has 14 kids, which is a lot. The author bought their dream house and is worried about the chaos and liability, especially with the pool. The sister got angry, called them selfish, and they haven't spoken in two months.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the situation. The author's reasons are about the logistics and safety. Hosting 50 people with 14 kids is a big deal. The sister usually hosts events at her place, like Christmas, and the author contributes by bringing dessert each year. The author's home isn't child-proof, and the pool is a concern. They also mention that traveling to the sister's house is easier for everyone instead of the other way around.\n\nThe sister's perspective is that the author is being selfish, especially since they've done the opposite in the past by bringing food. But the author is setting a boundary here. It's important to consider the right to say no. Family dynamics can be tricky, but the author has valid concerns. The sister might feel hurt, but the author's reasons are practical and safety-related. \n\nAlso, the fact that they haven't spoken in two months suggests the sister is holding a grudge, which might not be fair. The author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing their own home's safety and their comfort. They have the right to set limits on how their property is used. So, the answer would be B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
