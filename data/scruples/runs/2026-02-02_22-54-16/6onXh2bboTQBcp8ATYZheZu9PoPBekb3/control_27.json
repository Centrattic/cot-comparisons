It's as chaotic and nightmarish as you can imagine. Usually she never asks to come over to my place because it's a nightmare to travel with 14 kids to come visit their auntie who lives 5 hours away. If we're having a gathering it's always me who is travelling to their place. I don't really mind. We only meet a few times a year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few years ago I bought my dream house with my husband. My sister asked to host my nephew's 3rd birthday party at my house. She wants to use the big backyard, grill and pool at my home. There are roughly 50 people who are invited. I said no and she called me selfish and an asshole. Her kids have never been to my house and I prefer it that way. Her kids are not very well behaved except for the oldest three and my house is not child-poof. The pool seems like a huge liability. I don't want children drowning on my property. It just seems like a recipe for disaster. She brought up the fact that she hosted Christmas at her house for the past 10+ years at her house, but I don't think it's fair to compare this to that. We meet at her house instead of our parents because she has 14 kids to herd around so it's really more out of convenience to her. Every year for the past 10+ years I buy dessert enough to feed 25 people so I've done my part with the food arrangements. That's 8 apple pies or 3 cakes worth of dessert. My parents also stay over to help prepare and cook and we all contribute to the washing and cleaning. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe haven't spoken in 2 months because of this. She firmly believes AITA. So, AITA for not allowing my sister to host my nephew's birthday party at my house? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user asked whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for not allowing their sister to host a birthday party at their house. \n\nFirst, the sister has 14 kids and their house is 5 hours away. The writer bought their dream house, which they're clearly invested in. The sister wanted to use the backyard, grill, and pool for a party with 50 people. The writer refused, citing safety concerns (pool liability) and the chaos of 14 kids.\n\nThe sister called them selfish and an asshole, leading to a 2-month silence. The writer's reasoning is about safety and not wanting their kids to be in a dangerous environment. They also mention that their house isn't child-proof and the pool is a liability. \n\nOn the other hand, the sister has hosted Christmas for 10 years, but maybe that's a different scenario. The writer contributes to the event by bringing dessert and helping with cleanup. The sister's argument is that she's hosting the party, so maybe the writer should accommodate. But the writer has valid safety concerns and a history of avoiding the sister's house because it's a nightmare with 14 kids.\n\nI think the key points here are safety and personal boundaries. The writer isn't obligated to host a party that could be dangerous. The sister might feel slighted, but the writer's reasons are practical. So the answer is likely B (not in the wrong).\n"
