It's as chaotic and nightmarish as you can imagine. Usually she never asks to come over to my place because it's a nightmare to travel with 14 kids to come visit their auntie who lives 5 hours away. If we're having a gathering it's always me who is travelling to their place. I don't really mind. We only meet a few times a year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few years ago I bought my dream house with my husband. My sister asked to host my nephew's 3rd birthday party at my house. She wants to use the big backyard, grill and pool at my home. There are roughly 50 people who are invited. I said no and she called me selfish and an asshole. Her kids have never been to my house and I prefer it that way. Her kids are not very well behaved except for the oldest three and my house is not child-poof. The pool seems like a huge liability. I don't want children drowning on my property. It just seems like a recipe for disaster. She brought up the fact that she hosted Christmas at her house for the past 10+ years at her house, but I don't think it's fair to compare this to that. We meet at her house instead of our parents because she has 14 kids to herd around so it's really more out of convenience to her. Every year for the past 10+ years I buy dessert enough to feed 25 people so I've done my part with the food arrangements. That's 8 apple pies or 3 cakes worth of dessert. My parents also stay over to help prepare and cook and we all contribute to the washing and cleaning. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe haven't spoken in 2 months because of this. She firmly believes AITA. So, AITA for not allowing my sister to host my nephew's birthday party at my house? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this situation is in the wrong. The context is that the author's sister wanted to host a kid's birthday party at their house, but they refused. The sister has 14 kids, and the author is worried about the chaos and safety, especially with the pool. They bought their dream house and don't want the kids coming over, as they've never been before. The sister is upset, called them selfish, and they haven't spoken in two months.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author has a valid concern about safety. A pool with 14 kids and 50 guests is a big liability. They mention the house isn't \"child-proof,\" which could mean there are hazards a child could encounter. The author also mentions that they usually meet at the sister's place because it's easier for the sister to manage the kids. The sister is now upset because she felt the author should accommodate the party, especially since they've hosted other events like Christmas in the past. However, the author points out that the Christmas gatherings were at the sister's home, which makes sense given the number of kids. The author has contributed in other ways, like bringing desserts and helping with cleaning, but the sister's request for the birthday party seems different because of the specific setup and risks involved.\n\nI need to consider the perspective of both sides. The sister might feel hurt because she asked for a favor, and the author refused. However, the author has a right to protect their property and safety. The sister's kids have never been to the author's house before, so maybe there's a lack of understanding of the author's boundaries. The author also mentions the travel distance (5 hours) usually means the sister doesn't come over, but the author visits them. The main issue here is the author's refusal based on safety and convenience. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, they clearly stated their reasons: safety concerns, property liability, and past experiences with the kids. They didn't allow the party, which is their right as the homeowner. The sister's reaction might be exaggerated, especially calling the author an asshole. The author isn't refusing all gatherings but is saying no to this specific one with 50 people and 14 kids. The sister's argument about past Christmas events doesn't directly apply because hosting a birthday party with a pool is a different scenario. \n\nI think the key points are the author's safety concerns and the fact that they've never hosted the sister's kids before. The sister might not have considered the unique risks of the author's property. The author isn't being selfish; they're being cautious. So, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
