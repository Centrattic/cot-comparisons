It's as chaotic and nightmarish as you can imagine. Usually she never asks to come over to my place because it's a nightmare to travel with 14 kids to come visit their auntie who lives 5 hours away. If we're having a gathering it's always me who is travelling to their place. I don't really mind. We only meet a few times a year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few years ago I bought my dream house with my husband. My sister asked to host my nephew's 3rd birthday party at my house. She wants to use the big backyard, grill and pool at my home. There are roughly 50 people who are invited. I said no and she called me selfish and an asshole. Her kids have never been to my house and I prefer it that way. Her kids are not very well behaved except for the oldest three and my house is not child-poof. The pool seems like a huge liability. I don't want children drowning on my property. It just seems like a recipe for disaster. She brought up the fact that she hosted Christmas at her house for the past 10+ years at her house, but I don't think it's fair to compare this to that. We meet at her house instead of our parents because she has 14 kids to herd around so it's really more out of convenience to her. Every year for the past 10+ years I buy dessert enough to feed 25 people so I've done my part with the food arrangements. That's 8 apple pies or 3 cakes worth of dessert. My parents also stay over to help prepare and cook and we all contribute to the washing and cleaning. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe haven't spoken in 2 months because of this. She firmly believes AITA. So, AITA for not allowing my sister to host my nephew's birthday party at my house? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA story is in the wrong. The situation is about a sister not allowing her sibling to host a birthday party at her house because the sister has 14 kids, which is a lot, and the author is concerned about safety and chaos.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author has a dream house, and the sister wanted to use it for a 50-people party. The author declined, citing the kids' behavior, the pool safety, and the general chaos of 14 kids. The sister is upset, saying the author is selfish, and they haven't spoken in two months.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't wrong. I need to consider if the author's reasons are valid. The house isn't child-proof, which is a safety concern. The sister has a history of hosting big events, but this time it's specifically at the author's home. The author mentions contributing to other events, like providing desserts and helping with cleaning, which shows they've given without expecting something in return.\n\nThe sister's argument is about past Christmas events, but the author is differentiating this as a different situation. The author's house is a 5-hour drive, so maybe the sister's kids haven't been there often, reducing the author's responsibility. Also, the author's main reasons are safety and property liability, which are legitimate concerns.\n\nIn terms of fairness, the author is setting boundaries, which is reasonable. People have the right to control their own property. The sister's reaction might be overblown, especially if she's not considering the author's valid concerns. The fact that the author allows the sister to host at their parents' house but not their own is about their own home's safety and comfort.\n\nPossible counterarguments: Maybe the sister felt entitled because they've done things for her in the past. But the author isn't refusing to help entirely\u2014they've contributed desserts and help with Christmas. The key is the location, which is the author's personal space. The author isn't obligated to allow their home for such a large and potentially unsafe event, especially when it's for their own relative's birthday.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's reasons are reasonable and based on safety and personal choice. The sister's anger might stem from feeling unappreciated or taken for granted, but the author isn't in the wrong for protecting their home and ensuring safety.\n"
