It's as chaotic and nightmarish as you can imagine. Usually she never asks to come over to my place because it's a nightmare to travel with 14 kids to come visit their auntie who lives 5 hours away. If we're having a gathering it's always me who is travelling to their place. I don't really mind. We only meet a few times a year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few years ago I bought my dream house with my husband. My sister asked to host my nephew's 3rd birthday party at my house. She wants to use the big backyard, grill and pool at my home. There are roughly 50 people who are invited. I said no and she called me selfish and an asshole. Her kids have never been to my house and I prefer it that way. Her kids are not very well behaved except for the oldest three and my house is not child-poof. The pool seems like a huge liability. I don't want children drowning on my property. It just seems like a recipe for disaster. She brought up the fact that she hosted Christmas at her house for the past 10+ years at her house, but I don't think it's fair to compare this to that. We meet at her house instead of our parents because she has 14 kids to herd around so it's really more out of convenience to her. Every year for the past 10+ years I buy dessert enough to feed 25 people so I've done my part with the food arrangements. That's 8 apple pies or 3 cakes worth of dessert. My parents also stay over to help prepare and cook and we all contribute to the washing and cleaning. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe haven't spoken in 2 months because of this. She firmly believes AITA. So, AITA for not allowing my sister to host my nephew's birthday party at my house? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a sister with 14 kids wanting to host a birthday party at her sister's new house. The author says no, and now there's a two-month silence.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The sister has 14 kids, which is a lot, and the author bought a dream house. The main reasons the author says no are the chaos of the kids, the pool's liability, and the house not being child-proof. The sister feels slighted because maybe the author is being selfish, especially since the sister has hosted Christmas for years. The author points out that they bring desserts and help with food, so they think they've contributed enough.\n\nNow, considering the author's perspective. They own the house and have valid concerns about safety and the stress of hosting with so many kids. The sister's house is their usual meeting place because it's more convenient for the sheer number of children. The author doesn't mind traveling to their sister's place but doesn't want the opposite. The sister's kids haven't been to the author's house, which might be a factor in the author's reluctance.\n\nOn the sister's side, she might feel that her nephew's birthday is important and that the author is not supporting the family. The fact that she called the author names and they haven't spoken in two months shows the tension is high. But does that mean the author is wrong? \n\nI think the author has the right to set boundaries about their home. Hosting 50 people with 14 kids plus others is a big ask, especially with the pool's risk. The author has been contributing in other ways, which might not be enough for the sister, but it's a valid point. The sister's argument about past Christmases might not be a fair comparison since the situations are different. \n\nSo, the author's decision is about their own comfort and safety. It's reasonable to say no to hosting if it's not convenient or safe. The sister's reaction is harsh, but the author isn't in the wrong for making that choice. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
