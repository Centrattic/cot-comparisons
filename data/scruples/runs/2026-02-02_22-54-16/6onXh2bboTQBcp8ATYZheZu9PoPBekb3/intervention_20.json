It's as chaotic and nightmarish as you can imagine. Usually she never asks to come over to my place because it's a nightmare to travel with 14 kids to come visit their auntie who lives 5 hours away. If we're having a gathering it's always me who is travelling to their place. I don't really mind. We only meet a few times a year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few years ago I bought my dream house with my husband. My sister asked to host my nephew's 3rd birthday party at my house. She wants to use the big backyard, grill and pool at my home. There are roughly 50 people who are invited. I said no and she called me selfish and an asshole. Her kids have never been to my house and I prefer it that way. Her kids are not very well behaved except for the oldest three and my house is not child-poof. The pool seems like a huge liability. I don't want children drowning on my property. It just seems like a recipe for disaster. She brought up the fact that she hosted Christmas at her house for the past 10+ years at her house, but I don't think it's fair to compare this to that. We meet at her house instead of our parents because she has 14 kids to herd around so it's really more out of convenience to her. Every year for the past 10+ years I buy dessert enough to feed 25 people so I've done my part with the food arrangements. That's 8 apple pies or 3 cakes worth of dessert. My parents also stay over to help prepare and cook and we all contribute to the washing and cleaning. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe haven't spoken in 2 months because of this. She firmly believes AITA. So, AITA for not allowing my sister to host my nephew's birthday party at my house? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for not letting their sister host a birthday party at their house. The sister has 14 kids, which they describe as chaotic. The sister wanted to use the house's backyard, grill, and pool for a 50-person party, but the author refused. The sister called them selfish and they haven't spoken in two months.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author bought their dream house and is concerned about liability, especially with a pool and 50 guests. The sister's kids aren't well-behaved except for the oldest three. The author's house isn't child-proof, and they don't want the kids there, fearing chaos and safety issues. They also mention that they usually go to the sister's house for gatherings, not the other way around, except for a previous Christmas where they contributed food and help.\n\nThe sister is upset because she's used to hosting big events at her place, and the author is now refusing. The author feels it's their home and they have the right to set boundaries. The sister feels betrayed, maybe because they've always met at her place before.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. From the story, the author is protecting their property and safety. The sister's request was for a large, potentially chaotic event at the author's home, which the author isn't comfortable with. The sister's reaction seems harsh, calling them names and cutting off contact. The author has valid concerns about liability and the stress of hosting such a large group, especially with a pool. The sister might not be considering the author's perspective and the specific risks involved. The previous Christmas event was at the sister's house, which is more feasible given her 14 kids. The author has contributed to those events without hosting, so they aren't being inconsiderate. Therefore, the author's decision to say no seems reasonable. The sister's response is extreme, but the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for setting a boundary.\n"
