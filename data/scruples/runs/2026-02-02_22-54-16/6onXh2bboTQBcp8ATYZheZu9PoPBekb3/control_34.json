It's as chaotic and nightmarish as you can imagine. Usually she never asks to come over to my place because it's a nightmare to travel with 14 kids to come visit their auntie who lives 5 hours away. If we're having a gathering it's always me who is travelling to their place. I don't really mind. We only meet a few times a year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few years ago I bought my dream house with my husband. My sister asked to host my nephew's 3rd birthday party at my house. She wants to use the big backyard, grill and pool at my home. There are roughly 50 people who are invited. I said no and she called me selfish and an asshole. Her kids have never been to my house and I prefer it that way. Her kids are not very well behaved except for the oldest three and my house is not child-poof. The pool seems like a huge liability. I don't want children drowning on my property. It just seems like a recipe for disaster. She brought up the fact that she hosted Christmas at her house for the past 10+ years at her house, but I don't think it's fair to compare this to that. We meet at her house instead of our parents because she has 14 kids to herd around so it's really more out of convenience to her. Every year for the past 10+ years I buy dessert enough to feed 25 people so I've done my part with the food arrangements. That's 8 apple pies or 3 cakes worth of dessert. My parents also stay over to help prepare and cook and we all contribute to the washing and cleaning. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe haven't spoken in 2 months because of this. She firmly believes AITA. So, AITA for not allowing my sister to host my nephew's birthday party at my house? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author not allowing their sister to host a kid's birthday party at their house.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the details. The sister has 14 kids, which is a lot. The author bought a dream house and was asked to host the party. The sister invited around 50 people, and the author said no. The sister got angry, called them selfish and an asshole. They haven't spoken in two months.\n\nThe author's reasons: their house isn't child-proof, there's a pool which is a liability risk, and they don't want kids drowning. Also, the sister's kids, except the oldest three, aren't well-behaved. The sister's argument is that she's hosted Christmas for 10+ years at her house, but the author thinks that's different. The author mentions contributing to food and their parents helping with Christmas.\n\nSo, the key points here are safety concerns, the author's right to set boundaries, and whether the sister's request was reasonable. The sister has a large family, which makes hosting her kids elsewhere challenging, but the author's home is far (5 hours away), so it's not like the sister visits often.\n\nThe author is protecting their own home, especially considering the potential dangers with a pool and many kids. They also point out that the sister's kids haven't even been to their house before. The sister's argument about past Christmas events might not be directly comparable because a birthday party with 50 people is a different scale. Also, the author has contributed to past events with food, so they might feel they've already supported their sister's events.\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong. They have valid concerns about safety and the chaos of 14 kids plus 50 guests. They can choose how to use their property. The sister's reaction is harsh, and the author isn't obligated to host a party that poses risks. The fact that they haven't spoken in two months suggests the sister is unwilling to let go of it, but the author's decision was reasonable.\n"
