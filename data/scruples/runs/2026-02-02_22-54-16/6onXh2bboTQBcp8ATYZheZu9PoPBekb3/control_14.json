It's as chaotic and nightmarish as you can imagine. Usually she never asks to come over to my place because it's a nightmare to travel with 14 kids to come visit their auntie who lives 5 hours away. If we're having a gathering it's always me who is travelling to their place. I don't really mind. We only meet a few times a year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few years ago I bought my dream house with my husband. My sister asked to host my nephew's 3rd birthday party at my house. She wants to use the big backyard, grill and pool at my home. There are roughly 50 people who are invited. I said no and she called me selfish and an asshole. Her kids have never been to my house and I prefer it that way. Her kids are not very well behaved except for the oldest three and my house is not child-poof. The pool seems like a huge liability. I don't want children drowning on my property. It just seems like a recipe for disaster. She brought up the fact that she hosted Christmas at her house for the past 10+ years at her house, but I don't think it's fair to compare this to that. We meet at her house instead of our parents because she has 14 kids to herd around so it's really more out of convenience to her. Every year for the past 10+ years I buy dessert enough to feed 25 people so I've done my part with the food arrangements. That's 8 apple pies or 3 cakes worth of dessert. My parents also stay over to help prepare and cook and we all contribute to the washing and cleaning. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe haven't spoken in 2 months because of this. She firmly believes AITA. So, AITA for not allowing my sister to host my nephew's birthday party at my house? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The question is about a sister refusing to let her sister host a birthday party at her house. Let's break this down.\n\nFirst, the sister has 14 kids, which is a lot. The author bought a dream house and the sister wanted to host a 50-person party there. The author said no, and now they're not speaking. The sister is upset and called the author selfish. The author's reasons are safety concerns: the kids aren't well-behaved, the house isn't childproof, and there's a pool which is a liability. Also, the sister's kids have never been to the author's house before, which the author prefers.\n\nHmm. So, the key points here are the author's reasons for saying no. They mention liability, safety, and the chaos of 14 kids. The sister is upset because she's hosting Christmas every year at her place, but the author points out that the author's house is different and not suited for such a large group. The sister feels it's unfair, but the author is concerned about the risks.\n\nI think the author has valid reasons here. They own their house and have the right to set boundaries. The safety of their property and potential for accidents (like a kid drowning in the pool) is a legitimate concern. Plus, the sister's kids aren't well-behaved, which adds to the risk. The author also mentions that they're the ones traveling to the sister's place when there's a gathering, so maybe there's a pattern of convenience here. The sister expecting to host at the author's house might be imposing. The author isn't saying no out of spite but out of practicality and safety. The sister's reaction seems harsh, especially given the author's explanations. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They have the right to protect their home and their safety. The sister might need to respect that. Therefore, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
