It's as chaotic and nightmarish as you can imagine. Usually she never asks to come over to my place because it's a nightmare to travel with 14 kids to come visit their auntie who lives 5 hours away. If we're having a gathering it's always me who is travelling to their place. I don't really mind. We only meet a few times a year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few years ago I bought my dream house with my husband. My sister asked to host my nephew's 3rd birthday party at my house. She wants to use the big backyard, grill and pool at my home. There are roughly 50 people who are invited. I said no and she called me selfish and an asshole. Her kids have never been to my house and I prefer it that way. Her kids are not very well behaved except for the oldest three and my house is not child-poof. The pool seems like a huge liability. I don't want children drowning on my property. It just seems like a recipe for disaster. She brought up the fact that she hosted Christmas at her house for the past 10+ years at her house, but I don't think it's fair to compare this to that. We meet at her house instead of our parents because she has 14 kids to herd around so it's really more out of convenience to her. Every year for the past 10+ years I buy dessert enough to feed 25 people so I've done my part with the food arrangements. That's 8 apple pies or 3 cakes worth of dessert. My parents also stay over to help prepare and cook and we all contribute to the washing and cleaning. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe haven't spoken in 2 months because of this. She firmly believes AITA. So, AITA for not allowing my sister to host my nephew's birthday party at my house? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about the author refusing their sister's request to host a birthday party at their house. The sister has 14 kids, which is a lot, and the author is concerned about the chaos and safety, especially with the pool. The sister is upset and thinks the author is in the wrong, but the author is defending their decision.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author has a dream house they bought with their husband. Hosting a party for 50 people with 14 kids could be overwhelming. The sister has never hosted at the author's house before, and the author isn't comfortable with the kids being there. The sister mentioned hosting Christmas for 10+ years, but the author argues that's different. The author has contributed to Christmas by buying desserts and others help with the work. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, the author has the right to set boundaries with their own home. They have valid concerns about safety, especially with a pool and a lot of children. The sister's request is a one-time event, but the author has to live with the consequences of any issues that might arise. The sister's past hosting doesn't necessarily mean the author should have to host now. The author isn't refusing to help altogether\u2014they are meeting at the sister's house instead, contributing to food, etc. \n\nThe sister is upset, but the author's reasons are understandable. It's their property, and they can choose who to host and under what conditions. The fact that the sister called them selfish and an asshole might indicate she's not respecting the author's boundaries. The author isn't in the wrong here. They have the right to prioritize their home's safety and their own peace of mind.\n"
