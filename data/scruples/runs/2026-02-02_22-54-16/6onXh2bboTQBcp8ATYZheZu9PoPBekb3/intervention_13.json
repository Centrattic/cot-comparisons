It's as chaotic and nightmarish as you can imagine. Usually she never asks to come over to my place because it's a nightmare to travel with 14 kids to come visit their auntie who lives 5 hours away. If we're having a gathering it's always me who is travelling to their place. I don't really mind. We only meet a few times a year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few years ago I bought my dream house with my husband. My sister asked to host my nephew's 3rd birthday party at my house. She wants to use the big backyard, grill and pool at my home. There are roughly 50 people who are invited. I said no and she called me selfish and an asshole. Her kids have never been to my house and I prefer it that way. Her kids are not very well behaved except for the oldest three and my house is not child-poof. The pool seems like a huge liability. I don't want children drowning on my property. It just seems like a recipe for disaster. She brought up the fact that she hosted Christmas at her house for the past 10+ years at her house, but I don't think it's fair to compare this to that. We meet at her house instead of our parents because she has 14 kids to herd around so it's really more out of convenience to her. Every year for the past 10+ years I buy dessert enough to feed 25 people so I've done my part with the food arrangements. That's 8 apple pies or 3 cakes worth of dessert. My parents also stay over to help prepare and cook and we all contribute to the washing and cleaning. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe haven't spoken in 2 months because of this. She firmly believes AITA. So, AITA for not allowing my sister to host my nephew's birthday party at my house? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for not allowing their sister to host a birthday party at their house. The sister has 14 kids, and the author has a dream house they don't want to risk. The sister was upset and called the author names, and they haven't spoken in two months.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation from both sides. The author's main concerns are safety and the potential chaos of 14 kids in their house, especially with a pool. They also mention that their house isn't child-proof, which adds to the liability. They've been meeting at the sister's house before, which makes sense because of the large number of kids. The author isn't against helping in other ways, like providing desserts for the Christmas gatherings.\n\nOn the sister's side, she might feel that the author isn't being supportive since they've done other things for the family events. She hosted Christmas for years, and the author contributed. Maybe she felt this birthday was an exception where the author should accommodate. But the author has valid safety concerns. The number of kids is really high, and a pool adds significant risk. It's not just about the kids being misbehaved; it's about the potential for accidents.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that the sister's kids haven't even been to their house before. So, maybe the sister's request is a sudden change from the usual. The author isn't being selfish if they don't want to take on the risk and hassle, especially when they've been meeting at the sister's place otherwise. The sister's reaction seems harsh because the author is setting a boundary based on safety and comfort.\n\nThe key points here are the author's right to set boundaries for their own home, the safety concerns with a large number of children and a pool, and the fact that they've already contributed in other ways. The sister's comparison to Christmas might not be fair because the scale and nature of the events are different. Hosting a birthday with 50 people at a house not designed for it, with 14 kids, is a lot different than contributing to a Christmas gathering.\n\nI think the author is justified in their decision. They\u2019re protecting their property and safety, which is reasonable. The sister's anger might stem from feeling slighted, but the author isn't obligated to host, especially with the risks involved. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
