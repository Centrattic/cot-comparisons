It's as chaotic and nightmarish as you can imagine. Usually she never asks to come over to my place because it's a nightmare to travel with 14 kids to come visit their auntie who lives 5 hours away. If we're having a gathering it's always me who is travelling to their place. I don't really mind. We only meet a few times a year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few years ago I bought my dream house with my husband. My sister asked to host my nephew's 3rd birthday party at my house. She wants to use the big backyard, grill and pool at my home. There are roughly 50 people who are invited. I said no and she called me selfish and an asshole. Her kids have never been to my house and I prefer it that way. Her kids are not very well behaved except for the oldest three and my house is not child-poof. The pool seems like a huge liability. I don't want children drowning on my property. It just seems like a recipe for disaster. She brought up the fact that she hosted Christmas at her house for the past 10+ years at her house, but I don't think it's fair to compare this to that. We meet at her house instead of our parents because she has 14 kids to herd around so it's really more out of convenience to her. Every year for the past 10+ years I buy dessert enough to feed 25 people so I've done my part with the food arrangements. That's 8 apple pies or 3 cakes worth of dessert. My parents also stay over to help prepare and cook and we all contribute to the washing and cleaning. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe haven't spoken in 2 months because of this. She firmly believes AITA. So, AITA for not allowing my sister to host my nephew's birthday party at my house? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story (AITA) is in the wrong for not letting her sister host a birthday party at her house. \n\nFirst, the sister has 14 kids, which is a lot. The writer's house is their dream home, and they're worried about the chaos and safety, especially with the pool. They mentioned that their sister's kids aren't well-behaved except for the oldest three. The pool is a liability risk, which is a valid concern because of the number of kids. The sister was upset and called them selfish, but the writer explains they've been accommodating in other ways, like bringing desserts for years and helping during Christmas. \n\nThe sister wants to use the backyard, grill, and pool for the party with 50 people. The writer's reasons are safety and the potential disaster with so many kids. They also mention that their sister's kids have never been to their house before, which might be a factor. The sister is holding a grudge and hasn't spoken to them in two months.\n\nFrom a liability standpoint, hosting a party with 50 people and 14 kids at a house that's not \"child-proof\" could be risky. The pool is a big concern. The writer has a right to protect their property and ensure safety. Also, they've been contributing in other ways, so it's not about being selfish but practical concerns. \n\nThe sister's reaction seems harsh given the circumstances. The writer isn't obligated to host, especially when it's a potential safety hazard. The comparison to hosting Christmas is different because that's a family event they've done before, but this is a specific party with more logistical issues. \n\nConsidering all that, the writer isn't in the wrong. They made a reasonable decision based on safety and their own property's limitations. The sister's kids haven't been to the house before, so there's no built-up trust or prior experience with their behavior. The writer's refusal isn't selfish but a responsible choice. So the answer should be B.\n"
