It's as chaotic and nightmarish as you can imagine. Usually she never asks to come over to my place because it's a nightmare to travel with 14 kids to come visit their auntie who lives 5 hours away. If we're having a gathering it's always me who is travelling to their place. I don't really mind. We only meet a few times a year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few years ago I bought my dream house with my husband. My sister asked to host my nephew's 3rd birthday party at my house. She wants to use the big backyard, grill and pool at my home. There are roughly 50 people who are invited. I said no and she called me selfish and an asshole. Her kids have never been to my house and I prefer it that way. Her kids are not very well behaved except for the oldest three and my house is not child-poof. The pool seems like a huge liability. I don't want children drowning on my property. It just seems like a recipe for disaster. She brought up the fact that she hosted Christmas at her house for the past 10+ years at her house, but I don't think it's fair to compare this to that. We meet at her house instead of our parents because she has 14 kids to herd around so it's really more out of convenience to her. Every year for the past 10+ years I buy dessert enough to feed 25 people so I've done my part with the food arrangements. That's 8 apple pies or 3 cakes worth of dessert. My parents also stay over to help prepare and cook and we all contribute to the washing and cleaning. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe haven't spoken in 2 months because of this. She firmly believes AITA. So, AITA for not allowing my sister to host my nephew's birthday party at my house? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for not letting their sister host a birthday party at their house. \n\nFirst, the sister has 14 kids, which the author finds chaotic. The sister asked to use the author's house for a party with 50 people, including kids who aren't well-behaved and a risky pool situation. The author declined, and the sister is upset, calling them selfish. They haven't spoken in two months.\n\nThe author's main points are safety concerns, the kids' behavior, and the liability of the pool. They also mention that they usually visit the sister's house for gatherings, not the other way around. The sister points out hosting Christmas for years, but the author argues that's different because the sister has to manage 14 kids, making it more convenient for them to host there.\n\nLegally, the pool liability is a big deal. If a kid drowned, the author could be liable. Plus, the kids' behavior issues and the sheer number of people (50 guests plus 14 kids) would make it overwhelming. The author is also considering their own home's safety and comfort. \n\nThe sister's perspective is about tradition and past contributions (like bringing desserts). But the author's refusal seems reasonable given the risks. The sister's reaction might be overblown, especially since they live 5 hours apart and only meet a few times a year. The author isn't refusing all gatherings, just this specific event due to valid concerns.\n\nSo, the author's reasons are safety and practicality. The sister's anger doesn't seem justified here. The answer is B.\n"
