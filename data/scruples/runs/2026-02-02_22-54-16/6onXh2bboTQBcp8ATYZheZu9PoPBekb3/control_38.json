It's as chaotic and nightmarish as you can imagine. Usually she never asks to come over to my place because it's a nightmare to travel with 14 kids to come visit their auntie who lives 5 hours away. If we're having a gathering it's always me who is travelling to their place. I don't really mind. We only meet a few times a year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few years ago I bought my dream house with my husband. My sister asked to host my nephew's 3rd birthday party at my house. She wants to use the big backyard, grill and pool at my home. There are roughly 50 people who are invited. I said no and she called me selfish and an asshole. Her kids have never been to my house and I prefer it that way. Her kids are not very well behaved except for the oldest three and my house is not child-poof. The pool seems like a huge liability. I don't want children drowning on my property. It just seems like a recipe for disaster. She brought up the fact that she hosted Christmas at her house for the past 10+ years at her house, but I don't think it's fair to compare this to that. We meet at her house instead of our parents because she has 14 kids to herd around so it's really more out of convenience to her. Every year for the past 10+ years I buy dessert enough to feed 25 people so I've done my part with the food arrangements. That's 8 apple pies or 3 cakes worth of dessert. My parents also stay over to help prepare and cook and we all contribute to the washing and cleaning. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe haven't spoken in 2 months because of this. She firmly believes AITA. So, AITA for not allowing my sister to host my nephew's birthday party at my house? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong (AITA) for not letting their sister host a birthday party at their house. \n\nFirst, the sister has 14 kids, which they describe as chaotic and a nightmare. The writer has never had the sister's kids over before, and they don't want that to change. The reason given is that their house isn't childproof and the pool is a liability. They also mention that the sister has hosted Christmas for years, but they think that's different.\n\nSo, the main points here are the safety concerns and the previous arrangements. The sister is upset and thinks the writer is being selfish. But the writer is concerned about the pool and the number of kids. With 14 kids and 50 people, that's a lot to handle. Childproofing a house, especially around a pool, is a big responsibility. If the sister's kids aren't well-behaved except for the oldest three, there's a risk of accidents or damage. The writer might not be ready to handle such a large event at their home, especially if they're worried about safety. \n\nAlso, the sister has always hosted gatherings at her place before, so maybe the writer isn't obligated to do it now. The sister might be assuming that because the writer has a bigger house, they should host, but the writer might have valid personal and safety reasons. The fact that they haven't spoken in two months shows how serious the sister is taking it, but the writer's boundaries are about their own home and comfort. \n\nI think the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong. They have the right to set boundaries for their home, especially regarding safety. The sister might be overreaching by expecting this without considering the writer's concerns.\n"
