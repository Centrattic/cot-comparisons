It's as chaotic and nightmarish as you can imagine. Usually she never asks to come over to my place because it's a nightmare to travel with 14 kids to come visit their auntie who lives 5 hours away. If we're having a gathering it's always me who is travelling to their place. I don't really mind. We only meet a few times a year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few years ago I bought my dream house with my husband. My sister asked to host my nephew's 3rd birthday party at my house. She wants to use the big backyard, grill and pool at my home. There are roughly 50 people who are invited. I said no and she called me selfish and an asshole. Her kids have never been to my house and I prefer it that way. Her kids are not very well behaved except for the oldest three and my house is not child-poof. The pool seems like a huge liability. I don't want children drowning on my property. It just seems like a recipe for disaster. She brought up the fact that she hosted Christmas at her house for the past 10+ years at her house, but I don't think it's fair to compare this to that. We meet at her house instead of our parents because she has 14 kids to herd around so it's really more out of convenience to her. Every year for the past 10+ years I buy dessert enough to feed 25 people so I've done my part with the food arrangements. That's 8 apple pies or 3 cakes worth of dessert. My parents also stay over to help prepare and cook and we all contribute to the washing and cleaning. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe haven't spoken in 2 months because of this. She firmly believes AITA. So, AITA for not allowing my sister to host my nephew's birthday party at my house? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong for not allowing her sister to host a birthday party at her house. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author has 14 nephews and nieces. That's a lot of kids, and the sister usually hosts big gatherings at her own home. The author mentions that her house is not child-proof, and she's concerned about the safety, especially with the pool. She also points out that her sister never comes to her house because it's a 5-hour drive. So, the sister's request to host at the author's house seems out of the norm.\n\nThe author bought her dream house with her husband, which implies it's important to her. She turned down the request, leading to a two-month silence and the sister calling her selfish. The sister references hosting Christmas for years, but the author argues that the situations aren't the same because the Christmas gatherings are at the sister's home, which is more suitable for such a large group. The author also mentions contributing to the food in the past but doesn't want to take on the responsibility of hosting the birthday.\n\nKey points here: the author has valid safety concerns, the sister's request is for a large group in a home not suited for it, and the sister's own home is the usual location for such events. The sister's reaction seems harsh, especially since the author explained her reasons. The author isn't being selfish; she's protecting her property and safety. The sister's bringing up past Christmas events might be a red herring since the circumstances are different.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, and from the analysis, the author's reasons are legitimate. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
