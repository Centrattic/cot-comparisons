It's as chaotic and nightmarish as you can imagine. Usually she never asks to come over to my place because it's a nightmare to travel with 14 kids to come visit their auntie who lives 5 hours away. If we're having a gathering it's always me who is travelling to their place. I don't really mind. We only meet a few times a year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few years ago I bought my dream house with my husband. My sister asked to host my nephew's 3rd birthday party at my house. She wants to use the big backyard, grill and pool at my home. There are roughly 50 people who are invited. I said no and she called me selfish and an asshole. Her kids have never been to my house and I prefer it that way. Her kids are not very well behaved except for the oldest three and my house is not child-poof. The pool seems like a huge liability. I don't want children drowning on my property. It just seems like a recipe for disaster. She brought up the fact that she hosted Christmas at her house for the past 10+ years at her house, but I don't think it's fair to compare this to that. We meet at her house instead of our parents because she has 14 kids to herd around so it's really more out of convenience to her. Every year for the past 10+ years I buy dessert enough to feed 25 people so I've done my part with the food arrangements. That's 8 apple pies or 3 cakes worth of dessert. My parents also stay over to help prepare and cook and we all contribute to the washing and cleaning. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe haven't spoken in 2 months because of this. She firmly believes AITA. So, AITA for not allowing my sister to host my nephew's birthday party at my house? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the sister who said no to hosting the birthday party) is in the wrong. The sister has 14 kids, which is a lot. The author bought a dream house with her husband and didn't want the chaos of 50 people, including 14 kids, coming to her place. The sister called her selfish and an asshole because of that.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the main points. The author's reasons: her house isn't child-proof, pool safety is a concern, and she doesn't want the risk of kids getting hurt. She also mentions that the kids aren't well-behaved except for the oldest three. Plus, the sister usually hosts big events at her own home, so maybe the author doesn't see why this one is different. The sister brought up Christmas gatherings as a comparison, but the author points out that the Christmas events are at the sister's house, which is more convenient for her 14 kids. The author has contributed to food in the past, so she feels she's done her part.\n\nNow, from a moral standpoint, is the author wrong for saying no? Hosting a party for 50 people with 14 kids at someone else's home, especially a house that's not designed for it, could be a huge liability. The safety concerns about the pool and the unchild-proofed house are valid. The sister's reaction of calling her names might be over the top, but the author's decision is based on practical reasons. The sister's argument about past Christmas events doesn't seem fair because each situation is different in terms of location and risk.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the sister felt it was unfair since the author usually comes to her place. However, the author's home is a personal space, and she has the right to set boundaries. The fact that they haven't spoken in two months shows the tension, but the author's stance is about safety and personal property.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the author isn't in the wrong. She made a reasonable decision based on safety and personal comfort. The sister's response was harsh, but the author's reasons are valid. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
