It's as chaotic and nightmarish as you can imagine. Usually she never asks to come over to my place because it's a nightmare to travel with 14 kids to come visit their auntie who lives 5 hours away. If we're having a gathering it's always me who is travelling to their place. I don't really mind. We only meet a few times a year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few years ago I bought my dream house with my husband. My sister asked to host my nephew's 3rd birthday party at my house. She wants to use the big backyard, grill and pool at my home. There are roughly 50 people who are invited. I said no and she called me selfish and an asshole. Her kids have never been to my house and I prefer it that way. Her kids are not very well behaved except for the oldest three and my house is not child-poof. The pool seems like a huge liability. I don't want children drowning on my property. It just seems like a recipe for disaster. She brought up the fact that she hosted Christmas at her house for the past 10+ years at her house, but I don't think it's fair to compare this to that. We meet at her house instead of our parents because she has 14 kids to herd around so it's really more out of convenience to her. Every year for the past 10+ years I buy dessert enough to feed 25 people so I've done my part with the food arrangements. That's 8 apple pies or 3 cakes worth of dessert. My parents also stay over to help prepare and cook and we all contribute to the washing and cleaning. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe haven't spoken in 2 months because of this. She firmly believes AITA. So, AITA for not allowing my sister to host my nephew's birthday party at my house? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not letting their sister host a birthday party at their house. The sister has 14 kids, which is a lot, and the author is concerned about the chaos and safety, especially with the pool. The sister called them selfish and they haven't spoken in two months.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that their sister usually doesn't ask to come over, which suggests that the sister has been managing events at her own place. The author's house is a 5-hour drive away, so travel logistics are a factor. The sister's party would involve 50 people, which the author is not comfortable with. The safety concerns about the pool and the kids' behavior are valid. The sister points out that the author has hosted Christmas for years, but the author explains that their contributions there were minimal, just desserts, and the main event is at the sister's place for convenience due to the large family.\n\nThe key points here are autonomy over one's property and safety. The author has the right to set boundaries about who uses their home. The sister's reaction might be harsh, but the author's reasons are practical and safety-focused. The fact that the sister has hosted the Christmas events without the author using their space as a venue before supports the author's stance. Also, the author isn't refusing to participate entirely\u2014they meet at the sister's place instead. The sister's accusation of selfishness might be a misinterpretation; the author's concerns are legitimate about liability and the potential chaos with many kids.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong). They have valid reasons for their decision and are maintaining their own space's safety and comfort.\n"
