It's as chaotic and nightmarish as you can imagine. Usually she never asks to come over to my place because it's a nightmare to travel with 14 kids to come visit their auntie who lives 5 hours away. If we're having a gathering it's always me who is travelling to their place. I don't really mind. We only meet a few times a year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few years ago I bought my dream house with my husband. My sister asked to host my nephew's 3rd birthday party at my house. She wants to use the big backyard, grill and pool at my home. There are roughly 50 people who are invited. I said no and she called me selfish and an asshole. Her kids have never been to my house and I prefer it that way. Her kids are not very well behaved except for the oldest three and my house is not child-poof. The pool seems like a huge liability. I don't want children drowning on my property. It just seems like a recipe for disaster. She brought up the fact that she hosted Christmas at her house for the past 10+ years at her house, but I don't think it's fair to compare this to that. We meet at her house instead of our parents because she has 14 kids to herd around so it's really more out of convenience to her. Every year for the past 10+ years I buy dessert enough to feed 25 people so I've done my part with the food arrangements. That's 8 apple pies or 3 cakes worth of dessert. My parents also stay over to help prepare and cook and we all contribute to the washing and cleaning. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe haven't spoken in 2 months because of this. She firmly believes AITA. So, AITA for not allowing my sister to host my nephew's birthday party at my house? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about the author declining their sister's request to host a birthday party at their house. The sister has 14 kids, which is a lot, and she wants to use the big house, backyard, grill, and pool for a party with 50 people. The author says no, and the sister is upset, calling them selfish. They haven't spoken in two months.\n\nSo, the first thing to consider is the author's reasons. They mention that their house isn't child-proof, the pool is a liability, and they don't want kids drowning. Also, the sister's kids, except the oldest three, aren't well-behaved. Plus, they usually meet at the sister's house because she has more kids, making travel harder. The author feels it's a recipe for disaster and hasn't had the kids over before. They also contribute by buying desserts and help with cooking, so maybe they feel their contributions are enough.\n\nNow, the sister is upset because she hosted Christmas for 10 years, but the author is saying that's different. Hosting a kid's birthday with 50 people is a different scenario. The sister called them names, which is harsh, but maybe she felt slighted. The author is standing by their decision, so the question is whether that decision is valid.\n\nLooking at the factors: safety is a big one. The pool being a liability is a real concern. Child-proofing a home for 14 kids, especially when they're not well-behaved, could lead to accidents. The author's house is their dream home, and they might not want the risk or the mess. The sister's kids have never been there, so maybe the author isn't in the habit of hosting them.\n\nAlso, the sister's argument about previous years hosting Christmas is a comparison, but the author is right to point out that's not the same. Christmas is a family gathering, maybe more spread out, whereas a birthday party with 50 people is more intense. The author's contributions (desserts, helping with food) show they've supported in other ways, so declining this specific request isn't necessarily being selfish.\n\nThe sister's reaction seems over the top. Calling someone an asshole for saying no to a large, potentially risky event isn't fair. The author has the right to set boundaries for their home. So, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. They made a reasonable decision based on safety and comfort, and the sister's reaction is more about feeling rejected than the author being selfish. So the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
