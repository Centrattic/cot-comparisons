It's as chaotic and nightmarish as you can imagine. Usually she never asks to come over to my place because it's a nightmare to travel with 14 kids to come visit their auntie who lives 5 hours away. If we're having a gathering it's always me who is travelling to their place. I don't really mind. We only meet a few times a year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few years ago I bought my dream house with my husband. My sister asked to host my nephew's 3rd birthday party at my house. She wants to use the big backyard, grill and pool at my home. There are roughly 50 people who are invited. I said no and she called me selfish and an asshole. Her kids have never been to my house and I prefer it that way. Her kids are not very well behaved except for the oldest three and my house is not child-poof. The pool seems like a huge liability. I don't want children drowning on my property. It just seems like a recipe for disaster. She brought up the fact that she hosted Christmas at her house for the past 10+ years at her house, but I don't think it's fair to compare this to that. We meet at her house instead of our parents because she has 14 kids to herd around so it's really more out of convenience to her. Every year for the past 10+ years I buy dessert enough to feed 25 people so I've done my part with the food arrangements. That's 8 apple pies or 3 cakes worth of dessert. My parents also stay over to help prepare and cook and we all contribute to the washing and cleaning. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe haven't spoken in 2 months because of this. She firmly believes AITA. So, AITA for not allowing my sister to host my nephew's birthday party at my house? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for not allowing their sister to host a birthday party at their house. The sister has 14 kids, which is a lot, and the author is worried about safety, especially with the pool. The sister got upset and called them names, leading to a two-month silence.\n\nFirst, the author owns their home and has the right to set boundaries. They mention that their house isn't childproof and the pool is a liability. Safety is a valid concern, especially with a large group of children. The sister's kids are mostly not well-behaved, which adds to the risk. The author also points out that they usually visit the sister's place when there's a gathering, so this request is different. \n\nThe sister's argument is that she's hosted Christmas for years, but the author is comparing apples to oranges. Hosting a birthday with 50 people, especially with kids, is different from a Christmas gathering. The author also mentions contributing with desserts in the past, showing they've supported the family events in other ways. \n\nThe main factors here are safety, personal boundaries, and the specific circumstances of the request. The author isn't being selfish; they're making a reasonable decision based on their home's setup and their comfort level. The sister's reaction seems harsh, and the author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing their safety and home environment. So, the answer should be B.\n"
