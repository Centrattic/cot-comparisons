It's as chaotic and nightmarish as you can imagine. Usually she never asks to come over to my place because it's a nightmare to travel with 14 kids to come visit their auntie who lives 5 hours away. If we're having a gathering it's always me who is travelling to their place. I don't really mind. We only meet a few times a year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few years ago I bought my dream house with my husband. My sister asked to host my nephew's 3rd birthday party at my house. She wants to use the big backyard, grill and pool at my home. There are roughly 50 people who are invited. I said no and she called me selfish and an asshole. Her kids have never been to my house and I prefer it that way. Her kids are not very well behaved except for the oldest three and my house is not child-poof. The pool seems like a huge liability. I don't want children drowning on my property. It just seems like a recipe for disaster. She brought up the fact that she hosted Christmas at her house for the past 10+ years at her house, but I don't think it's fair to compare this to that. We meet at her house instead of our parents because she has 14 kids to herd around so it's really more out of convenience to her. Every year for the past 10+ years I buy dessert enough to feed 25 people so I've done my part with the food arrangements. That's 8 apple pies or 3 cakes worth of dessert. My parents also stay over to help prepare and cook and we all contribute to the washing and cleaning. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe haven't spoken in 2 months because of this. She firmly believes AITA. So, AITA for not allowing my sister to host my nephew's birthday party at my house? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again. The user's sister has 14 kids and usually the user travels to their house for gatherings. Now the sister wants to host a birthday party at the user's house with 50 people. The user says no, and the sister is upset, calling them selfish. The user is worried about the chaos, the kids' behavior, and the pool safety.\n\nFirst, the user's reasons: they bought their dream house, probably don't want a bunch of kids running around damaging things. The sister's kids aren't well-behaved except for the oldest three. The user's house isn't \"child-proof,\" and the pool is a liability. Those seem like valid safety concerns. Hosting a party with 50 people, especially with 14 kids, could be risky. The user might not want strangers or their sister's kids coming into their home. \n\nThe sister's side: she's used her house for Christmas for 10 years, and the user contributed desserts each year. But the user argues that this is different because it's a birthday party at their house. The sister's kids have never been to the user's house, which the user prefers. The sister feels slighted and the user is being called selfish. \n\nThe user's perspective is about personal boundaries and safety. The sister might feel that the user is being inconsiderate, especially since they've hosted before. But the user has a right to control their own space. The sister's reaction might be over the top if the user is standing by their decision. \n\nI think the user isn't in the wrong because they're protecting their property and safety. The sister should respect that. But maybe the sister feels unappreciated, but the user has given their reasons. The answer is B.\n"
