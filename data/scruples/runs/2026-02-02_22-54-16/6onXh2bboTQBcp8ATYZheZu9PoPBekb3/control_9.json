It's as chaotic and nightmarish as you can imagine. Usually she never asks to come over to my place because it's a nightmare to travel with 14 kids to come visit their auntie who lives 5 hours away. If we're having a gathering it's always me who is travelling to their place. I don't really mind. We only meet a few times a year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few years ago I bought my dream house with my husband. My sister asked to host my nephew's 3rd birthday party at my house. She wants to use the big backyard, grill and pool at my home. There are roughly 50 people who are invited. I said no and she called me selfish and an asshole. Her kids have never been to my house and I prefer it that way. Her kids are not very well behaved except for the oldest three and my house is not child-poof. The pool seems like a huge liability. I don't want children drowning on my property. It just seems like a recipe for disaster. She brought up the fact that she hosted Christmas at her house for the past 10+ years at her house, but I don't think it's fair to compare this to that. We meet at her house instead of our parents because she has 14 kids to herd around so it's really more out of convenience to her. Every year for the past 10+ years I buy dessert enough to feed 25 people so I've done my part with the food arrangements. That's 8 apple pies or 3 cakes worth of dessert. My parents also stay over to help prepare and cook and we all contribute to the washing and cleaning. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe haven't spoken in 2 months because of this. She firmly believes AITA. So, AITA for not allowing my sister to host my nephew's birthday party at my house? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for not allowing their sister to host a birthday party at their house. The sister has 14 kids, which the author finds chaotic. The party would involve 50 people, and the author is concerned about the pool and their home not being child-proof.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the main points. The sister's request is to host a 3rd birthday party at the author's house, which is 5 hours away. The author has a dream home but doesn't want the hassle. The sister is upset, calling the author selfish. They haven't spoken in two months now. The author's reasoning includes the risk of the pool and not wanting to deal with 14 kids, especially since they haven't met at the author's place before. The sister had hosted Christmas for years, but the author thinks it's not the same. They contribute to food and other help, so maybe the sister feels the author should reciprocate.\n\nOn one hand, the sister might feel that the author should be more accommodating, especially since they have the space. But on the other, the author has valid safety concerns with the pool and a large number of children. Also, the distance is a factor\u2014traveling 5 hours is a big deal with 14 kids. The author also mentions they only meet a few times a year, so maybe they're trying to set boundaries to protect their home and personal time. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the sister is being unreasonable if the request is too burdensome. The author's reasons are about safety and personal preference. They've been meeting at the sister's house because it's more convenient for the sister's large family. The sister's argument about previous Christmas events might not be fair since that's a different scale and purpose. The author isn't refusing all family gatherings but is setting a boundary for a specific reason. \n\nSo, the answer is likely B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. They have the right to set limits on their property, especially regarding safety. The sister's reaction seems harsh given the practical concerns.\n"
