It's as chaotic and nightmarish as you can imagine. Usually she never asks to come over to my place because it's a nightmare to travel with 14 kids to come visit their auntie who lives 5 hours away. If we're having a gathering it's always me who is travelling to their place. I don't really mind. We only meet a few times a year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few years ago I bought my dream house with my husband. My sister asked to host my nephew's 3rd birthday party at my house. She wants to use the big backyard, grill and pool at my home. There are roughly 50 people who are invited. I said no and she called me selfish and an asshole. Her kids have never been to my house and I prefer it that way. Her kids are not very well behaved except for the oldest three and my house is not child-poof. The pool seems like a huge liability. I don't want children drowning on my property. It just seems like a recipe for disaster. She brought up the fact that she hosted Christmas at her house for the past 10+ years at her house, but I don't think it's fair to compare this to that. We meet at her house instead of our parents because she has 14 kids to herd around so it's really more out of convenience to her. Every year for the past 10+ years I buy dessert enough to feed 25 people so I've done my part with the food arrangements. That's 8 apple pies or 3 cakes worth of dessert. My parents also stay over to help prepare and cook and we all contribute to the washing and cleaning. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe haven't spoken in 2 months because of this. She firmly believes AITA. So, AITA for not allowing my sister to host my nephew's birthday party at my house? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The question is whether the author is at fault for not letting their sister host a birthday party at their house. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the sister has 14 kids. That's a lot. The author lives 5 hours away, so traveling there isn't feasible for the sister. They usually meet at the sister's place. The author bought a dream house with their husband, which is important because they might not want the chaos of 14 kids plus 50 guests. The sister asked to use the backyard, grill, and pool for a 3rd birthday party. The author refused, and the sister got upset, calling them selfish. The author is worried about the kids' behavior and the pool's safety. They mention that the sister has hosted Christmas for 10 years, but the author thinks that's different. They also point out they contribute with desserts and help with cleaning.\n\nSo, the main points are about safety, the number of kids, and the author's right to control their property. The sister might feel entitled because of past help, but the author has valid concerns. Is it fair to compare past family gatherings to a birthday party? The author is prioritizing their own home's safety and their comfort. I think the author is justified in saying no, especially considering the potential risks. The sister might be overreacting, thinking it's about selfishness when it's actually about practicality and safety. So, the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
