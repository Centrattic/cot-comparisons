It's as chaotic and nightmarish as you can imagine. Usually she never asks to come over to my place because it's a nightmare to travel with 14 kids to come visit their auntie who lives 5 hours away. If we're having a gathering it's always me who is travelling to their place. I don't really mind. We only meet a few times a year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few years ago I bought my dream house with my husband. My sister asked to host my nephew's 3rd birthday party at my house. She wants to use the big backyard, grill and pool at my home. There are roughly 50 people who are invited. I said no and she called me selfish and an asshole. Her kids have never been to my house and I prefer it that way. Her kids are not very well behaved except for the oldest three and my house is not child-poof. The pool seems like a huge liability. I don't want children drowning on my property. It just seems like a recipe for disaster. She brought up the fact that she hosted Christmas at her house for the past 10+ years at her house, but I don't think it's fair to compare this to that. We meet at her house instead of our parents because she has 14 kids to herd around so it's really more out of convenience to her. Every year for the past 10+ years I buy dessert enough to feed 25 people so I've done my part with the food arrangements. That's 8 apple pies or 3 cakes worth of dessert. My parents also stay over to help prepare and cook and we all contribute to the washing and cleaning. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe haven't spoken in 2 months because of this. She firmly believes AITA. So, AITA for not allowing my sister to host my nephew's birthday party at my house? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for not letting their sister host a birthday party at their house. The sister has 14 kids, which is a lot. The author bought their dream home and probably doesn't want the chaos of 14 kids plus 50 guests in their backyard and pool. They mentioned safety concerns about the pool and the kids being unruly. The sister felt slighted and called them names, leading to a two-month silence.\n\nFirst, the author's perspective: they have a valid reason for saying no. Their house isn't childproof, and the liability of many children around a pool is a real issue. They also prefer not to have the sister's kids over because of past behavior. Plus, they're already contributing to the family gatherings by bringing dessert and helping out, so maybe they feel they've done their part without hosting.\n\nThe sister's side: she might feel that hosting at her own house is too hard (14 kids to manage), so she relies on others' homes. But the author is setting boundaries here. It's their home, and they have the right to decide who uses it and under what conditions. The sister's reaction seems harsh, calling the author selfish. Maybe she didn't consider the author's reasons, like safety and the stress of hosting a large party with unruly kids.\n\nLegally and ethically, the author isn't in the wrong. They're protecting their property and safety. The sister should have respected that. The fact that they met at the parents' house as usual suggests there's a history of that being the norm. The author isn't refusing all family gatherings but is specifically setting a boundary for their own home. The sister's anger might stem from feeling excluded or not being considered, but the author's decision is reasonable.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
