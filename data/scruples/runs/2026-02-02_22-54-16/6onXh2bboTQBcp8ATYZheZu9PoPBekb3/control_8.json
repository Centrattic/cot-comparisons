It's as chaotic and nightmarish as you can imagine. Usually she never asks to come over to my place because it's a nightmare to travel with 14 kids to come visit their auntie who lives 5 hours away. If we're having a gathering it's always me who is travelling to their place. I don't really mind. We only meet a few times a year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few years ago I bought my dream house with my husband. My sister asked to host my nephew's 3rd birthday party at my house. She wants to use the big backyard, grill and pool at my home. There are roughly 50 people who are invited. I said no and she called me selfish and an asshole. Her kids have never been to my house and I prefer it that way. Her kids are not very well behaved except for the oldest three and my house is not child-poof. The pool seems like a huge liability. I don't want children drowning on my property. It just seems like a recipe for disaster. She brought up the fact that she hosted Christmas at her house for the past 10+ years at her house, but I don't think it's fair to compare this to that. We meet at her house instead of our parents because she has 14 kids to herd around so it's really more out of convenience to her. Every year for the past 10+ years I buy dessert enough to feed 25 people so I've done my part with the food arrangements. That's 8 apple pies or 3 cakes worth of dessert. My parents also stay over to help prepare and cook and we all contribute to the washing and cleaning. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe haven't spoken in 2 months because of this. She firmly believes AITA. So, AITA for not allowing my sister to host my nephew's birthday party at my house? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong for not allowing their sister to host a birthday party at their house. The sister has 14 kids, which the author finds chaotic. They mentioned that the sister never usually asks to come over, and when they have gatherings, it's the author who travels to the sister's place. The sister wanted to use the author's backyard, grill, and pool for a party with 50 people. The author refused, and the sister is upset, saying the author is selfish.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's perspective. They bought their dream house and might be reluctant to have a large, potentially chaotic event there. The author is concerned about the safety, especially with the pool and the number of kids. They also mention that the kids aren't well-behaved except for the oldest three, and the house isn't child-proof. The liability of having so many children in a pool is a valid concern. Plus, the author has been contributing to the Christmas gatherings at the sister's house over the years with food and other help, so maybe they feel they've already given enough.\n\nOn the other hand, the sister's side is that she's hosting a birthday, which is a common family event. She might feel that since the author has more space and facilities, it's a good opportunity. She might also feel that because the author has hosted in the past (like Christmas), this is a continuation of that. The sister's frustration could stem from feeling that the author isn't supporting the family event, especially when they live 5 hours away, making it inconvenient to gather elsewhere.\n\nThe key points here are consent and boundaries. The author isn't obligated to host family events. They have the right to set boundaries to protect their home and safety. The sister's reaction of calling the author selfish and an asshole seems harsh, especially if the author had legitimate reasons. The sister's argument about previous Christmases might not be a fair comparison if the events are different in scale and context.\n\nAlso, the author's concern about the pool and the number of kids is valid. Safety should be a priority, and allowing 50 people with 14 kids, some of whom aren't well-behaved, could lead to accidents. The author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing their property and safety over hosting a party they're uncomfortable with.\n\nThe sister might not have considered the author's perspective and the logistical challenges. The fact that the author has been contributing to other events (like desserts for Christmas) shows they are willing to help in their own way. The sister might be expecting more than the author is willing to provide, which is a common source of family conflict.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong. They have the right to say no, and their concerns are reasonable. The sister's reaction is probably more about the sister's expectations not being met rather than the author being selfish.\n"
