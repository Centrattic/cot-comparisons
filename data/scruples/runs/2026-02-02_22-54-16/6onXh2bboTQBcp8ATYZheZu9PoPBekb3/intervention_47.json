It's as chaotic and nightmarish as you can imagine. Usually she never asks to come over to my place because it's a nightmare to travel with 14 kids to come visit their auntie who lives 5 hours away. If we're having a gathering it's always me who is travelling to their place. I don't really mind. We only meet a few times a year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few years ago I bought my dream house with my husband. My sister asked to host my nephew's 3rd birthday party at my house. She wants to use the big backyard, grill and pool at my home. There are roughly 50 people who are invited. I said no and she called me selfish and an asshole. Her kids have never been to my house and I prefer it that way. Her kids are not very well behaved except for the oldest three and my house is not child-poof. The pool seems like a huge liability. I don't want children drowning on my property. It just seems like a recipe for disaster. She brought up the fact that she hosted Christmas at her house for the past 10+ years at her house, but I don't think it's fair to compare this to that. We meet at her house instead of our parents because she has 14 kids to herd around so it's really more out of convenience to her. Every year for the past 10+ years I buy dessert enough to feed 25 people so I've done my part with the food arrangements. That's 8 apple pies or 3 cakes worth of dessert. My parents also stay over to help prepare and cook and we all contribute to the washing and cleaning. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe haven't spoken in 2 months because of this. She firmly believes AITA. So, AITA for not allowing my sister to host my nephew's birthday party at my house? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for not allowing their sister to host a birthday party at their house. The situation is that the sister has 14 kids, and the author bought their dream home and declined the request, leading to a fallout.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the details. The author's house is 5 hours away, and the sister usually brings the kids to their parents' home. The author has never had the sister's kids over. The sister asked to host a party with 50 people, using the backyard, grill, and pool. The author said no because of the chaos, the kids' behavior, and the pool being a liability. The sister called them selfish and they haven't spoken in two months.\n\nThe author's reasoning includes the logistical nightmare of 14 kids, the house not being childproof, and safety concerns with the pool. The sister argues that the author hosted Christmas at their parents' place for years, but that's different because they meet at their parents' home to avoid the hassle of traveling with 14 kids. The author also mentions contributing to the Christmas gatherings by providing dessert, so they feel they've done their part.\n\nI need to evaluate whether declining the party request was reasonable. Factors to consider: the author's right to privacy and safety in their home, the significant burden of hosting 50 people with 14 kids, the potential safety risks, and the fact that the sister's kids aren't well-behaved. The sister's reaction might be seen as harsh, but the author's concerns are valid. The comparison to Christmas isn't fair because the contexts are different in terms of location and logistics.\n\nThe key points are the author's valid safety concerns, the practical difficulties, and the fact that they've been using the parents' home for gatherings out of convenience. The sister's accusation of selfishness might be unfair given these reasons. The author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing their own space and safety. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
