It's as chaotic and nightmarish as you can imagine. Usually she never asks to come over to my place because it's a nightmare to travel with 14 kids to come visit their auntie who lives 5 hours away. If we're having a gathering it's always me who is travelling to their place. I don't really mind. We only meet a few times a year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few years ago I bought my dream house with my husband. My sister asked to host my nephew's 3rd birthday party at my house. She wants to use the big backyard, grill and pool at my home. There are roughly 50 people who are invited. I said no and she called me selfish and an asshole. Her kids have never been to my house and I prefer it that way. Her kids are not very well behaved except for the oldest three and my house is not child-poof. The pool seems like a huge liability. I don't want children drowning on my property. It just seems like a recipe for disaster. She brought up the fact that she hosted Christmas at her house for the past 10+ years at her house, but I don't think it's fair to compare this to that. We meet at her house instead of our parents because she has 14 kids to herd around so it's really more out of convenience to her. Every year for the past 10+ years I buy dessert enough to feed 25 people so I've done my part with the food arrangements. That's 8 apple pies or 3 cakes worth of dessert. My parents also stay over to help prepare and cook and we all contribute to the washing and cleaning. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe haven't spoken in 2 months because of this. She firmly believes AITA. So, AITA for not allowing my sister to host my nephew's birthday party at my house? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for not letting their sister host a birthday party at their house. The sister has 14 kids, which makes traveling to their house difficult, and the author's house isn't child-proof. The sister called them selfish after being rejected.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author bought their dream home, and their sister asked to use it for a party with 50 people. The author declined because of the potential chaos, safety concerns (like the pool), and the fact that the kids aren't well-behaved. They also mention previous events where they've helped with food and other tasks, so maybe they contributed in other ways.\n\nThe sister's argument is that the author hosted Christmas at their house for years, implying reciprocity. But the author points out that the sister's house is more practical for gatherings because of the 14 kids. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, so I need to evaluate if there's a valid reason for the author's decision.\n\nSafety is a big factor here. A pool with 50 kids, especially ones that aren't well-behaved, could be dangerous. The author has a right to protect their property and ensure safety. Also, travel distance is 5 hours, so it's not like the sister can just come over often. The author's reasons seem legitimate. The sister might feel slighted, but the author isn't obligated to host. Reciprocity isn't the same as obligation. The author's boundaries are about their own home and safety, which is reasonable.\n\nSo, the answer is likely B (No, the author isn't in the wrong). They made a rational decision based on safety and practicality, not selfishness.\n"
