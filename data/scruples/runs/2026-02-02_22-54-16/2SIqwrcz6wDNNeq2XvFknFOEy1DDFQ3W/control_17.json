Both enjoy having me there and in general the arrangement works out well.\n\nThey both earn more than 3 x what I do, if this matters.\n\nThey got engaged in July and I was asked to be a bridesmaid. I was very excited, and as this is my best friend of ten ish years I couldn\u2019t imagine not being a part of their wedding. The groom and I are also good friends due to being housemates, we are almost like a little family.\n\nI do not like Stephanie\u2019s friends. They are mean and shallow and materialistic and when I hang out with them I feel bad. I have a history of mental health issues if this matters - a big part of my road to recovery was understanding when I hung out with certain people, I would feel bad afterwards. My mental health has greatly improved since I stopped hanging out with this group of girls three or so years ago. I kept the friendships that didn\u2019t make me feel bad - such as Stephanie.\n\nI enthusiastically agreed the hen do would be great and not to worry about me not liking the other girls going - I could be civil for a few days to celebrate my best friends wedding.\n\nStephanie\u2019s sister and some of the girls going organised the hen do in secret, wanting Stephanie to be surprised. Three days ago I received a text from this group asking for \u00a3350 by Saturday (tomorrow) - and that if I couldn\u2019t afford it Stephanie\u2019s mother would pay my share and I could pay her back \u00a360 a month. The hen do will be a holiday to The south of france for four days, staying in a luxury villa/mansion, with a wine tour, a night out and a dinner. The \u00a3350 only covers flights and accommodation and will be in June next year.\n\nI do not have \u00a3350, I do not have \u00a360 a month spare. I am on a debt management plan and my car broke two months ago, meaning I had to borrow money from an uncle and agree to pay him back \u00a355 a month for three years. This was already a financial stress to me as I try to pay off my debt. I have been paying it off for three years and would have been debt free in a years time, but will be paying my uncle back for some years now. I don\u2019t buy clothes, I don\u2019t go out for dinners, I don\u2019t get my hair and nails done. I am sensible with my money.\n\nI approached Stephanie and Dave (he just happened to be there) - I said I was embarrassed about being offered to pay her mother back as they obviously know I can\u2019t afford the hen do, and that I just didn\u2019t know how I was going to afford to go.\n\nDave said it was disgusting of any friend, especially a bridesmaid, not to go to a hen party. He said he would go into debt or borrow money or \u201csell a limb\u201d to be there for a friend. Stephanie said I was \u201cbeing negative\u201d that I would \u201cupset her mum who offered to pay to be nice\u201d and that I\u2019m \u201cruining something she has dreamed of since she was a little girl\u201d\n\n\nI laid awake that night for hours trying to think of what I could sacrifice so that I will have an extra \u00a360 a month for this hen do. I feel awkward and uncomfortable living with people who want me to go into debt for their benefit, but can\u2019t find anywhere else to live that I can afford, though I\u2019ll keep looking. My anxiety is through the roof at the concept I\u2019ll be in more debt if I go.\n\nAITA if I say I just can\u2019t afford it and I\u2019m not going? Even though they let me live in their home and have offered me a payment plan? I don\u2019t want to hurt my finances but I don\u2019t want to be an ungrateful cow of a friend. I was expecting the whole thing to cost around \u00a3200, which I probably could have squeezed. reddit, be brutal. Am I a tight fisted ungrateful asshole here?? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is the asshole (AITA) for not attending their best friend's and housemate's hen party due to financial reasons. \n\nFirst, the author is a bridesmaid, which is a significant role in the wedding. They've been friends for ten years, so the relationship is long-standing. The hen party is a big event, organized by Stephanie's sister and friends, with the author being asked to pay \u00a3350 upfront or take a payment plan from Stephanie's mom. The author can't afford it because they're on a debt management plan and have a car loan. They might have to sacrifice other things they already don't spend on (like clothes, dinners, hair/nails) to cover it.\n\nThe key points here are financial constraints and the hen party's cost. The author isn't avoiding the event because of disinterest but due to real financial limitations. The friends and family members in the hen party group are described as making the author feel bad, but the author is making an effort to attend despite that. \n\nThe housemates, Stephanie and Dave, are critical of the author's decision. Dave says it's disgusting not to go, implying that even going into debt is necessary. But the author is already in a precarious financial situation. The fact that the hen do is a surprise might add to the pressure, but the author communicated their inability to pay. \n\nThe author's mental health history is relevant because they've learned to avoid people who negatively affect them. However, they're trying to be civil for the event, which shows consideration. The cost was unexpected (\u00a3350 vs. expected \u00a3200), and the payment plan isn't feasible. \n\nIn many cultures, bridesmaids are expected to participate in events like the hen party, but financial expectations can be a gray area. The author isn't being ungrateful; they're being honest about their situation. The friends should have considered the financial burden on the bridesmaid. \n\nThe housemates' living arrangement might complicate things, but the author's right to manage their finances isn't inherently wrong. The fact that Stephanie and Dave earn three times more than the author could imply a disparity in financial expectations. \n\nSo, the author is not in the wrong for prioritizing their financial stability and health. They communicated their situation, and the hen party organizers might not have considered the cost's impact on others. Answer B.\n"
