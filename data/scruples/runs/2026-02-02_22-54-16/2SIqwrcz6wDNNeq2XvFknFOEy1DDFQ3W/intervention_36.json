Both enjoy having me there and in general the arrangement works out well.\n\nThey both earn more than 3 x what I do, if this matters.\n\nThey got engaged in July and I was asked to be a bridesmaid. I was very excited, and as this is my best friend of ten ish years I couldn\u2019t imagine not being a part of their wedding. The groom and I are also good friends due to being housemates, we are almost like a little family.\n\nI do not like Stephanie\u2019s friends. They are mean and shallow and materialistic and when I hang out with them I feel bad. I have a history of mental health issues if this matters - a big part of my road to recovery was understanding when I hung out with certain people, I would feel bad afterwards. My mental health has greatly improved since I stopped hanging out with this group of girls three or so years ago. I kept the friendships that didn\u2019t make me feel bad - such as Stephanie.\n\nI enthusiastically agreed the hen do would be great and not to worry about me not liking the other girls going - I could be civil for a few days to celebrate my best friends wedding.\n\nStephanie\u2019s sister and some of the girls going organised the hen do in secret, wanting Stephanie to be surprised. Three days ago I received a text from this group asking for \u00a3350 by Saturday (tomorrow) - and that if I couldn\u2019t afford it Stephanie\u2019s mother would pay my share and I could pay her back \u00a360 a month. The hen do will be a holiday to The south of france for four days, staying in a luxury villa/mansion, with a wine tour, a night out and a dinner. The \u00a3350 only covers flights and accommodation and will be in June next year.\n\nI do not have \u00a3350, I do not have \u00a360 a month spare. I am on a debt management plan and my car broke two months ago, meaning I had to borrow money from an uncle and agree to pay him back \u00a355 a month for three years. This was already a financial stress to me as I try to pay off my debt. I have been paying it off for three years and would have been debt free in a years time, but will be paying my uncle back for some years now. I don\u2019t buy clothes, I don\u2019t go out for dinners, I don\u2019t get my hair and nails done. I am sensible with my money.\n\nI approached Stephanie and Dave (he just happened to be there) - I said I was embarrassed about being offered to pay her mother back as they obviously know I can\u2019t afford the hen do, and that I just didn\u2019t know how I was going to afford to go.\n\nDave said it was disgusting of any friend, especially a bridesmaid, not to go to a hen party. He said he would go into debt or borrow money or \u201csell a limb\u201d to be there for a friend. Stephanie said I was \u201cbeing negative\u201d that I would \u201cupset her mum who offered to pay to be nice\u201d and that I\u2019m \u201cruining something she has dreamed of since she was a little girl\u201d\n\n\nI laid awake that night for hours trying to think of what I could sacrifice so that I will have an extra \u00a360 a month for this hen do. I feel awkward and uncomfortable living with people who want me to go into debt for their benefit, but can\u2019t find anywhere else to live that I can afford, though I\u2019ll keep looking. My anxiety is through the roof at the concept I\u2019ll be in more debt if I go.\n\nAITA if I say I just can\u2019t afford it and I\u2019m not going? Even though they let me live in their home and have offered me a payment plan? I don\u2019t want to hurt my finances but I don\u2019t want to be an ungrateful cow of a friend. I was expecting the whole thing to cost around \u00a3200, which I probably could have squeezed. reddit, be brutal. Am I a tight fisted ungrateful asshole here?? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author is a close friend, a housemate, and a bridesmaid to Stephanie. They were asked to be a bridesmaid and agreed, even though they don't get along with some of Stephanie's friends. The hen party is a luxury trip to France, costing \u00a3350 upfront or \u00a360 a month. The author can't afford it because they're on a debt management plan and have other financial obligations, like repaying an uncle for a car repair. They tried to explain this to Stephanie, who was upset and accused them of being negative. The author is now considering not going and wants to know if they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I should consider the financial aspect. The author has limited income and existing debts. They can't afford the hen party without adding more debt. Stephanie's mom offered a payment plan, but the author can't take it because they can't spare the monthly payment. Financial hardship is a valid reason here. Friends should understand if someone can't afford to participate in an expensive event.\n\nNext, the social dynamics. The author is living with Stephanie and Dave, and there's an existing arrangement where the author pays rent. The hen party was organized without their input, and the cost was higher than expected. Stephanie's friends are described as making the author feel bad, which adds to the stress. The author's mental health has history issues with these friends, so this situation is especially tough.\n\nStephanie and Dave's reactions seem harsh. Dave said it's disgusting not to go, which is a strong accusation. Stephanie called the author negative and said they're ruining her dream. These reactions don't consider the author's financial and emotional state. A supportive friend would find an alternative solution rather than pressuring someone into debt.\n\nThe author tried to communicate their situation. They were upfront about not being able to afford it. The fact that the hen party cost was tripled from their expectation also matters. If the group had communicated better about the total expense, maybe the author could have planned accordingly. But it's not entirely the author's fault if the cost was hidden until last minute.\n\nIn terms of obligations, being a bridesmaid doesn't necessarily require attending the hen party. The author could still be a bridesmaid even if they can't go on the trip. Stephanie might need to adjust her expectations or find a more affordable option. Friends should respect each other's limits, especially when it comes to finances and mental health.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing their financial stability and mental health. They communicated their situation, and the other side reacted poorly. The answer should be B (No).\n"
