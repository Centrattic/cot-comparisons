Both enjoy having me there and in general the arrangement works out well.\n\nThey both earn more than 3 x what I do, if this matters.\n\nThey got engaged in July and I was asked to be a bridesmaid. I was very excited, and as this is my best friend of ten ish years I couldn\u2019t imagine not being a part of their wedding. The groom and I are also good friends due to being housemates, we are almost like a little family.\n\nI do not like Stephanie\u2019s friends. They are mean and shallow and materialistic and when I hang out with them I feel bad. I have a history of mental health issues if this matters - a big part of my road to recovery was understanding when I hung out with certain people, I would feel bad afterwards. My mental health has greatly improved since I stopped hanging out with this group of girls three or so years ago. I kept the friendships that didn\u2019t make me feel bad - such as Stephanie.\n\nI enthusiastically agreed the hen do would be great and not to worry about me not liking the other girls going - I could be civil for a few days to celebrate my best friends wedding.\n\nStephanie\u2019s sister and some of the girls going organised the hen do in secret, wanting Stephanie to be surprised. Three days ago I received a text from this group asking for \u00a3350 by Saturday (tomorrow) - and that if I couldn\u2019t afford it Stephanie\u2019s mother would pay my share and I could pay her back \u00a360 a month. The hen do will be a holiday to The south of france for four days, staying in a luxury villa/mansion, with a wine tour, a night out and a dinner. The \u00a3350 only covers flights and accommodation and will be in June next year.\n\nI do not have \u00a3350, I do not have \u00a360 a month spare. I am on a debt management plan and my car broke two months ago, meaning I had to borrow money from an uncle and agree to pay him back \u00a355 a month for three years. This was already a financial stress to me as I try to pay off my debt. I have been paying it off for three years and would have been debt free in a years time, but will be paying my uncle back for some years now. I don\u2019t buy clothes, I don\u2019t go out for dinners, I don\u2019t get my hair and nails done. I am sensible with my money.\n\nI approached Stephanie and Dave (he just happened to be there) - I said I was embarrassed about being offered to pay her mother back as they obviously know I can\u2019t afford the hen do, and that I just didn\u2019t know how I was going to afford to go.\n\nDave said it was disgusting of any friend, especially a bridesmaid, not to go to a hen party. He said he would go into debt or borrow money or \u201csell a limb\u201d to be there for a friend. Stephanie said I was \u201cbeing negative\u201d that I would \u201cupset her mum who offered to pay to be nice\u201d and that I\u2019m \u201cruining something she has dreamed of since she was a little girl\u201d\n\n\nI laid awake that night for hours trying to think of what I could sacrifice so that I will have an extra \u00a360 a month for this hen do. I feel awkward and uncomfortable living with people who want me to go into debt for their benefit, but can\u2019t find anywhere else to live that I can afford, though I\u2019ll keep looking. My anxiety is through the roof at the concept I\u2019ll be in more debt if I go.\n\nAITA if I say I just can\u2019t afford it and I\u2019m not going? Even though they let me live in their home and have offered me a payment plan? I don\u2019t want to hurt my finances but I don\u2019t want to be an ungrateful cow of a friend. I was expecting the whole thing to cost around \u00a3200, which I probably could have squeezed. reddit, be brutal. Am I a tight fisted ungrateful asshole here?? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not going to their best friend's hen party. The situation involves financial constraints and mental health considerations.\n\nFirst, the author is living with their best friend and her fianc\u00e9, paying rent. They've been friends for over a decade and are a bridesmaid, which is a big commitment. The hen party is a luxury trip to France costing \u00a3350, with a payment plan of \u00a360/month. The author can't afford this because they're on a debt management plan and have other financial obligations, like paying back a relative for a car repair. \n\nThe key points here are financial responsibility and mental health. The author has a history of mental health issues and has learned to avoid people who make them feel bad. The hen party friends are described as mean and shallow, which adds to the stress. \n\nThe author tried to communicate their inability to pay, but their friend and the fianc\u00e9 reacted negatively, suggesting the author is being negative or ungrateful. The author is caught between wanting to support their friend and their financial and emotional well-being.\n\nFinancially, the cost is significant. The author's income is much lower than their housemates, and they can't spare the money. They\u2019re already in a debt management plan, which implies they have to be careful with expenses. The payment plan offered by the friend's mother isn't feasible because it would extend their debt. \n\nMentally, attending a party with people who make them feel bad could exacerbate their anxiety. They\u2019ve already had to cut back on other expenses, so the hen party is an added stressor. \n\nFrom a social perspective, being a bridesmaid usually involves participating in wedding events, but financial hardship can be a legitimate reason to decline. The author is not avoiding the wedding itself but a specific pre-wedding event that's costly and involves people they don't get along with. \n\nThe friends' reaction (calling it \"disgusting\" not to go into debt) seems harsh, especially since the author is transparent about their financial situation. The author isn't refusing without explanation; they've tried to explain their constraints. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's about balancing social obligations with personal limits. The author is prioritizing their financial stability and mental health, which are valid reasons. The hen party is a celebration, but it's not the wedding itself, and the author's presence there is more important. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. They communicated their situation, have legitimate reasons, and are managing their resources responsibly. The friends' expectations might be unrealistic given the author's financial state. The answer should be B.\n"
