Both enjoy having me there and in general the arrangement works out well.\n\nThey both earn more than 3 x what I do, if this matters.\n\nThey got engaged in July and I was asked to be a bridesmaid. I was very excited, and as this is my best friend of ten ish years I couldn\u2019t imagine not being a part of their wedding. The groom and I are also good friends due to being housemates, we are almost like a little family.\n\nI do not like Stephanie\u2019s friends. They are mean and shallow and materialistic and when I hang out with them I feel bad. I have a history of mental health issues if this matters - a big part of my road to recovery was understanding when I hung out with certain people, I would feel bad afterwards. My mental health has greatly improved since I stopped hanging out with this group of girls three or so years ago. I kept the friendships that didn\u2019t make me feel bad - such as Stephanie.\n\nI enthusiastically agreed the hen do would be great and not to worry about me not liking the other girls going - I could be civil for a few days to celebrate my best friends wedding.\n\nStephanie\u2019s sister and some of the girls going organised the hen do in secret, wanting Stephanie to be surprised. Three days ago I received a text from this group asking for \u00a3350 by Saturday (tomorrow) - and that if I couldn\u2019t afford it Stephanie\u2019s mother would pay my share and I could pay her back \u00a360 a month. The hen do will be a holiday to The south of france for four days, staying in a luxury villa/mansion, with a wine tour, a night out and a dinner. The \u00a3350 only covers flights and accommodation and will be in June next year.\n\nI do not have \u00a3350, I do not have \u00a360 a month spare. I am on a debt management plan and my car broke two months ago, meaning I had to borrow money from an uncle and agree to pay him back \u00a355 a month for three years. This was already a financial stress to me as I try to pay off my debt. I have been paying it off for three years and would have been debt free in a years time, but will be paying my uncle back for some years now. I don\u2019t buy clothes, I don\u2019t go out for dinners, I don\u2019t get my hair and nails done. I am sensible with my money.\n\nI approached Stephanie and Dave (he just happened to be there) - I said I was embarrassed about being offered to pay her mother back as they obviously know I can\u2019t afford the hen do, and that I just didn\u2019t know how I was going to afford to go.\n\nDave said it was disgusting of any friend, especially a bridesmaid, not to go to a hen party. He said he would go into debt or borrow money or \u201csell a limb\u201d to be there for a friend. Stephanie said I was \u201cbeing negative\u201d that I would \u201cupset her mum who offered to pay to be nice\u201d and that I\u2019m \u201cruining something she has dreamed of since she was a little girl\u201d\n\n\nI laid awake that night for hours trying to think of what I could sacrifice so that I will have an extra \u00a360 a month for this hen do. I feel awkward and uncomfortable living with people who want me to go into debt for their benefit, but can\u2019t find anywhere else to live that I can afford, though I\u2019ll keep looking. My anxiety is through the roof at the concept I\u2019ll be in more debt if I go.\n\nAITA if I say I just can\u2019t afford it and I\u2019m not going? Even though they let me live in their home and have offered me a payment plan? I don\u2019t want to hurt my finances but I don\u2019t want to be an ungrateful cow of a friend. I was expecting the whole thing to cost around \u00a3200, which I probably could have squeezed. reddit, be brutal. Am I a tight fisted ungrateful asshole here?? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not attending their best friend's hen party due to financial constraints. Let me break down the details.\n\nFirst, the author lives with their best friend Stephanie and her fianc\u00e9 Dave. They pay rent for a room in a house the couple owns. The author's income is significantly lower than theirs. The hen party is a luxury trip to the south of France, costing \u00a3350 upfront and then \u00a360 a month, which the author can't afford. They're already on a debt management plan and have a car loan. The author has mental health issues and avoids Stephanie's other friends because they're toxic. They were okay with the hen party initially, thinking it would cost about \u00a3200, but the actual cost is way higher. When they tried to explain their situation, Dave and Stephanie were dismissive, even hostile. The author is now considering not going because they can't afford it, but they feel guilty and worry about being seen as ungrateful.\n\nSo, the main points here are financial hardship, the value of the relationship, and the expectations versus reality. The author is in a tough spot. They want to support their best friend but can't afford the expense. The friends and fianc\u00e9 aren't being understanding. The hen party is a big expense that the author didn't anticipate. The author's mental health is also a factor, as they have a history of being affected by certain social groups. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, they tried to be a good friend by agreeing to be a bridesmaid and attend the hen party. They communicated their inability to pay once they realized the cost. The friends and fianc\u00e9's reactions are problematic. The author isn't being selfish; they're making a responsible financial decision. They're not asking for a handout, just explaining their limits. The friends expected the author to go into debt, which is unreasonable. The author's mental health is a valid concern, especially given their past experiences with Stephanie's friends. \n\nSo, the answer is B (Not in the wrong). The author isn't obligated to go into debt for a friend's event, even if it's a hen party. Their financial situation and mental health are valid reasons. The friends and fianc\u00e9 should have considered the cost and the author's circumstances better. The author isn't ungrateful; they're being honest about their limitations."
