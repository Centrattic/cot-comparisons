Both enjoy having me there and in general the arrangement works out well.\n\nThey both earn more than 3 x what I do, if this matters.\n\nThey got engaged in July and I was asked to be a bridesmaid. I was very excited, and as this is my best friend of ten ish years I couldn\u2019t imagine not being a part of their wedding. The groom and I are also good friends due to being housemates, we are almost like a little family.\n\nI do not like Stephanie\u2019s friends. They are mean and shallow and materialistic and when I hang out with them I feel bad. I have a history of mental health issues if this matters - a big part of my road to recovery was understanding when I hung out with certain people, I would feel bad afterwards. My mental health has greatly improved since I stopped hanging out with this group of girls three or so years ago. I kept the friendships that didn\u2019t make me feel bad - such as Stephanie.\n\nI enthusiastically agreed the hen do would be great and not to worry about me not liking the other girls going - I could be civil for a few days to celebrate my best friends wedding.\n\nStephanie\u2019s sister and some of the girls going organised the hen do in secret, wanting Stephanie to be surprised. Three days ago I received a text from this group asking for \u00a3350 by Saturday (tomorrow) - and that if I couldn\u2019t afford it Stephanie\u2019s mother would pay my share and I could pay her back \u00a360 a month. The hen do will be a holiday to The south of france for four days, staying in a luxury villa/mansion, with a wine tour, a night out and a dinner. The \u00a3350 only covers flights and accommodation and will be in June next year.\n\nI do not have \u00a3350, I do not have \u00a360 a month spare. I am on a debt management plan and my car broke two months ago, meaning I had to borrow money from an uncle and agree to pay him back \u00a355 a month for three years. This was already a financial stress to me as I try to pay off my debt. I have been paying it off for three years and would have been debt free in a years time, but will be paying my uncle back for some years now. I don\u2019t buy clothes, I don\u2019t go out for dinners, I don\u2019t get my hair and nails done. I am sensible with my money.\n\nI approached Stephanie and Dave (he just happened to be there) - I said I was embarrassed about being offered to pay her mother back as they obviously know I can\u2019t afford the hen do, and that I just didn\u2019t know how I was going to afford to go.\n\nDave said it was disgusting of any friend, especially a bridesmaid, not to go to a hen party. He said he would go into debt or borrow money or \u201csell a limb\u201d to be there for a friend. Stephanie said I was \u201cbeing negative\u201d that I would \u201cupset her mum who offered to pay to be nice\u201d and that I\u2019m \u201cruining something she has dreamed of since she was a little girl\u201d\n\n\nI laid awake that night for hours trying to think of what I could sacrifice so that I will have an extra \u00a360 a month for this hen do. I feel awkward and uncomfortable living with people who want me to go into debt for their benefit, but can\u2019t find anywhere else to live that I can afford, though I\u2019ll keep looking. My anxiety is through the roof at the concept I\u2019ll be in more debt if I go.\n\nAITA if I say I just can\u2019t afford it and I\u2019m not going? Even though they let me live in their home and have offered me a payment plan? I don\u2019t want to hurt my finances but I don\u2019t want to be an ungrateful cow of a friend. I was expecting the whole thing to cost around \u00a3200, which I probably could have squeezed. reddit, be brutal. Am I a tight fisted ungrateful asshole here?? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for not attending their best friend's and housemate's hen party. The main points here are financial constraints, mental health, and the dynamics between the friends.\n\nFirst, the author is a bridesmaid for their best friend, Stephanie, and they were asked to pay \u00a3350 for the hen party, which is a luxury trip to South France. They don't have that money upfront and can't afford the monthly payments of \u00a360. They're already on a debt management plan and have a car loan from their uncle. Their mental health has been a concern, especially with Stephanie's other friends, and they've made a conscious effort to avoid people who negatively affect their well-being.\n\nStephanie and Dave (the groom, and the author's housemate) react strongly. Dave says they'd go into debt to attend, and Stephanie accuses the author of being negative and ruining her dream. The author is caught between not wanting to add more debt and not wanting to be seen as ungrateful.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider the ethical aspects. Financial responsibility is a big factor here. The author is making a conscious effort to manage their debt and avoid further financial strain. Taking on more debt just to go to a party they can't afford might not be wise, especially if they're already making sacrifices in their spending habits. \n\nAlso, their mental health is an important aspect. They've had issues in the past with Stephanie's friends, and attending might exacerbate their anxiety. It's valid to prioritize one's mental health, even if it means declining an event. \n\nOn the other side, Stephanie might feel hurt because the author is her best friend. However, the author didn't promise to cover the entire cost upfront. The hen party is planned in June next year, giving some time to save, but the author's financial situation is already tight. The sister's offer to pay through the mother with a repayment plan might not be feasible for the author given their current commitments.\n\nHousemates and the living arrangement could add pressure, but the author's needs shouldn't be overshadowed by the housemates' expectations, especially when it's a matter of personal finance and health. The author's intention to keep looking for a more affordable place to live shows they care about the relationship, but that shouldn't force them into debt for a celebration that's not their primary responsibility.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, people often consider intent and impact. The author's intent is to be responsible with their money and protect their mental health. The impact is not attending the event, which might hurt Stephanie's feelings, but the author's reasoning is understandable. Stepahnie's reaction seems harsh, as she and Dave earn significantly more than the author. It's unfair to expect someone with a lower income to take on debt for a party, especially when the author is already managing their own financial obligations. \n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing their financial stability and mental health. They communicated their concerns, and while they chose not to go, it's a responsible decision given their circumstances.\n"
