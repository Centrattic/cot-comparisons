Both enjoy having me there and in general the arrangement works out well.\n\nThey both earn more than 3 x what I do, if this matters.\n\nThey got engaged in July and I was asked to be a bridesmaid. I was very excited, and as this is my best friend of ten ish years I couldn\u2019t imagine not being a part of their wedding. The groom and I are also good friends due to being housemates, we are almost like a little family.\n\nI do not like Stephanie\u2019s friends. They are mean and shallow and materialistic and when I hang out with them I feel bad. I have a history of mental health issues if this matters - a big part of my road to recovery was understanding when I hung out with certain people, I would feel bad afterwards. My mental health has greatly improved since I stopped hanging out with this group of girls three or so years ago. I kept the friendships that didn\u2019t make me feel bad - such as Stephanie.\n\nI enthusiastically agreed the hen do would be great and not to worry about me not liking the other girls going - I could be civil for a few days to celebrate my best friends wedding.\n\nStephanie\u2019s sister and some of the girls going organised the hen do in secret, wanting Stephanie to be surprised. Three days ago I received a text from this group asking for \u00a3350 by Saturday (tomorrow) - and that if I couldn\u2019t afford it Stephanie\u2019s mother would pay my share and I could pay her back \u00a360 a month. The hen do will be a holiday to The south of france for four days, staying in a luxury villa/mansion, with a wine tour, a night out and a dinner. The \u00a3350 only covers flights and accommodation and will be in June next year.\n\nI do not have \u00a3350, I do not have \u00a360 a month spare. I am on a debt management plan and my car broke two months ago, meaning I had to borrow money from an uncle and agree to pay him back \u00a355 a month for three years. This was already a financial stress to me as I try to pay off my debt. I have been paying it off for three years and would have been debt free in a years time, but will be paying my uncle back for some years now. I don\u2019t buy clothes, I don\u2019t go out for dinners, I don\u2019t get my hair and nails done. I am sensible with my money.\n\nI approached Stephanie and Dave (he just happened to be there) - I said I was embarrassed about being offered to pay her mother back as they obviously know I can\u2019t afford the hen do, and that I just didn\u2019t know how I was going to afford to go.\n\nDave said it was disgusting of any friend, especially a bridesmaid, not to go to a hen party. He said he would go into debt or borrow money or \u201csell a limb\u201d to be there for a friend. Stephanie said I was \u201cbeing negative\u201d that I would \u201cupset her mum who offered to pay to be nice\u201d and that I\u2019m \u201cruining something she has dreamed of since she was a little girl\u201d\n\n\nI laid awake that night for hours trying to think of what I could sacrifice so that I will have an extra \u00a360 a month for this hen do. I feel awkward and uncomfortable living with people who want me to go into debt for their benefit, but can\u2019t find anywhere else to live that I can afford, though I\u2019ll keep looking. My anxiety is through the roof at the concept I\u2019ll be in more debt if I go.\n\nAITA if I say I just can\u2019t afford it and I\u2019m not going? Even though they let me live in their home and have offered me a payment plan? I don\u2019t want to hurt my finances but I don\u2019t want to be an ungrateful cow of a friend. I was expecting the whole thing to cost around \u00a3200, which I probably could have squeezed. reddit, be brutal. Am I a tight fisted ungrateful asshole here?? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not attending their best friend's hen party. The situation is a bit complicated, so I need to break it down.\n\nFirst, the author is a best friend and a housemate. They pay rent for a room in the house owned by the friend and her fianc\u00e9. The fianc\u00e9 earns three times more than the author. The hen party is a big deal, and the author was asked to be a bridesmaid. But the problem is the cost\u2014\u00a3350 upfront or \u00a360 a month. The author is on a debt management plan, has a broken car, and is already paying back an uncle. They can't afford the extra expense. They tried to explain this to Stephanie and Dave, but the fianc\u00e9 was dismissive, and Stephanie was upset.\n\nThe author is worried about going into more debt and is anxious about the situation. They don't want to be seen as ungrateful but can't afford it. The question is whether they are in the wrong by not attending despite the payment plan offered by Stephanie's mom.\n\nLet me consider the key points. The author has valid financial constraints. They mentioned a debt management plan, a broken car with ongoing payments, and a tight budget. They\u2019re not being frivolous; they\u2019re prioritizing their financial stability. Stephanie's friends are people the author already finds toxic, which adds to the stress. The hen party is organized by Stephanie's sister and friends in a way that the author finds unreasonable in cost. The author tried to communicate their situation but was met with negative reactions from the fianc\u00e9 and Stephanie. \n\nIs it fair to expect the author to go into debt for a hen party? Not really. Financial responsibility is important. The author isn't the one who set the cost, and they\u2019ve already made their position clear. The payment plan is an option, but the author can't afford it. The fianc\u00e9's reaction seems harsh, and Stephanie's insistence on the author going, despite their financial situation, might be inconsiderate. \n\nThe author's main concern is their well-being and financial health. They\u2019re not being ungrateful; they\u2019re being realistic. The friends' group is toxic, and the hen party isn't a vacation they can afford. The author\u2019s decision to not go is about self-preservation. So, they're not in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
