Both enjoy having me there and in general the arrangement works out well.\n\nThey both earn more than 3 x what I do, if this matters.\n\nThey got engaged in July and I was asked to be a bridesmaid. I was very excited, and as this is my best friend of ten ish years I couldn\u2019t imagine not being a part of their wedding. The groom and I are also good friends due to being housemates, we are almost like a little family.\n\nI do not like Stephanie\u2019s friends. They are mean and shallow and materialistic and when I hang out with them I feel bad. I have a history of mental health issues if this matters - a big part of my road to recovery was understanding when I hung out with certain people, I would feel bad afterwards. My mental health has greatly improved since I stopped hanging out with this group of girls three or so years ago. I kept the friendships that didn\u2019t make me feel bad - such as Stephanie.\n\nI enthusiastically agreed the hen do would be great and not to worry about me not liking the other girls going - I could be civil for a few days to celebrate my best friends wedding.\n\nStephanie\u2019s sister and some of the girls going organised the hen do in secret, wanting Stephanie to be surprised. Three days ago I received a text from this group asking for \u00a3350 by Saturday (tomorrow) - and that if I couldn\u2019t afford it Stephanie\u2019s mother would pay my share and I could pay her back \u00a360 a month. The hen do will be a holiday to The south of france for four days, staying in a luxury villa/mansion, with a wine tour, a night out and a dinner. The \u00a3350 only covers flights and accommodation and will be in June next year.\n\nI do not have \u00a3350, I do not have \u00a360 a month spare. I am on a debt management plan and my car broke two months ago, meaning I had to borrow money from an uncle and agree to pay him back \u00a355 a month for three years. This was already a financial stress to me as I try to pay off my debt. I have been paying it off for three years and would have been debt free in a years time, but will be paying my uncle back for some years now. I don\u2019t buy clothes, I don\u2019t go out for dinners, I don\u2019t get my hair and nails done. I am sensible with my money.\n\nI approached Stephanie and Dave (he just happened to be there) - I said I was embarrassed about being offered to pay her mother back as they obviously know I can\u2019t afford the hen do, and that I just didn\u2019t know how I was going to afford to go.\n\nDave said it was disgusting of any friend, especially a bridesmaid, not to go to a hen party. He said he would go into debt or borrow money or \u201csell a limb\u201d to be there for a friend. Stephanie said I was \u201cbeing negative\u201d that I would \u201cupset her mum who offered to pay to be nice\u201d and that I\u2019m \u201cruining something she has dreamed of since she was a little girl\u201d\n\n\nI laid awake that night for hours trying to think of what I could sacrifice so that I will have an extra \u00a360 a month for this hen do. I feel awkward and uncomfortable living with people who want me to go into debt for their benefit, but can\u2019t find anywhere else to live that I can afford, though I\u2019ll keep looking. My anxiety is through the roof at the concept I\u2019ll be in more debt if I go.\n\nAITA if I say I just can\u2019t afford it and I\u2019m not going? Even though they let me live in their home and have offered me a payment plan? I don\u2019t want to hurt my finances but I don\u2019t want to be an ungrateful cow of a friend. I was expecting the whole thing to cost around \u00a3200, which I probably could have squeezed. reddit, be brutal. Am I a tight fisted ungrateful asshole here?? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking whether the person who wrote the original post (AITA) is in the wrong for not attending their best friend's hen party. The key points here are about financial responsibility, mental health, and the dynamics of their living situation.\n\nFirst, the author is living with their best friend and her fianc\u00e9, paying rent. They were asked to be a bridesmaid, which they were excited about. The issue arises with the hen party, which costs \u00a3350, and a payment plan that would add to their existing financial strain. The author is on a debt management plan and has a car repair debt they're paying off. The friend's mother offered a payment plan, but the author can't afford it. The fianc\u00e9 criticized the author for not wanting to go into debt, while the friend said the author was being negative and ruining her dream.\n\nI need to consider if the author is obligated to attend despite financial issues. The author has mental health concerns with the friend's other friends, which adds another layer. They've already cut back on personal expenses and are managing their debt. The friends, on the other hand, earn more than three times what the author does. \n\nFinancial responsibility is a big factor here. The author isn't avoiding the commitment but is realistically assessing their ability to pay. The friends might feel hurt, but the author's situation is valid. The fianc\u00e9's comment about selling a limb is extreme, suggesting he thinks it's necessary regardless of cost, which might not be fair. The author's mental health history is also a consideration; they've had issues in the past with certain social groups, so this event could trigger anxiety.\n\nThe living arrangement complicates things because the author can't just leave, but they're still trying to find affordable housing. They're in a tough spot between their financial obligations and their social commitments. The key is whether not attending is ungrateful or if it's a necessary decision based on their circumstances.\n\nIn most cases, friends should understand each other's financial realities. Expecting someone to go into debt for a hen party, especially when there are other means (like the mother's payment plan), but the person can't meet those terms due to existing debts, isn't fair. The author is prioritizing their financial stability, which is crucial for their well-being and recovery. They're not avoiding the event out of spite but because they can't afford it without harming their financial health.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author isn't in the wrong. They've communicated their situation and are making a responsible choice. The friends' reactions, especially the fianc\u00e9's, seem judgmental and not considering the author's real constraints. Therefore, the answer should be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
