Both enjoy having me there and in general the arrangement works out well.\n\nThey both earn more than 3 x what I do, if this matters.\n\nThey got engaged in July and I was asked to be a bridesmaid. I was very excited, and as this is my best friend of ten ish years I couldn\u2019t imagine not being a part of their wedding. The groom and I are also good friends due to being housemates, we are almost like a little family.\n\nI do not like Stephanie\u2019s friends. They are mean and shallow and materialistic and when I hang out with them I feel bad. I have a history of mental health issues if this matters - a big part of my road to recovery was understanding when I hung out with certain people, I would feel bad afterwards. My mental health has greatly improved since I stopped hanging out with this group of girls three or so years ago. I kept the friendships that didn\u2019t make me feel bad - such as Stephanie.\n\nI enthusiastically agreed the hen do would be great and not to worry about me not liking the other girls going - I could be civil for a few days to celebrate my best friends wedding.\n\nStephanie\u2019s sister and some of the girls going organised the hen do in secret, wanting Stephanie to be surprised. Three days ago I received a text from this group asking for \u00a3350 by Saturday (tomorrow) - and that if I couldn\u2019t afford it Stephanie\u2019s mother would pay my share and I could pay her back \u00a360 a month. The hen do will be a holiday to The south of france for four days, staying in a luxury villa/mansion, with a wine tour, a night out and a dinner. The \u00a3350 only covers flights and accommodation and will be in June next year.\n\nI do not have \u00a3350, I do not have \u00a360 a month spare. I am on a debt management plan and my car broke two months ago, meaning I had to borrow money from an uncle and agree to pay him back \u00a355 a month for three years. This was already a financial stress to me as I try to pay off my debt. I have been paying it off for three years and would have been debt free in a years time, but will be paying my uncle back for some years now. I don\u2019t buy clothes, I don\u2019t go out for dinners, I don\u2019t get my hair and nails done. I am sensible with my money.\n\nI approached Stephanie and Dave (he just happened to be there) - I said I was embarrassed about being offered to pay her mother back as they obviously know I can\u2019t afford the hen do, and that I just didn\u2019t know how I was going to afford to go.\n\nDave said it was disgusting of any friend, especially a bridesmaid, not to go to a hen party. He said he would go into debt or borrow money or \u201csell a limb\u201d to be there for a friend. Stephanie said I was \u201cbeing negative\u201d that I would \u201cupset her mum who offered to pay to be nice\u201d and that I\u2019m \u201cruining something she has dreamed of since she was a little girl\u201d\n\n\nI laid awake that night for hours trying to think of what I could sacrifice so that I will have an extra \u00a360 a month for this hen do. I feel awkward and uncomfortable living with people who want me to go into debt for their benefit, but can\u2019t find anywhere else to live that I can afford, though I\u2019ll keep looking. My anxiety is through the roof at the concept I\u2019ll be in more debt if I go.\n\nAITA if I say I just can\u2019t afford it and I\u2019m not going? Even though they let me live in their home and have offered me a payment plan? I don\u2019t want to hurt my finances but I don\u2019t want to be an ungrateful cow of a friend. I was expecting the whole thing to cost around \u00a3200, which I probably could have squeezed. reddit, be brutal. Am I a tight fisted ungrateful asshole here?? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author is a bridesmaid for their best friend, Stephanie, and a housemate with both Stephanie and her fianc\u00e9, Dave. The hen party is a big deal, and they were asked to pay \u00a3350 upfront or take a loan from Stephanie's mom, which would require \u00a360 a month. The author can't afford this because they're on a debt management plan and already paying back an uncle. They're struggling financially and feel pressured.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author is in a tight financial situation, with existing debts. They mentioned that they already have to pay \u00a355 a month for three years to their uncle, which was a necessary expense. The hen party cost is higher than expected (\u00a3350 instead of the anticipated \u00a3200), and the proposed payment plan would add more financial strain. \n\nThen, there's the dynamic with the housemates. Dave and Stephanie are both in a better financial position, and they own the house where the author lives. The author pays rent for a room, so while they live there, they're contributing. But the hen party is an additional expense. The author is worried that declining might hurt their relationship, but they don't want to go into debt for something they can't afford. \n\nThe friends on the hen party are described as mean and shallow, which the author has a history of being affected by. Even though the author tried to be civil before, this trip might trigger their anxiety again. \n\nThe main question is whether the author is in the wrong for not going. From the author's perspective, they're prioritizing their financial stability and mental health. They have a valid reason not to take on more debt, especially when they're already on a debt management plan. The hen party is a social event, and while being a bridesmaid is a commitment, it's not a legal one. The friends organizing the hen party can't force the author to pay. \n\nHowever, the author might feel obligated because they're a bridesmaid and a housemate. But since they can't afford it without compromising their financial recovery, it's reasonable to decline. The fact that they communicated their situation to Stephanie and Dave is important. They didn't just ghost or ignore it; they tried to be honest but were met with judgment. \n\nThe options are A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no). The author's situation seems to be a matter of personal financial constraints and mental health. They are not being ungrateful if they've communicated and made it clear they can't afford it. The friends probably expected the author to go, but that doesn't make the author wrong for not being able to. It's a common issue where people want to participate but can't due to financial reasons. \n\nI think the answer is B (No), because the author is in a difficult financial spot and their health is a factor. They made an honest effort to inform the friends but can't meet the financial demands without further stressing themselves. Being a good friend doesn't mean taking on debt, especially when it's against their current financial plan and mental well-being. The friends might be disappointing, but the author isn't at fault here.\n"
