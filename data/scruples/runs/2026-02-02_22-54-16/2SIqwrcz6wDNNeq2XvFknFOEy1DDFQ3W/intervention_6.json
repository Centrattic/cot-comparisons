Both enjoy having me there and in general the arrangement works out well.\n\nThey both earn more than 3 x what I do, if this matters.\n\nThey got engaged in July and I was asked to be a bridesmaid. I was very excited, and as this is my best friend of ten ish years I couldn\u2019t imagine not being a part of their wedding. The groom and I are also good friends due to being housemates, we are almost like a little family.\n\nI do not like Stephanie\u2019s friends. They are mean and shallow and materialistic and when I hang out with them I feel bad. I have a history of mental health issues if this matters - a big part of my road to recovery was understanding when I hung out with certain people, I would feel bad afterwards. My mental health has greatly improved since I stopped hanging out with this group of girls three or so years ago. I kept the friendships that didn\u2019t make me feel bad - such as Stephanie.\n\nI enthusiastically agreed the hen do would be great and not to worry about me not liking the other girls going - I could be civil for a few days to celebrate my best friends wedding.\n\nStephanie\u2019s sister and some of the girls going organised the hen do in secret, wanting Stephanie to be surprised. Three days ago I received a text from this group asking for \u00a3350 by Saturday (tomorrow) - and that if I couldn\u2019t afford it Stephanie\u2019s mother would pay my share and I could pay her back \u00a360 a month. The hen do will be a holiday to The south of france for four days, staying in a luxury villa/mansion, with a wine tour, a night out and a dinner. The \u00a3350 only covers flights and accommodation and will be in June next year.\n\nI do not have \u00a3350, I do not have \u00a360 a month spare. I am on a debt management plan and my car broke two months ago, meaning I had to borrow money from an uncle and agree to pay him back \u00a355 a month for three years. This was already a financial stress to me as I try to pay off my debt. I have been paying it off for three years and would have been debt free in a years time, but will be paying my uncle back for some years now. I don\u2019t buy clothes, I don\u2019t go out for dinners, I don\u2019t get my hair and nails done. I am sensible with my money.\n\nI approached Stephanie and Dave (he just happened to be there) - I said I was embarrassed about being offered to pay her mother back as they obviously know I can\u2019t afford the hen do, and that I just didn\u2019t know how I was going to afford to go.\n\nDave said it was disgusting of any friend, especially a bridesmaid, not to go to a hen party. He said he would go into debt or borrow money or \u201csell a limb\u201d to be there for a friend. Stephanie said I was \u201cbeing negative\u201d that I would \u201cupset her mum who offered to pay to be nice\u201d and that I\u2019m \u201cruining something she has dreamed of since she was a little girl\u201d\n\n\nI laid awake that night for hours trying to think of what I could sacrifice so that I will have an extra \u00a360 a month for this hen do. I feel awkward and uncomfortable living with people who want me to go into debt for their benefit, but can\u2019t find anywhere else to live that I can afford, though I\u2019ll keep looking. My anxiety is through the roof at the concept I\u2019ll be in more debt if I go.\n\nAITA if I say I just can\u2019t afford it and I\u2019m not going? Even though they let me live in their home and have offered me a payment plan? I don\u2019t want to hurt my finances but I don\u2019t want to be an ungrateful cow of a friend. I was expecting the whole thing to cost around \u00a3200, which I probably could have squeezed. reddit, be brutal. Am I a tight fisted ungrateful asshole here?? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not attending their best friend's and housemate's hen party. The author is in a situation where they live with Stephanie and Dave, pay rent for a room, and have a history of mental health issues. They don't get along with Stephanie's friends, who are mean and shallow. The hen party is organized by Stephanie's sister and friends, costing \u00a3350, which the author can't afford. They mentioned being on a debt management plan and having to pay back their uncle \u00a355 a month for three years.\n\nSo, the author tried to tell Stephanie and Dave about their financial constraints. Dave criticized them for not wanting to go into debt, while Stephanie was upset and said they were ruining her dream. The author feels torn between their finances and being a good friend and housemate. They're considering if it's wrong to not go despite the offered payment plan.\n\nFirst, I should consider the financial aspect. The hen party is a significant cost, especially with the debt management plan and the car payment. The author can't afford the upfront \u00a3350 and can't handle the monthly payments. It's their responsibility to manage their own money without getting into additional debt. They've already made sacrifices, like not buying clothes or going out to eat. Forcing someone into debt to attend a party isn't fair, even if it's a friend's event.\n\nThen there's the mental health angle. The author has a history of mental health issues and needs to be around people who don't trigger them. Stephanie's friends make them feel bad, so attending an event with them could be harmful. The author's well-being is important, and they've already set boundaries by cutting ties with those friends in the past.\n\nLiving with Stephanie and Dave adds another layer. The author is paying rent, and the housemates expect them to be part of the family. However, the hen party is a specific event organized by Stephanie's sister and friends, not the housemates themselves. The author's financial situation is their own, and they can't be expected to prioritize a hen party over their existing obligations. They're already making an effort to be part of the wedding as a bridesmaid, which is a big commitment.\n\nThe offered payment plan from Stephanie's mother is a gesture, but the author can't take it because it would add to their financial stress. They don't want to be seen as ungrateful, but they're also not in a position to take on more debt. The key here is the author's honesty in communicating their inability to afford it. They approached Stephanie and Dave, explained their situation, and now it's up to the organizers to adjust or find an alternative if they can.\n\nStephanie and Dave's reactions seem a bit harsh. Dave's comment about selling a limb is extreme, and Stephanie's focus on her mother's feelings might not consider the author's actual limitations. The author's priority is to maintain their mental health and financial stability, which are valid reasons. They're not being selfish by not attending; they're being realistic about their constraints.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong. They've communicated their issues, made sacrifices, and their decision is based on genuine financial and mental health reasons. The hen party is a personal event for the bride, but the author's circumstances make it impossible to attend without causing self-harm. So, answer B.\n"
