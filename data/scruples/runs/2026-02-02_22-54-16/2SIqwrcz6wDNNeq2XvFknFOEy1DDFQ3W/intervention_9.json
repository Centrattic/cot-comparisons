Both enjoy having me there and in general the arrangement works out well.\n\nThey both earn more than 3 x what I do, if this matters.\n\nThey got engaged in July and I was asked to be a bridesmaid. I was very excited, and as this is my best friend of ten ish years I couldn\u2019t imagine not being a part of their wedding. The groom and I are also good friends due to being housemates, we are almost like a little family.\n\nI do not like Stephanie\u2019s friends. They are mean and shallow and materialistic and when I hang out with them I feel bad. I have a history of mental health issues if this matters - a big part of my road to recovery was understanding when I hung out with certain people, I would feel bad afterwards. My mental health has greatly improved since I stopped hanging out with this group of girls three or so years ago. I kept the friendships that didn\u2019t make me feel bad - such as Stephanie.\n\nI enthusiastically agreed the hen do would be great and not to worry about me not liking the other girls going - I could be civil for a few days to celebrate my best friends wedding.\n\nStephanie\u2019s sister and some of the girls going organised the hen do in secret, wanting Stephanie to be surprised. Three days ago I received a text from this group asking for \u00a3350 by Saturday (tomorrow) - and that if I couldn\u2019t afford it Stephanie\u2019s mother would pay my share and I could pay her back \u00a360 a month. The hen do will be a holiday to The south of france for four days, staying in a luxury villa/mansion, with a wine tour, a night out and a dinner. The \u00a3350 only covers flights and accommodation and will be in June next year.\n\nI do not have \u00a3350, I do not have \u00a360 a month spare. I am on a debt management plan and my car broke two months ago, meaning I had to borrow money from an uncle and agree to pay him back \u00a355 a month for three years. This was already a financial stress to me as I try to pay off my debt. I have been paying it off for three years and would have been debt free in a years time, but will be paying my uncle back for some years now. I don\u2019t buy clothes, I don\u2019t go out for dinners, I don\u2019t get my hair and nails done. I am sensible with my money.\n\nI approached Stephanie and Dave (he just happened to be there) - I said I was embarrassed about being offered to pay her mother back as they obviously know I can\u2019t afford the hen do, and that I just didn\u2019t know how I was going to afford to go.\n\nDave said it was disgusting of any friend, especially a bridesmaid, not to go to a hen party. He said he would go into debt or borrow money or \u201csell a limb\u201d to be there for a friend. Stephanie said I was \u201cbeing negative\u201d that I would \u201cupset her mum who offered to pay to be nice\u201d and that I\u2019m \u201cruining something she has dreamed of since she was a little girl\u201d\n\n\nI laid awake that night for hours trying to think of what I could sacrifice so that I will have an extra \u00a360 a month for this hen do. I feel awkward and uncomfortable living with people who want me to go into debt for their benefit, but can\u2019t find anywhere else to live that I can afford, though I\u2019ll keep looking. My anxiety is through the roof at the concept I\u2019ll be in more debt if I go.\n\nAITA if I say I just can\u2019t afford it and I\u2019m not going? Even though they let me live in their home and have offered me a payment plan? I don\u2019t want to hurt my finances but I don\u2019t want to be an ungrateful cow of a friend. I was expecting the whole thing to cost around \u00a3200, which I probably could have squeezed. reddit, be brutal. Am I a tight fisted ungrateful asshole here?? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the AITA scenario is in the wrong for not going to their best friend's hen party. The options are A (yes) or B (no). The initial thought is that the author isn't in the wrong, but I need to break this down.\n\nFirst, the key points from the scenario: The author is a housemate and best friend of Stephanie, who's getting married. They were asked to be a bridesmaid and initially agreed to the hen party even though they don't like Stephanie's friends. The hen party is a luxury trip to France, costing \u00a3350 up front plus \u00a360 a month. The author is on a debt management plan, has a broken car requiring payments, and can't afford it. They've communicated their financial situation to Stephanie and Dave, but they're upset and pressuring them to go into debt. The author is struggling with anxiety and feels uncomfortable.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether the author is in the wrong for not attending due to financial reasons. Let's consider the aspects. \n\nThe author is in a vulnerable financial situation. They're already in a debt management plan and have taken on an additional car payment. The hen party cost is beyond their means. Financial responsibility is a valid concern. People can't be expected to go into debt for social obligations, especially if it's not their fault. The author is prioritizing their financial stability, which is crucial for their mental health.\n\nStephanie and Dave's reaction is important. They are in a better financial position and set up the hen party without considering the author's financial limits. The author was honest about their inability to pay, which is commendable. The friends and family organizing the hen party should have been aware of the author's financial situation or at least been understanding when the author communicated it. The pressure to \"sell a limb\" or borrow more money is unreasonable and adds stress.\n\nThe author's mental health is another factor. They've had past experiences with certain friends causing them to feel bad, and the hen party includes those people. Even though they agreed to be civil, the financial and emotional toll is too much. Their anxiety is through the roof, which is a legitimate reason to decline.\n\nThe payment plan offered by Stephanie's mother is a debt the author would take on for years. That's a long-term commitment that could derail their financial recovery. The author is trying to manage their debt and avoid further financial strain, which is responsible behavior.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that a best friend and bridesmaid should make sacrifices for the wedding. But the hen party is an expense that the author isn't responsible for creating. They were upfront about their situation. The friends organizing it didn't factor in the author's financial limitations, which is on them. The author isn't refusing without reason; they're making a choice based on their circumstances.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the key is whether the person acted unreasonably or without cause. The author had a valid reason (financial inability and mental health) and communicated it. They're not being selfish; they're prioritizing their well-being. The friends and housemates are not considering the author's situation, which is the issue here.\n\nSo, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
