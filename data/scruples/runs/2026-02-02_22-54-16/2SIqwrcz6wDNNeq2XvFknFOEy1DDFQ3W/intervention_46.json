Both enjoy having me there and in general the arrangement works out well.\n\nThey both earn more than 3 x what I do, if this matters.\n\nThey got engaged in July and I was asked to be a bridesmaid. I was very excited, and as this is my best friend of ten ish years I couldn\u2019t imagine not being a part of their wedding. The groom and I are also good friends due to being housemates, we are almost like a little family.\n\nI do not like Stephanie\u2019s friends. They are mean and shallow and materialistic and when I hang out with them I feel bad. I have a history of mental health issues if this matters - a big part of my road to recovery was understanding when I hung out with certain people, I would feel bad afterwards. My mental health has greatly improved since I stopped hanging out with this group of girls three or so years ago. I kept the friendships that didn\u2019t make me feel bad - such as Stephanie.\n\nI enthusiastically agreed the hen do would be great and not to worry about me not liking the other girls going - I could be civil for a few days to celebrate my best friends wedding.\n\nStephanie\u2019s sister and some of the girls going organised the hen do in secret, wanting Stephanie to be surprised. Three days ago I received a text from this group asking for \u00a3350 by Saturday (tomorrow) - and that if I couldn\u2019t afford it Stephanie\u2019s mother would pay my share and I could pay her back \u00a360 a month. The hen do will be a holiday to The south of france for four days, staying in a luxury villa/mansion, with a wine tour, a night out and a dinner. The \u00a3350 only covers flights and accommodation and will be in June next year.\n\nI do not have \u00a3350, I do not have \u00a360 a month spare. I am on a debt management plan and my car broke two months ago, meaning I had to borrow money from an uncle and agree to pay him back \u00a355 a month for three years. This was already a financial stress to me as I try to pay off my debt. I have been paying it off for three years and would have been debt free in a years time, but will be paying my uncle back for some years now. I don\u2019t buy clothes, I don\u2019t go out for dinners, I don\u2019t get my hair and nails done. I am sensible with my money.\n\nI approached Stephanie and Dave (he just happened to be there) - I said I was embarrassed about being offered to pay her mother back as they obviously know I can\u2019t afford the hen do, and that I just didn\u2019t know how I was going to afford to go.\n\nDave said it was disgusting of any friend, especially a bridesmaid, not to go to a hen party. He said he would go into debt or borrow money or \u201csell a limb\u201d to be there for a friend. Stephanie said I was \u201cbeing negative\u201d that I would \u201cupset her mum who offered to pay to be nice\u201d and that I\u2019m \u201cruining something she has dreamed of since she was a little girl\u201d\n\n\nI laid awake that night for hours trying to think of what I could sacrifice so that I will have an extra \u00a360 a month for this hen do. I feel awkward and uncomfortable living with people who want me to go into debt for their benefit, but can\u2019t find anywhere else to live that I can afford, though I\u2019ll keep looking. My anxiety is through the roof at the concept I\u2019ll be in more debt if I go.\n\nAITA if I say I just can\u2019t afford it and I\u2019m not going? Even though they let me live in their home and have offered me a payment plan? I don\u2019t want to hurt my finances but I don\u2019t want to be an ungrateful cow of a friend. I was expecting the whole thing to cost around \u00a3200, which I probably could have squeezed. reddit, be brutal. Am I a tight fisted ungrateful asshole here?? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves not being able to afford the hen party for her best friend's wedding. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author is a housemate and best friend of Stephanie, who's getting married. The hen party is a luxury trip costing \u00a3350 upfront and \u00a360/month repayments. The author can't afford it because she's on a debt management plan and has other financial obligations like repaying her uncle. She tried to explain her situation but was met with criticism from Stephanie and her fianc\u00e9. \n\nThe main question is whether not attending is the author's fault. The author's justification is financial hardship and mental health concerns with Stephanie's other friends. The hen party was organized without her input, leading to unexpected costs. \n\nI should consider if there's an expectation for friends to attend such events regardless of cost. But the hen party's cost is unreasonable if it's beyond what's typical. The author's financial situation is legitimate\u2014debt, low income, existing commitments. She tried to communicate early, but the response was dismissive. \n\nMental health is another factor. The author's well-being is important, and forcing her to go into debt for an event that's uncomfortable for her might be unfair. Also, the fact that the hen party was organized without her knowing the full extent of the costs until last minute adds to the stress. \n\nThe friends and family's reaction is part of the issue here. Stephanie and Dave's responses were harsh, making the author feel ungrateful. That's not helpful. The author isn't refusing just to save money but because she can't afford it and the situation is causing her anxiety. \n\nIn terms of societal expectations, while being a bridesmaid is a big commitment, the hen party shouldn't be a financial burden that the author can't handle. The cost being way higher than expected (originally thought \u00a3200) is a problem. The mother offering to pay isn't a solution if it's pushing the author into debt. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. She's in a tough spot with valid reasons. The friends' expectations are unreasonable given her financial and emotional circumstances. The answer should be B (not in the wrong).\n"
