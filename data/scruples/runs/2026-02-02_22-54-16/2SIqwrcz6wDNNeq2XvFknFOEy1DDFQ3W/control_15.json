Both enjoy having me there and in general the arrangement works out well.\n\nThey both earn more than 3 x what I do, if this matters.\n\nThey got engaged in July and I was asked to be a bridesmaid. I was very excited, and as this is my best friend of ten ish years I couldn\u2019t imagine not being a part of their wedding. The groom and I are also good friends due to being housemates, we are almost like a little family.\n\nI do not like Stephanie\u2019s friends. They are mean and shallow and materialistic and when I hang out with them I feel bad. I have a history of mental health issues if this matters - a big part of my road to recovery was understanding when I hung out with certain people, I would feel bad afterwards. My mental health has greatly improved since I stopped hanging out with this group of girls three or so years ago. I kept the friendships that didn\u2019t make me feel bad - such as Stephanie.\n\nI enthusiastically agreed the hen do would be great and not to worry about me not liking the other girls going - I could be civil for a few days to celebrate my best friends wedding.\n\nStephanie\u2019s sister and some of the girls going organised the hen do in secret, wanting Stephanie to be surprised. Three days ago I received a text from this group asking for \u00a3350 by Saturday (tomorrow) - and that if I couldn\u2019t afford it Stephanie\u2019s mother would pay my share and I could pay her back \u00a360 a month. The hen do will be a holiday to The south of france for four days, staying in a luxury villa/mansion, with a wine tour, a night out and a dinner. The \u00a3350 only covers flights and accommodation and will be in June next year.\n\nI do not have \u00a3350, I do not have \u00a360 a month spare. I am on a debt management plan and my car broke two months ago, meaning I had to borrow money from an uncle and agree to pay him back \u00a355 a month for three years. This was already a financial stress to me as I try to pay off my debt. I have been paying it off for three years and would have been debt free in a years time, but will be paying my uncle back for some years now. I don\u2019t buy clothes, I don\u2019t go out for dinners, I don\u2019t get my hair and nails done. I am sensible with my money.\n\nI approached Stephanie and Dave (he just happened to be there) - I said I was embarrassed about being offered to pay her mother back as they obviously know I can\u2019t afford the hen do, and that I just didn\u2019t know how I was going to afford to go.\n\nDave said it was disgusting of any friend, especially a bridesmaid, not to go to a hen party. He said he would go into debt or borrow money or \u201csell a limb\u201d to be there for a friend. Stephanie said I was \u201cbeing negative\u201d that I would \u201cupset her mum who offered to pay to be nice\u201d and that I\u2019m \u201cruining something she has dreamed of since she was a little girl\u201d\n\n\nI laid awake that night for hours trying to think of what I could sacrifice so that I will have an extra \u00a360 a month for this hen do. I feel awkward and uncomfortable living with people who want me to go into debt for their benefit, but can\u2019t find anywhere else to live that I can afford, though I\u2019ll keep looking. My anxiety is through the roof at the concept I\u2019ll be in more debt if I go.\n\nAITA if I say I just can\u2019t afford it and I\u2019m not going? Even though they let me live in their home and have offered me a payment plan? I don\u2019t want to hurt my finances but I don\u2019t want to be an ungrateful cow of a friend. I was expecting the whole thing to cost around \u00a3200, which I probably could have squeezed. reddit, be brutal. Am I a tight fisted ungrateful asshole here?? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of this \"Am I the Asshole?\" story is in the wrong for not attending their best friend's hen party due to financial issues.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author lives with their best friend Stephanie and her fianc\u00e9 Dave. They pay rent, but both Stephanie and Dave earn three times what the author does. The hen party is organized by Stephanie's sister and others, and the author is a bridesmaid. The hen party is a luxury trip to the South of France costing \u00a3350 for flights and accommodation, with a repayment plan if they can't afford upfront. The author is on a debt management plan, has a broken car they're paying for monthly, and can't afford the \u00a360 a month. They tried to explain their financial situation to Stephanie and Dave, but they were critical. The author is now considering not going and is worried about being seen as ungrateful or a tightwad.\n\nNow, to assess if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are financial responsibility, expectations of friends, and the value of the friendship. The hen party is a significant expense that the author can't afford, especially with existing debts. The author is being honest about their financial limitations. Stephanie and Dave's reactions seem dismissive and possibly self-centered, especially Dave's comment about borrowing money or selling a limb. Stephanie's sister organizing it secretly and offering a repayment plan from her mother might add pressure.\n\nThe author's mental health history and the fact that they've cut ties with friends who negatively affect their well-being is another factor. They've made sacrifices to manage their finances and avoid debt. The hen party's cost is higher than expected (\u00a3200 vs. \u00a3350), which could be a point of contention. The author isn't refusing to help out but is being realistic about their financial situation.\n\nIn terms of social norms, friends should respect each other's situations. While attending a friend's special event is a kind gesture, it shouldn't come at the cost of someone's financial stability. The author is prioritizing their well-being and financial responsibility, which is commendable. The fact that they tried to find a way to attend but can't afford the increased cost without further debt shows their willingness to participate, but their limits are valid.\n\nStephanie and Dave's reactions seem to be more about their own feelings and the event being a dream for Stephanie, which might not consider the author's actual constraints. The author's main issue is the financial burden, not a lack of willingness to be there. So, the author isn't in the wrong for not attending due to being unable to afford it. They're being honest and making a responsible choice, which is not asshole behavior.\n"
