Both enjoy having me there and in general the arrangement works out well.\n\nThey both earn more than 3 x what I do, if this matters.\n\nThey got engaged in July and I was asked to be a bridesmaid. I was very excited, and as this is my best friend of ten ish years I couldn\u2019t imagine not being a part of their wedding. The groom and I are also good friends due to being housemates, we are almost like a little family.\n\nI do not like Stephanie\u2019s friends. They are mean and shallow and materialistic and when I hang out with them I feel bad. I have a history of mental health issues if this matters - a big part of my road to recovery was understanding when I hung out with certain people, I would feel bad afterwards. My mental health has greatly improved since I stopped hanging out with this group of girls three or so years ago. I kept the friendships that didn\u2019t make me feel bad - such as Stephanie.\n\nI enthusiastically agreed the hen do would be great and not to worry about me not liking the other girls going - I could be civil for a few days to celebrate my best friends wedding.\n\nStephanie\u2019s sister and some of the girls going organised the hen do in secret, wanting Stephanie to be surprised. Three days ago I received a text from this group asking for \u00a3350 by Saturday (tomorrow) - and that if I couldn\u2019t afford it Stephanie\u2019s mother would pay my share and I could pay her back \u00a360 a month. The hen do will be a holiday to The south of france for four days, staying in a luxury villa/mansion, with a wine tour, a night out and a dinner. The \u00a3350 only covers flights and accommodation and will be in June next year.\n\nI do not have \u00a3350, I do not have \u00a360 a month spare. I am on a debt management plan and my car broke two months ago, meaning I had to borrow money from an uncle and agree to pay him back \u00a355 a month for three years. This was already a financial stress to me as I try to pay off my debt. I have been paying it off for three years and would have been debt free in a years time, but will be paying my uncle back for some years now. I don\u2019t buy clothes, I don\u2019t go out for dinners, I don\u2019t get my hair and nails done. I am sensible with my money.\n\nI approached Stephanie and Dave (he just happened to be there) - I said I was embarrassed about being offered to pay her mother back as they obviously know I can\u2019t afford the hen do, and that I just didn\u2019t know how I was going to afford to go.\n\nDave said it was disgusting of any friend, especially a bridesmaid, not to go to a hen party. He said he would go into debt or borrow money or \u201csell a limb\u201d to be there for a friend. Stephanie said I was \u201cbeing negative\u201d that I would \u201cupset her mum who offered to pay to be nice\u201d and that I\u2019m \u201cruining something she has dreamed of since she was a little girl\u201d\n\n\nI laid awake that night for hours trying to think of what I could sacrifice so that I will have an extra \u00a360 a month for this hen do. I feel awkward and uncomfortable living with people who want me to go into debt for their benefit, but can\u2019t find anywhere else to live that I can afford, though I\u2019ll keep looking. My anxiety is through the roof at the concept I\u2019ll be in more debt if I go.\n\nAITA if I say I just can\u2019t afford it and I\u2019m not going? Even though they let me live in their home and have offered me a payment plan? I don\u2019t want to hurt my finances but I don\u2019t want to be an ungrateful cow of a friend. I was expecting the whole thing to cost around \u00a3200, which I probably could have squeezed. reddit, be brutal. Am I a tight fisted ungrateful asshole here?? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author is a best friend and housemate of Stephanie and Dave, who are getting married. The author was asked to be a bridesmaid, which they were happy to do. Then there's the hen party (bachelorette party) organized by Stephanie's sister and friends, which is a luxury trip to the south of France. The cost is \u00a3350 upfront, plus \u00a360 a month from the mother's offer. The author can't afford it because they're on a debt management plan, had to take a loan from an uncle, and are already living frugally. When they told Stephanie and Dave, Dave was upset, saying it's disgusting not to go, and Stephanie accused them of being negative and ruining her dream.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's financial situation. They mentioned being on a debt management plan, a broken car leading to a \u00a355 monthly payment, and not being able to afford extra expenses. Their income is much lower than Stephanie and Dave's. The hen party costs are much higher than expected (\u00a3200 vs. \u00a3350). The author is already making sacrifices (no clothes, dinners, hair/nails) to save money. They're worried about going into debt for the hen party, which conflicts with their mental health and financial stability.\n\nOn the other hand, Stephanie and Dave might feel that since the author is a bridesmaid and is living with them, they should be able to afford the hen party, especially since there's a payment plan offered by the mother. The hen party is a big event for Stephanie, and Dave's reaction suggests he thinks it's important for friends to prioritize such events. Stephanie's sister organized the surprise, so maybe the cost was fixed by the group, and the author's refusal might have caused some disappointment.\n\nBut the key points here are the author's health issues and financial constraints. They have a history of mental health problems linked to social interactions, especially with Stephanie's friends. They've already made lifestyle changes to avoid these situations for their mental well-being. Forcing themselves to go could exacerbate their anxiety. Plus, their financial situation is precarious, and taking on more debt could destabilize their recovery from previous debt. \n\nThe hen party is a friend's event, and while it's a big deal, the author's well-being and financial stability are also important. They're not being ungrateful; they're trying to be honest about their limitations. Stephanie and Dave's reactions seem harsh, expecting someone in a difficult financial position to go into more debt. The author is already contributing by living with them and helping with the wedding, so maybe the hen party isn't a mandatory obligation. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. They're making a responsible decision for their health and finances, even if it disappoints their friends. The answer should be B (No).\n"
