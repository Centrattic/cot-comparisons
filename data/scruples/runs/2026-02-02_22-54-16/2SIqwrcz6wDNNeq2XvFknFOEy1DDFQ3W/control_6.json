Both enjoy having me there and in general the arrangement works out well.\n\nThey both earn more than 3 x what I do, if this matters.\n\nThey got engaged in July and I was asked to be a bridesmaid. I was very excited, and as this is my best friend of ten ish years I couldn\u2019t imagine not being a part of their wedding. The groom and I are also good friends due to being housemates, we are almost like a little family.\n\nI do not like Stephanie\u2019s friends. They are mean and shallow and materialistic and when I hang out with them I feel bad. I have a history of mental health issues if this matters - a big part of my road to recovery was understanding when I hung out with certain people, I would feel bad afterwards. My mental health has greatly improved since I stopped hanging out with this group of girls three or so years ago. I kept the friendships that didn\u2019t make me feel bad - such as Stephanie.\n\nI enthusiastically agreed the hen do would be great and not to worry about me not liking the other girls going - I could be civil for a few days to celebrate my best friends wedding.\n\nStephanie\u2019s sister and some of the girls going organised the hen do in secret, wanting Stephanie to be surprised. Three days ago I received a text from this group asking for \u00a3350 by Saturday (tomorrow) - and that if I couldn\u2019t afford it Stephanie\u2019s mother would pay my share and I could pay her back \u00a360 a month. The hen do will be a holiday to The south of france for four days, staying in a luxury villa/mansion, with a wine tour, a night out and a dinner. The \u00a3350 only covers flights and accommodation and will be in June next year.\n\nI do not have \u00a3350, I do not have \u00a360 a month spare. I am on a debt management plan and my car broke two months ago, meaning I had to borrow money from an uncle and agree to pay him back \u00a355 a month for three years. This was already a financial stress to me as I try to pay off my debt. I have been paying it off for three years and would have been debt free in a years time, but will be paying my uncle back for some years now. I don\u2019t buy clothes, I don\u2019t go out for dinners, I don\u2019t get my hair and nails done. I am sensible with my money.\n\nI approached Stephanie and Dave (he just happened to be there) - I said I was embarrassed about being offered to pay her mother back as they obviously know I can\u2019t afford the hen do, and that I just didn\u2019t know how I was going to afford to go.\n\nDave said it was disgusting of any friend, especially a bridesmaid, not to go to a hen party. He said he would go into debt or borrow money or \u201csell a limb\u201d to be there for a friend. Stephanie said I was \u201cbeing negative\u201d that I would \u201cupset her mum who offered to pay to be nice\u201d and that I\u2019m \u201cruining something she has dreamed of since she was a little girl\u201d\n\n\nI laid awake that night for hours trying to think of what I could sacrifice so that I will have an extra \u00a360 a month for this hen do. I feel awkward and uncomfortable living with people who want me to go into debt for their benefit, but can\u2019t find anywhere else to live that I can afford, though I\u2019ll keep looking. My anxiety is through the roof at the concept I\u2019ll be in more debt if I go.\n\nAITA if I say I just can\u2019t afford it and I\u2019m not going? Even though they let me live in their home and have offered me a payment plan? I don\u2019t want to hurt my finances but I don\u2019t want to be an ungrateful cow of a friend. I was expecting the whole thing to cost around \u00a3200, which I probably could have squeezed. reddit, be brutal. Am I a tight fisted ungrateful asshole here?? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong for not going to their best friend's hen party because they can't afford it.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author lives with their best friend Stephanie and her fianc\u00e9 Dave. They pay rent and have a good relationship. The hen party is a luxury trip to the south of France, which the author was initially excited about but now can't afford. The cost is \u00a3350 for flights and accommodation, plus \u00a360/month repayment via Stephanie's mom. The author is in a debt management plan, has a car repair debt, and can't spare any extra money. They tried to explain this to Stephanie and Dave, but they were upset, with Dave saying it's disgusting not to go and Stephanie being negative towards the author. The author is worried about going into more debt and is feeling anxious.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Let me break it down.\n\nFinancial responsibility is a big factor here. The author is on a debt management plan and can't afford the additional costs. They mentioned they don't spend on things like clothes, dining out, or beauty treatments. Sacrificing these isn't helping, so they can't afford the trip. They tried to explain this, but the friends are pressuring them. It's important to consider that the author isn't being cheap; they're in a financial situation where they can't take on more debt. \n\nFriendship obligations: Being a bridesmaid is a big commitment, but it's not a legal obligation. The hen party is a social event, not a mandatory one. The author was enthusiastic at first but now can't attend due to financial constraints. The friends' reactions seem harsh, especially Dave's comment about selling a limb. That suggests they might not be considering the author's financial reality. \n\nRespect for boundaries: The author is being honest about their situation. It's reasonable to say they can't afford it, even if others can. The author is in a vulnerable position, living with the couple, which adds to the pressure. They don't want to be seen as ungrateful, but their mental health and financial stability are at stake. \n\nThe friends' friends are the ones who organized the trip without considering the author's financial situation. The author was assured they could be civil, but the cost was way higher than expected (\u00a3200 vs. \u00a3350). The payment plan from Stephanie's mom adds to the pressure, but the author can't take on more debt. \n\nIn terms of mental health, the author has a history of issues exacerbated by certain social groups. They've already made choices to avoid people who negatively affect them, which is a valid reason to decline if necessary. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't being ungrateful or tight. They're being honest about their limitations. The friends' expectations might be unrealistic given the author's financial situation. The author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing their financial health and mental well-being over attending an expensive event they can't afford.\n"
