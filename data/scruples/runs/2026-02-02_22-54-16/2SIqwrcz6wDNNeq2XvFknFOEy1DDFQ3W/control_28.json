Both enjoy having me there and in general the arrangement works out well.\n\nThey both earn more than 3 x what I do, if this matters.\n\nThey got engaged in July and I was asked to be a bridesmaid. I was very excited, and as this is my best friend of ten ish years I couldn\u2019t imagine not being a part of their wedding. The groom and I are also good friends due to being housemates, we are almost like a little family.\n\nI do not like Stephanie\u2019s friends. They are mean and shallow and materialistic and when I hang out with them I feel bad. I have a history of mental health issues if this matters - a big part of my road to recovery was understanding when I hung out with certain people, I would feel bad afterwards. My mental health has greatly improved since I stopped hanging out with this group of girls three or so years ago. I kept the friendships that didn\u2019t make me feel bad - such as Stephanie.\n\nI enthusiastically agreed the hen do would be great and not to worry about me not liking the other girls going - I could be civil for a few days to celebrate my best friends wedding.\n\nStephanie\u2019s sister and some of the girls going organised the hen do in secret, wanting Stephanie to be surprised. Three days ago I received a text from this group asking for \u00a3350 by Saturday (tomorrow) - and that if I couldn\u2019t afford it Stephanie\u2019s mother would pay my share and I could pay her back \u00a360 a month. The hen do will be a holiday to The south of france for four days, staying in a luxury villa/mansion, with a wine tour, a night out and a dinner. The \u00a3350 only covers flights and accommodation and will be in June next year.\n\nI do not have \u00a3350, I do not have \u00a360 a month spare. I am on a debt management plan and my car broke two months ago, meaning I had to borrow money from an uncle and agree to pay him back \u00a355 a month for three years. This was already a financial stress to me as I try to pay off my debt. I have been paying it off for three years and would have been debt free in a years time, but will be paying my uncle back for some years now. I don\u2019t buy clothes, I don\u2019t go out for dinners, I don\u2019t get my hair and nails done. I am sensible with my money.\n\nI approached Stephanie and Dave (he just happened to be there) - I said I was embarrassed about being offered to pay her mother back as they obviously know I can\u2019t afford the hen do, and that I just didn\u2019t know how I was going to afford to go.\n\nDave said it was disgusting of any friend, especially a bridesmaid, not to go to a hen party. He said he would go into debt or borrow money or \u201csell a limb\u201d to be there for a friend. Stephanie said I was \u201cbeing negative\u201d that I would \u201cupset her mum who offered to pay to be nice\u201d and that I\u2019m \u201cruining something she has dreamed of since she was a little girl\u201d\n\n\nI laid awake that night for hours trying to think of what I could sacrifice so that I will have an extra \u00a360 a month for this hen do. I feel awkward and uncomfortable living with people who want me to go into debt for their benefit, but can\u2019t find anywhere else to live that I can afford, though I\u2019ll keep looking. My anxiety is through the roof at the concept I\u2019ll be in more debt if I go.\n\nAITA if I say I just can\u2019t afford it and I\u2019m not going? Even though they let me live in their home and have offered me a payment plan? I don\u2019t want to hurt my finances but I don\u2019t want to be an ungrateful cow of a friend. I was expecting the whole thing to cost around \u00a3200, which I probably could have squeezed. reddit, be brutal. Am I a tight fisted ungrateful asshole here?? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not attending their best friend's hen party due to financial constraints. Let me start by reading through the details carefully.\n\nFirst, the author lives with their best friend Stephanie and her fianc\u00e9 Dave. They pay rent for a room in the house Stephanie and Dave own. The author's income is much lower than theirs. They were asked to be a bridesmaid and initially agreed to the hen party, even though they don't like Stephanie's other friends. The hen party is a luxury trip to the south of France costing \u00a3350 upfront, with a payment plan from Stephanie's mom. The author is on a debt management plan and recently had to take a loan for their broken car, which adds to their existing debt. They can't afford the \u00a3350 upfront or the monthly payments of \u00a360. They tried to explain their situation to Stephanie and Dave, but Stephanie was upset, saying the author was being negative and ruining her dream. The author is now considering not going and is worried about being seen as ungrateful.\n\nSo, the key points here are financial constraints versus social obligations. The author is in a difficult financial situation with existing debt and can't afford the hen party. They made their situation clear to Stephanie but were met with a negative reaction. The hen party cost was higher than the author expected, and they didn't anticipate the payment plan from Stephanie's mom, which adds to the financial burden.\n\nI need to consider if the author is at fault. Friends often have different financial situations. The author has been clear about their limitations and made sacrifices to be part of the wedding (as a bridesmaid) despite not liking the other friends. The hen party is a separate event, and the author is being honest about their inability to pay. Stephanie's reaction seems dismissive of the author's financial reality. The author isn't refusing out of spite; they're genuinely unable to afford it. The cost was unexpected and higher than they could manage. The author is trying to maintain the friendship and has been living with them, which suggests they value the relationship.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that being a bridesmaid implies being part of the wedding events, including the hen party. However, the author's mental health and financial stability are important factors here. They have a history of mental health issues and have made changes to avoid toxic friendships, which they've shared with Stephanie. The hen party's cost was a surprise, and the payment plan from Stephanie's mom might be seen as a way to pressure the author into going by offering a loan, which the author can't handle due to their debt.\n\nIn such cases, it's about balancing obligations with personal circumstances. The author is not being ungrateful; they're being honest about their limits. Stephanie's reaction seems to not validate the author's situation, which might indicate a lack of empathy. The financial strain is real, and the author is making responsible decisions to manage their debt. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong here; they are prioritizing their financial health and mental well-being, which is crucial for their recovery.\n"
