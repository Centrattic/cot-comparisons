Both enjoy having me there and in general the arrangement works out well.\n\nThey both earn more than 3 x what I do, if this matters.\n\nThey got engaged in July and I was asked to be a bridesmaid. I was very excited, and as this is my best friend of ten ish years I couldn\u2019t imagine not being a part of their wedding. The groom and I are also good friends due to being housemates, we are almost like a little family.\n\nI do not like Stephanie\u2019s friends. They are mean and shallow and materialistic and when I hang out with them I feel bad. I have a history of mental health issues if this matters - a big part of my road to recovery was understanding when I hung out with certain people, I would feel bad afterwards. My mental health has greatly improved since I stopped hanging out with this group of girls three or so years ago. I kept the friendships that didn\u2019t make me feel bad - such as Stephanie.\n\nI enthusiastically agreed the hen do would be great and not to worry about me not liking the other girls going - I could be civil for a few days to celebrate my best friends wedding.\n\nStephanie\u2019s sister and some of the girls going organised the hen do in secret, wanting Stephanie to be surprised. Three days ago I received a text from this group asking for \u00a3350 by Saturday (tomorrow) - and that if I couldn\u2019t afford it Stephanie\u2019s mother would pay my share and I could pay her back \u00a360 a month. The hen do will be a holiday to The south of france for four days, staying in a luxury villa/mansion, with a wine tour, a night out and a dinner. The \u00a3350 only covers flights and accommodation and will be in June next year.\n\nI do not have \u00a3350, I do not have \u00a360 a month spare. I am on a debt management plan and my car broke two months ago, meaning I had to borrow money from an uncle and agree to pay him back \u00a355 a month for three years. This was already a financial stress to me as I try to pay off my debt. I have been paying it off for three years and would have been debt free in a years time, but will be paying my uncle back for some years now. I don\u2019t buy clothes, I don\u2019t go out for dinners, I don\u2019t get my hair and nails done. I am sensible with my money.\n\nI approached Stephanie and Dave (he just happened to be there) - I said I was embarrassed about being offered to pay her mother back as they obviously know I can\u2019t afford the hen do, and that I just didn\u2019t know how I was going to afford to go.\n\nDave said it was disgusting of any friend, especially a bridesmaid, not to go to a hen party. He said he would go into debt or borrow money or \u201csell a limb\u201d to be there for a friend. Stephanie said I was \u201cbeing negative\u201d that I would \u201cupset her mum who offered to pay to be nice\u201d and that I\u2019m \u201cruining something she has dreamed of since she was a little girl\u201d\n\n\nI laid awake that night for hours trying to think of what I could sacrifice so that I will have an extra \u00a360 a month for this hen do. I feel awkward and uncomfortable living with people who want me to go into debt for their benefit, but can\u2019t find anywhere else to live that I can afford, though I\u2019ll keep looking. My anxiety is through the roof at the concept I\u2019ll be in more debt if I go.\n\nAITA if I say I just can\u2019t afford it and I\u2019m not going? Even though they let me live in their home and have offered me a payment plan? I don\u2019t want to hurt my finances but I don\u2019t want to be an ungrateful cow of a friend. I was expecting the whole thing to cost around \u00a3200, which I probably could have squeezed. reddit, be brutal. Am I a tight fisted ungrateful asshole here?? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not attending their best friend's hen party. The key points here are financial constraints and the impact on the friendship.\n\nFirst, the author is a bridesmaid and has been asked to pay \u00a3350 for a trip, with a repayment plan of \u00a360 a month. But they're on a debt management plan and have a car payment of \u00a355 a month. They don't have any extra money for clothes, dinners, or other expenses. The hen do is in June next year, so the payment is for flights and accommodation. The author is worried about going into more debt, which is affecting their mental health.\n\nNow, the friend (Stephanie) and her fianc\u00e9 (Dave) reacted negatively. Dave said it's disgusting not to go, and Stephanie said the author is being negative and ruining her dream. The author is feeling pressured by their housemates, which is causing anxiety.\n\nI need to consider if the author is obligated to attend despite their financial situation. The author was enthusiastic about being a bridesmaid and expected the cost to be around \u00a3200, which they could handle. But the actual cost is much higher. The payment plan from Stephanie's mother might be a solution, but the author is worried about their existing debt and the financial strain.\n\nFinancial responsibility is important. The author is managing their debt and has limited income. Taking on additional debt for a trip they can't afford might not be wise. Also, the fact that they don't like Stephanie's other friends adds another layer. Being a bridesmaid is a role they accepted, but the hen do isn't something they can afford. \n\nIn many cultures, bridesmaids are expected to attend the hen party, but that doesn't mean the author should be in a position where they have to take on unsustainable debt. The author's mental health is a factor here, as they've had past issues and are now in a place where they manage their finances carefully. \n\nDave's comment about selling a limb to be there for a friend seems extreme and maybe a bit insensitive to the author's financial reality. Stephanie's reaction also seems harsh, especially since the author is already paying rent in the house they own. The author is in a tough spot, balancing their financial health with their friendship and commitment to being a bridesmaid.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? They're not being ungrateful if they can't afford it, especially given their existing commitments. They've communicated their situation to the couple and are concerned about their well-being. The hen party is a social event, but the financial demand is unrealistic. Therefore, the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
