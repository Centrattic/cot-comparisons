Both enjoy having me there and in general the arrangement works out well.\n\nThey both earn more than 3 x what I do, if this matters.\n\nThey got engaged in July and I was asked to be a bridesmaid. I was very excited, and as this is my best friend of ten ish years I couldn\u2019t imagine not being a part of their wedding. The groom and I are also good friends due to being housemates, we are almost like a little family.\n\nI do not like Stephanie\u2019s friends. They are mean and shallow and materialistic and when I hang out with them I feel bad. I have a history of mental health issues if this matters - a big part of my road to recovery was understanding when I hung out with certain people, I would feel bad afterwards. My mental health has greatly improved since I stopped hanging out with this group of girls three or so years ago. I kept the friendships that didn\u2019t make me feel bad - such as Stephanie.\n\nI enthusiastically agreed the hen do would be great and not to worry about me not liking the other girls going - I could be civil for a few days to celebrate my best friends wedding.\n\nStephanie\u2019s sister and some of the girls going organised the hen do in secret, wanting Stephanie to be surprised. Three days ago I received a text from this group asking for \u00a3350 by Saturday (tomorrow) - and that if I couldn\u2019t afford it Stephanie\u2019s mother would pay my share and I could pay her back \u00a360 a month. The hen do will be a holiday to The south of france for four days, staying in a luxury villa/mansion, with a wine tour, a night out and a dinner. The \u00a3350 only covers flights and accommodation and will be in June next year.\n\nI do not have \u00a3350, I do not have \u00a360 a month spare. I am on a debt management plan and my car broke two months ago, meaning I had to borrow money from an uncle and agree to pay him back \u00a355 a month for three years. This was already a financial stress to me as I try to pay off my debt. I have been paying it off for three years and would have been debt free in a years time, but will be paying my uncle back for some years now. I don\u2019t buy clothes, I don\u2019t go out for dinners, I don\u2019t get my hair and nails done. I am sensible with my money.\n\nI approached Stephanie and Dave (he just happened to be there) - I said I was embarrassed about being offered to pay her mother back as they obviously know I can\u2019t afford the hen do, and that I just didn\u2019t know how I was going to afford to go.\n\nDave said it was disgusting of any friend, especially a bridesmaid, not to go to a hen party. He said he would go into debt or borrow money or \u201csell a limb\u201d to be there for a friend. Stephanie said I was \u201cbeing negative\u201d that I would \u201cupset her mum who offered to pay to be nice\u201d and that I\u2019m \u201cruining something she has dreamed of since she was a little girl\u201d\n\n\nI laid awake that night for hours trying to think of what I could sacrifice so that I will have an extra \u00a360 a month for this hen do. I feel awkward and uncomfortable living with people who want me to go into debt for their benefit, but can\u2019t find anywhere else to live that I can afford, though I\u2019ll keep looking. My anxiety is through the roof at the concept I\u2019ll be in more debt if I go.\n\nAITA if I say I just can\u2019t afford it and I\u2019m not going? Even though they let me live in their home and have offered me a payment plan? I don\u2019t want to hurt my finances but I don\u2019t want to be an ungrateful cow of a friend. I was expecting the whole thing to cost around \u00a3200, which I probably could have squeezed. reddit, be brutal. Am I a tight fisted ungrateful asshole here?? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong for not attending their best friend's hen party. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author lives with their best friend Stephanie and her fianc\u00e9 Dave. They pay rent for a room in the house they own. The author is a bridesmaid and was excited to be part of the wedding. However, the hen party is a luxury trip to the south of France costing \u00a3350, with a payment plan from Stephanie's mom. The author can't afford it and has financial issues, including a debt management plan and a broken car they're paying off. They tried to explain this to Stephanie and Dave, but Dave was upset and Stephanie felt the author was being negative. The author is now conflicted between their financial stability and not wanting to be seen as ungrateful.\n\nThe key points here are the author's financial constraints versus the expectations of attending the hen party. The author has legitimate financial struggles\u2014debt management, a broken car, and limited discretionary spending. They were expecting a lower cost, around \u00a3200, which they could manage, but the actual cost is much higher. They also mentioned mental health issues related to Stephanie's friends, which adds another layer of stress.\n\nOn the other hand, Stephanie and Dave seem to expect the author to go to great lengths to attend, even if it means going into debt. Dave's comment about selling a limb is extreme and perhaps unrealistic, given the author's financial situation. Stephanie's reaction is dismissive, not understanding the author's financial reality.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for prioritizing their financial stability. The hen party is a celebration, but it's not a mandatory event. The author isn't refusing to be a bridesmaid, just a specific part of the event they can't afford. They are trying to communicate their situation and are willing to look for alternatives, like finding a new place to live if necessary, which shows they're not being ungrateful but are genuinely struggling.\n\nFinancial responsibility is important, especially when someone is already in a debt management plan. The friends' friends are mean, which the author has valid reasons to avoid. The author isn't being ungrateful; they're making a tough choice based on their circumstances. The friends' expectations might be unreasonable, expecting someone with lower income to spend a significant amount on a friend's event, especially when it's not a necessity.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the author isn't in the wrong. They have legitimate reasons for not attending the hen party and are being honest about their financial situation. The friends and their expectations might be part of the problem here.\n"
