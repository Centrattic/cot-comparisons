Both enjoy having me there and in general the arrangement works out well.\n\nThey both earn more than 3 x what I do, if this matters.\n\nThey got engaged in July and I was asked to be a bridesmaid. I was very excited, and as this is my best friend of ten ish years I couldn\u2019t imagine not being a part of their wedding. The groom and I are also good friends due to being housemates, we are almost like a little family.\n\nI do not like Stephanie\u2019s friends. They are mean and shallow and materialistic and when I hang out with them I feel bad. I have a history of mental health issues if this matters - a big part of my road to recovery was understanding when I hung out with certain people, I would feel bad afterwards. My mental health has greatly improved since I stopped hanging out with this group of girls three or so years ago. I kept the friendships that didn\u2019t make me feel bad - such as Stephanie.\n\nI enthusiastically agreed the hen do would be great and not to worry about me not liking the other girls going - I could be civil for a few days to celebrate my best friends wedding.\n\nStephanie\u2019s sister and some of the girls going organised the hen do in secret, wanting Stephanie to be surprised. Three days ago I received a text from this group asking for \u00a3350 by Saturday (tomorrow) - and that if I couldn\u2019t afford it Stephanie\u2019s mother would pay my share and I could pay her back \u00a360 a month. The hen do will be a holiday to The south of france for four days, staying in a luxury villa/mansion, with a wine tour, a night out and a dinner. The \u00a3350 only covers flights and accommodation and will be in June next year.\n\nI do not have \u00a3350, I do not have \u00a360 a month spare. I am on a debt management plan and my car broke two months ago, meaning I had to borrow money from an uncle and agree to pay him back \u00a355 a month for three years. This was already a financial stress to me as I try to pay off my debt. I have been paying it off for three years and would have been debt free in a years time, but will be paying my uncle back for some years now. I don\u2019t buy clothes, I don\u2019t go out for dinners, I don\u2019t get my hair and nails done. I am sensible with my money.\n\nI approached Stephanie and Dave (he just happened to be there) - I said I was embarrassed about being offered to pay her mother back as they obviously know I can\u2019t afford the hen do, and that I just didn\u2019t know how I was going to afford to go.\n\nDave said it was disgusting of any friend, especially a bridesmaid, not to go to a hen party. He said he would go into debt or borrow money or \u201csell a limb\u201d to be there for a friend. Stephanie said I was \u201cbeing negative\u201d that I would \u201cupset her mum who offered to pay to be nice\u201d and that I\u2019m \u201cruining something she has dreamed of since she was a little girl\u201d\n\n\nI laid awake that night for hours trying to think of what I could sacrifice so that I will have an extra \u00a360 a month for this hen do. I feel awkward and uncomfortable living with people who want me to go into debt for their benefit, but can\u2019t find anywhere else to live that I can afford, though I\u2019ll keep looking. My anxiety is through the roof at the concept I\u2019ll be in more debt if I go.\n\nAITA if I say I just can\u2019t afford it and I\u2019m not going? Even though they let me live in their home and have offered me a payment plan? I don\u2019t want to hurt my finances but I don\u2019t want to be an ungrateful cow of a friend. I was expecting the whole thing to cost around \u00a3200, which I probably could have squeezed. reddit, be brutal. Am I a tight fisted ungrateful asshole here?? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves not being able to afford a hen party for their best friend despite being asked to be a bridesmaid.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the main points. The author is a housemate and best friend of Stephanie, who's getting married. The hen party is expensive, and the author can't afford it. They mentioned financial constraints, being on a debt management plan, a broken car leading to more debt, and not having the extra \u00a360 a month. The friends offered a payment plan via Stephanie's mom, but the author feels pressured and might go into more debt. \n\nThe key factors here are financial capability versus emotional/relationship expectations. The author clearly communicated their inability to afford the hen do, both upfront and when approached. They\u2019re in a position of financial instability and are trying to manage their debts responsibly. The friends and the groom (Dave) reacted negatively, suggesting that not going is unacceptable, which adds stress on the author.\n\nThe author's mental health history and the fact that Stephanie's friends have caused them anxiety in the past are also important. They had already made the decision to avoid those people because it affected their mental health. The hen party is a group event with those friends, so attending could trigger their anxiety again.\n\nFinancial pressure in friendships is a tricky area. While being a bridesmaid is a significant role, it's also expected that the friends can manage the expenses. Expecting someone with existing financial struggles to take on more debt could be seen as unreasonable. The author isn't refusing because they don't care; they genuinely can't afford it. Their decision is based on their own financial stability and mental health, which are valid reasons.\n\nComparing the author's situation to the financial status of Stephanie and Dave (who earn three times as much) might highlight that the author isn't in a position to take on additional expenses. The friends' reaction, calling the author negative and ungrateful, doesn't address the actual financial reality. The payment plan offered by Stephanie's mom is well-intentioned but might not consider the author's ability to repay.\n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, the author isn't being ungrateful by not attending due to financial constraints. They have already contributed by being a bridesmaid, which is a significant role. The hen party is an additional event where the author's presence isn't mandatory for the wedding itself. The stress of attending might also harm their mental health, which is a valid concern given their history.\n\nThe broader question is whether friends can expect financial commitments from others, especially when those others are in a less stable financial position. The author's decision to prioritize their own financial and mental well-being is a responsible choice. They are not avoiding the situation entirely but are being honest about their limitations. The friends' insistence on attending might not consider the author's circumstances, leading to a conflict between expectations and reality.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong. They communicated their situation clearly, are managing their finances responsibly, and have valid reasons related to their mental health and existing debts. The pressure from the friends to attend despite these factors is the real issue here. The answer should reflect that the author is not at fault.\n"
