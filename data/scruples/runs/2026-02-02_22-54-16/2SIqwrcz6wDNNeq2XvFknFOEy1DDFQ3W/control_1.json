Both enjoy having me there and in general the arrangement works out well.\n\nThey both earn more than 3 x what I do, if this matters.\n\nThey got engaged in July and I was asked to be a bridesmaid. I was very excited, and as this is my best friend of ten ish years I couldn\u2019t imagine not being a part of their wedding. The groom and I are also good friends due to being housemates, we are almost like a little family.\n\nI do not like Stephanie\u2019s friends. They are mean and shallow and materialistic and when I hang out with them I feel bad. I have a history of mental health issues if this matters - a big part of my road to recovery was understanding when I hung out with certain people, I would feel bad afterwards. My mental health has greatly improved since I stopped hanging out with this group of girls three or so years ago. I kept the friendships that didn\u2019t make me feel bad - such as Stephanie.\n\nI enthusiastically agreed the hen do would be great and not to worry about me not liking the other girls going - I could be civil for a few days to celebrate my best friends wedding.\n\nStephanie\u2019s sister and some of the girls going organised the hen do in secret, wanting Stephanie to be surprised. Three days ago I received a text from this group asking for \u00a3350 by Saturday (tomorrow) - and that if I couldn\u2019t afford it Stephanie\u2019s mother would pay my share and I could pay her back \u00a360 a month. The hen do will be a holiday to The south of france for four days, staying in a luxury villa/mansion, with a wine tour, a night out and a dinner. The \u00a3350 only covers flights and accommodation and will be in June next year.\n\nI do not have \u00a3350, I do not have \u00a360 a month spare. I am on a debt management plan and my car broke two months ago, meaning I had to borrow money from an uncle and agree to pay him back \u00a355 a month for three years. This was already a financial stress to me as I try to pay off my debt. I have been paying it off for three years and would have been debt free in a years time, but will be paying my uncle back for some years now. I don\u2019t buy clothes, I don\u2019t go out for dinners, I don\u2019t get my hair and nails done. I am sensible with my money.\n\nI approached Stephanie and Dave (he just happened to be there) - I said I was embarrassed about being offered to pay her mother back as they obviously know I can\u2019t afford the hen do, and that I just didn\u2019t know how I was going to afford to go.\n\nDave said it was disgusting of any friend, especially a bridesmaid, not to go to a hen party. He said he would go into debt or borrow money or \u201csell a limb\u201d to be there for a friend. Stephanie said I was \u201cbeing negative\u201d that I would \u201cupset her mum who offered to pay to be nice\u201d and that I\u2019m \u201cruining something she has dreamed of since she was a little girl\u201d\n\n\nI laid awake that night for hours trying to think of what I could sacrifice so that I will have an extra \u00a360 a month for this hen do. I feel awkward and uncomfortable living with people who want me to go into debt for their benefit, but can\u2019t find anywhere else to live that I can afford, though I\u2019ll keep looking. My anxiety is through the roof at the concept I\u2019ll be in more debt if I go.\n\nAITA if I say I just can\u2019t afford it and I\u2019m not going? Even though they let me live in their home and have offered me a payment plan? I don\u2019t want to hurt my finances but I don\u2019t want to be an ungrateful cow of a friend. I was expecting the whole thing to cost around \u00a3200, which I probably could have squeezed. reddit, be brutal. Am I a tight fisted ungrateful asshole here?? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about whether they should attend the hen party despite the financial burden.\n\nFirst, the author is a best friend and bridesmaid, which means they have a significant role in the wedding. They've been friends for a decade, so there's a long-standing relationship. The hen party is expensive, \u00a3350 upfront and \u00a360 a month, which they can't afford due to existing debts and financial struggles. They have a debt management plan, a broken car they're paying off, and don't spend on luxuries. \n\nThe friends who organized the trip included the author's friend Stephanie's sister and others. They sent the payment request suddenly, which might have been a surprise. The author tried to communicate the issue to Stephanie and Dave, but Dave's reaction was dismissive, saying it's disgusting not to go, and Stephanie accused the author of being negative and ruining her dream.\n\nThe author is in a tough spot. They genuinely can't afford the expense, and forcing themselves into more debt could harm their financial stability. They are already living in a house owned by Stephanie and Dave, which might be a factor in the pressure to attend. The friends' friends are described as mean and shallow, which adds to the discomfort of attending. \n\nThe key points here are financial capacity and the right to say no. The author isn't refusing to attend just to be difficult; it's a real financial constraint. The friends and their partners didn't consider the author's financial situation when planning the event. The author tried to communicate this, but instead of support, they faced criticism. \n\nIn many cases, expecting someone to go into debt for a social event, especially when they've communicated their inability to afford it, is unreasonable. The author is not obligated to prioritize the hen party over their financial health. Their mental health history and the negative impact of certain social groups also play a role in their decision-making. \n\nOn the other hand, the author did agree to be a bridesmaid, which could imply some commitment to participating in the wedding events. But if the hen party's cost was not properly communicated or estimated (they expected \u00a3200, but it's \u00a3350+), that's on the organizers. The author isn't in the wrong for not being able to meet an unexpected financial demand, especially when it would exacerbate their debt issues.\n\nConsidering all this, the author's decision not to attend due to financial constraints is valid. They are not being ungrateful but are prioritizing their well-being and financial stability. The pressure from Stephanie and Dave is unwarranted, and the author isn't in the wrong here.\n"
