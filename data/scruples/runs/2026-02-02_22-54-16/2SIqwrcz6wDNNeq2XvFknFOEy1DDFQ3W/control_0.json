Both enjoy having me there and in general the arrangement works out well.\n\nThey both earn more than 3 x what I do, if this matters.\n\nThey got engaged in July and I was asked to be a bridesmaid. I was very excited, and as this is my best friend of ten ish years I couldn\u2019t imagine not being a part of their wedding. The groom and I are also good friends due to being housemates, we are almost like a little family.\n\nI do not like Stephanie\u2019s friends. They are mean and shallow and materialistic and when I hang out with them I feel bad. I have a history of mental health issues if this matters - a big part of my road to recovery was understanding when I hung out with certain people, I would feel bad afterwards. My mental health has greatly improved since I stopped hanging out with this group of girls three or so years ago. I kept the friendships that didn\u2019t make me feel bad - such as Stephanie.\n\nI enthusiastically agreed the hen do would be great and not to worry about me not liking the other girls going - I could be civil for a few days to celebrate my best friends wedding.\n\nStephanie\u2019s sister and some of the girls going organised the hen do in secret, wanting Stephanie to be surprised. Three days ago I received a text from this group asking for \u00a3350 by Saturday (tomorrow) - and that if I couldn\u2019t afford it Stephanie\u2019s mother would pay my share and I could pay her back \u00a360 a month. The hen do will be a holiday to The south of france for four days, staying in a luxury villa/mansion, with a wine tour, a night out and a dinner. The \u00a3350 only covers flights and accommodation and will be in June next year.\n\nI do not have \u00a3350, I do not have \u00a360 a month spare. I am on a debt management plan and my car broke two months ago, meaning I had to borrow money from an uncle and agree to pay him back \u00a355 a month for three years. This was already a financial stress to me as I try to pay off my debt. I have been paying it off for three years and would have been debt free in a years time, but will be paying my uncle back for some years now. I don\u2019t buy clothes, I don\u2019t go out for dinners, I don\u2019t get my hair and nails done. I am sensible with my money.\n\nI approached Stephanie and Dave (he just happened to be there) - I said I was embarrassed about being offered to pay her mother back as they obviously know I can\u2019t afford the hen do, and that I just didn\u2019t know how I was going to afford to go.\n\nDave said it was disgusting of any friend, especially a bridesmaid, not to go to a hen party. He said he would go into debt or borrow money or \u201csell a limb\u201d to be there for a friend. Stephanie said I was \u201cbeing negative\u201d that I would \u201cupset her mum who offered to pay to be nice\u201d and that I\u2019m \u201cruining something she has dreamed of since she was a little girl\u201d\n\n\nI laid awake that night for hours trying to think of what I could sacrifice so that I will have an extra \u00a360 a month for this hen do. I feel awkward and uncomfortable living with people who want me to go into debt for their benefit, but can\u2019t find anywhere else to live that I can afford, though I\u2019ll keep looking. My anxiety is through the roof at the concept I\u2019ll be in more debt if I go.\n\nAITA if I say I just can\u2019t afford it and I\u2019m not going? Even though they let me live in their home and have offered me a payment plan? I don\u2019t want to hurt my finances but I don\u2019t want to be an ungrateful cow of a friend. I was expecting the whole thing to cost around \u00a3200, which I probably could have squeezed. reddit, be brutal. Am I a tight fisted ungrateful asshole here?? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a hen party (which is like a bachelorette party) that the author can't afford to attend. The author is a best friend and a bridesmaid, living with the bride and groom, and she's on a debt management plan. She can't pay the \u00a3350 up front or the \u00a360 monthly payments.\n\nFirst, the key points. The author has mental health issues and doesn't get along well with the bride's other friends, which is a significant factor. She's already in a financial bind with her car breaking down and needing to pay her uncle \u00a355 a month for three years. She's been paying off debt for three years and this hen do would push her further into debt. She's told the bride and groom about her situation, but they responded negatively, implying she should go into debt to attend.\n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong for not being able to afford the hen do and choosing not to go. \n\nOn one hand, being a bridesmaid does come with certain expectations, like attending events. The author did agree to be a bridesmaid and initially said she could handle the expense. But she has valid financial constraints and mental health reasons. She's already making sacrifices (no clothes, no dinners, etc.) to manage her finances. The hen do is more expensive than she anticipated, and the payment plan offered by the bride's mother isn't feasible for her.\n\nThe bride and groom's reactions seem dismissive of her financial struggles. The groom's comment about borrowing money or selling a limb is problematic because it's not realistic for someone in a debt management plan. The bride's response about being negative and ruining the hen do ignores the author's real financial limitations.\n\nThe author is in a difficult position. She's trying to prioritize her financial health and mental well-being. Not going might make her feel ungrateful, but forcing herself into more debt could have negative consequences. The hen do is a luxury trip that the bride's friends organized, and the author isn't responsible for covering that cost if she can't afford it. The fact that she's living with them and paying rent doesn't obligate her to fund a party that's primarily for the bride's other friends.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author isn't in the wrong. She's being honest about her financial situation and making a choice that's necessary for her well-being. The bride and groom should have been more understanding and found an alternative solution without pressuring her into debt.\n"
