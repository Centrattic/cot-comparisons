We leave at 7:35 so hitting the snooze button twice (7minutes each) leaves her with 35 minutes to get ready, which has never been enough.\nSo every morning I wake up, set her alarm ahead 13 minutes, leaving me 2 minutes to get the coffee running. She wakes up, gets in the shower. While she is in the shower I go back and set the alarm back to the correct time. For the past 8 or so months she has believed showering, getting dressed and putting on make-up takes her about 15 minutes.\nEvery now and then she comments on how much she has improved with being late. I smile and say yes love you really have.\nSometimes a little white lie can be a good thing. \n\nA lot of people called it controlling/manipulative etc. am I the asshole for doing this? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about lying to their wife by adjusting her alarm clock. The author sets her alarm 13 minutes ahead so she thinks she has 35 minutes to get ready, but actually, she only has 22 minutes because the author resets it. The wife thinks she's improving with punctuality, but it's all a lie.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. Lying to someone in a relationship can be a big deal. Even if the intention is good\u2014like avoiding arguments and helping her be on time\u2014it's still a lie. The key point is whether this deception is acceptable or considered wrong.\n\nThe wife isn't aware that her alarm is being manipulated. She might feel deceived if she ever finds out. Trust is a crucial part of a relationship, and lying, even a \"white lie,\" can erode that trust. Also, manipulating someone's schedule without their consent could be seen as controlling. The author is essentially making decisions for her to make their own life easier, which might not be fair.\n\nPeople's reactions on the subreddit called it controlling and manipulative. That's a red flag. Even if the author's intention was to help, the method is deceptive. The wife's punctuality is being faked by the author, which isn't honest. The author should have communicated the issue directly instead of resorting to a lie. Maybe they could have discussed changing the alarm time together or found another solution.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is trying to make mornings smoother and avoid arguments. That's a valid concern, but the solution chosen is problematic. Honesty and open communication are usually better than deception. The fact that the author felt the need to lie suggests there might be a deeper issue in the relationship, like not being able to address the problem openly.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is intentionally deceiving their spouse, which is a violation of trust. Even if the outcome is positive, the means are ethically questionable. Therefore, the answer is A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
