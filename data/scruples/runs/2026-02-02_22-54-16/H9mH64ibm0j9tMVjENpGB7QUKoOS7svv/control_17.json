We leave at 7:35 so hitting the snooze button twice (7minutes each) leaves her with 35 minutes to get ready, which has never been enough.\nSo every morning I wake up, set her alarm ahead 13 minutes, leaving me 2 minutes to get the coffee running. She wakes up, gets in the shower. While she is in the shower I go back and set the alarm back to the correct time. For the past 8 or so months she has believed showering, getting dressed and putting on make-up takes her about 15 minutes.\nEvery now and then she comments on how much she has improved with being late. I smile and say yes love you really have.\nSometimes a little white lie can be a good thing. \n\nA lot of people called it controlling/manipulative etc. am I the asshole for doing this? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for lying to his wife about setting her alarm. So, the situation is that they both drive to work together. The wife used to be late because she snoozed her alarm. The husband sets her alarm 13 minutes ahead, so she thinks she has 35 minutes to get ready, but actually, she only has 22 minutes because he later sets it back. The wife is unaware of this and thinks she's improved with being punctual.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if this is a justified lie or if it's manipulative. The husband's intention is to avoid arguments and help her get ready on time. But he's doing it by deception. The key here is the lack of honesty. Even if the outcome is good (they leave on time without arguments), the method involves lying and manipulating her perception.\n\nThe wife doesn't know the truth. She believes she's improving, which might be good for her self-esteem, but she's not aware that her husband is altering her alarm. This could be seen as a breach of trust. Honesty is a cornerstone in relationships, and even if it's a small lie, it's still a lie. The husband isn't being transparent about his actions, which could lead to bigger issues if discovered.\n\nAlso, the fact that he's doing this without her knowledge might be considered controlling. He's making a decision that affects her routine without her input. Even if his intentions are good, the act of manipulating the situation without her consent could be problematic. People have the right to make their own choices, even if they're not perfect. The husband's intervention, while well-meaning, takes away her autonomy in the matter.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that it's a harmless lie that helps them both. But the line between a white lie and manipulation can be thin. The problem arises when the lie is ongoing and affects the other person's perception without their awareness. The wife might feel betrayed if she found out, leading to more significant conflict than the original issue.\n\nSo, considering all angles, the husband is acting in a way that's deceptive. The fact that others called it controlling and manipulative supports that view. Even if there's good intent, the lack of honesty and the manipulation of the wife's experience without her consent makes the action problematic. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
