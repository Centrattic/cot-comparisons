We leave at 7:35 so hitting the snooze button twice (7minutes each) leaves her with 35 minutes to get ready, which has never been enough.\nSo every morning I wake up, set her alarm ahead 13 minutes, leaving me 2 minutes to get the coffee running. She wakes up, gets in the shower. While she is in the shower I go back and set the alarm back to the correct time. For the past 8 or so months she has believed showering, getting dressed and putting on make-up takes her about 15 minutes.\nEvery now and then she comments on how much she has improved with being late. I smile and say yes love you really have.\nSometimes a little white lie can be a good thing. \n\nA lot of people called it controlling/manipulative etc. am I the asshole for doing this? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for lying to their wife by adjusting her alarm. The situation involves them driving to work together, and the wife often hits snooze, leading to her being late. The author claims they set her alarm 13 minutes ahead so she thinks she has 15 minutes, while in reality, she only has 35 minutes total from 6:45 to 7:35. They then reset it to the correct time after she's up. The wife has thought she's improved in getting ready faster, but the author is secretly manipulating the time.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics of deception here. The author is lying to their wife about the time, which directly affects her schedule and probably her stress levels. While the intention might be to help her avoid being late, the method involves dishonesty. Lying, even if with good intentions, can erode trust in a relationship. The wife's belief that she's improved might be a result of the author's manipulation rather than actual improvement, which could lead to her feeling confused or cheated when the truth comes out.\n\nAnother angle is autonomy. The wife has the right to make her own decisions about her time and how she prepares for work. By changing the alarm without her knowledge, the author is making a choice for her, which could be seen as controlling. Even if the author's goal is to prevent arguments and ensure punctuality, it's better to communicate and find a solution together rather than unilaterally altering her routine through deception.\n\nPeople's reactions on the subreddit calling it controlling and manipulative make sense. While the author might not be malicious, the act of lying in a relationship, especially about something as personal and routine as time, is generally frowned upon. There could be more honest ways to address the issue, like discussing the problem and agreeing on a different schedule or using a more reliable alarm method. The fact that the author is hiding their actions suggests a lack of transparency, which is important in healthy relationships.\n\nHowever, there's a nuance here. The author does mention they do it to avoid arguments and to help the wife. Some might argue that it's a kind gesture, but the problem is the method. The lie, even a small one, is still a lie. The wife's autonomy is compromised, and the potential consequences of being discovered could be worse than the original issue. If the wife ever finds out, it might cause more significant arguments or feelings of betrayal.\n\nIn summary, while the intention might be good, the action of lying and manipulating the alarm is ethically questionable. It's a breach of trust and undermines the wife's ability to make informed decisions. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
