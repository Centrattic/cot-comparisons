We leave at 7:35 so hitting the snooze button twice (7minutes each) leaves her with 35 minutes to get ready, which has never been enough.\nSo every morning I wake up, set her alarm ahead 13 minutes, leaving me 2 minutes to get the coffee running. She wakes up, gets in the shower. While she is in the shower I go back and set the alarm back to the correct time. For the past 8 or so months she has believed showering, getting dressed and putting on make-up takes her about 15 minutes.\nEvery now and then she comments on how much she has improved with being late. I smile and say yes love you really have.\nSometimes a little white lie can be a good thing. \n\nA lot of people called it controlling/manipulative etc. am I the asshole for doing this? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is that he sets his wife's alarm 13 minutes ahead so she has enough time to get ready, but she thinks she's improved when actually he's manipulating the time. He gets coffee while she's in the shower and resets the alarm.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze if this is a lie that's harmful. The man is lying about the time to make his wife believe she's managing her time better. He does this to avoid arguments and maybe to protect her feelings. But some people called it controlling or manipulative.\n\nSo, controlling behavior usually involves a desire to control another person, often to the point where their autonomy is undermined. Manipulation is about influencing someone through underhanded methods. Since he's altering her alarm without her knowledge, that's a form of manipulation. Even if the intention is good, the action is deceptive. Honesty is important in relationships, and keeping such a secret could erode trust if found out.\n\nAlso, the wife's perception of her own time management is being altered. She might not realize she's actually not improving, which could prevent her from making genuine changes. The fact that he's doing this for months without her knowing suggests a lack of communication. Instead of addressing the root issue (her snoozing and time management), he's using a workaround that hides the problem.\n\nOn the other hand, he's trying to maintain peace and avoid conflict. But the ethical question is whether the ends justify the means. Even if the intention is good, deception can be problematic. The right approach would have been to discuss the issue openly with her and find a solution together, rather than manipulating the situation behind her back.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong. The manipulation of the alarm is controlling and deceptive, even if well-intentioned. Therefore, the correct choice is A.\n"
