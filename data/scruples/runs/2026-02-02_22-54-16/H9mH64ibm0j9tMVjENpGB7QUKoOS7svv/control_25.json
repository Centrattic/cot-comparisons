We leave at 7:35 so hitting the snooze button twice (7minutes each) leaves her with 35 minutes to get ready, which has never been enough.\nSo every morning I wake up, set her alarm ahead 13 minutes, leaving me 2 minutes to get the coffee running. She wakes up, gets in the shower. While she is in the shower I go back and set the alarm back to the correct time. For the past 8 or so months she has believed showering, getting dressed and putting on make-up takes her about 15 minutes.\nEvery now and then she comments on how much she has improved with being late. I smile and say yes love you really have.\nSometimes a little white lie can be a good thing. \n\nA lot of people called it controlling/manipulative etc. am I the asshole for doing this? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for lying to his wife. The situation is that he's been adjusting her alarm clock by 13 minutes ahead so that when she wakes up, she thinks she has 35 minutes to get ready, but actually, she has 48. He does this because she's been hitting snooze and being late, so he manipulates the time to make her leave on time. He then resets the clock back when she's in the shower. The wife thinks she's improved, but it's actually because of the lie.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. The man is lying about the time, which directly affects his wife's daily routine. While the intention seems to be helpful (avoiding arguments and ensuring they leave on time), the method is deceptive. Deception can be a gray area\u2014sometimes people lie for what they think is a good reason. However, honesty is usually valued in relationships. Even if the lie is small, it's a betrayal of trust because he's not being truthful about the time, which is a basic aspect of their shared life.\n\nAnother angle is consent. The wife isn't aware that her alarm is being manipulated. She thinks her time management is improving, but in reality, it's the man's intervention. This could be seen as controlling or manipulative because he's making decisions for her without her knowledge. Even if the outcome is positive (they leave on time), the means are underhanded. Manipulation often occurs when someone influences another person's actions without their knowledge or consent.\n\nThere's also the aspect of autonomy. The wife has the right to make her own decisions about her time and how she manages her morning routine. By adjusting the alarm, he's taking away her ability to make informed choices. If she knew the truth, she might choose to address her snooze habit differently, perhaps with open communication rather than deception.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the lie is a harmless way to solve a recurring problem. The man's actions prevent arguments and ensure punctuality, which are positive outcomes. He might believe that the benefits outweigh the deceit, especially if the wife is happy with the results. However, the key here is whether the deception is justified. In relationships, transparency is crucial. Trust is built on honesty, and even small lies can erode that trust over time.\n\nAlso, the term \"white lie\" is often used for minor deceptions that are considered harmless. But in this case, the lie is ongoing and affects a significant part of her daily routine. The fact that he continues to do this for months without her knowing might indicate a pattern of behavior that could lead to other issues if discovered. If the wife finds out, she might feel betrayed, leading to bigger conflicts than the original problem of being late.\n\nAnother point to consider is the potential consequences if the deception were discovered. The wife might feel that her autonomy was violated and that her husband didn't trust her to manage her own time. This could lead to resentment or a breakdown in communication. Even if the intention was good, the method could cause more harm than good in the long run.\n\nIn summary, while the man's intention might be to help and avoid arguments, the method of deception without her knowledge is problematic. The lack of transparency and consent makes his actions ethically questionable. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong.\n"
