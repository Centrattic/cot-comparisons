We leave at 7:35 so hitting the snooze button twice (7minutes each) leaves her with 35 minutes to get ready, which has never been enough.\nSo every morning I wake up, set her alarm ahead 13 minutes, leaving me 2 minutes to get the coffee running. She wakes up, gets in the shower. While she is in the shower I go back and set the alarm back to the correct time. For the past 8 or so months she has believed showering, getting dressed and putting on make-up takes her about 15 minutes.\nEvery now and then she comments on how much she has improved with being late. I smile and say yes love you really have.\nSometimes a little white lie can be a good thing. \n\nA lot of people called it controlling/manipulative etc. am I the asshole for doing this? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. Let's break it down.\n\nThe situation is that the person is setting their wife's alarm 13 minutes ahead each morning so that she has enough time to get ready without arguing about being late. The wife doesn't know the alarm is set ahead, and the husband lies about her improving her punctuality. The main question is whether this is a \"little white lie\" that's helpful or if it's manipulative and controlling.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the intentions. The husband's goal is to avoid arguments and help his wife get ready on time. He's adjusting the alarm to give her more time without her realizing. On the surface, it seems like he's trying to be helpful. However, the act of lying about the alarm time and lying to his wife about her improvement could be seen as deceptive. \n\nDeception in relationships can be a tricky area. While the intention isn't malicious, the method involves withholding the truth. Even if the outcome is positive (no arguments, on-time arrival), the deception itself could cause issues if discovered. Trust is a big part of any relationship, and lying, even for good reasons, can erode that trust. \n\nAlso, the wife's autonomy is a factor. She's making decisions based on incorrect information. If she thought she had 35 minutes but actually had 48 (13 minutes extra), she might not be aware of her own capabilities. This could affect her self-perception and independence. The husband might be preventing her from learning to manage her time effectively on her own.\n\nThe responses from others called it controlling or manipulative. That's a red flag. Even if the husband didn't mean it that way, the actions can be perceived as such. The line between a helpful lie and manipulation can be thin. The key difference is whether the person is being controlled without their knowledge. Here, the wife is being controlled in her routine without her consent or awareness.\n\nAnother angle is communication. Instead of lying, a better approach would have been to discuss the issue openly. Maybe they could have found a solution together, like adjusting the alarm time without deception or setting a different morning routine. The husband's method avoids conflict in the short term but might lead to bigger issues if the truth comes out.\n\nSo, weighing the pros and cons: the intention is positive, but the method involves deception and undermines the wife's autonomy. The potential for harm (loss of trust, perceived manipulation) might outweigh the benefit of avoiding arguments. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not being honest and for manipulating the situation behind his wife's back.\n"
