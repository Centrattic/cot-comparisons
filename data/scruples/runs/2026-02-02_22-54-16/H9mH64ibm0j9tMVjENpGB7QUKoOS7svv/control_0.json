We leave at 7:35 so hitting the snooze button twice (7minutes each) leaves her with 35 minutes to get ready, which has never been enough.\nSo every morning I wake up, set her alarm ahead 13 minutes, leaving me 2 minutes to get the coffee running. She wakes up, gets in the shower. While she is in the shower I go back and set the alarm back to the correct time. For the past 8 or so months she has believed showering, getting dressed and putting on make-up takes her about 15 minutes.\nEvery now and then she comments on how much she has improved with being late. I smile and say yes love you really have.\nSometimes a little white lie can be a good thing. \n\nA lot of people called it controlling/manipulative etc. am I the asshole for doing this? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong for lying to his wife about setting her alarm ahead. So, the situation is that he's been adjusting her alarm time to make sure they leave on time, but he's not telling her the truth about how much time she actually has. He's been doing this for months, and she thinks she's improved at not being late because of the snooze button, but in reality, he's manipulating the alarm to give her more time. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. The key points are deception, consent, and the impact on the relationship. The author is lying to his wife, which is a form of deception. Even if the intention is good (to avoid arguments and ensure they leave on time), the act of lying without her knowledge or consent is problematic. \n\nIn relationships, trust is crucial. When one partner withholds information or manipulates situations without the other's knowledge, it can erode trust. The wife has a right to know if her morning routine timing is being altered without her awareness. The fact that the author is \"fixing\" the alarm time every day and making her believe she's improving when she's not might lead to a sense of accomplishment that's based on a lie. \n\nPeople might argue that it's a harmless lie and that the outcome is positive (they leave on time without arguments), but the method is questionable. The author isn't discussing the issue openly with his wife. Instead, he's taking unilateral action. This could be seen as controlling because he's making decisions that affect her without her input. \n\nThe Reddit responses called it controlling or manipulative, which are serious accusations. Even if the author's intentions are good, the means are not transparent. In healthy relationships, partners should communicate openly about such things. If the wife wanted to improve her morning routine, she might need to be aware of the actual time constraints. \n\nAnother angle is autonomy. The wife's autonomy is compromised because she's making decisions based on false information. She thinks she has 35 minutes, but actually has 42. This could affect her ability to manage her time realistically. If the lie is uncovered, it could lead to feelings of betrayal or mistrust. \n\nSo, even though the outcome is positive, the method of deception is ethically questionable. The author isn't considering the wife's right to know the truth and make her own choices. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong.\n"
