We leave at 7:35 so hitting the snooze button twice (7minutes each) leaves her with 35 minutes to get ready, which has never been enough.\nSo every morning I wake up, set her alarm ahead 13 minutes, leaving me 2 minutes to get the coffee running. She wakes up, gets in the shower. While she is in the shower I go back and set the alarm back to the correct time. For the past 8 or so months she has believed showering, getting dressed and putting on make-up takes her about 15 minutes.\nEvery now and then she comments on how much she has improved with being late. I smile and say yes love you really have.\nSometimes a little white lie can be a good thing. \n\nA lot of people called it controlling/manipulative etc. am I the asshole for doing this? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're the asshole for lying to their wife about setting her alarm ahead to make her leave on time. The situation is that they both work close and used to argue about her lateness. The husband wakes up early, sets her alarm 13 minutes ahead, so she thinks she has 35 minutes to get ready. But in reality, she only has 22 minutes because the alarm is set ahead. He then resets it after she takes a shower so she doesn't notice. He says this has been going on for 8 months, and he's been praising her for improving, when actually she's just been following the adjusted schedule.\n\nNow, the question is whether this is wrong. The possible answers are A (yes, he's in the wrong) or B (no). Let me think about the ethical aspects here. Honesty is a key component of trust in a relationship. By lying about the alarm time, the husband is manipulating his wife's perception of her own punctuality. Even though his intention is to avoid arguments and help her be on time, he's not being truthful. The wife believes she's improved, but she's actually just following a schedule that's been artificially adjusted without her knowledge. This deception could erode trust if she ever finds out. Manipulation is often considered unethical because it involves controlling someone's actions without their knowledge or consent. Even if the outcome is positive (they leave on time without arguments), the means used are dishonest. The subreddit users called it controlling and manipulative, which are valid criticisms. The husband isn't addressing the root issues, like maybe setting a more realistic schedule or discussing her use of the snooze button. Instead, he's using a workaround that's deceptive. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong.\n"
