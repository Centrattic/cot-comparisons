We leave at 7:35 so hitting the snooze button twice (7minutes each) leaves her with 35 minutes to get ready, which has never been enough.\nSo every morning I wake up, set her alarm ahead 13 minutes, leaving me 2 minutes to get the coffee running. She wakes up, gets in the shower. While she is in the shower I go back and set the alarm back to the correct time. For the past 8 or so months she has believed showering, getting dressed and putting on make-up takes her about 15 minutes.\nEvery now and then she comments on how much she has improved with being late. I smile and say yes love you really have.\nSometimes a little white lie can be a good thing. \n\nA lot of people called it controlling/manipulative etc. am I the asshole for doing this? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about setting their wife's alarm clock ahead by 13 minutes so she thinks she has enough time to get ready, but actually she's starting later. The person is lying about her improving with punctuality. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key elements here. The main issue is deception. The husband is manipulating the alarm time without his wife's knowledge. Even though the intention might be to help her avoid being late, the method involves lying and not being honest. \n\nThe wife isn't aware that her alarm is being adjusted. She believes she's improving because the husband praises her, but in reality, she's just been given a false head start. This could be seen as a lack of trust or a way to control the situation without her consent. \n\nNow, the responses from others called it controlling and manipulative. That's a red flag. Deception in a relationship can lead to trust issues. Even if the husband's intention is good, the act of lying and altering her alarm without her knowledge is a breach of trust.\n\nAnother angle is that the husband is taking responsibility for solving a problem that could be addressed through communication. Instead of discussing the issue with his wife and finding a mutual solution, he's taking unilateral action. That might mean he's not respecting her autonomy in the situation.\n\nHowever, some might argue that the husband is trying to maintain peace and avoid daily arguments. But intentional deception, even for a \"good\" cause, can undermine the relationship's foundation. Trust is crucial, and if the wife found out, it could cause significant hurt.\n\nSo, putting it all together: the husband's actions involve deception, lack of consent, and could be seen as controlling. Even if the outcome is positive (no arguments), the method is ethically questionable. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong.\n"
