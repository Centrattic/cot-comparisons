We leave at 7:35 so hitting the snooze button twice (7minutes each) leaves her with 35 minutes to get ready, which has never been enough.\nSo every morning I wake up, set her alarm ahead 13 minutes, leaving me 2 minutes to get the coffee running. She wakes up, gets in the shower. While she is in the shower I go back and set the alarm back to the correct time. For the past 8 or so months she has believed showering, getting dressed and putting on make-up takes her about 15 minutes.\nEvery now and then she comments on how much she has improved with being late. I smile and say yes love you really have.\nSometimes a little white lie can be a good thing. \n\nA lot of people called it controlling/manipulative etc. am I the asshole for doing this? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're an asshole for lying to their wife by setting her alarm ahead by 13 minutes. The context is that she's always late because she snoozes twice, which adds up to 7 minutes each. By setting the alarm ahead, he gives her enough time to get ready. But she thinks she's improving because she believes her routine takes 15 minutes. He gets coffee while she's in the shower and then resets the alarm.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics of this. The key points are deception, manipulation, and the intent. He's lying to her by adjusting the alarm without her knowledge, making her think she's faster than she actually is. Even though the intention is good\u2014to avoid arguments and ensure they leave on time\u2014the method is deceptive. \n\nDeception in relationships can be problematic because it erodes trust. Even a \"little white lie\" can have consequences. The wife might find out eventually, and that could lead to hurt feelings or a breach of trust. The husband's actions are manipulative because he's altering her perception of her own behavior. She's not aware of the real time constraints, so she's not making informed decisions about her morning routine. \n\nSome might argue that it's a harmless way to solve a recurring problem. However, the fact that he's doing this for 8 months without her knowing suggests it's a long-term deception. The wife's autonomy is compromised since she's not given the accurate information to manage her time. Instead of working together to find a solution, he's taking control unilaterally. \n\nThe community's reaction was that it's controlling or manipulative, which are strong indicators that this behavior is seen as crossing a line. The husband isn't addressing the root cause, like maybe adjusting their schedule or helping her build better habits, but instead uses deception. This approach doesn't foster collaboration or honesty in the relationship. \n\nIn conclusion, while the intentions might be good, the method is ethically questionable due to deception and lack of transparency. Trust is a cornerstone in relationships, and this action undermines it. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
