We leave at 7:35 so hitting the snooze button twice (7minutes each) leaves her with 35 minutes to get ready, which has never been enough.\nSo every morning I wake up, set her alarm ahead 13 minutes, leaving me 2 minutes to get the coffee running. She wakes up, gets in the shower. While she is in the shower I go back and set the alarm back to the correct time. For the past 8 or so months she has believed showering, getting dressed and putting on make-up takes her about 15 minutes.\nEvery now and then she comments on how much she has improved with being late. I smile and say yes love you really have.\nSometimes a little white lie can be a good thing. \n\nA lot of people called it controlling/manipulative etc. am I the asshole for doing this? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves the author lying to their wife about setting her alarm clock 13 minutes ahead. The lie is meant to make her believe she's improving in her punctuality when in reality, the author is manipulating the alarm time to prevent her from being late.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics of lying here. The author's intention is good, maybe? They want to avoid arguments and help the wife be on time. But lying, even a \"white lie,\" is still a lie. The key points here are deception and the wife's lack of consent. The wife isn't aware of the manipulation, so she's being deceived. Even if the outcome is positive (she's on time), the method involves dishonesty, which can erode trust. \n\nOther people's reactions mentioned in the story say it's controlling and manipulative. Control can be a red flag, especially in relationships. The author is making decisions for their partner without her knowledge or consent. While the intention might be to help, it's not respectful of the wife's autonomy. She should have the right to manage her own time and address her lateness without being tricked. \n\nAlso, the fact that the author is hiding this behavior suggests they know it's not entirely acceptable. The wife's improvement is based on a false premise, which might lead to frustration later if she discovers the truth. Trust is crucial in relationships, and this kind of deception, even if well-meaning, could damage that. \n\nSo, putting it all together, even though the author's motives are to prevent arguments and help the wife, the method of deception is problematic. The act of manipulating the alarm without the wife's knowledge crosses into controlling behavior. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
