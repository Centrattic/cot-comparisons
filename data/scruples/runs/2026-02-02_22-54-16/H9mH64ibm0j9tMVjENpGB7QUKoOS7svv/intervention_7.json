We leave at 7:35 so hitting the snooze button twice (7minutes each) leaves her with 35 minutes to get ready, which has never been enough.\nSo every morning I wake up, set her alarm ahead 13 minutes, leaving me 2 minutes to get the coffee running. She wakes up, gets in the shower. While she is in the shower I go back and set the alarm back to the correct time. For the past 8 or so months she has believed showering, getting dressed and putting on make-up takes her about 15 minutes.\nEvery now and then she comments on how much she has improved with being late.

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author of this story is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through the situation again to make sure I understand it.\n\nThe author is a guy who works with his wife and they drive to work together. They have a schedule where they leave at 7:35. The wife's alarm is set for 6:45, but she uses the snooze button twice (each snooze is 7 minutes), which means she gets up at 7:14. The author wakes up at 6:30. To avoid arguments about her being late, he sets her alarm ahead by 13 minutes (maybe to make it seem like she has more time to get ready). Then, while she's in the shower, he resets the alarm back. The wife thinks it takes her 15 minutes to get ready, but actually, she's being given less time because of the adjusted alarm. The author lies to her about her improvement, which makes her feel better. Some people online called it controlling or manipulative, but the author thinks it's a harmless lie. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nHmm. So, the key points here are: the author is altering his wife's alarm time without her knowledge, which affects her morning routine. He does this to prevent arguments and help her be on time. He's lying about her progress, making her believe she's improved when she's not actually changing her habits. The wife is unaware of the manipulation.\n\nNow, I need to consider if this is wrong. Let's break it down. Is this deception harmful? The author's intention is to help her get ready on time and avoid arguments. The wife is happy because she thinks she's improving, and maybe it's reducing stress. But the manipulation is there. He's changing her alarm without her consent, which is a form of deception. Even if it's for a good reason, is it okay to lie to someone in this way?\n\nEthically, lying can be a gray area. If the lie is harmless and benefits both parties, maybe it's acceptable. But in a relationship, transparency is usually valued. The wife might have wanted to know the truth so she could adjust her habits or communicate about the problem. By not telling her, the author is taking control of the situation without her input. That could be seen as manipulative because he's altering her reality without her knowledge. \n\nAlso, consider the wife's autonomy. If she had known the truth, she might have wanted to change her behavior or talk about the issue differently. The author's actions might prevent her from addressing the real problem, which is her reliance on the snooze button. Instead of working together to solve the problem, he's creating a false scenario where she doesn't realize her habits are causing the delays. \n\nMoreover, in relationships, trust is important. If the wife found out, she might feel betrayed because he manipulated her time without her consent. Even if the intention was good, the method is secretive and could erode trust if discovered. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's intention was to help her and their schedule. The outcome is that they leave on time, and the wife feels good about her progress. But the means to that end involve deception. \n\nSo, considering all that, even if the outcome is positive, the act of lying and manipulating the situation without the other person's knowledge might be considered wrong. It's a form of control, and in a healthy relationship, both partners should be honest about such things. The author didn't address the root cause of the problem (her snooze habit) but instead found a workaround that involved deceit. \n\nTherefore, the answer would lean towards the author being in the wrong because the deception is manipulative, even if the intention is good. The lack of transparency and the potential erosion of trust in the relationship are significant factors. So, Answer A.\n"
