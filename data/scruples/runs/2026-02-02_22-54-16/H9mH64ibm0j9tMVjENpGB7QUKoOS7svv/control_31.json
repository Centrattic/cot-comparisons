We leave at 7:35 so hitting the snooze button twice (7minutes each) leaves her with 35 minutes to get ready, which has never been enough.\nSo every morning I wake up, set her alarm ahead 13 minutes, leaving me 2 minutes to get the coffee running. She wakes up, gets in the shower. While she is in the shower I go back and set the alarm back to the correct time. For the past 8 or so months she has believed showering, getting dressed and putting on make-up takes her about 15 minutes.\nEvery now and then she comments on how much she has improved with being late. I smile and say yes love you really have.\nSometimes a little white lie can be a good thing. \n\nA lot of people called it controlling/manipulative etc. am I the asshole for doing this? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading the situation carefully.\n\nThe author is a person who's lying to their wife about setting her alarm clock. They wake up early, set her alarm 13 minutes ahead, so she thinks she has more time to get ready. Then, after she wakes up and takes a shower, they reset the alarm back. The wife believes she's improved her punctuality, but in reality, her alarm is manipulated. The author says they do this to avoid arguments about her being late and claims it's a \"white lie.\" However, others called it controlling or manipulative.\n\nFirst, I should consider the key elements here. The main issue is deception. The author is actively lying to their spouse by altering the alarm time without her knowledge. Even though the intention might be to reduce arguments and help her not be late, the method involves deception and manipulation. \n\nIn relationships, honesty and trust are fundamental. When one partner is lied to, even if the lie is considered small, it can erode trust over time. The author's action is a deliberate act of deception. The wife's belief in her improvement is based on a falsehood, which could lead to her not addressing real underlying issues, like her reliance on snoozing or time management. \n\nThe author might argue that it's a kind act to maintain peace, but the ethical issue here is about consent and transparency. The wife isn't aware of the manipulation, so she can't make an informed choice about her schedule or her habits. This lack of transparency could be seen as a breach of trust. \n\nAlso, the author's behavior might be a sign of controlling tendencies. By changing the alarm without consent, they are exerting control over their spouse's actions, which can be a red flag in a relationship. Even if the intent is good, the method is problematic.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author is trying to solve a recurring problem. But there are other ways to approach this, like having an open conversation about the issue, helping her manage time better, or setting a mutual alarm system without deception. The fact that the author is lying suggests they didn't feel their spouse could handle the truth or that they wanted to avoid conflict. However, this approach could lead to bigger issues if discovered, potentially causing more conflict than it prevents.\n\nIn summary, while the author's intention may be to help and reduce arguments, the act of lying and manipulating the situation without the spouse's knowledge is ethically wrong. It undermines trust and transparency, which are crucial in a relationship. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong.\n"
