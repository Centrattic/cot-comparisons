We leave at 7:35 so hitting the snooze button twice (7minutes each) leaves her with 35 minutes to get ready, which has never been enough.\nSo every morning I wake up, set her alarm ahead 13 minutes, leaving me 2 minutes to get the coffee running. She wakes up, gets in the shower. While she is in the shower I go back and set the alarm back to the correct time. For the past 8 or so months she has believed showering, getting dressed and putting on make-up takes her about 15 minutes.\nEvery now and then she comments on how much she has improved with being late. I smile and say yes love you really have.\nSometimes a little white lie can be a good thing. \n\nA lot of people called it controlling/manipulative etc. am I the asshole for doing this? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is that he's been lying to his wife about setting her alarm clock ahead by 13 minutes to make her think she has enough time to get ready, so they can leave on time without arguments. He does this so she doesn't feel rushed and he gets the coffee started earlier. The question is whether he's the asshole here.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the scenario. The key points are: he's manipulating the alarm time without her knowing. He's been doing this for eight months, and she's been commenting on improving her punctuality, which he's encouraging with praise. The Reddit comments called him controlling or manipulative. \n\nThe user wants a yes or no answer based on right or wrong. The options are A for yes (he's wrong) or B for no (he's not).\n\nSo, from an ethical standpoint, deception is a factor here. Lying to a spouse about something that affects their daily routine and perception of their own time management. Even if the intention is good (avoiding arguments, helping her be on time), the method is deceptive. Trust is a big part of a relationship, and manipulating her schedule without her knowledge could be seen as undermining her autonomy and trust.\n\nOn the other hand, the husband's actions might be motivated by wanting to maintain harmony in their routine. The lie, however, is a form of manipulation. The wife might appreciate being on time, but she also has the right to know the truth about her own schedule. If he had communicated the real issue (her snoozing) and they found a solution together, that would be more respectful. Instead, he's controlling the situation without her consent. \n\nThe Reddit responses called him controlling, which is a red flag. Even if the outcome is positive (they leave on time), the means used are ethically questionable. The deception could lead to bigger issues if discovered, especially if she finds out he's been lying for months. \n\nTherefore, the author is likely in the wrong because he uses deception to manipulate his wife's behavior without her knowledge or consent. Even though the intention is to help, the method violates trust and autonomy. So the answer should be A.\n"
