We leave at 7:35 so hitting the snooze button twice (7minutes each) leaves her with 35 minutes to get ready, which has never been enough.\nSo every morning I wake up, set her alarm ahead 13 minutes, leaving me 2 minutes to get the coffee running. She wakes up, gets in the shower. While she is in the shower I go back and set the alarm back to the correct time. For the past 8 or so months she has believed showering, getting dressed and putting on make-up takes her about 15 minutes.\nEvery now and then she comments on how much she has improved with being late. I smile and say yes love you really have.\nSometimes a little white lie can be a good thing. \n\nA lot of people called it controlling/manipulative etc. am I the asshole for doing this? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for lying to his wife. The scenario is that he's been adjusting her alarm clock to make her think she has less time to get ready, which he claims has prevented arguments about her being late. He sets her alarm 13 minutes ahead, then resets it later. The wife thinks she's improved, but he's actually manipulating the time.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the moral implications. Lying, even if it's a \"white lie,\" can be problematic, especially when it's done to control someone's behavior. The author is intentionally deceiving his spouse, which could erode trust. Trust is a fundamental part of any relationship, and if one partner is being manipulated without their knowledge, that's a big issue. \n\nHe mentions that they used to argue about her being late, so his intention was to reduce conflict. But the method he chose involves deception. Even if the outcome seems positive (she's not late), the means are questionable. Manipulating someone's perception can lead to a lack of trust and may cause other issues down the line. If the wife found out, she might feel betrayed, even if the intention was good.\n\nThe Reddit responses mentioned that some people called it controlling or manipulative. That's a red flag. Control and manipulation are generally not acceptable in healthy relationships. The author is not addressing the root cause of the problem\u2014perhaps communication or time management\u2014but instead using a deceptive tactic to make things easier for himself. \n\nThe wife's belief in her own improvement might be genuine, but it's based on false premises. The author isn't helping her develop better time management skills; he's just creating an illusion of improvement. This could prevent her from recognizing the real issue, which might lead to problems if the situation changes or if she discovers the truth.\n\nIn summary, while the intention was to reduce conflict, the method used involves deception and control, which are harmful in a relationship. The author is not being honest with his spouse, which is a breach of trust. Therefore, the answer would likely be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
