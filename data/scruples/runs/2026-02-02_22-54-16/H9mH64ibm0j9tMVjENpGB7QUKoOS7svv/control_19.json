We leave at 7:35 so hitting the snooze button twice (7minutes each) leaves her with 35 minutes to get ready, which has never been enough.\nSo every morning I wake up, set her alarm ahead 13 minutes, leaving me 2 minutes to get the coffee running. She wakes up, gets in the shower. While she is in the shower I go back and set the alarm back to the correct time. For the past 8 or so months she has believed showering, getting dressed and putting on make-up takes her about 15 minutes.\nEvery now and then she comments on how much she has improved with being late.

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for lying to his wife about setting her alarm ahead. The situation is that they both drive to work together, and the wife often hits the snooze button, leading to arguments about her being late. The husband sets her alarm 13 minutes ahead so she thinks she has enough time, but he actually gives her less time to get ready. He then goes back and corrects the alarm after she showers. The wife thinks she's improved, but it's because of his manipulation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications here. The husband is lying by not telling his wife the truth about her alarm. He's manipulating her routine without her knowledge. Even though his intention is to avoid arguments and help her be on time, deception is still involved. \n\nIn relationships, trust is crucial. Lying, even if it's a \"white lie,\" can erode trust over time. The husband's actions are keeping the wife in the dark about her own schedule. She thinks she's managing her time better, but it's actually the husband adjusting things behind the scenes. This could lead to resentment if she ever finds out, or a sense of betrayal because he didn't communicate the real issue.\n\nAnother angle is consent. The wife didn't agree to this arrangement. The husband made a unilateral decision to change her alarm without discussing it with her. This could be seen as controlling because he's managing her time without her input. Even if the outcome is positive (she's not late), the method is ethically questionable.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that his actions are a kind of problem-solving to maintain harmony in their relationship. He's trying to prevent daily arguments, which are stressful. But the means he used (deception) might outweigh the benefit. There's also the aspect of autonomy; the wife has the right to know the truth about her own schedule and make her own decisions about how to manage her time.\n\nThe Reddit comments mentioned that some people called it controlling or manipulative. That suggests there's a societal consensus that such actions are problematic. Even if the intention is good, the method of deception is where the issue lies. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the husband's actions, while perhaps well-intentioned, involve deception and lack of consent. These are significant ethical issues in a relationship. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong.\n"
