We leave at 7:35 so hitting the snooze button twice (7minutes each) leaves her with 35 minutes to get ready, which has never been enough.\nSo every morning I wake up, set her alarm ahead 13 minutes, leaving me 2 minutes to get the coffee running. She wakes up, gets in the shower. While she is in the shower I go back and set the alarm back to the correct time. For the past 8 or so months she has believed showering, getting dressed and putting on make-up takes her about 15 minutes.\nEvery now and then she comments on how much she has improved with being late. I smile and say yes love you really have.\nSometimes a little white lie can be a good thing. \n\nA lot of people called it controlling/manipulative etc. am I the asshole for doing this? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is that the husband set his wife's alarm 13 minutes ahead so she would get ready faster, then reset it back. The wife thinks she's improving, but he's actually lying to her about the time.\n\nFirst, I need to consider different angles. The husband's intention was to avoid arguments about being late. He thought this would help her manage her time better. But he's manipulating the alarm times, which she's unaware of. The key issue here is deception. He's lying about the time, which affects her perception of her own punctuality. \n\nNow, the arguments against him: lying in a relationship can erode trust. Even if it's a \"white lie,\" manipulating something as routine as the alarm clock is a form of control. People might see this as manipulative because he's altering her environment without her consent. It's possible she would be upset if she found out, even if the intention was good.\n\nOn the other hand, his intention was to reduce conflict and help her. He's not lying in a harmful way, just adjusting the time. But the act of lying itself, regardless of intent, is still a lie. The subreddit users called him controlling, which is a valid criticism because he's making decisions for her without her input.\n\nAlso, the wife's autonomy is being compromised. She's not aware that her perception of time is being altered. Even if the result is positive (her being on time), the method is ethically questionable. Trust in a relationship is built on honesty, so this deception could lead to bigger issues if discovered.\n\nIn terms of right vs. wrong, while the intention was good, the action of lying and manipulating the situation without her knowledge is problematic. The harm is in the deception and the lack of consent. So, the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
