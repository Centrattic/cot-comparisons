We leave at 7:35 so hitting the snooze button twice (7minutes each) leaves her with 35 minutes to get ready, which has never been enough.\nSo every morning I wake up, set her alarm ahead 13 minutes, leaving me 2 minutes to get the coffee running. She wakes up, gets in the shower. While she is in the shower I go back and set the alarm back to the correct time. For the past 8 or so months she has believed showering, getting dressed and putting on make-up takes her about 15 minutes.\nEvery now and then she comments on how much she has improved with being late.

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for lying to his wife. So, first, I need to understand the situation thoroughly.\n\nThe man and his wife have a routine where they leave for work at 7:35. He wakes up early to get ready and sets her alarm 13 minutes ahead to give her enough time. She hits snooze twice, which makes her actually have less time, leading to arguments about her lateness. He then resets the alarm back to the correct time after she's in the shower. He's been doing this for 8 months, and she's unaware of his manipulation. He's proud of her thinking she's improved, even though he's the one adjusting the alarm. The community on Reddit called him controlling and manipulative, but he's unsure if he's the asshole.\n\nNow, I need to evaluate if he's in the wrong. Let's break it down. The key points here are deception and consent. He's lying to his wife by manipulating the alarm time without her knowledge. The intention is to make her believe she's improving, but in reality, she's not. This could be seen as underhanded because he's not honest about his actions. Even if the outcome is positive (no arguments, she's on time), the method involves deceit. \n\nTrust is a big component in relationships. By lying, especially in a significant way like this, he's violating her trust. She's not given the chance to make informed decisions about her own schedule. He's taking control without her consent, which can be seen as controlling behavior. The fact that people labeled it as controlling and manipulative supports that view. Even if he didn't mean to harm, the act itself is ethically questionable. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe his intention was to prevent arguments and ensure they leave on time. But the means to that end involve deception, which is problematic. There's no evidence that she'd agree to such a method if she knew. The situation could have been handled by having a conversation about the snooze button and finding a mutually agreeable solution. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is likely A (Yes, he's in the wrong). The deception, lack of consent, and potential for controlling behavior make his actions unethical in this context.\n"
