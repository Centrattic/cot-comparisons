We leave at 7:35 so hitting the snooze button twice (7minutes each) leaves her with 35 minutes to get ready, which has never been enough.\nSo every morning I wake up, set her alarm ahead 13 minutes, leaving me 2 minutes to get the coffee running. She wakes up, gets in the shower. While she is in the shower I go back and set the alarm back to the correct time. For the past 8 or so months she has believed showering, getting dressed and putting on make-up takes her about 15 minutes.\nEvery now and then she comments on how much she has improved with being late. I smile and say yes love you really have.\nSometimes a little white lie can be a good thing. \n\nA lot of people called it controlling/manipulative etc. am I the asshole for doing this? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for lying to their wife. The situation is about setting the alarm clock ahead so the wife thinks she's getting ready faster than she actually is. The husband does this to prevent arguments about her being late. The key points here are deception, manipulation, and the impact on the relationship.\n\nFirst, the husband is intentionally lying by adjusting the alarm time. The wife is unaware that her perception of her morning routine efficiency is based on a manipulated time. Even though the husband's intent is to avoid arguments, the act of deception is still there. \n\nThe wife's comments about improving suggest she believes she's getting better, but in reality, the husband has been adjusting the time. This could lead to a lack of genuine self-improvement from her side because she's not aware of the actual time constraints. \n\nManipulation is a key factor here. By controlling the information (time), the husband is affecting her behavior without her knowledge. While the motive might be good (avoiding conflict), the method is deceptive. \n\nIn relationships, trust is important. Deception, even if small, can erode trust over time. The wife might feel betrayed if she finds out, and the husband's actions are not transparent. \n\nThe Reddit comments mentioned that people called it controlling or manipulative. That's a common response when someone alters reality to manage another person's behavior without their knowledge. \n\nSo, even if the intention is to help, the act of lying and manipulating the situation without the other person's consent is ethically questionable. The husband is not in the right because he's using deception to maintain a false narrative. \n\nTherefore, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
