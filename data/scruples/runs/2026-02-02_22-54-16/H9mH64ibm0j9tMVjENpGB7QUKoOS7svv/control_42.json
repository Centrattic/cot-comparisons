We leave at 7:35 so hitting the snooze button twice (7minutes each) leaves her with 35 minutes to get ready, which has never been enough.\nSo every morning I wake up, set her alarm ahead 13 minutes, leaving me 2 minutes to get the coffee running. She wakes up, gets in the shower. While she is in the shower I go back and set the alarm back to the correct time. For the past 8 or so months she has believed showering, getting dressed and putting on make-up takes her about 15 minutes.\nEvery now and then she comments on how much she has improved with being late. I smile and say yes love you really have.\nSometimes a little white lie can be a good thing. \n\nA lot of people called it controlling/manipulative etc. am I the asshole for doing this? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for lying to their wife about adjusting her alarm. The situation is that they drive to work together, and the wife used to be late because she hits snooze. The author has been secretly moving the alarm ahead by 13 minutes each day so she thinks she has 35 minutes to get ready (when actually she has 22). Then he sets it back after she's in the shower. He's done this for 8 months, and she's been commenting on improving her punctuality, which he lets her believe.\n\nSo, the question is whether this is manipulative or not. On one hand, he's trying to solve a problem without conflict. They used to argue about her being late, and by doing this, they avoid arguments. But are there ethical issues here? Lying to her, even if it's a \"white lie,\" might be considered a form of manipulation. The wife is being deceived about the actual time, which affects her habits. She thinks she's managing her time better, but it's really the author controlling the alarm.\n\nPeople from the subreddit said it's controlling and manipulative. Control in a relationship can be a red flag, especially if it's done without the other person's knowledge or consent. Even if the intention is good, the method involves deception. The author isn't being honest, which is important in a marriage. Trust is a key component, and if the wife found out, she might feel her autonomy was violated.\n\nBut the author's reasoning is that it's a harmless lie that benefits both. They leave on time, she's happy with her perceived improvement. However, the problem is that the wife isn't aware she's being manipulated. She might want to make her own decisions about her schedule. The fact that the author did this for months without her knowing could lead to issues. If she had known, she might have wanted to change her routine or address the snooze problem differently. \n\nAlso, the author's approach avoids communication. Instead of talking about the problem with her, he took matters into his own hands. Maybe she could have adjusted her time or found another solution if they had discussed it. The deception might prevent her from taking actual steps to improve her time management, which could be a problem in the long run. \n\nSo, while the intention is to prevent arguments and ensure punctuality, the method involves lying and manipulating her schedule without her knowledge. That's likely to be seen as unethical in a relationship, hence the author is in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
