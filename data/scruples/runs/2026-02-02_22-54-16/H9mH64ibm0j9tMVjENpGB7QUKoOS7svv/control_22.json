We leave at 7:35 so hitting the snooze button twice (7minutes each) leaves her with 35 minutes to get ready, which has never been enough.\nSo every morning I wake up, set her alarm ahead 13 minutes, leaving me 2 minutes to get the coffee running. She wakes up, gets in the shower. While she is in the shower I go back and set the alarm back to the correct time. For the past 8 or so months she has believed showering, getting dressed and putting on make-up takes her about 15 minutes.\nEvery now and then she comments on how much she has improved with being late. I smile and say yes love you really have.\nSometimes a little white lie can be a good thing. \n\nA lot of people called it controlling/manipulative etc. am I the asshole for doing this? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person in the situation is lying to their wife by adjusting her alarm time. The main question is whether this makes them the asshole.\n\nFirst, their intention: They want to avoid arguments about her being late. They set her alarm 13 minutes ahead so she thinks she has enough time. She then feels better about her efficiency, not realizing the lie. The person claims it's a \"white lie\" for the greater good of their routine.\n\nBut what about the ethics here? Lying, even if well-intentioned, can be problematic. Trust is a cornerstone in relationships. By consistently lying, they're not being honest with their wife. Even if the lie is minor, it's a deception that affects daily life. The wife's autonomy is also an issue here. She's making decisions based on false information, which could prevent her from addressing real time management issues.\n\nAnother angle: The husband isn't solving the root problem. Instead of helping her manage her time better, he's enabling bad habits. If she genuinely had trouble with time, maybe setting up a better routine or communication would be better. Also, the fact that they've been doing this for 8 months without her discovering it suggests a long-term pattern of dishonesty.\n\nThe reactions from the subreddit users labeling it as controlling or manipulative make sense. Manipulation often involves subtle control over another person's actions without their full awareness. Even if the intent is to avoid conflict, the method crosses into manipulative territory.\n\nOn the other hand, the husband might argue it's a harmless lie that maintains peace. But in relationships, honesty is crucial. The potential harm here isn't just in the lie itself, but in the lack of transparency and the possible erosion of trust if it's discovered later. Also, the wife's ability to improve her punctuality is hindered because she's not aware of the actual time she has.\n\nSo, weighing the intent against the impact, the action is deceitful even if well-meaning. The husband's behavior undermines trust and autonomy, which are important in healthy relationships. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong.\n"
