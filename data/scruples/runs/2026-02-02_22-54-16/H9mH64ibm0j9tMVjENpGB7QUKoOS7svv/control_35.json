We leave at 7:35 so hitting the snooze button twice (7minutes each) leaves her with 35 minutes to get ready, which has never been enough.\nSo every morning I wake up, set her alarm ahead 13 minutes, leaving me 2 minutes to get the coffee running. She wakes up, gets in the shower. While she is in the shower I go back and set the alarm back to the correct time. For the past 8 or so months she has believed showering, getting dressed and putting on make-up takes her about 15 minutes.\nEvery now and then she comments on how much she has improved with being late. I smile and say yes love you really have.\nSometimes a little white lie can be a good thing. \n\nA lot of people called it controlling/manipulative etc. am I the asshole for doing this? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is that the author has been secretly adjusting his wife's alarm clock by 13 minutes ahead so that she thinks she has 35 minutes to get ready, but actually, she's only getting 22 minutes (since the alarm is set ahead). This way, she never experiences the lateness caused by hitting snooze twice, and he can get coffee done in 2 minutes. He's been doing this for 8 months, and she's been complimented on improving her punctuality. But when he posted about it, people called him controlling and manipulative. Now he's asking if he's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if his actions are wrong. The key points here are deception, manipulation, and consent. The wife isn't aware that her alarm is being altered. She believes she's managing her time effectively, but in reality, she's being manipulated to be on time. The author is lying to maintain the appearance that she's improving, which he takes credit for by saying \"you really have.\"\n\nThe main ethical issues here are deception and lack of consent. By altering the alarm without her knowledge, he's interfering with her autonomy. She doesn't have the right to make informed decisions about her routine because the information is being manipulated. Even though the outcome (on-time arrival) is positive, the method is unethical because it's based on a lie. The wife's ability to make decisions about her own schedule is compromised. \n\nAdditionally, the author's justification (\"a little white lie can be a good thing\") doesn't hold because the lie is ongoing and affects a significant part of their daily lives. It's not a minor or trivial lie. The manipulation here is more about controlling the outcome without the other person's knowledge or agreement. \n\nPeople's reactions calling it controlling and manipulative make sense because it's a form of covert control. The wife might feel betrayed if she found out, as it undermines trust. Trust is crucial in relationships, and such deception can erode it even if there's no immediate harm. The fact that the author is proud of the lie and shares it publicly suggests a lack of awareness about the ethical implications.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author is in the wrong. The answer should be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
