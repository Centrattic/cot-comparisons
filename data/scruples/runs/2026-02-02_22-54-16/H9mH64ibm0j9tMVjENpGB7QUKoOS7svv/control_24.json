We leave at 7:35 so hitting the snooze button twice (7minutes each) leaves her with 35 minutes to get ready, which has never been enough.\nSo every morning I wake up, set her alarm ahead 13 minutes, leaving me 2 minutes to get the coffee running. She wakes up, gets in the shower. While she is in the shower I go back and set the alarm back to the correct time. For the past 8 or so months she has believed showering, getting dressed and putting on make-up takes her about 15 minutes.\nEvery now and then she comments on how much she has improved with being late. I smile and say yes love you really have.\nSometimes a little white lie can be a good thing. \n\nA lot of people called it controlling/manipulative etc. am I the asshole for doing this? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the story is in the wrong. The situation involves lying to his wife by adjusting her alarm clock. The main points are that he sets her alarm ahead by 13 minutes so she thinks she has more time, but actually, he resets it later. He does this to avoid her being late for work, which used to cause arguments.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the ethical implications of his actions. Lying to someone, even if it's for a good reason, can be problematic. The key factors here are intent and the impact on the relationship. The husband's intention is to help her avoid being late, which seems well-meaning. However, the method involves deception, which might undermine trust.\n\nThe wife isn't aware of his actions and believes she's improved her punctuality. The husband smiles when she comments on her improvement, indicating he's aware of the lie but doesn't correct her. The subreddit comments labeled this as controlling or manipulative, which are serious accusations. \n\nControl and manipulation often involve one person exerting influence over another without consent. By altering her alarm without her knowledge, the husband is making decisions for her, which could be seen as controlling. Even if it's done to help, the lack of transparency is an issue. \n\nTrust is crucial in a relationship. If the wife found out, she might feel betrayed, even if the motive was good. The husband could have addressed the issue through communication rather than deception. Maybe suggesting a different time for the alarm or helping her manage her morning routine without lying.\n\nOn the other hand, the husband's actions prevented daily arguments, which is a positive outcome. He didn't cause direct harm, just used a trick to ease a recurring problem. The lie is a minor one, and the consequences don't seem severe. \n\nBut the principle here is about honesty. Even minor lies can erode trust over time. The subreddit's reaction suggests that many people see this as manipulative, which adds weight to the argument that the husband is in the wrong. \n\nIn relationships, transparency is important. The husband should have discussed the problem with his wife and found a mutual solution instead of handling it secretly. His actions, while well-intentioned, bypassed her autonomy. \n\nSo, considering all these points, the husband's actions, though aimed at solving a problem, involve deception and could be seen as controlling. Therefore, the answer leans towards 'A' (the author is in the wrong).\n"
