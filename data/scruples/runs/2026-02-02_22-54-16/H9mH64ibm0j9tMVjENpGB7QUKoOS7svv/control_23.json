We leave at 7:35 so hitting the snooze button twice (7minutes each) leaves her with 35 minutes to get ready, which has never been enough.\nSo every morning I wake up, set her alarm ahead 13 minutes, leaving me 2 minutes to get the coffee running. She wakes up, gets in the shower. While she is in the shower I go back and set the alarm back to the correct time. For the past 8 or so months she has believed showering, getting dressed and putting on make-up takes her about 15 minutes.\nEvery now and then she comments on how much she has improved with being late. I smile and say yes love you really have.\nSometimes a little white lie can be a good thing. \n\nA lot of people called it controlling/manipulative etc. am I the asshole for doing this? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation involves the author lying to his wife by adjusting her alarm clock to make her think she's improving in waking up on time. The wife uses the snooze button twice, which adds 14 minutes, but the author sets her alarm 13 minutes ahead. So she thinks she has 35 minutes, but actually has 49 (35+14). This way, she doesn't realize she's been using the snooze button so much. The author mentions lying to her by saying she's improved, which she isn't actually doing.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author's actions are unethical or harmful. The key points here are deception and the intent behind it. The author is manipulating the situation to make the wife believe she's better at managing her time than she is. The wife is unaware of the true reason she's not late anymore. \n\nDeception in a relationship can be a gray area. Small lies that don't cause harm are sometimes considered \"white lies.\" However, this situation involves ongoing manipulation. The wife is not given the truth, which could prevent her from addressing the root cause of her lateness (her snooze habit). The author is avoiding potential conflicts by lying instead of having an honest conversation. \n\nThe author's actions might be seen as controlling because he's altering her alarm without her knowledge, which affects her daily routine. Even if the intention was good (avoiding arguments and helping her be on time), the method involves deception. Trust is a crucial element in a relationship, and such lies can erode that trust if discovered. \n\nThe community's reaction mentioned people calling it controlling or manipulative, which suggests that many view this as problematic. The author didn't confront the issue directly but chose a deceptive route. The wife's autonomy in managing her time is compromised because she's not aware of her actual behavior. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's intent was to help, and there's no evident harm beyond the deception. However, the ethical issue lies in the method used. Relationships require honesty, and even well-meaning lies can be harmful in the long run. The author could have approached the problem by discussing the snooze habit with his wife instead of manipulating the situation behind her back.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's intention might not have been malicious, the act of deception and manipulation in a relationship is generally considered wrong. The answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong) because of the dishonesty and control involved, even if the motive was benign.\n"
