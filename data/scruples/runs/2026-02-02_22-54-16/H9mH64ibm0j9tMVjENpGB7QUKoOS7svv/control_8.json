We leave at 7:35 so hitting the snooze button twice (7minutes each) leaves her with 35 minutes to get ready, which has never been enough.\nSo every morning I wake up, set her alarm ahead 13 minutes, leaving me 2 minutes to get the coffee running. She wakes up, gets in the shower. While she is in the shower I go back and set the alarm back to the correct time. For the past 8 or so months she has believed showering, getting dressed and putting on make-up takes her about 15 minutes.\nEvery now and then she comments on how much she has improved with being late. I smile and say yes love you really have.\nSometimes a little white lie can be a good thing. \n\nA lot of people called it controlling/manipulative etc. am I the asshole for doing this? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the given scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about lying to their wife by adjusting her alarm clock to make her think she's improving in getting ready on time. The husband sets her alarm ahead by 13 minutes so she thinks she has 35 minutes, but actually, she's only getting 22 minutes. This has been going on for 8 months, and he's making her believe she's improved when she's not really. The user wants to know if the author is the asshole here.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications of the husband's actions. Lying about the time she has each morning could be seen as manipulative. Even though the intention might be good (to prevent arguments and ensure they leave on time), the method involves deception. The wife is being misled into thinking she's getting better at managing her time when in reality, her time is being manipulated. \n\nTrust is a crucial component in any relationship. By lying repeatedly, the husband is eroding that trust. The wife might feel betrayed if she finds out, especially since this has been going on for several months. The fact that he's acknowledging the possible negative reactions from others (\"controlling/manipulative\") suggests he's aware there's a problem. \n\nAnother angle is the lack of communication. Instead of adjusting her alarm without her knowledge, the husband should have addressed the root issue\u2014the problem with her being late. Maybe discussing ways to help her manage her time better without deception would have been a more respectful approach. \n\nThe husband's solution is a \"white lie,\" but the consequences of such a lie can be significant. If the wife discovers the truth, it could lead to more arguments or even damage the relationship. The husband's actions, while perhaps well-intentioned, undermine the wife's autonomy and honesty between them. \n\nSo, even if the intention is to prevent daily conflicts, the method is ethically problematic. The husband's actions are deceptive, which is why many people would view it as controlling or manipulative. Therefore, the answer is likely that the author is in the wrong.\n"
