We leave at 7:35 so hitting the snooze button twice (7minutes each) leaves her with 35 minutes to get ready, which has never been enough.\nSo every morning I wake up, set her alarm ahead 13 minutes, leaving me 2 minutes to get the coffee running. She wakes up, gets in the shower. While she is in the shower I go back and set the alarm back to the correct time. For the past 8 or so months she has believed showering, getting dressed and putting on make-up takes her about 15 minutes.\nEvery now and then she comments on how much she has improved with being late. I smile and say yes love you really have.\nSometimes a little white lie can be a good thing. \n\nA lot of people called it controlling/manipulative etc. am I the asshole for doing this? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for lying to their wife by adjusting her alarm clock. So, the scenario is that they both have to leave by 7:35. The wife wakes up at 6:45 but uses the snooze button twice, each for 7 minutes, totaling 14 minutes. The husband sets her alarm 13 minutes ahead, making her think she has 35 minutes to get ready when in reality she only has 22 minutes. Then he resets the alarm back. The wife believes her routine takes 15 minutes and is happy about being on time. The husband says he lies to her and smiles when she comments on her improvement.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. The key issues are deception, consent, and the impact on the relationship. The husband is actively manipulating the situation by altering the time on the alarm. This is a form of lying, even if it's a \"white lie.\" The wife isn't aware that her time is being manipulated, so she's not making informed decisions about her routine. \n\nWhile the intention might be good\u2014avoiding arguments and ensuring they leave on time\u2014it's important to consider whether the means justify the ends. Deception in a relationship can erode trust. Even if the husband thinks it's harmless, the wife might feel betrayed if she found out. The fact that he's lying to reinforce her belief that she's improving might be manipulative, as it's altering her perception of her own efficiency without her knowledge.\n\nAnother angle is respect. The wife might value her autonomy in managing her morning routine. By controlling the alarm without her knowledge, the husband is undermining her ability to make real changes. If she thought she had 35 minutes and actually has less, she might not address the real issue of her punctuality. This could prevent her from developing better time management skills if she doesn't know the true time she has.\n\nAlso, the response from the community (people calling it controlling/manipulative) suggests that this is a red flag in relationships. While the husband might not see it as malicious, the act of consistently lying, even for a \"good\" reason, can be harmful. It's possible the wife would feel disrespected or that her time is not being valued, leading to resentment over time.\n\nOn the other hand, the husband's intention is to avoid conflict and ensure they leave on time. The lie does seem minor and not harmful in the short term. But the key is whether it's ethical to deceive a partner in this way. In a healthy relationship, communication is key. Instead of lying, the husband could have discussed with his wife the issue of her using the snooze button and worked together to find a solution. That would be more respectful and honest.\n\nSo, putting it all together: While the action might be well-intentioned, the act of deception is problematic. The husband is not being truthful with his wife, which can lead to trust issues. The answer is likely A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
