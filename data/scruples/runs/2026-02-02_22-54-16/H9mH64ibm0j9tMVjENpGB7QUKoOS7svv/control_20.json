We leave at 7:35 so hitting the snooze button twice (7minutes each) leaves her with 35 minutes to get ready, which has never been enough.\nSo every morning I wake up, set her alarm ahead 13 minutes, leaving me 2 minutes to get the coffee running. She wakes up, gets in the shower. While she is in the shower I go back and set the alarm back to the correct time. For the past 8 or so months she has believed showering, getting dressed and putting on make-up takes her about 15 minutes.\nEvery now and then she comments on how much she has improved with being late. I smile and say yes love you really have.\nSometimes a little white lie can be a good thing. \n\nA lot of people called it controlling/manipulative etc. am I the asshole for doing this? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for lying to his wife about setting her alarm. The situation is that he sets her alarm 13 minutes ahead so she thinks she has 35 minutes to get ready when actually she has less. He does this to prevent her from being late because she hits snooze. He's been doing this for 8 months and has told her she's improved when she hasn't. Some people think it's controlling or manipulative.\n\nHmm. So, the key points here are deception and the intent behind it. The author is intentionally altering the alarm time without his wife's knowledge. Even if the intention is to help her avoid being late, lying to her about the actual time she has could be seen as a breach of trust. The wife has no idea that her alarm is being manipulated, which means she's making decisions based on false information. \n\nAlso, the author is taking pride in her thinking she's improved, even though he's the one causing that illusion. The comments from others about it being controlling or manipulative make sense because he's taking control of her routine without her consent. Even if the motive seems benign, the act of deception itself is questionable. \n\nIn relationships, honesty is usually valued. If the author wanted to help her with her morning routine, a better approach would be to communicate the problem and work together to find a solution, like adjusting her wake-up time or discussing the snooze habit. Deception, even a \"little white lie,\" can erode trust over time. The fact that he's been doing this for 8 months without her knowing might lead to her feeling betrayed if she ever finds out, which could have more significant repercussions than the initial problem of being late. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong because the deception is a form of manipulation, even if the intent is good. The means used are unethical in a relationship where honesty is expected.\n"
