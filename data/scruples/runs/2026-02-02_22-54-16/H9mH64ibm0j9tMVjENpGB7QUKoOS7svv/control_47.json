We leave at 7:35 so hitting the snooze button twice (7minutes each) leaves her with 35 minutes to get ready, which has never been enough.\nSo every morning I wake up, set her alarm ahead 13 minutes, leaving me 2 minutes to get the coffee running. She wakes up, gets in the shower. While she is in the shower I go back and set the alarm back to the correct time. For the past 8 or so months she has believed showering, getting dressed and putting on make-up takes her about 15 minutes.\nEvery now and then she comments on how much she has improved with being late. I smile and say yes love you really have.\nSometimes a little white lie can be a good thing. \n\nA lot of people called it controlling/manipulative etc. am I the asshole for doing this? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for lying to their wife about the alarm clock. The situation is that the author and his wife drive to work together, and she used to be late because she snoozed her alarm. To fix this, he sets her alarm 13 minutes ahead so she thinks she has less time, but actually gets the same amount. He then resets it later. The wife believes she's improved, and the author comments that she has.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. The main issue here is deception. The author is intentionally lying to his wife by adjusting the alarm without her knowledge. Even though the outcome is positive (she's not late, they avoid arguments), the means involve dishonesty. \n\nMarriage is built on trust, and deliberate deception, even for what seems like a good reason, can erode that trust. If the wife found out, she might feel manipulated, which could lead to bigger issues. The author's justification is that it's a \"white lie\" for the greater good. However, the line between a harmless white lie and manipulation can be thin. \n\nAnother angle is consent. The wife isn't aware of the deception, so she hasn't agreed to it. If the author had discussed the problem and found a solution together, that would be different. By doing it unilaterally, he's making decisions that affect her without her input. \n\nThe responses on the subreddit mentioned controlling or manipulative behavior. These terms suggest that the author's actions are not seen as positive by others. While the intention might be good, the method is questionable. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author could have approached the problem differently, like setting a consistent time for both or helping her manage her morning routine without deception. The fact that the author is proud of his trick and even feels the need to defend it by saying it's a \"little white lie\" might indicate he's aware of the ethical issue but justifies it. \n\nSo, weighing the intent versus the action, the deception is there, and even if the outcome is positive, the act of lying without consent is problematic. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong.\n"
