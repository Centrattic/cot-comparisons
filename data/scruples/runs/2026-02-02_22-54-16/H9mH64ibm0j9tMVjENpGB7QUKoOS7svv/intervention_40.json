We leave at 7:35 so hitting the snooze button twice (7minutes each) leaves her with 35 minutes to get ready, which has never been enough.\nSo every morning I wake up, set her alarm ahead 13 minutes, leaving me 2 minutes to get the coffee running. She wakes up, gets in the shower. While she is in the shower I go back and set the alarm back to the correct time. For the past 8 or so months she has believed showering, getting dressed and putting on make-up takes her about 15 minutes.\nEvery now and then she comments on how much she has improved with being late. I smile and say yes love you really have.\nSometimes a little white lie can be a good thing. \n\nA lot of people called it controlling/manipulative etc. am I the asshole for doing this? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that he's setting his wife's alarm 13 minutes ahead each morning, making her think she has 35 minutes to get ready when actually she only has 22 minutes. He does this to avoid arguments about her being late when they drive to work together. He gets coffee while she's in the shower, then resets the alarm.\n\nHmm. So the key points here are about deception and consent. The wife doesn't know he's adjusting the alarm. He's lying to her about her own time management skills. The question is whether this is controlling or manipulative, as some people on the subreddit said.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the nature of the lie. It's a small, ongoing deception. He's essentially creating a false reality for her so that she feels she's improved in time management when she's not actually improving. He's maintaining the status quo by making her believe her routine is efficient, when in fact he's the one making adjustments to keep her on time.\n\nIs this a harmless white lie or something more insidious? Maybe the intention is good\u2014avoiding arguments and ensuring punctuality. But the method involves manipulating her perception without her knowledge or consent. In a healthy relationship, transparency is important. Even if the outcome is positive (no arguments, she's on time), the means of deception could erode trust if discovered. Also, it's taking away her agency to manage her own time. She's not aware of the real time constraints, so she can't make informed decisions about her morning routine.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe it's a minor issue. It's not like he's doing anything harmful beyond a small lie. But the fact that it's a repeated lie and that he's essentially controlling her schedule without her knowing might be problematic. Manipulative behavior is about influencing someone without their consent, often to one's own advantage. Here, he's benefiting by not dealing with arguments and having time for coffee, but she's not making autonomous choices about her time.\n\nSo, even if the intention is good, the action of deception without consent could be considered wrong. The subreddit's reaction of calling it controlling or manipulative might be valid. Relationships require trust and honesty, and this kind of deception, while small, could be seen as undermining those values. Even a \"white lie\" can be harmful if it's a recurring act that affects the other person's autonomy and trust in the relationship.\n\nTherefore, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because he's manipulating the situation without his wife's knowledge or consent, which could be seen as controlling and could damage trust in the relationship.\n"
