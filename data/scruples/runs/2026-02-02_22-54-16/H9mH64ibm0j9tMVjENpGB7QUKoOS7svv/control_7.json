We leave at 7:35 so hitting the snooze button twice (7minutes each) leaves her with 35 minutes to get ready, which has never been enough.\nSo every morning I wake up, set her alarm ahead 13 minutes, leaving me 2 minutes to get the coffee running. She wakes up, gets in the shower. While she is in the shower I go back and set the alarm back to the correct time. For the past 8 or so months she has believed showering, getting dressed and putting on make-up takes her about 15 minutes.\nEvery now and then she comments on how much she has improved with being late. I smile and say yes love you really have.\nSometimes a little white lie can be a good thing. \n\nA lot of people called it controlling/manipulative etc. am I the asshole for doing this? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author here is the asshole. So the situation is that he's lying to his wife by adjusting her alarm clock. He says he sets it 13 minutes ahead so she has enough time to get ready, and then sets it back after she showers. The wife thinks she's improved in not being late, but actually, he's manipulating the time.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics of lying. Lying to someone, even with good intentions, can be a problem because it's a breach of trust. The question is whether this is a harmless white lie or something more manipulative. The author mentions that others called it controlling and manipulative. \n\nThe key points here are: he's adjusting her alarm without her knowledge, making her believe she's more efficient than she is. This could affect her self-perception. Also, the fact that he does this every day for months suggests it's habitual and not a one-time thing. \n\nControl and manipulation are red flags in relationships. If one partner is making decisions that affect the other without their consent, that's an issue. The wife's lateness was causing arguments, but instead of addressing it together, he took unilateral action. That might prevent her from taking responsibility or finding solutions on her own. \n\nHonesty is important in a relationship. Even if the intention is good, the method is deceptive. The wife has the right to know the truth about her morning routine. The fact that he's lying to make her feel better about her time management could backfire if discovered. It might lead to mistrust or resentment later.\n\nOn the other hand, the lie might be seen as a small act of kindness to avoid daily arguments. But the line between a harmless lie and manipulation is thin. The fact that he's adjusting the alarm twice a day for months is a significant ongoing deception. \n\nAlso, the wife's snooze habit is a personal choice. By changing her alarm time, he's interfering with her autonomy. She might not be aware of the actual time she takes, which could prevent her from making changes she would if she knew the truth. \n\nIn conclusion, while the intention might be to help, the method is deceitful and undermines trust. The author is manipulating the situation without the other person's knowledge or consent, which is a form of control. Therefore, he's in the wrong.\n"
