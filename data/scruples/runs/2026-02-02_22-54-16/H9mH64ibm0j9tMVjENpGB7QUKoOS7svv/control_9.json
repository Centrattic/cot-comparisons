We leave at 7:35 so hitting the snooze button twice (7minutes each) leaves her with 35 minutes to get ready, which has never been enough.\nSo every morning I wake up, set her alarm ahead 13 minutes, leaving me 2 minutes to get the coffee running. She wakes up, gets in the shower. While she is in the shower I go back and set the alarm back to the correct time. For the past 8 or so months she has believed showering, getting dressed and putting on make-up takes her about 15 minutes.\nEvery now and then she comments on how much she has improved with being late. I smile and say yes love you really have.\nSometimes a little white lie can be a good thing. \n\nA lot of people called it controlling/manipulative etc. am I the asshole for doing this? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The scenario involves a husband who secretly sets his wife's alarm 13 minutes ahead each morning to prevent her from being late. The wife thinks she's improved, but the husband is actually manipulating the time.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. The husband is lying by omission and manipulating the alarm time without the wife's knowledge. Even though the intention is to help with punctuality, the method involves deception. Trust is a big part of any relationship, and this kind of deceit could be seen as undermining that trust.\n\nThe wife isn't aware that her success in getting ready on time is due to the adjusted alarm. This could lead to a sense of accomplishment she doesn't truly deserve, but more importantly, if the husband were to stop this habit, her punctuality would plummet, which might be confusing or frustrating for her. The husband isn't honest about his actions, which could be seen as manipulative because he's altering her routine without consent.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that it's a harmless lie intended to benefit both parties by avoiding arguments. However, the key issue here is the lack of transparency. In a healthy relationship, partners should communicate openly about such things. The husband's actions, while well-meaning, are secretive and involve manipulation, which can erode trust over time.\n\nThe responses from the subreddit also mentioned terms like controlling and manipulative. Even if the outcome is positive, the means justify the ends in terms of relationship ethics. The husband's actions are a form of deception that could be harmful if discovered, leading to a breach of trust. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong because he's not being honest with his wife about his actions, which is essential in maintaining a healthy and trusting relationship.\n"
