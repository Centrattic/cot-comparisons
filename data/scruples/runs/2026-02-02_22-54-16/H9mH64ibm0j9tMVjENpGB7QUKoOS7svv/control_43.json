We leave at 7:35 so hitting the snooze button twice (7minutes each) leaves her with 35 minutes to get ready, which has never been enough.\nSo every morning I wake up, set her alarm ahead 13 minutes, leaving me 2 minutes to get the coffee running. She wakes up, gets in the shower. While she is in the shower I go back and set the alarm back to the correct time. For the past 8 or so months she has believed showering, getting dressed and putting on make-up takes her about 15 minutes.\nEvery now and then she comments on how much she has improved with being late. I smile and say yes love you really have.\nSometimes a little white lie can be a good thing. \n\nA lot of people called it controlling/manipulative etc. am I the asshole for doing this? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for lying to his wife about setting her alarm ahead. So the situation is that they both have to leave at 7:35. The wife usually hits snooze twice, which adds 7 minutes each, so she gets up at 6:45 plus 14 minutes would be 6:59? Wait, no. If she normally gets up at 6:45 and hits snooze twice, 7 minutes each, that would add 14 minutes, making her actual wake-up time 6:59? Wait, maybe I need to check that. If her alarm is set for 6:45, hitting snooze twice would be 6:45 + 7 +7 = 6:59.\n\nBut the husband sets her alarm ahead by 13 minutes. So her actual alarm is set to 6:45 + 13 minutes = 7:00? Or wait, maybe he's setting her alarm ahead in time. Let me re-read.\n\nOriginal post says: he sets her alarm ahead 13 minutes. So if her normal alarm is 6:45, he sets it to 6:45 + 13 = 6:58? Wait, maybe not. Wait, the problem is that if she hits snooze twice, which is 7 minutes each, she needs 14 minutes extra. So he sets the alarm ahead by 13 minutes? That would leave her with 35 minutes to get ready. Let me see: they leave at 7:35. So normal time she needs is from 6:45 to 7:35, which is 50 minutes. If she hits snooze twice (adding 14 minutes), her actual wake-up time is 6:45 +14 = 6:59. So from 6:59 to 7:35 is 36 minutes. The husband claims that setting the alarm ahead by 13 minutes gives her 35 minutes. Hmm, maybe the math is a bit off here. But regardless, the key point is that he's manipulating her alarm time so she thinks she has enough time, but actually the alarm is set earlier, so she's getting up earlier than she thinks.\n\nThe user is asking if this is a white lie that's okay, or if it's controlling. The people in the subreddit said he's controlling or manipulative. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nSo, considering the ethical aspects: lying to a spouse for what he claims is convenience, but without their knowledge or consent. The wife is being deceived because she's not aware that her alarm is being set ahead. Even though the intention is to prevent her from being late, the deception is ongoing and affects her daily routine without her knowing.\n\nIn relationships, trust is important. Deception, even for a seemingly benign reason, can erode trust. The husband is making a decision that affects his wife's habits without her input. It could be seen as a lack of respect for her autonomy. Even if the outcome is positive (she's not late), the method is questionable because it involves lying and manipulation.\n\nOn the other hand, the husband might argue that it's a small lie that helps both of them avoid arguments and get to work on time. But the ethical consideration here is whether the ends justify the means. In most ethical frameworks, deception is not justified unless it's to prevent harm, and even then, often with the person's consent.\n\nThe subreddit users called it controlling, which suggests that they see it as a power imbalance where one partner is manipulating the other's behavior without their knowledge. That's a red flag in relationships. So, considering all that, the husband is indeed in the wrong because he's using deception to control the situation, which can lead to trust issues and undermine the wife's ability to manage her own time accurately.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
