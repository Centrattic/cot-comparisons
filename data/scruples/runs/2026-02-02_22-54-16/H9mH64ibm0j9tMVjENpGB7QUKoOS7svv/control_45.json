We leave at 7:35 so hitting the snooze button twice (7minutes each) leaves her with 35 minutes to get ready, which has never been enough.\nSo every morning I wake up, set her alarm ahead 13 minutes, leaving me 2 minutes to get the coffee running. She wakes up, gets in the shower. While she is in the shower I go back and set the alarm back to the correct time. For the past 8 or so months she has believed showering, getting dressed and putting on make-up takes her about 15 minutes.\nEvery now and then she comments on how much she has improved with being late. I smile and say yes love you really have.\nSometimes a little white lie can be a good thing. \n\nA lot of people called it controlling/manipulative etc. am I the asshole for doing this? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for lying to his wife about setting her alarm. So, the situation is that he sets her alarm 13 minutes ahead so she thinks she has less time, which helps her be on time. Then he corrects it after she's in the shower.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The husband is manipulating the alarm time without his wife knowing. He's keeping her on a tight schedule to avoid arguments about her being late. The question is whether this is a harmless white lie or something more problematic.\n\nLooking at the responses from the subreddit, people called it controlling or manipulative. That's a sign that others see an issue. The wife isn't aware of the deception, which means her consent isn't involved. Trust is a big part of any relationship, and lying, even for what seems like a good reason, can erode that trust. \n\nThe husband's actions are a form of control. By adjusting the alarm, he's influencing her behavior without her knowledge. While the intention might be to help her avoid being late, the method is deceptive. Even if the outcome is positive (she's on time), the means used are ethically questionable. \n\nAnother angle is autonomy. The wife isn't making her own decisions about her morning routine because she's being misled. She thinks she's improving, but it's actually the manipulated time that's keeping her on track. This could affect her self-perception and independence. \n\nThere's also the aspect of communication. If the husband had talked to his wife about the problem with the snooze button and the timing, they might have found a solution together. Instead, he chose to handle it unilaterally. This approach might prevent arguments in the short term but could lead to bigger issues if the deception were ever discovered. \n\nWhile the husband's intention is to help, the method of deception crosses a line. Relationships require honesty and mutual respect. Manipulating someone's schedule without their knowledge isn't respectful of their autonomy. Even if it's a \"white lie,\" it's still a lie that affects her daily life. \n\nIn conclusion, the husband's actions are ethically wrong because they involve deception and manipulation without the wife's consent. The answer should be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
