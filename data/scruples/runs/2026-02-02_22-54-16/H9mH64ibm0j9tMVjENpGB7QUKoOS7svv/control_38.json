We leave at 7:35 so hitting the snooze button twice (7minutes each) leaves her with 35 minutes to get ready, which has never been enough.\nSo every morning I wake up, set her alarm ahead 13 minutes, leaving me 2 minutes to get the coffee running. She wakes up, gets in the shower. While she is in the shower I go back and set the alarm back to the correct time. For the past 8 or so months she has believed showering, getting dressed and putting on make-up takes her about 15 minutes.\nEvery now and then she comments on how much she has improved with being late. I smile and say yes love you really have.\nSometimes a little white lie can be a good thing. \n\nA lot of people called it controlling/manipulative etc. am I the asshole for doing this? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about lying to their wife by adjusting her alarm time so she doesn't get late. They wake up early, set her alarm ahead by 13 minutes, so she thinks she has 35 minutes to get ready, but actually, she's getting less. The wife thinks she's improved in not being late, but the husband is secretly managing the alarm.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the husband's actions are unethical or manipulative. The key points here are deception and the impact on the relationship. The husband is intentionally misleading his wife about the time she has, which is a form of lying. Even though his intention might be to help her avoid arguments and be punctual, the fact that he's hiding the truth is problematic.\n\nLying in a relationship, even with good intentions, can erode trust. Trust is a fundamental part of any partnership. By not being honest, the husband is not respecting his wife's autonomy. She has the right to know the actual time and make her own decisions about her schedule. The fact that people called him controlling or manipulative makes sense because he's manipulating her environment without her knowledge.\n\nThe husband might argue it's a small lie for a good cause, but the consequences of such deceit could be significant. If the wife found out, she might feel betrayed, even if the outcome (her not being late) is positive. The deception is ongoing, and it's not a one-time thing. Also, the husband is taking credit for her improvement, which isn't entirely true since he's the one adjusting the alarm.\n\nIn ethical terms, the principle of honesty is important. While the intention is good, the action is deceptive. The ends don't necessarily justify the means here. The husband should have communicated the issue with his wife and worked together to solve it, rather than manipulating her perception. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
