We leave at 7:35 so hitting the snooze button twice (7minutes each) leaves her with 35 minutes to get ready, which has never been enough.\nSo every morning I wake up, set her alarm ahead 13 minutes, leaving me 2 minutes to get the coffee running. She wakes up, gets in the shower. While she is in the shower I go back and set the alarm back to the correct time. For the past 8 or so months she has believed showering, getting dressed and putting on make-up takes her about 15 minutes.\nEvery now and then she comments on how much she has improved with being late. I smile and say yes love you really have.\nSometimes a little white lie can be a good thing. \n\nA lot of people called it controlling/manipulative etc. am I the asshole for doing this? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is lying to their wife by setting her alarm 13 minutes ahead so she thinks she has more time. The wife believes she's improved, but actually, the husband is manipulating the time. The main question is whether this makes him the asshole.\n\nFirst, deception is involved here. Even if the intention is to avoid arguments and help her get ready on time, lying can erode trust. The wife isn't aware of the manipulation, so she can't consent to it. That's a problem because honesty is a cornerstone of trust in relationships.\n\nSecond, the husband is taking control of the situation without the wife's knowledge or agreement. While he might see it as a helpful act, it's essentially a covert manipulation. The wife might feel disrespected if she found out, as it undermines her autonomy over her own schedule and decisions.\n\nThird, the scenario mentions that the wife sometimes comments on her improvement, which the husband affirms. This suggests he's not only lying about the alarm but also reinforcing a false narrative, which compounds the deception.\n\nOn the other hand, the husband's intention is to prevent arguments and ensure they leave on time. He's trying to maintain harmony, which is understandable. But the means he used\u2014deception\u2014might be more harmful in the long run. Trust is crucial, and once broken, it's hard to rebuild.\n\nThe responses from the subreddit called him controlling or manipulative, which are serious accusations. Even if the outcome is positive (no arguments, timely departure), the method is ethically questionable. In relationships, transparency is important. If there's a problem with the wife being late, it's better to communicate openly and find a solution together rather than using a lie.\n\nSo considering all these points, the husband is indeed in the wrong because he used deception to manipulate the situation without his partner's knowledge or consent, which is a breach of trust.\n"
