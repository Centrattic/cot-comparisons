We leave at 7:35 so hitting the snooze button twice (7minutes each) leaves her with 35 minutes to get ready, which has never been enough.\nSo every morning I wake up, set her alarm ahead 13 minutes, leaving me 2 minutes to get the coffee running. She wakes up, gets in the shower. While she is in the shower I go back and set the alarm back to the correct time. For the past 8 or so months she has believed showering, getting dressed and putting on make-up takes her about 15 minutes.\nEvery now and then she comments on how much she has improved with being late. I smile and say yes love you really have.\nSometimes a little white lie can be a good thing. \n\nA lot of people called it controlling/manipulative etc. am I the asshole for doing this? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the story is in the wrong. The situation is that the husband sets his wife's alarm ahead by 13 minutes every day so she thinks she has 35 minutes to get ready, when actually she only has 22 minutes. He does this to avoid arguments about her being late. He then lies to her when she comments on improving her punctuality.\n\nSo, first, is this a harmless little trick or something more problematic? The key points here are deception and manipulation. The husband is intentionally misleading his wife about the time she has to prepare each morning. Even though his intention is to reduce arguments, the method involves lying. \n\nDeception in relationships can be tricky. Some might say it's a small white lie that helps their daily routine. Others might see it as controlling because he's making decisions for her without her knowledge. If the wife thought she was improving when she wasn't, that could lead to a lack of trust if she found out. Also, not being honest about such a regular issue might erode trust over time.\n\nThe original post mentions that other people called it controlling or manipulative. The husband's actions are keeping his wife in the dark about her actual time, which could be seen as undermining her autonomy. Even if there's no malicious intent, the act of lying repeatedly is still a form of dishonesty that could harm the relationship.\n\nSo considering these points, the consensus might lean towards the author being in the wrong because the deception, while perhaps well-intentioned, is not transparent and could be harmful in the long run. The correct answer would be A.\n"
