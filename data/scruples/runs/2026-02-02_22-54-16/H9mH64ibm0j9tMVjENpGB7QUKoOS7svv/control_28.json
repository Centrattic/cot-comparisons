We leave at 7:35 so hitting the snooze button twice (7minutes each) leaves her with 35 minutes to get ready, which has never been enough.\nSo every morning I wake up, set her alarm ahead 13 minutes, leaving me 2 minutes to get the coffee running. She wakes up, gets in the shower. While she is in the shower I go back and set the alarm back to the correct time. For the past 8 or so months she has believed showering, getting dressed and putting on make-up takes her about 15 minutes.\nEvery now and then she comments on how much she has improved with being late. I smile and say yes love you really have.\nSometimes a little white lie can be a good thing. \n\nA lot of people called it controlling/manipulative etc. am I the asshole for doing this? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if they're the asshole for lying to their wife by setting her alarm ahead. So, the situation is they both drive to work, and the wife used to be late. The husband wakes up early, sets her alarm 13 minutes ahead so she has more time, then fixes it after she showers. The wife thinks her routine takes 15 minutes, but actually, the adjusted alarm gives her enough time. The husband admits to lying and making her feel like she's improving when she isn't really. People called it controlling or manipulative.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about honesty and consent in a relationship. The husband is altering her alarm without her knowledge, which is a form of deception. Even if the intention is good\u2014trying to prevent arguments and ensure they leave on time\u2014it's done without her consent. The wife isn't aware of the manipulation, which means she's not making an informed choice about her morning routine. \n\nIn relationships, trust is important. Lying, even small ones, can erode that trust. The husband might think it's a harmless lie, but it's a lie that affects his wife's autonomy. She's not in control of her schedule; he's making decisions for her under the guise of helping. This could be seen as controlling because he's manipulating her perception of her own efficiency. \n\nAlso, the husband is taking credit for things he didn't actually do (her being less late). That could lead to resentment if she ever finds out. Even if there are no arguments now, the underlying issue of dishonesty is a problem. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the husband is trying to solve a practical problem without conflict. But there are better ways to handle it. Maybe they could have had a conversation about her alarm habits and found a compromise. Instead of lying, he could have encouraged her to adjust her routine or set her own alarm correctly. \n\nSo, considering all that, the husband's actions are deceptive and undermine the wife's autonomy. Therefore, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
