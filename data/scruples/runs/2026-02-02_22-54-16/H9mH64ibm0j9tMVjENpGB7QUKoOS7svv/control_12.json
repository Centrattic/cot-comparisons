We leave at 7:35 so hitting the snooze button twice (7minutes each) leaves her with 35 minutes to get ready, which has never been enough.\nSo every morning I wake up, set her alarm ahead 13 minutes, leaving me 2 minutes to get the coffee running. She wakes up, gets in the shower. While she is in the shower I go back and set the alarm back to the correct time. For the past 8 or so months she has believed showering, getting dressed and putting on make-up takes her about 15 minutes.\nEvery now and then she comments on how much she has improved with being late. I smile and say yes love you really have.\nSometimes a little white lie can be a good thing. \n\nA lot of people called it controlling/manipulative etc. am I the asshole for doing this? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for lying to his wife by setting her alarm ahead. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The husband and wife drive to work together. The wife used to be late because of her snooze button. The husband wakes up earlier, sets her alarm 13 minutes ahead, so she thinks she has 35 minutes to get ready. He does this so she can get ready without being late. When she notices she's improved, he lies and agrees.\n\nNow, the key points here are: deception, manipulation, and the impact. The husband isn't telling his wife the truth about the alarm time. He's altering her perception of how much time she has. Even though his intention is good (to help her be on time), the method involves lying and possibly manipulating her routine without her consent.\n\nPeople might argue that it's controlling because he's making decisions for her without her knowledge. The wife's autonomy is being compromised. Also, if she had known the truth, maybe she could have adjusted her routine differently. The husband's actions prevent her from understanding her actual time constraints. \n\nOn the other hand, the husband's motive is to reduce arguments and help her be on time, which seems positive. But the means of deception could be problematic. Lying, even if with good intentions, can erode trust. If the wife found out, she might feel betrayed. Also, the fact that he continues to lie and agree with her false perception of improvement shows he's aware it's a lie.\n\nMost people in the comments called it controlling or manipulative. While the outcome is positive (she's on time), the method is ethically questionable. Trust is a cornerstone in a relationship, and deception can damage that. Even small lies can have bigger consequences if discovered. \n\nSo, considering all these factors, the husband is manipulating his wife's schedule without her knowledge, which is a breach of trust. Therefore, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
