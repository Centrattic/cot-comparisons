We leave at 7:35 so hitting the snooze button twice (7minutes each) leaves her with 35 minutes to get ready, which has never been enough.\nSo every morning I wake up, set her alarm ahead 13 minutes, leaving me 2 minutes to get the coffee running. She wakes up, gets in the shower. While she is in the shower I go back and set the alarm back to the correct time. For the past 8 or so months she has believed showering, getting dressed and putting on make-up takes her about 15 minutes.\nEvery now and then she comments on how much she has improved with being late. I smile and say yes love you really have.\nSometimes a little white lie can be a good thing. \n\nA lot of people called it controlling/manipulative etc. am I the asshole for doing this? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation carefully.\n\nThe author is a husband who's been setting his wife's alarm clock ahead by 13 minutes every morning. The reason given is that his wife tends to oversleep because of the snooze button. By setting the alarm forward, he gives her more time to get ready without her realizing it. He then resets the clock back later. The wife thinks she's only taking 15 minutes to get ready, but actually has 35 minutes because of the adjusted alarm. He's been doing this for 8 months and sometimes lies to her about her improvement in not being late. \n\nNow, the key question is whether this is wrong. The author argues that it's a \"little white lie\" and that it's beneficial because it prevents arguments about being late. However, others called it controlling or manipulative. \n\nFirst, I should consider the ethical implications. The main issue here is deception. The wife isn't aware that her alarm is being altered, and she's being misled about the time she actually takes. While the intention might be good (avoiding arguments and helping her be on time), deception can erode trust in a relationship. Even if the outcome is positive, the method involves lying and manipulating her perception.\n\nAnother angle is consent. The wife hasn't agreed to this arrangement. If the husband had discussed the problem and found a mutual solution, like adjusting the alarm together or changing their routines, it might be different. But doing it secretly without her knowledge could be seen as undermining her autonomy. \n\nAlso, the husband is lying about her improvement. Even though she's actually improving, he's not being truthful about the reason for the improvement. This could lead to her making incorrect assumptions about her own behavior, which might affect her self-perception or future habits if the deception were discovered. \n\nHowever, some might argue that the husband's actions are a kind gesture, trying to help his wife and reduce daily stress. The arguments about being late might be a bigger problem, and without this, the couple could have more conflict. But again, the means of achieving that peace (deception) could be problematic. \n\nIn relationships, transparency and honesty are usually valued. Even small lies can have consequences if they become a pattern or if discovered later. The wife might feel betrayed upon finding out, which could lead to more significant issues than the original problem. \n\nSo, while the intention is to help, the method involves manipulation and deception. The author isn't considering his wife's autonomy and is making decisions for her without her consent. Therefore, the answer is likely that he is in the wrong.\n"
