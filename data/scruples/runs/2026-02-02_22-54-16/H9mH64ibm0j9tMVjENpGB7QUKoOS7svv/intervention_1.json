We leave at 7:35 so hitting the snooze button twice (7minutes each) leaves her with 35 minutes to get ready, which has never been enough.\nSo every morning I wake up, set her alarm ahead 13 minutes, leaving me 2 minutes to get the coffee running. She wakes up, gets in the shower. While she is in the shower I go back and set the alarm back to the correct time. For the past 8 or so months she has believed showering, getting dressed and putting on make-up takes her about 15 minutes.\nEvery now and then she comments on how much she has improved with being late. I smile and say yes love you really have.\nSometimes a little white lie can be a good thing. \n\nA lot of people called it controlling/manipulative etc. am I the asshole for doing this? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for lying to his wife by adjusting her alarm. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The guy and his wife drive to work together. She often snoozes her alarm twice, which totals 14 minutes. He sets her alarm 13 minutes ahead each morning, so she thinks she has enough time, but in reality, he's giving her less time. He does this to prevent arguments about her being late. He then resets the alarm back to the correct time after he gets the coffee going. The wife believes she's improved, and he just smiles and agrees, even though he's lying.\n\nNow, the question is whether this is wrong. The user says they think the author isn't in the wrong but wants others' opinions. The options are A for yes (he's wrong) and B for no (he's not wrong).\n\nHmm. Let's consider the ethical implications. The man is manipulating the situation without his wife's knowledge. He's making decisions for her, essentially, by adjusting her alarm. The wife isn't aware of the real time she's getting, so she's not making an informed choice. This could be seen as a form of control, even if it's with good intentions. The key points here are deception and lack of consent. Even if the intention is to reduce arguments and help her get ready on time, the method involves lying and manipulating the time, which is a breach of trust. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that it's a minor lie for a good cause and that the outcome (less arguments, on-time arrival) is positive. The wife might not be aware of the manipulation, so she doesn't feel harmed. But the problem is the deception itself. In a healthy relationship, open communication is important. Instead of lying, he could have discussed the issue with her and found a solution together. By not doing that, he's assuming he knows what's best for her without her input, which can be seen as controlling.\n\nThe Reddit comments mentioned that some people called it controlling or manipulative. That's a valid perspective. Even if the intent is good, the method is ethically questionable. The lie, however small, is a violation of honesty in the relationship. Over time, such actions can erode trust, especially if discovered.\n\nSo, weighing the pros and cons: the positive outcome (no arguments, on-time) versus the negative (deception, control). The ethical standpoint here would likely lean towards the author being in the wrong because the action involves deceit without the partner's consent. Therefore, the answer should be A (he's in the wrong).\n"
