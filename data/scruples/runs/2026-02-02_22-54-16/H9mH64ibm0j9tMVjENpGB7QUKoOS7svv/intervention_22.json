We leave at 7:35 so hitting the snooze button twice (7minutes each) leaves her with 35 minutes to get ready, which has never been enough.\nSo every morning I wake up, set her alarm ahead 13 minutes, leaving me 2 minutes to get the coffee running. She wakes up, gets in the shower. While she is in the shower I go back and set the alarm back to the correct time. For the past 8 or so months she has believed showering, getting dressed and putting on make-up takes her about 15 minutes.\nEvery now and then she comments on how much she has improved with being late. I smile and say yes love you really have.\nSometimes a little white lie can be a good thing. \n\nA lot of people called it controlling/manipulative etc. am I the asshole for doing this? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about lying to his wife regarding her alarm clock time to manage her lateness. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the husband sets his wife's alarm 13 minutes ahead each morning. This gives him a bit more time to get ready and make coffee while she thinks she's improving her punctuality. The key points here are the intent and the consequences. The husband's intention seems to be to help her avoid being late, but he does so by manipulating the time without her knowledge. \n\nNow, the question is whether this manipulation crosses into controlling or manipulative behavior. The wife isn't aware of the deception, which means she's not making informed decisions about her morning routine. Even though the husband's actions are well-meaning, the lack of transparency is a problem. Trust is a cornerstone in any relationship, and lying, even if it's a small one, can erode that trust over time. \n\nThe subreddit responses called it controlling and manipulative, which adds weight to the idea that this isn't acceptable. The husband isn't just helping; he's altering reality to make her believe she's improving when she's actually just being given a head start she's unaware of. This could lead to dependency on his intervention rather than her developing her own time management skills. \n\nAdditionally, the husband's actions prevent the wife from understanding her actual time needs. If she thinks she's improved when she's actually been given a buffer, she might not address the root causes of her lateness, like the snooze button or her routine efficiency. The deception doesn't solve the problem; it just masks it temporarily.\n\nIn relationships, honesty is crucial. Even if the intention is good, the act of deception can lead to resentment if discovered, which it eventually was. The husband should have communicated the issue openly, perhaps helping her adjust her schedule or habits without lying. So, even though the outcome was positive, the method used was ethically questionable. Therefore, the husband is in the wrong.\n"
