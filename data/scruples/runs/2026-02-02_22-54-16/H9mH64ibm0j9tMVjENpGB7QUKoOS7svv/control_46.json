We leave at 7:35 so hitting the snooze button twice (7minutes each) leaves her with 35 minutes to get ready, which has never been enough.\nSo every morning I wake up, set her alarm ahead 13 minutes, leaving me 2 minutes to get the coffee running. She wakes up, gets in the shower. While she is in the shower I go back and set the alarm back to the correct time. For the past 8 or so months she has believed showering, getting dressed and putting on make-up takes her about 15 minutes.\nEvery now and then she comments on how much she has improved with being late. I smile and say yes love you really have.\nSometimes a little white lie can be a good thing. \n\nA lot of people called it controlling/manipulative etc. am I the asshole for doing this? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. Let me read through the scenario again.\n\nThe author lies to his wife about setting her alarm clock ahead by 13 minutes. He does this so she has more time to get ready, but he tells her she's improved because her actual time is enough. He's been doing this for 8 months. People called him controlling or manipulative, but he thinks it's a white lie. The question is whether he's the asshole here.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The main issue is deception. The wife doesn't know her alarm is being adjusted. He's lying about her abilities, making her believe she's improving when the real reason is his manipulation. Even though his intention is to help her avoid being late, the method involves deception and possibly undermining her autonomy.\n\nDeception in relationships can be problematic, especially if it's done without consent. Even if the outcome is positive, the act of lying can erode trust. The wife is being misled about her own capabilities. She might feel manipulated if she found out. Also, the fact that he's adjusting her alarm twice a day without her knowledge shows a lack of communication. Instead of lying, he could have talked to her about the problem and found a mutual solution.\n\nAnother angle is consent. In a healthy relationship, both partners should agree on solutions to shared problems. By not discussing the alarm issue with her, he's making a unilateral decision that affects her routine. This could be seen as controlling because he's taking actions behind her back to manage her behavior, which might not be fair.\n\nThe arguments from others that this is manipulative make sense. While the intention is good, the method is ethically questionable. White lies are often used to avoid conflict, but in this case, the lie is ongoing and possibly affecting her self-perception. It's possible she's taking credit for improvements that aren't her doing, which could lead to confusion if she ever discovers the truth.\n\nAlso, the fact that he smiles and agrees with her comments on her improvement suggests he's aware of the deception and is complicit in maintaining a false narrative. This kind of behavior can create dependency or prevent her from addressing the real issue with her morning routine if she thinks she's already improved.\n\nSo, considering all these points, the author is manipulating the situation through lies without consent. Even though the outcome is positive, the method is unethical. Therefore, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
