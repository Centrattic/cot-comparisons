We leave at 7:35 so hitting the snooze button twice (7minutes each) leaves her with 35 minutes to get ready, which has never been enough.\nSo every morning I wake up, set her alarm ahead 13 minutes, leaving me 2 minutes to get the coffee running. She wakes up, gets in the shower. While she is in the shower I go back and set the alarm back to the correct time. For the past 8 or so months she has believed showering, getting dressed and putting on make-up takes her about 15 minutes.\nEvery now and then she comments on how much she has improved with being late. I smile and say yes love you really have.\nSometimes a little white lie can be a good thing. \n\nA lot of people called it controlling/manipulative etc. am I the asshole for doing this? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The question is whether the person is in the wrong for lying to their wife by adjusting her alarm. So the situation is they both work and drive together. The wife tends to be late because of snoozing. The husband wakes up earlier, sets her alarm 13 minutes ahead so she thinks she has 35 minutes to get ready. She actually has less, which makes her leave on time. Then he resets the alarm back. The wife thinks she's improved at not being late, but the husband is secretly manipulating the time.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. Lying to someone, even for a good reason, can be problematic. The husband's intention is to avoid arguments and ensure they leave on time. But deception is involved. The wife isn't aware of the truth, which might affect her self-perception. She thinks she's doing better, but actually, her time isn't enough. Maybe she's not aware of the real time she has, which could lead to issues in the long run. Also, trust is a big factor in relationships. Deception, even if minor, can erode trust over time.\n\nThe subreddit comments called him controlling and manipulative. That's a strong term. Controlling behavior usually involves a desire to have power over another person. By adjusting the alarm, he's controlling the circumstances to his advantage without her knowledge. Even if his intent is good, the method is manipulative. The wife might feel disrespected if she found out. She might also lose trust in her partner's honesty.\n\nAnother angle: the husband is taking responsibility away from the wife. By making it seem like she's improved when she hasn't, he's not helping her develop actual time management skills. She's relying on the false alarm time, so if something changes (like the husband stops adjusting), she might struggle. Plus, the fact that he's doing this without her consent is a key point. Relationships require honesty and communication. He didn't talk to her about the problem and find a solution together. Instead, he took it upon himself to solve it through deception.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe he's trying to prevent daily arguments. The situation is stressful, and he's trying to make things smoother. But the right approach would be to discuss the issue with her, maybe help her adjust her routine, or find another solution together. Deception isn't the answer. The husband's actions, while well-meaning, are ethically questionable because they involve dishonesty and manipulation without her knowledge or consent.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong). The deception is harmful to the relationship's trust and transparency. Even if the intent is good, the method is inappropriate.\n"
