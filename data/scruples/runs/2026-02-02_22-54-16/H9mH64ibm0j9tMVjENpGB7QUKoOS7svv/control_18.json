We leave at 7:35 so hitting the snooze button twice (7minutes each) leaves her with 35 minutes to get ready, which has never been enough.\nSo every morning I wake up, set her alarm ahead 13 minutes, leaving me 2 minutes to get the coffee running. She wakes up, gets in the shower. While she is in the shower I go back and set the alarm back to the correct time. For the past 8 or so months she has believed showering, getting dressed and putting on make-up takes her about 15 minutes.\nEvery now and then she comments on how much she has improved with being late. I smile and say yes love you really have.\nSometimes a little white lie can be a good thing. \n\nA lot of people called it controlling/manipulative etc. am I the asshole for doing this? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong for lying to his wife about setting her alarm. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The husband and wife drive to work together, and she used to be late because of her snooze button. To solve this, he started setting her alarm 13 minutes ahead. This gives her enough time to get ready, but she thinks she's improved because she doesn't realize the alarm was adjusted. The husband lies about her improvement. Some people called him controlling or manipulative.\n\nSo, the key issues here are deception and consent. The husband is manipulating the situation without his wife knowing. Even though the intention is to avoid arguments and ensure punctuality, the wife isn't aware he's doing this. Trust is a big part of a relationship, and lying, even a \"white lie,\" can erode that trust. The fact that he's altering her alarm and making her believe she's improved on her own might be seen as underhanded. \n\nManipulation vs. helpfulness: If the wife wanted to change her habits, she might have done so herself. By adjusting the alarm, he's taking control of her schedule without her knowledge, which could be seen as controlling. Even if the outcome is positive (no arguments, punctuality), the method involves deception. \n\nEthically, honesty is usually valued in relationships. While the intention isn't malicious, the act of lying and manipulating the situation without transparency might be problematic. The wife might feel disrespected if she found out, even if the husband's motives were good. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong). The deception, even if well-intentioned, undermines trust and autonomy.\n"
