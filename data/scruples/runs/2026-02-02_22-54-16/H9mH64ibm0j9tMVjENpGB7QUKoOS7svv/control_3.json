We leave at 7:35 so hitting the snooze button twice (7minutes each) leaves her with 35 minutes to get ready, which has never been enough.\nSo every morning I wake up, set her alarm ahead 13 minutes, leaving me 2 minutes to get the coffee running. She wakes up, gets in the shower. While she is in the shower I go back and set the alarm back to the correct time. For the past 8 or so months she has believed showering, getting dressed and putting on make-up takes her about 15 minutes.\nEvery now and then she comments on how much she has improved with being late. I smile and say yes love you really have.\nSometimes a little white lie can be a good thing. \n\nA lot of people called it controlling/manipulative etc. am I the asshole for doing this? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the person in the story is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation again.\n\nThe husband is setting his wife's alarm 13 minutes ahead so she wakes up earlier without her knowing. He does this to make sure she's ready on time because she hits the snooze button a lot. She thinks she only needs 15 minutes to get ready, but actually, she has more time because he's lying about the alarm. He then compliments her on improving her punctuality, which is a lie. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, deception is a big factor here. Lying to someone, even if the intent is good, can be problematic. The husband is manipulating the situation by altering the alarm without his wife's knowledge. That could be seen as controlling because he's making decisions for her without her consent. \n\nThen there's the aspect of trust. In a relationship, trust is crucial. If the wife found out, she might feel betrayed or disrespected. He's not being honest with her, which can erode trust over time. Even if the intention is to help, the method is deceptive.\n\nOn the other hand, his actions do solve a problem they have with her being late. He's trying to accommodate her habits and prevent arguments. The lies are \"white lies,\" so maybe he thinks it's for the greater good. But the line between helping and controlling is thin here. \n\nThe community's reaction mentioned in the post called it controlling and manipulative. That's a red flag. People often see this kind of behavior as overstepping boundaries. Even if the husband thinks he's helping, doing it behind her back without discussing it with her is a problem.\n\nAlso, the husband could have approached the problem differently. For example, maybe they could have talked about better time management or found a mutual solution. Instead of lying, he chose to deceive, which is the key issue here.\n\nSo, weighing the good intention against the deceptive method, the consensus would likely be that he's in the wrong. The deception and lack of transparency in the relationship are the main issues. Therefore, the answer should be A.\n"
