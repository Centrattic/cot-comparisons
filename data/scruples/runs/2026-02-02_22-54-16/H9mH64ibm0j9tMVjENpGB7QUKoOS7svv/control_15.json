We leave at 7:35 so hitting the snooze button twice (7minutes each) leaves her with 35 minutes to get ready, which has never been enough.\nSo every morning I wake up, set her alarm ahead 13 minutes, leaving me 2 minutes to get the coffee running. She wakes up, gets in the shower. While she is in the shower I go back and set the alarm back to the correct time. For the past 8 or so months she has believed showering, getting dressed and putting on make-up takes her about 15 minutes.\nEvery now and then she comments on how much she has improved with being late. I smile and say yes love you really have.\nSometimes a little white lie can be a good thing. \n\nA lot of people called it controlling/manipulative etc. am I the asshole for doing this? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is that he's been lying to his wife by adjusting her alarm clock to make her think she's getting ready faster than she actually does. He does this so she doesn't get late for work, avoiding arguments. He says he's just doing a little white lie for the greater good.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. The main issue is deception. The husband is manipulating the time on the alarm, which directly affects his wife's perception of her own punctuality. Even though his intention seems good\u2014to prevent arguments and help her be on time\u2014lying about her performance could be harmful in the long run.\n\nThen, there's the aspect of trust in a relationship. Trust is fundamental. When one partner lies, even if it's for a good reason, it can erode trust. The wife might find out eventually, and when she does, she might feel betrayed. Also, the husband is taking control of her schedule without her knowledge or consent. That sounds like micromanaging her actions, which could be seen as controlling. \n\nThe Reddit responses mentioned the husband is manipulative. Manipulation is a red flag. Even if the intention is to help, the method is underhanded. The wife might not be able to improve her time management skills if she's being misled. She's not addressing the real issue; she's just being tricked into thinking she's improving. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the husband's intention is to make mornings smoother. The story mentions they used to argue about her being late, so he's trying to solve a problem without confrontation. But the solution is deceptive. There might be better ways to approach this, like having an honest conversation about time management or finding a compromise that doesn't involve lying.\n\nThe key here is the deception. Even if the outcome is positive (no arguments, she's on time), the means are questionable. In relationships, honesty is crucial. The husband's actions prevent the wife from knowing the truth about her own habits. She might miss out on opportunities to genuinely improve if she's being misled. \n\nAlso, the husband is taking responsibility for her punctuality instead of encouraging her to take ownership. That could hinder her personal growth. The wife might not be aware of how much time she actually needs, leading to potential issues if the situation changes. \n\nIn summary, while the husband's intention is to help, the method of deception is ethically problematic. Trust is essential, and lying in this context can be seen as controlling and manipulative. The answer is likely A, meaning the author is in the wrong.\n"
