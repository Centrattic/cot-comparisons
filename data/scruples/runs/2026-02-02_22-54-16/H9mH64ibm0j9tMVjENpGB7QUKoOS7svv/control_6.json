We leave at 7:35 so hitting the snooze button twice (7minutes each) leaves her with 35 minutes to get ready, which has never been enough.\nSo every morning I wake up, set her alarm ahead 13 minutes, leaving me 2 minutes to get the coffee running. She wakes up, gets in the shower. While she is in the shower I go back and set the alarm back to the correct time. For the past 8 or so months she has believed showering, getting dressed and putting on make-up takes her about 15 minutes.\nEvery now and then she comments on how much she has improved with being late. I smile and say yes love you really have.\nSometimes a little white lie can be a good thing. \n\nA lot of people called it controlling/manipulative etc. am I the asshole for doing this? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong. The situation is that the husband is setting his wife's alarm 13 minutes ahead every morning so she thinks she has 35 minutes to get ready, when in reality she only has 22 minutes. He does this to avoid arguments about her being late, and he lies to her about her improvement. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points here. The husband's intention is to prevent arguments by making his wife think she's managing her time better than she actually is. The method involves deception\u2014changing the alarm time without her knowledge. The question is whether this manipulation is wrong.\n\nOn one hand, the husband's actions are aimed at reducing conflict and ensuring they leave on time. He's trying to make his wife's life easier by adjusting the alarm, and she doesn't realize the deception. On the other hand, deception in a relationship can be problematic. Even if the intent is good, lying can erode trust. The wife is being misled about her own abilities and the actual time she has. \n\nThe term \"white lie\" is used here, which typically refers to a small, harmless untruth meant to avoid hurting someone's feelings. However, this isn't just a one-off lie. It's a sustained deception that affects the wife's daily routine. The husband is manipulating the situation to maintain a false perception, which might not be harmless in the long run. \n\nSome people might argue that it's a kind gesture, trying to help her without confrontation. But others see it as controlling because he's making decisions for her without her knowledge or consent. The wife's autonomy is being compromised. She might change her behavior based on the wrong information, which could lead to issues if she ever discovers the deception. \n\nAlso, the fact that he's lying about her improvement is another layer. Instead of addressing the root issue\u2014like discussing her snoozing habits or time management\u2014he's using a workaround that involves dishonesty. A more transparent approach, like communicating the problem and finding a solution together, would be healthier for the relationship. \n\nThe key here is the ethical aspect of deception in a relationship. While the husband's intentions are good, the method he uses crosses into manipulative territory. Trust is fundamental in relationships, and even small lies can have negative consequences. The wife has a right to know the truth about her schedule and her own time management, even if it's uncomfortable. \n\nIn conclusion, the author is likely in the wrong because the deception, despite good intentions, undermines trust and respects the wife's autonomy. The correct answer would be A.\n"
