      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person in the AITA (Am I the Asshole?) scenario is in the wrong. Let me start by reading the situation carefully.\n\nThe user says they and their wife drive to work together because their workplaces are close. They used to argue a lot about her being late. He wakes up at 6:30 to get ready, and she's supposed to wake up at 6:45. But she uses the snooze button twice, each for 7 minutes, so that would make her real wake-up time around 6:59. He claims that this gives her 35 minutes to get ready, but she's never had enough time. To solve this, he lies by setting her alarm 13 minutes ahead (so it goes off at 6:45 + 13 = 7:00?), which makes her think she has 35 minutes when actually she has 35 -13 = 22 minutes? Wait, maybe I need to check the math again.\n\nWait, original plan: He gets up at 6:30, she at 6:45. They leave at 7:35. So the user gets up early to get coffee going, and she gets up at 6:45 but hits snooze twice for 7 minutes each. So first alarm is at 6:45, then snooze to 6:52, then 6:59. So she actually gets up at 6:59. The time between when she wakes up and when they leave is 7:35 - 6:59 = 36 minutes. But he says she has 35 minutes. Hmm, maybe the exact numbers are not the main issue here. The key is that he's lying to her by adjusting the alarm clock to make her think she has less time than she actually does, so she doesn't hit snooze as much, or so he can have more time for coffee. \n\nThe user claims that she thinks her routine takes about 15 minutes because of the adjusted alarm. They then sometimes leave her with 35 minutes (original plan) but she uses 36 minutes (because of snoozing) and ends up leaving on time. He's lying about her improving, which he says is a \"little white lie.\" But others called him controlling and manipulative. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, let's consider intent. The user's intention is to avoid arguments and ensure they leave on time. He's trying to help his wife by making her believe she has less time, so she doesn't snooze as much. Wait, but actually he's setting the alarm ahead, so when she hits snooze twice, she ends up waking up later than the original 6:45? Or is he adjusting the alarm to an earlier time? Wait, the original setup is that she sets her alarm for 6:45, but hits snooze twice. So the real time she wakes up is 6:45 + 14 minutes (two 7-minute snoozes) = 7:00. They leave at 7:35. So normally, she has from 7:00 until 7:35, which is 35 minutes to get ready. But he says she's never had enough time. So to fix that, he sets her alarm ahead 13 minutes. So when her alarm goes off, it shows 6:45 + 13 = 7:00. So she thinks the alarm is set for a later time, but in reality, it's set for 6:45. Wait, no. Wait, the user is setting her alarm ahead by 13 minutes. Let me think again. If the actual time is 6:45, but he sets the alarm ahead by 13 minutes, does that mean the alarm is at 6:45 +13 = 7:00, but she thinks it's set for 6:45? Because if the alarm is set ahead, maybe he's changing the displayed time to make her think it's 7:00 when it's actually 6:45. That way, when she hits snooze, the next alarm would be earlier. Wait, this is confusing. Let me parse the original statement again.\n\nOriginal scenario: The user sets her alarm ahead 13 minutes. So if she's supposed to get up at 6:45, he sets her alarm to show 7:00 instead. She then hits snooze twice, which are 7 minutes each, so she thinks she's waking up at 7:00, snoozes to 7:07, then 7:14. But the real time she's waking up is 6:45 + 13 = 7:00's actual time? Wait, no. The user is setting her alarm ahead by 13 minutes. So if the actual time is 6:45, he changes her phone's clock to show 6:45 +13 = 7:00. So when the alarm goes off, she thinks it's 7:00, but it's actually 6:45. Then she hits snooze twice, which would take 7 minutes each, so she snoozes to 7:07 (which is 6:45 + 13 +7= 6:65+7= 7:10?), wait, maybe I'm getting the math wrong. Let's try again.\n\nIf the user wants her to wake up at 6:45, but she hits snooze twice, adding 14 minutes, making her actual waking time 7:00. So normally, she has 35 minutes from 6:45 to 7:35, but because of snoozing, she only has 35 minutes from 7:00 to 7:35. But he claims that this never is enough. Wait, but in the scenario, he says she gets up at 6:45, but hits snooze twice (7 minutes each) leaving her with 35 minutes. Wait, maybe the total time between when her alarm first goes off and when they leave is 6:45 to 7:35, which is 50 minutes, but with two snoozes, she ends up with 50 - 14 = 36 minutes. So he says she's never had enough time. But by setting her alarm ahead 13 minutes, he's making her think the alarm is going off at an earlier time. Let me try to model the time steps.\n\nOriginal plan (without lying):\n\n- User wakes up at 6:30.\n- Sets his own alarm at 6:45 for his wife. She hits snooze twice, so she actually wakes up at 6:45 + 7 +7 = 7:00.\n- They leave at 7:35.\n- So wife has from 7:00 to 7:35 to get ready, which is 35 minutes. But the user says she's never had enough time.\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense. If she has 35 minutes from when she wakes up, but the user says that's not enough. So he lies by setting her alarm 13 minutes ahead. Let's see how that works.\n\nWhen he sets the alarm ahead by 13 minutes, the actual alarm time is 6:45, but he makes the clock show 7:00 (6:45 +13). So when the alarm goes off, the clock shows 7:00. She hits snooze twice, which are 7 minutes each. So the next alarm would go off at 7:07 (per the clock), but the actual time is 6:45 +7 = 6:52. Then the next snooze would be 7:14 (clock time), which is 6:45 +7+7= 6:59. So she thinks she's waking up at 7:14 (clock time), which would be 6:59 real time. They leave at 7:35. So the time she has to get ready is 7:35 -7:14 = 21 minutes (from clock time) but real time is 6:59 to 7:35, which is 36 minutes. Wait, but the user says she believes she has 35 minutes. So maybe the math is off here. Maybe the adjusted alarm is set to 6:45 -13 = 6:32, but that doesn't fit the description. The user says he sets her alarm ahead 13 minutes. So perhaps the clock is manipulated. For example, if he changes her phone's time to be 13 minutes ahead. So when her alarm is set to 6:45 (on the manipulated clock), the actual time is 6:45 -13 minutes = 6:32. Then she hits snooze twice, so she thinks she has to get up at 6:45 (on the clock), but it's actually 6:32. Then the next snooze would be 7:00 (clock time), which is 6:47 real time. Then the next one is 7:07 (clock), which is 6:54 real. Then she gets up at 7:14 (clock time) which is 7:01 real. They leave at 7:35 real time. So from when she actually wakes up (7:01) to when they leave (7:35) is 34 minutes. But she believes her shower, getting dressed, etc., takes 15 minutes. Wait, but the user is making her think she has 35 minutes (from 6:45 to 7:35 on the clock) but in reality, she has from 6:32 to 7:35, which is 63 minutes. But maybe I'm miscalculating. This part is a bit confusing. Perhaps the main point is that he's altering the alarm clock so that she perceives her time differently, leading her to believe she's improving when in fact he's manipulating the system.\n\nNow, the ethical aspects. The user is lying to his wife by adjusting the alarm clock. The wife is unaware she's being manipulated. The user is making her think she's becoming more punctual, which he says is a \"little white lie.\" But others called him controlling and manipulative. \n\nIs this a kind act or a manipulative one? On the surface, he's trying to help her avoid being late, which is a common problem. However, the method he uses involves deception. Lying to someone, even if the intent is good, can be problematic because it undermines trust. The wife might feel betrayed if she finds out, even if the intention was to help. Also, the user is taking control of her device and manipulating the time, which could be seen as an invasion of privacy or autonomy. \n\nIn relationships, honesty and open communication are usually valued. Instead of lying, a better approach might have been to communicate the problem and find a solution together. For example, maybe setting the alarm correctly and convincing her that she needs to stop snoozing, or agreeing on a later departure time. By lying and adjusting the alarm, the user is not addressing the root issue but instead creating a false perception. This could lead to dependency or the wife not realizing she has a problem with time management. \n\nThe response from the community (other users calling him controlling/manipulative) suggests that this behavior is not seen as a minor transgression. Even if the intention is good, the act of deception and manipulation could be considered wrong. Controlling behavior often involves underhanded tactics to influence someone without their consent. \n\nSo, putting it all together: The user's actions involve deception and manipulation under the guise of helping. The wife's autonomy is compromised because she's not making an informed decision. The potential harm (if she found out) could include feeling disrespected or like her partner is not truthful. Therefore, the author is in the wrong, so the answer is A.\n"
