We leave at 7:35 so hitting the snooze button twice (7minutes each) leaves her with 35 minutes to get ready, which has never been enough.\nSo every morning I wake up, set her alarm ahead 13 minutes, leaving me 2 minutes to get the coffee running. She wakes up, gets in the shower. While she is in the shower I go back and set the alarm back to the correct time. For the past 8 or so months she has believed showering, getting dressed and putting on make-up takes her about 15 minutes.\nEvery now and then she comments on how much she has improved with being late. I smile and say yes love you really have.\nSometimes a little white lie can be a good thing. \n\nA lot of people called it controlling/manipulative etc. am I the asshole for doing this? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. The situation is that they've been setting their wife's alarm clock ahead by 13 minutes every morning so she thinks she has 35 minutes to get ready, but actually, she has less. They do this to prevent her from being late, and when she comments on improving, they lie and agree. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The main issue is deception. The husband is lying about the time, which affects his wife's perception of her morning routine. Even if the intention is good\u2014trying to avoid arguments and ensure they leave on time\u2014lying can be a problem in a relationship. \n\nTrust is a big factor here. If one partner is consistently lying, even about something as small as the alarm time, it can erode trust. The wife might feel manipulated if she finds out, which could lead to bigger issues. Also, the husband's actions might be seen as controlling because he's adjusting her alarm without her knowledge or consent. \n\nAnother angle is consent. The wife hasn't agreed to this arrangement. She's under the impression that her time management is improving when it's actually the alarm that's being manipulated. This lack of transparency might be seen as respecting her autonomy. \n\nThe husband's justification is that it's a \"white lie\" that helps avoid arguments. But relationships should ideally be built on honesty. Even small deceptions can have consequences. If the wife discovers the truth, she might feel betrayed, which could damage the relationship more than the original issue of being late.\n\nPeople's reactions on the subreddit called it controlling and manipulative. That's a red flag. While intentions matter, the impact of the action is also important. The husband's solution to a problem (her being late) is to deceive her rather than address the root cause, like discussing time management strategies openly.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the husband's actions cross a line into deceit without the wife's knowledge or consent. Even if the outcome is positive (they leave on time), the method is ethically questionable. Therefore, the answer is likely that the author is in the wrong.\n"
