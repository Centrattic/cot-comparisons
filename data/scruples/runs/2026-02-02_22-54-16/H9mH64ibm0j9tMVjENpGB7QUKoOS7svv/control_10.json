We leave at 7:35 so hitting the snooze button twice (7minutes each) leaves her with 35 minutes to get ready, which has never been enough.\nSo every morning I wake up, set her alarm ahead 13 minutes, leaving me 2 minutes to get the coffee running. She wakes up, gets in the shower. While she is in the shower I go back and set the alarm back to the correct time. For the past 8 or so months she has believed showering, getting dressed and putting on make-up takes her about 15 minutes.\nEvery now and then she comments on how much she has improved with being late. I smile and say yes love you really have.\nSometimes a little white lie can be a good thing. \n\nA lot of people called it controlling/manipulative etc. am I the asshole for doing this? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, the situation: the author is lying to his wife about setting her alarm clock 13 minutes ahead each morning. The wife thinks she has 35 minutes to get ready, but actually, she's getting 22 minutes because the alarm is set early. He does this to avoid arguments about her being late. He also lies about her improving her punctuality. The question is whether this is wrong.\n\nSo, the key points here are deception and manipulation. The author is intentionally setting the alarm incorrectly, which affects the wife's perception of her morning routine. The wife isn't aware of the truth, so she's operating under false information. The author's justification is that it prevents arguments, but the wife's autonomy is compromised here. \n\nNow, looking at the responses from people who called it controlling and manipulative. Those terms often apply when someone is manipulating another person's actions without their knowledge or consent. The author is controlling the situation by altering the alarm, which could be seen as a breach of trust. Even though the intent might be good (avoiding arguments), the method is dishonest.\n\nAlso, the wife's independence is affected. She's not making decisions based on accurate information. If she knew the truth, she might want to address the real issues, like her reliance on the snooze button or time management. By lying, the author is preventing her from solving the problem on her own. \n\nAnother angle is consent. The wife hasn't agreed to this arrangement. If he had talked to her about setting the alarm differently or helped her adjust her routine without deception, that might be a better approach. But keeping it a secret and lying about her progress shows a lack of transparency. \n\nTrust is a big factor here. When someone lies, especially repeatedly, it can erode trust in a relationship. The wife might feel betrayed if she finds out, even if the motive was good. The long-term effects of such lies could be more damaging than the original problem of morning arguments. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's actions are deceptive and manipulative, even if the intent is to help. The right approach would have been to communicate openly with the wife about the problem and work together to find a solution rather than lying. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
