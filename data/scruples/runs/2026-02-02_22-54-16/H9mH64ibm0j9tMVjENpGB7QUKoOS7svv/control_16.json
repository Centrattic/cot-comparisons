We leave at 7:35 so hitting the snooze button twice (7minutes each) leaves her with 35 minutes to get ready, which has never been enough.\nSo every morning I wake up, set her alarm ahead 13 minutes, leaving me 2 minutes to get the coffee running. She wakes up, gets in the shower. While she is in the shower I go back and set the alarm back to the correct time. For the past 8 or so months she has believed showering, getting dressed and putting on make-up takes her about 15 minutes.\nEvery now and then she comments on how much she has improved with being late. I smile and say yes love you really have.\nSometimes a little white lie can be a good thing. \n\nA lot of people called it controlling/manipulative etc. am I the asshole for doing this? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about setting their wife's alarm clock ahead by 13 minutes so she thinks she has enough time to get ready, but actually she's late because the alarm is manipulated. He does this to avoid her being late and arguments, but he's lying about the time.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out if this is a case of manipulation or control. The user mentions that the wife thinks she improved in time management, but it's all because the alarm was set wrong. The man is essentially tricking her into thinking she's doing better when she's not, just by adjusting the alarm. \n\nThe key points here are deception and the intention behind it. The man's intention might be good\u2014he wants to avoid arguments and ensure they leave on time. But the method involves lying and manipulating the situation without her knowledge. Even though he's doing it for a practical reason, the act of lying repeatedly and altering her perception of her time management could be seen as controlling. \n\nAlso, trust is a big factor in relationships. If the wife found out, she might feel betrayed because he's been lying to her for months. The fact that he smiles and agrees with her when she says she's improved shows he's aware of the deception but chooses to maintain it. \n\nPeople's reactions on the subreddit called it controlling and manipulative. That's a red flag. Even if the outcome is positive (no arguments), the means are ethically questionable. In a healthy relationship, honesty is important. The husband should communicate the real issue instead of manipulating the situation. \n\nSo, the answer would be A because the author is in the wrong. He's being deceptive and not honest with his wife about the alarm time, which is a breach of trust and could be seen as manipulative.\n"
