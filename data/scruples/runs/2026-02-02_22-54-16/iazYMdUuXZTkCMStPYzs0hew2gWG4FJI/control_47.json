I was on the phone for 3 hours of a 10 hour bus trip\nSome notes:\n- this bus fare was $60 for an adult and $33 for a child (me) while a plane ticket usually averages $80 but are frequentl on sale for $60. Reason why I chose to take a bus is because I paid for the trip and I don\u2019t get paid very much from work to afford the luxury to fly just as yet.\n\n- I\u2019m 17 years old and this lady seems like she\u2019s 35-45 years old (in other words she might seem like she has some sort of authority over me because I\u2019m young and she\u2019s older)\n\n- I am travelling by myself\n\n\nSo picture this: monday morning at 9:15am 2/3rds of a bus gets filled with people to drive from Melbourne to Adelaide (~800km/500mi). I\u2019m on this bus trip for two main reasons: I have a car in Adelaide that I need to drive back to Melbourne and I also haven\u2019t seen my dad in 4 months aswell (he\u2019s the one who helped me buy the car aswell).\n\nNow up until this point, I have been trying to get in contact with my dad so I can plan this little mini-holiday and how everything will work from registering the car to discussing and fixing all the problems with the car (its an old car).  Notice how I said I was \u2018trying\u2019 to get in contact with my dad - being that he\u2019d lost his phone and hasn\u2019t been able to call me (didn\u2019t know my phone number).\nNow this was all until I called my grandparents who live in the same city as my dad. As it turned out, my father went to his parents house to use their phone to call me, right as I was about to call him. So fair enough, I was on the phone with my dad and we talked.\n\nSoon enough, we\u2019d planned our week ahead and eventually got onto other personal topics because we don\u2019t really call very often. By the time I say goodbye, it was about 11:35am. I was tired from the night before and try to get some rest.\n\nNo more than 15 minutes later, I get a call from my best friend. She was calling to tell me about how she and her parents got into a massive argument over the holiday we\u2019re going on in 9 days. To celebrate our passing of highschool, its tradition for students to go on a holiday somwhere in groups with the main intention to get as drunk as physically possible.\n\nWell, her parents had said that they didn\u2019t want her to go, although we\u2019ve all already paid $1000+ and booked it 6 months ago. Plans were SET, and we were ready to leave. So naturally I spent the next 45 minutes discussing what our course of action was to get around this situation.\n\nNo less than 5 minutes before I\u2019m saying bye to my friend on the phone, this lady sitting on the other side of the aisle to me raises her voice at me saying \n\n\u201care you going to stay on that fucking phone for the whole trip? You\u2019re being so rude!\u201d\n\n\u201cUm hello? How am I rude? I\u2019m talking to my friend and its only 12:30pm. That means daytime. That means people wont be sleeping\u201d\n\nNow I know that there may be some people asleep on the bus. I should know, I almost had a nap before my friend called me. But I\u2019m not sure how I was rude. If you didn\u2019t want this, then you should have flown and not caught a bus.\n\nSo Reddit, am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a 17-year-old on a 10-hour bus trip who used their phone for three hours. The key points are the bus fare, the reason for taking the bus, the age difference and possible perceived authority of the other passenger, and the specific events leading up to the confrontation.\n\nFirst, the user took a bus because it's cheaper, which makes sense given their financial situation. They mention that they needed to coordinate with their dad about a car and a trip, and then spoke with their best friend about a planned holiday. The other passenger complained about the phone use, calling it rude.\n\nI need to consider bus etiquette. Typically, it's expected to keep phone conversations quiet unless using headphones. However, in a bus where people might be trying to rest, even during the day, loud phone calls can be disruptive. The user was on the phone for a significant portion of the trip, which could be seen as inconsiderate. But the user argues that since it's daytime and not everyone is asleep, their use isn't wrong. \n\nThe user also mentions that they tried to nap before the call, implying they might have been aware of the environment. However, after talking to their friend, the complaint came from the passenger. The user's response to the woman's outburst is defensive, pointing out that the woman could have chosen a different mode of transport if she was unhappy. That's a common argument in such situations.\n\nThe question is whether the user was in the wrong. Factors to consider: duration of the call, volume, and the context. The user was on the phone for three hours, which is a long time on a bus. Even if it's daytime, prolonged phone use can be disruptive. However, the user had valid reasons related to family and friends. The woman's outburst might have been reactive to the length of the call rather than the volume. \n\nIn terms of etiquette, it's generally advisable to keep phone calls to a minimum on public transport, especially during longer trips. The user might have been inconsiderate by talking for so long, but they weren't necessarily wrong if they were using their time to attend to personal matters. The woman's reaction could be harsh, but the user's actions might still be seen as rude due to the duration. \n\nConsidering the financial constraints and the necessity to communicate with family and friends, the user's actions might be understandable. However, the bus is a shared space, and others have the right to a comfortable journey. The user's argument that the woman could have flown instead is a bit dismissive but highlights that bus passengers choose the bus for cost reasons, not comfort. \n\nOverall, whether the user is in the wrong depends on balancing personal needs with consideration for others. The three-hour call is a lot, but the user had valid reasons. The woman's reaction might be over the top, but the user's actions could be seen as inconsiderate. So, the answer is a bit nuanced. However, according to typical public etiquette, using a phone for extended periods without headphones is usually frowned upon, so the user might be in the wrong (A). But if the volume was low and the context is considered, maybe not (B). The key is the duration and the shared space. I think the answer is A.\n"
