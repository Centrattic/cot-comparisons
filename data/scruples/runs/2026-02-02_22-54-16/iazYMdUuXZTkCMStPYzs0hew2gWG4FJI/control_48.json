I was on the phone for 3 hours of a 10 hour bus trip\nSome notes:\n- this bus fare was $60 for an adult and $33 for a child (me) while a plane ticket usually averages $80 but are frequentl on sale for $60. Reason why I chose to take a bus is because I paid for the trip and I don\u2019t get paid very much from work to afford the luxury to fly just as yet.\n\n- I\u2019m 17 years old and this lady seems like she\u2019s 35-45 years old (in other words she might seem like she has some sort of authority over me because I\u2019m young and she\u2019s older)\n\n- I am travelling by myself\n\n\nSo picture this: monday morning at 9:15am 2/3rds of a bus gets filled with people to drive from Melbourne to Adelaide (~800km/500mi). I\u2019m on this bus trip for two main reasons: I have a car in Adelaide that I need to drive back to Melbourne and I also haven\u2019t seen my dad in 4 months aswell (he\u2019s the one who helped me buy the car aswell).\n\nNow up until this point, I have been trying to get in contact with my dad so I can plan this little mini-holiday and how everything will work from registering the car to discussing and fixing all the problems with the car (its an old car).  Notice how I said I was \u2018trying\u2019 to get in contact with my dad - being that he\u2019d lost his phone and hasn\u2019t been able to call me (didn\u2019t know my phone number).\nNow this was all until I called my grandparents who live in the same city as my dad. As it turned out, my father went to his parents house to use their phone to call me, right as I was about to call him. So fair enough, I was on the phone with my dad and we talked.\n\nSoon enough, we\u2019d planned our week ahead and eventually got onto other personal topics because we don\u2019t really call very often. By the time I say goodbye, it was about 11:35am. I was tired from the night before and try to get some rest.\n\nNo more than 15 minutes later, I get a call from my best friend. She was calling to tell me about how she and her parents got into a massive argument over the holiday we\u2019re going on in 9 days. To celebrate our passing of highschool, its tradition for students to go on a holiday somwhere in groups with the main intention to get as drunk as physically possible.\n\nWell, her parents had said that they didn\u2019t want her to go, although we\u2019ve all already paid $1000+ and booked it 6 months ago. Plans were SET, and we were ready to leave. So naturally I spent the next 45 minutes discussing what our course of action was to get around this situation.\n\nNo less than 5 minutes before I\u2019m saying bye to my friend on the phone, this lady sitting on the other side of the aisle to me raises her voice at me saying \n\n\u201care you going to stay on that fucking phone for the whole trip? You\u2019re being so rude!\u201d\n\n\u201cUm hello? How am I rude? I\u2019m talking to my friend and its only 12:30pm. That means daytime. That means people wont be sleeping\u201d\n\nNow I know that there may be some people asleep on the bus. I should know, I almost had a nap before my friend called me. But I\u2019m not sure how I was rude. If you didn\u2019t want this, then you should have flown and not caught a bus.\n\nSo Reddit, am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me read through their story again carefully.\n\nThey took a bus from Melbourne to Adelaide, which is a long trip. They're 17, paying for the trip themselves, and chose the bus because it's cheaper than a plane. They were on the phone for three hours of a ten-hour trip. The main points are that they were talking to their dad for a while, then their best friend called about a holiday they've already paid for. The lady sitting next to them got angry and called them rude for talking on the phone. The author is asking if they're the asshole here.\n\nFirst, I should consider the situation. Bus travel often has different expectations compared to planes. Planes are more formal with rules about being quiet, but buses can vary. The author was on the phone during the day, not during a time when people are expected to sleep. The lady complained, but the author points out that people might be trying to sleep, though they mention they themselves were almost asleep before the friend called. \n\nThe author had two long calls: first with their dad to plan a car-related trip and catch up, then with their friend about a planned holiday they were already committed to. The argument might be about whether using the phone for personal calls is considerate. However, since it's daytime and not a time when everyone is asleep, maybe it's acceptable. Also, the author is paying for their own trip and trying to use the time to handle important matters. \n\nOn the other hand, talking on the phone in public can be disruptive. Even if it's daytime, some people might prefer quiet on a bus. The author could have used headphones to avoid being overheard, but maybe they didn't. However, the lady's outburst was confrontational, which might not be the best approach either. \n\nThe author's defense is that the lady should have flown if she wanted more privacy, but that's a bit of a stretch. Maybe the issue is more about volume and consideration. If the author was speaking loudly, that's rude. But if they were having a normal conversation, it's a common thing. The key factors are the time of day, the necessity of the calls (important plans with family and friends), and the context of the lady's complaint. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong here. They were using the time to address important matters, and it's daytime where people's expectations of quiet might be lower. The lady's reaction seems harsh, and the author didn't do anything explicitly wrong. So the answer is B.\n"
