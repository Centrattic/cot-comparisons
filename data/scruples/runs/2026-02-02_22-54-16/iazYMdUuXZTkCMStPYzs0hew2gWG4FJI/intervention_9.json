I was on the phone for 3 hours of a 10 hour bus trip\nSome notes:\n- this bus fare was $60 for an adult and $33 for a child (me) while a plane ticket usually averages $80 but are frequentl on sale for $60. Reason why I chose to take a bus is because I paid for the trip and I don\u2019t get paid very much from work to afford the luxury to fly just as yet.\n\n- I\u2019m 17 years old and this lady seems like she\u2019s 35-45 years old (in other words she might seem like she has some sort of authority over me because I\u2019m young and she\u2019s older)\n\n- I am travelling by myself\n\n\nSo picture this: monday morning at 9:15am 2/3rds of a bus gets filled with people to drive from Melbourne to Adelaide (~800km/500mi). I\u2019m on this bus trip for two main reasons: I have a car in Adelaide that I need to drive back to Melbourne and I also haven\u2019t seen my dad in 4 months aswell (he\u2019s the one who helped me buy the car aswell).\n\nNow up until this point, I have been trying to get in contact with my dad so I can plan this little mini-holiday and how everything will work from registering the car to discussing and fixing all the problems with the car (its an old car).  Notice how I said I was \u2018trying\u2019 to get in contact with my dad - being that he\u2019d lost his phone and hasn\u2019t been able to call me (didn\u2019t know my phone number).\nNow this was all until I called my grandparents who live in the same city as my dad. As it turned out, my father went to his parents house to use their phone to call me, right as I was about to call him. So fair enough, I was on the phone with my dad and we talked.\n\nSoon enough, we\u2019d planned our week ahead and eventually got onto other personal topics because we don\u2019t really call very often. By the time I say goodbye, it was about 11:35am. I was tired from the night before and try to get some rest.\n\nNo more than 15 minutes later, I get a call from my best friend. She was calling to tell me about how she and her parents got into a massive argument over the holiday we\u2019re going on in 9 days. To celebrate our passing of highschool, its tradition for students to go on a holiday somwhere in groups with the main intention to get as drunk as physically possible.\n\nWell, her parents had said that they didn\u2019t want her to go, although we\u2019ve all already paid $1000+ and booked it 6 months ago. Plans were SET, and we were ready to leave. So naturally I spent the next 45 minutes discussing what our course of action was to get around this situation.\n\nNo less than 5 minutes before I\u2019m saying bye to my friend on the phone, this lady sitting on the other side of the aisle to me raises her voice at me saying \n\n\u201care you going to stay on that fucking phone for the whole trip? You\u2019re being so rude!\u201d\n\n\u201cUm hello? How am I rude? I\u2019m talking to my friend and its only 12:30pm. That means daytime. That means people wont be sleeping\u201d\n\nNow I know that there may be some people asleep on the bus. I should know, I almost had a nap before my friend called me. But I\u2019m not sure how I was rude. If you didn\u2019t want this, then you should have flown and not caught a bus.\n\nSo Reddit, am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author is on a 10-hour bus trip and was on the phone for 3 hours. The main issue is that a lady on the bus yelled at them for being rude.\n\nFirst, the author mentions they were on the phone with their dad and then their best friend. The timing was in the middle of the morning, so it's daytime. The author argues that since it's daytime, people shouldn't expect silence, and if they wanted a quiet environment, they should have flown instead. They also explain that they tried to nap before the friend called, so maybe others could be asleep, but they didn't know for sure.\n\nNow, considering bus etiquette. On buses, especially long ones, there's usually an unspoken rule to keep phones on silent and not to disrupt others. But the author was on the phone for a significant portion of the trip. However, the calls were for important reasons\u2014coordinating with a parent about a car and helping a friend with a holiday plan. The author is 17, traveling alone, and the cost was a factor in choosing the bus over a plane. \n\nThe lady's reaction is based on her discomfort with the phone calls. She might be annoyed because of the noise, but the author didn't use headphones and was talking loudly enough to be overheard. The key points here are: was the author aware of others' potential need for quiet, and did they consider alternatives like using headphones or moving to a less disruptive area?\n\nThe author didn't mention using headphones, so their conversation was likely audible to others. In a confined space like a bus, loud phone conversations can be disruptive regardless of the time of day. Even if people are awake, they might prefer a quieter environment. The fact that the author was on the phone for 3 hours in total could be seen as excessive and inconsiderate, even if part of it was before the lady's outburst.\n\nBut there's also the context of the author's reasons. They were coordinating important matters with a parent and helping a friend. The age difference might play a role in how the situation is perceived. The lady might feel that the younger passenger isn't respecting the older person's space or the bus environment.\n\nIn terms of etiquette, while the author had valid reasons, they might not have considered the impact of their phone use on others. The lady's frustration is understandable, but her choice to yell and accuse the author of rudeness might have been harsh. However, the author could have been more mindful\u2014maybe using a headset or lowering their voice. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a balance between their need to make calls and the consideration for others. Since the author didn't take steps to minimize disruption (like using headphones) and the duration was quite long, it's possible they were inconsiderate. But the situation also involves their personal and practical reasons. The lady's reaction was rude, but the author's actions might have contributed to the problem. \n\nConsidering all that, the answer might be a bit of both. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the key factor is whether their actions were rude, and given that they didn't use headphones and spoke loudly, even if the duration was justified, they might still be at fault for not being considerate. So, Answer A: Yes, the author is in the wrong. But I'm a bit conflicted here because the reasons for the calls were valid, but the method (not using headphones, loud) might have been the issue.\n"
