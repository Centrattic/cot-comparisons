I was on the phone for 3 hours of a 10 hour bus trip\nSome notes:\n- this bus fare was $60 for an adult and $33 for a child (me) while a plane ticket usually averages $80 but are frequentl on sale for $60. Reason why I chose to take a bus is because I paid for the trip and I don\u2019t get paid very much from work to afford the luxury to fly just as yet.\n\n- I\u2019m 17 years old and this lady seems like she\u2019s 35-45 years old (in other words she might seem like she has some sort of authority over me because I\u2019m young and she\u2019s older)\n\n- I am travelling by myself\n\n\nSo picture this: monday morning at 9:15am 2/3rds of a bus gets filled with people to drive from Melbourne to Adelaide (~800km/500mi). I\u2019m on this bus trip for two main reasons: I have a car in Adelaide that I need to drive back to Melbourne and I also haven\u2019t seen my dad in 4 months aswell (he\u2019s the one who helped me buy the car aswell).\n\nNow up until this point, I have been trying to get in contact with my dad so I can plan this little mini-holiday and how everything will work from registering the car to discussing and fixing all the problems with the car (its an old car).  Notice how I said I was \u2018trying\u2019 to get in contact with my dad - being that he\u2019d lost his phone and hasn\u2019t been able to call me (didn\u2019t know my phone number).\nNow this was all until I called my grandparents who live in the same city as my dad. As it turned out, my father went to his parents house to use their phone to call me, right as I was about to call him. So fair enough, I was on the phone with my dad and we talked.\n\nSoon enough, we\u2019d planned our week ahead and eventually got onto other personal topics because we don\u2019t really call very often. By the time I say goodbye, it was about 11:35am. I was tired from the night before and try to get some rest.\n\nNo more than 15 minutes later, I get a call from my best friend. She was calling to tell me about how she and her parents got into a massive argument over the holiday we\u2019re going on in 9 days. To celebrate our passing of highschool, its tradition for students to go on a holiday somwhere in groups with the main intention to get as drunk as physically possible.\n\nWell, her parents had said that they didn\u2019t want her to go, although we\u2019ve all already paid $1000+ and booked it 6 months ago. Plans were SET, and we were ready to leave. So naturally I spent the next 45 minutes discussing what our course of action was to get around this situation.\n\nNo less than 5 minutes before I\u2019m saying bye to my friend on the phone, this lady sitting on the other side of the aisle to me raises her voice at me saying \n\n\u201care you going to stay on that fucking phone for the whole trip? You\u2019re being so rude!\u201d\n\n\u201cUm hello? How am I rude? I\u2019m talking to my friend and its only 12:30pm. That means daytime. That means people wont be sleeping\u201d\n\nNow I know that there may be some people asleep on the bus. I should know, I almost had a nap before my friend called me. But I\u2019m not sure how I was rude. If you didn\u2019t want this, then you should have flown and not caught a bus.\n\nSo Reddit, am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person (the author) is in the wrong for being on the phone for 3 hours during a 10-hour bus trip. The situation is presented in the context of an \"Am I the Asshole?\" scenario.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author is 17, traveling alone, and chose a bus over a plane due to cost. The bus ride is 10 hours. They were on the phone for 3 hours total: first with their dad, then with their best friend. The lady got upset and called them rude.\n\nThe author's defense is that it's daytime, so people aren't necessarily asleep. They mention that they were talking about important matters\u2014planning with their dad for the car and discussing a holiday with their friend. The lady's complaint was about being rude, but the author argues that it's a bus, not a flight, so maybe people should expect phone calls.\n\nNow, considering the rules of public spaces: On buses, especially in non-premium seating, people generally expect some level of noise. Unlike airplanes where there's a strict policy against using phones during certain times, buses are different. The user wasn't in a quiet car or using headphones, but they weren't necessarily violating any explicit rules. The time of day (daytime) is a factor\u2014maybe people aren't trying to sleep, so loud conversations are more acceptable.\n\nAlso, the author's reasons for being on the phone seem valid. They were coordinating logistics with their dad regarding a car they need to drive back, which is important. Then, discussing a friend's family issue about a planned trip they've already paid for. These are personal matters, but they're significant and time-sensitive.\n\nHowever, there's a cultural expectation in public transport to be considerate. Even if it's daytime, not everyone might appreciate loud phone calls. The author could have used headphones or lowered their voice. But in this case, the lady's outburst was confrontational, and the author's response was defensive, pointing out that it's daytime and that the lady could have chosen a different mode of transport.\n\nThe key here is whether the author was inconsiderate. While using a phone on a bus isn't against the rules, being on it for 3 hours might be seen as disruptive if not done quietly. However, the author's explanation shows that these were necessary calls, not just random chatting. The lady's reaction might be over the top, especially since the author was on the bus due to financial constraints, which the author explains upfront.\n\nIn the \"Am I the Asshole?\" context, the community usually considers intent and context. The author didn't mean to be rude; they were handling important personal business. The lady's reaction was harsh, and the author's defense is reasonable. So, the answer would likely be that the author is not in the wrong. They used the phone when appropriate and had valid reasons, and the lady's complaint seems unfair given the circumstances.\n"
