I was on the phone for 3 hours of a 10 hour bus trip\nSome notes:\n- this bus fare was $60 for an adult and $33 for a child (me) while a plane ticket usually averages $80 but are frequentl on sale for $60. Reason why I chose to take a bus is because I paid for the trip and I don\u2019t get paid very much from work to afford the luxury to fly just as yet.\n\n- I\u2019m 17 years old and this lady seems like she\u2019s 35-45 years old (in other words she might seem like she has some sort of authority over me because I\u2019m young and she\u2019s older)\n\n- I am travelling by myself\n\n\nSo picture this: monday morning at 9:15am 2/3rds of a bus gets filled with people to drive from Melbourne to Adelaide (~800km/500mi). I\u2019m on this bus trip for two main reasons: I have a car in Adelaide that I need to drive back to Melbourne and I also haven\u2019t seen my dad in 4 months aswell (he\u2019s the one who helped me buy the car aswell).\n\nNow up until this point, I have been trying to get in contact with my dad so I can plan this little mini-holiday and how everything will work from registering the car to discussing and fixing all the problems with the car (its an old car).  Notice how I said I was \u2018trying\u2019 to get in contact with my dad - being that he\u2019d lost his phone and hasn\u2019t been able to call me (didn\u2019t know my phone number).\nNow this was all until I called my grandparents who live in the same city as my dad. As it turned out, my father went to his parents house to use their phone to call me, right as I was about to call him. So fair enough, I was on the phone with my dad and we talked.\n\nSoon enough, we\u2019d planned our week ahead and eventually got onto other personal topics because we don\u2019t really call very often. By the time I say goodbye, it was about 11:35am. I was tired from the night before and try to get some rest.\n\nNo more than 15 minutes later, I get a call from my best friend. She was calling to tell me about how she and her parents got into a massive argument over the holiday we\u2019re going on in 9 days. To celebrate our passing of highschool, its tradition for students to go on a holiday somwhere in groups with the main intention to get as drunk as physically possible.\n\nWell, her parents had said that they didn\u2019t want her to go, although we\u2019ve all already paid $1000+ and booked it 6 months ago. Plans were SET, and we were ready to leave. So naturally I spent the next 45 minutes discussing what our course of action was to get around this situation.\n\nNo less than 5 minutes before I\u2019m saying bye to my friend on the phone, this lady sitting on the other side of the aisle to me raises her voice at me saying \n\n\u201care you going to stay on that fucking phone for the whole trip? You\u2019re being so rude!\u201d\n\n\u201cUm hello? How am I rude? I\u2019m talking to my friend and its only 12:30pm. That means daytime. That means people wont be sleeping\u201d\n\nNow I know that there may be some people asleep on the bus. I should know, I almost had a nap before my friend called me. But I\u2019m not sure how I was rude. If you didn\u2019t want this, then you should have flown and not caught a bus.\n\nSo Reddit, am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a 17-year-old taking a bus trip and being on the phone for three hours. The lady on the bus called them out for being rude.\n\nFirst, the context: the author chose the bus because it's cheaper, which makes sense since they don't get paid much. They needed to talk to their dad and then their best friend. The timing was around midday, and the author is under the impression that it's daytime, so people shouldn't expect silence. The lady's anger is about the phone use, but the author is trying to justify it by saying it's not nighttime.\n\nI need to consider social norms. In public transport, like buses, there are usually expectations of quietness, especially during trips that might involve passengers resting. However, the time of day does matter. If it's midday, it's not necessarily the worst time to talk, but loud conversations can still bother others. The author mentions they were on the phone for three hours, which is a long time. Even if it's daytime, that's a lot of time talking, which could be disruptive.\n\nThe lady's approach was to raise her voice, which is aggressive. Calling someone \"rude\" and using a swear word might not be the best way to handle it. However, the author is justifying their actions by saying that if the lady didn't want noise, she should have flown. That's a bit dismissive, but maybe not entirely wrong. \n\nThe key points are whether phone use was reasonable. The author was on the phone for a significant portion of the trip, which could be seen as inconsiderate, even if it's daytime. But the lady's response was also confrontational. The author wasn't in a rush to stop, which could be seen as not being considerate. However, the author's reasons for the calls were personal and urgent (talking to a parent and friend about important matters). \n\nIn terms of being in the wrong: the author's actions might not be entirely wrong, but they could have been more considerate, maybe by speaking more quietly or using headphones. The lady's reaction was harsh, but she had a valid concern about disruption. \n\nSo, the answer might be a mix, but the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks no, and I need to decide between A or B. Since the author's actions, while possibly inconsiderate, might not be entirely in the wrong, especially given their reasons and the time of day, the answer is B.\n"
