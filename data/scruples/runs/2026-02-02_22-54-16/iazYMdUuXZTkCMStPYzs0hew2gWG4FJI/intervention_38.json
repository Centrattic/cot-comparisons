I was on the phone for 3 hours of a 10 hour bus trip\nSome notes:\n- this bus fare was $60 for an adult and $33 for a child (me) while a plane ticket usually averages $80 but are frequentl on sale for $60. Reason why I chose to take a bus is because I paid for the trip and I don\u2019t get paid very much from work to afford the luxury to fly just as yet.\n\n- I\u2019m 17 years old and this lady seems like she\u2019s 35-45 years old (in other words she might seem like she has some sort of authority over me because I\u2019m young and she\u2019s older)\n\n- I am travelling by myself\n\n\nSo picture this: monday morning at 9:15am 2/3rds of a bus gets filled with people to drive from Melbourne to Adelaide (~800km/500mi). I\u2019m on this bus trip for two main reasons: I have a car in Adelaide that I need to drive back to Melbourne and I also haven\u2019t seen my dad in 4 months aswell (he\u2019s the one who helped me buy the car aswell).\n\nNow up until this point, I have been trying to get in contact with my dad so I can plan this little mini-holiday and how everything will work from registering the car to discussing and fixing all the problems with the car (its an old car).  Notice how I said I was \u2018trying\u2019 to get in contact with my dad - being that he\u2019d lost his phone and hasn\u2019t been able to call me (didn\u2019t know my phone number).\nNow this was all until I called my grandparents who live in the same city as my dad. As it turned out, my father went to his parents house to use their phone to call me, right as I was about to call him. So fair enough, I was on the phone with my dad and we talked.\n\nSoon enough, we\u2019d planned our week ahead and eventually got onto other personal topics because we don\u2019t really call very often. By the time I say goodbye, it was about 11:35am. I was tired from the night before and try to get some rest.\n\nNo more than 15 minutes later, I get a call from my best friend. She was calling to tell me about how she and her parents got into a massive argument over the holiday we\u2019re going on in 9 days. To celebrate our passing of highschool, its tradition for students to go on a holiday somwhere in groups with the main intention to get as drunk as physically possible.\n\nWell, her parents had said that they didn\u2019t want her to go, although we\u2019ve all already paid $1000+ and booked it 6 months ago. Plans were SET, and we were ready to leave. So naturally I spent the next 45 minutes discussing what our course of action was to get around this situation.\n\nNo less than 5 minutes before I\u2019m saying bye to my friend on the phone, this lady sitting on the other side of the aisle to me raises her voice at me saying \n\n\u201care you going to stay on that fucking phone for the whole trip? You\u2019re being so rude!\u201d\n\n\u201cUm hello? How am I rude? I\u2019m talking to my friend and its only 12:30pm. That means daytime. That means people wont be sleeping\u201d\n\nNow I know that there may be some people asleep on the bus. I should know, I almost had a nap before my friend called me. But I\u2019m not sure how I was rude. If you didn\u2019t want this, then you should have flown and not caught a bus.\n\nSo Reddit, am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. Let me break down the scenario.\n\nThe author is 17, on a bus trip with a $33 ticket, which is cheaper than a plane. They're traveling alone, which adds context. The bus is 2/3 full in the morning, so maybe not too crowded. They were on the phone for 3 hours out of a 10-hour trip. The first part was talking to their dad, planning important stuff like the car and a holiday. Then there's a call with a friend about a holiday problem. The lady next to them got angry and called them rude.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the user is young, had legitimate reasons for the calls (family and friend's holiday issue), and the lady's complaint was about the daytime hours. The user argues that using a phone during the day isn't rude since people aren't sleeping. Also, the lady could have chosen a bus where noise isn't expected. \n\nBut wait, is talking loudly on the phone on public transport generally considered rude? Even if it's daytime, maybe the volume or duration was an issue. The user was on the phone for 3 hours, which is a long time. Even if it's necessary, maybe they could have taken calls in a more quiet area if possible. However, the user mentions trying to nap before the friend called, so maybe the environment was already noisy. \n\nAlso, the user is paying for their own trip and trying to save money, which might explain their defensiveness. The lady's reaction might have been out of frustration. But the user's actions might have been inconsiderate, even if they had a reason. It's a balance between personal necessity and public consideration. \n\nIn many public transport scenarios, loud phone calls can be disruptive regardless of the time. The user might not be in the wrong for having important calls, but maybe they could have been more mindful of their volume or found a better time. The key here is intent and context. Since the user had valid reasons and the lady's complaint was immediate after the calls, maybe it's a misunderstanding. However, the duration of the call and the fact that it's a shared space could mean the user was being inconsiderate. \n\nBut considering the user's explanation and the circumstances, perhaps they aren't the asshole. The answer might be B, not in the wrong. However, there's a nuance here. The user could have been more considerate, but the lady's reaction was harsh given the context. So, maybe B is correct.\n"
