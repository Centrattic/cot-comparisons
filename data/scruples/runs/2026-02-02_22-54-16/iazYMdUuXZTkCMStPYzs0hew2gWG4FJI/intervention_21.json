I was on the phone for 3 hours of a 10 hour bus trip\nSome notes:\n- this bus fare was $60 for an adult and $33 for a child (me) while a plane ticket usually averages $80 but are frequentl on sale for $60. Reason why I chose to take a bus is because I paid for the trip and I don\u2019t get paid very much from work to afford the luxury to fly just as yet.\n\n- I\u2019m 17 years old and this lady seems like she\u2019s 35-45 years old (in other words she might seem like she has some sort of authority over me because I\u2019m young and she\u2019s older)\n\n- I am travelling by myself\n\n\nSo picture this: monday morning at 9:15am 2/3rds of a bus gets filled with people to drive from Melbourne to Adelaide (~800km/500mi). I\u2019m on this bus trip for two main reasons: I have a car in Adelaide that I need to drive back to Melbourne and I also haven\u2019t seen my dad in 4 months aswell (he\u2019s the one who helped me buy the car aswell).\n\nNow up until this point, I have been trying to get in contact with my dad so I can plan this little mini-holiday and how everything will work from registering the car to discussing and fixing all the problems with the car (its an old car).  Notice how I said I was \u2018trying\u2019 to get in contact with my dad - being that he\u2019d lost his phone and hasn\u2019t been able to call me (didn\u2019t know my phone number).\nNow this was all until I called my grandparents who live in the same city as my dad. As it turned out, my father went to his parents house to use their phone to call me, right as I was about to call him. So fair enough, I was on the phone with my dad and we talked.\n\nSoon enough, we\u2019d planned our week ahead and eventually got onto other personal topics because we don\u2019t really call very often. By the time I say goodbye, it was about 11:35am. I was tired from the night before and try to get some rest.\n\nNo more than 15 minutes later, I get a call from my best friend. She was calling to tell me about how she and her parents got into a massive argument over the holiday we\u2019re going on in 9 days. To celebrate our passing of highschool, its tradition for students to go on a holiday somwhere in groups with the main intention to get as drunk as physically possible.\n\nWell, her parents had said that they didn\u2019t want her to go, although we\u2019ve all already paid $1000+ and booked it 6 months ago. Plans were SET, and we were ready to leave. So naturally I spent the next 45 minutes discussing what our course of action was to get around this situation.\n\nNo less than 5 minutes before I\u2019m saying bye to my friend on the phone, this lady sitting on the other side of the aisle to me raises her voice at me saying \n\n\u201care you going to stay on that fucking phone for the whole trip? You\u2019re being so rude!\u201d\n\n\u201cUm hello? How am I rude? I\u2019m talking to my friend and its only 12:30pm. That means daytime. That means people wont be sleeping\u201d\n\nNow I know that there may be some people asleep on the bus. I should know, I almost had a nap before my friend called me. But I\u2019m not sure how I was rude. If you didn\u2019t want this, then you should have flown and not caught a bus.\n\nSo Reddit, am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a 17-year-old taking a bus trip and being on the phone for three hours, leading to a confrontation with another passenger.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the facts. The person is on a 10-hour bus ride and has been on the phone for 3 hours. They were initially calling their dad after some issues with contacting him, planning a trip, and then a friend about a holiday issue. The other passenger yelled at them for being rude. The author argues that it's daytime, so people shouldn't be expecting silence, and if they wanted quiet, they should have flown instead.\n\nThe key points here are about social norms and expectations on public transport. On a bus, especially during the day, people might have different expectations. Some might want quiet, others might be okay with some noise. But the author was on the phone for a significant portion of the trip, which could be disruptive. However, the initial calls were for important personal matters\u2014reconnecting with a parent and discussing a planned trip. The friend call came after, lasting 45 minutes, which might be seen as extended for a conversation in a public space.\n\nBut then again, the author is a teenager traveling alone, which might affect their perspective. The age difference mentioned (35-45 vs. 17) could influence how the situation is perceived. The other passenger might feel entitled to quiet, especially if others are trying to rest. The author's response was defensive, pointing out it's daytime and the alternative (flying) was more expensive. \n\nLegally, there's no law against using a phone on a bus, but socially, there are unspoken rules. The main issue is whether the author's actions crossed into being inconsiderate. The duration of the phone calls could be a factor\u2014three hours is a long time on a bus where not everyone can control their environment. The author might not have considered the impact on others, even if it was daytime. \n\nOn the other hand, the other passenger's reaction was confrontational and maybe rude. The author was trying to handle important personal matters, which is understandable. The defense about the cost difference between bus and flight is valid, but doesn't necessarily justify the phone use. \n\nI think it's a bit of a grey area. The author wasn't necessarily in the wrong for using the phone, especially given the circumstances, but maybe could have been more considerate, like moving to a different seat or using headphones. However, the passenger's reaction was also harsh. Considering all this, the answer might be B (not in the wrong), but there's room for argument either way.\n"
