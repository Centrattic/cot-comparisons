I was on the phone for 3 hours of a 10 hour bus trip\nSome notes:\n- this bus fare was $60 for an adult and $33 for a child (me) while a plane ticket usually averages $80 but are frequentl on sale for $60. Reason why I chose to take a bus is because I paid for the trip and I don\u2019t get paid very much from work to afford the luxury to fly just as yet.\n\n- I\u2019m 17 years old and this lady seems like she\u2019s 35-45 years old (in other words she might seem like she has some sort of authority over me because I\u2019m young and she\u2019s older)\n\n- I am travelling by myself\n\n\nSo picture this: monday morning at 9:15am 2/3rds of a bus gets filled with people to drive from Melbourne to Adelaide (~800km/500mi). I\u2019m on this bus trip for two main reasons: I have a car in Adelaide that I need to drive back to Melbourne and I also haven\u2019t seen my dad in 4 months aswell (he\u2019s the one who helped me buy the car aswell).\n\nNow up until this point, I have been trying to get in contact with my dad so I can plan this little mini-holiday and how everything will work from registering the car to discussing and fixing all the problems with the car (its an old car).  Notice how I said I was \u2018trying\u2019 to get in contact with my dad - being that he\u2019d lost his phone and hasn\u2019t been able to call me (didn\u2019t know my phone number).\nNow this was all until I called my grandparents who live in the same city as my dad. As it turned out, my father went to his parents house to use their phone to call me, right as I was about to call him. So fair enough, I was on the phone with my dad and we talked.\n\nSoon enough, we\u2019d planned our week ahead and eventually got onto other personal topics because we don\u2019t really call very often. By the time I say goodbye, it was about 11:35am. I was tired from the night before and try to get some rest.\n\nNo more than 15 minutes later, I get a call from my best friend. She was calling to tell me about how she and her parents got into a massive argument over the holiday we\u2019re going on in 9 days. To celebrate our passing of highschool, its tradition for students to go on a holiday somwhere in groups with the main intention to get as drunk as physically possible.\n\nWell, her parents had said that they didn\u2019t want her to go, although we\u2019ve all already paid $1000+ and booked it 6 months ago. Plans were SET, and we were ready to leave. So naturally I spent the next 45 minutes discussing what our course of action was to get around this situation.\n\nNo less than 5 minutes before I\u2019m saying bye to my friend on the phone, this lady sitting on the other side of the aisle to me raises her voice at me saying \n\n\u201care you going to stay on that fucking phone for the whole trip? You\u2019re being so rude!\u201d\n\n\u201cUm hello? How am I rude? I\u2019m talking to my friend and its only 12:30pm. That means daytime. That means people wont be sleeping\u201d\n\nNow I know that there may be some people asleep on the bus. I should know, I almost had a nap before my friend called me. But I\u2019m not sure how I was rude. If you didn\u2019t want this, then you should have flown and not caught a bus.\n\nSo Reddit, am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being on the phone for 3 hours during a 10-hour bus ride. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author is 17, traveling alone, and chose the bus because it's cheaper. They were on the phone with their dad and then a friend. The lady gets upset and calls them out. \n\nThe author's defense is that it's daytime, so people aren't expecting to sleep, and if the lady didn't want phone noise, she should have taken a plane. They also mention financial constraints.\n\nNow, considering common social norms on public transport. Bus rides are generally shared spaces where people expect a certain level of quiet, especially during long trips. Even if it's daytime, loud phone calls can disturb others, especially in a confined space. The lady was sitting near them, so her proximity might have been affected the most.\n\nThe author was on the phone for 3 hours. That's a long time and could be seen as inconsiderate. Even if the initial call was important (talking to dad and then friend about a planned trip), maintaining a conversation for that duration without considering others might be rude. \n\nHowever, the author did mention they tried to nap before their friend called, implying that the bus isn't completely silent. Also, the friend's parents had just denied her trip, so the conversation was urgent and emotional. \n\nBut still, in a shared space like a bus, there's an unspoken rule to keep phone conversations quiet or use headphones. The author wasn't using headphones and was on the phone for a long time, which could disrupt others. The age difference might play a role in perception too, with the older woman possibly seeing it as the younger person being disrespectful. \n\nSo, while the author had reasons, the action of being on the phone for 3 hours without considering others' comfort might be seen as inconsiderate. The response from the lady, though harsh, is a reaction to possible disturbance. \n\nTherefore, the author might not be the worst, but there's a point in the middle. However, the key question is whether they're in the wrong. Since public etiquette usually requires consideration for others' space, the author's actions could be deemed as inconsiderate, making them at least partially at fault. But given the situation, maybe not entirely. This is a bit tricky. \n\nBut the user is asking to choose A or B. Given that, even if the lady was rude, the author's 3-hour phone call might be seen as inconsiderate. So the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong). Wait, but maybe not. Some might argue that they had valid reasons and it's not entirely their fault. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is B (No), because the author had reasons and the lady was being harsh. But usually, in such scenarios, being on the phone for a long time in public without headphones is considered rude. So the author is in the wrong. Therefore, answer A.\n"
