I was on the phone for 3 hours of a 10 hour bus trip\nSome notes:\n- this bus fare was $60 for an adult and $33 for a child (me) while a plane ticket usually averages $80 but are frequentl on sale for $60. Reason why I chose to take a bus is because I paid for the trip and I don\u2019t get paid very much from work to afford the luxury to fly just as yet.\n\n- I\u2019m 17 years old and this lady seems like she\u2019s 35-45 years old (in other words she might seem like she has some sort of authority over me because I\u2019m young and she\u2019s older)\n\n- I am travelling by myself\n\n\nSo picture this: monday morning at 9:15am 2/3rds of a bus gets filled with people to drive from Melbourne to Adelaide (~800km/500mi). I\u2019m on this bus trip for two main reasons: I have a car in Adelaide that I need to drive back to Melbourne and I also haven\u2019t seen my dad in 4 months aswell (he\u2019s the one who helped me buy the car aswell).\n\nNow up until this point, I have been trying to get in contact with my dad so I can plan this little mini-holiday and how everything will work from registering the car to discussing and fixing all the problems with the car (its an old car).  Notice how I said I was \u2018trying\u2019 to get in contact with my dad - being that he\u2019d lost his phone and hasn\u2019t been able to call me (didn\u2019t know my phone number).\nNow this was all until I called my grandparents who live in the same city as my dad. As it turned out, my father went to his parents house to use their phone to call me, right as I was about to call him. So fair enough, I was on the phone with my dad and we talked.\n\nSoon enough, we\u2019d planned our week ahead and eventually got onto other personal topics because we don\u2019t really call very often. By the time I say goodbye, it was about 11:35am. I was tired from the night before and try to get some rest.\n\nNo more than 15 minutes later, I get a call from my best friend. She was calling to tell me about how she and her parents got into a massive argument over the holiday we\u2019re going on in 9 days. To celebrate our passing of highschool, its tradition for students to go on a holiday somwhere in groups with the main intention to get as drunk as physically possible.\n\nWell, her parents had said that they didn\u2019t want her to go, although we\u2019ve all already paid $1000+ and booked it 6 months ago. Plans were SET, and we were ready to leave. So naturally I spent the next 45 minutes discussing what our course of action was to get around this situation.\n\nNo less than 5 minutes before I\u2019m saying bye to my friend on the phone, this lady sitting on the other side of the aisle to me raises her voice at me saying \n\n\u201care you going to stay on that fucking phone for the whole trip? You\u2019re being so rude!\u201d\n\n\u201cUm hello? How am I rude? I\u2019m talking to my friend and its only 12:30pm. That means daytime. That means people wont be sleeping\u201d\n\nNow I know that there may be some people asleep on the bus. I should know, I almost had a nap before my friend called me. But I\u2019m not sure how I was rude. If you didn\u2019t want this, then you should have flown and not caught a bus.\n\nSo Reddit, am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that a 17-year-old is on a 10-hour bus trip, and they were on the phone for a significant portion of it. The key points are the duration of the phone calls, the setting (bus vs. plane), the age difference with the lady who confronted them, and the reasons behind the calls.\n\nFirst, the user is 17, which is a minor, and they're traveling alone. The bus ride is 10 hours, and they've already been on the phone for 3 hours. The first call was with their dad, which is understandable because they hadn't seen him in 4 months and need to plan car-related stuff. Then, they talk to their friend about a holiday conflict. The lady confronts them, calling them rude for talking so much.\n\nNow, in a public transport setting like a bus, there are usually expectations about noise levels. Even if it's daytime, some people might be trying to rest or work. But the user argues that they were on the phone during the day, and others should have chosen a plane if they wanted privacy. However, buses are generally more communal than planes, where there might be more privacy. Also, the user mentions that they tried to nap before the friend called, so maybe the timing of the calls overlapped with when others might want quiet.\n\nThe user's defense is that they paid for the trip, it's a bus, and if others didn't want to be around phone calls, they should have taken the plane. But this might not be the best reasoning because it's not about the ticket price but about respecting others' space. Even if you paid for a seat, you're still sharing the cabin with others. The lady's outburst about being rude could be justified if the phone calls were disruptive, like loud or long conversations. However, the user did mention trying to get in contact with their dad and discussing important matters, which could be seen as a valid reason.\n\nSo, the question is whether the user was being inconsiderate. The key factors are: the length of the calls (3 hours out of 10), the content (personal matters), and the setting (a bus where people expect a quieter environment). Even if it's daytime, others might not want to hear constant conversation. The user might not be the asshole if they were using a reasonable volume and the calls were necessary, but if they were loud and ignoring others' discomfort, then maybe they are. However, the user's response to the lady was defensive and dismissive, which isn't helpful. The lady's frustration is understandable, but the user's reaction could be seen as dismissive of her feelings.\n\nIn conclusion, while the user had valid reasons for the calls, the combination of the long duration and the setting might mean they were inconsiderate. The answer might be A (the user is in the wrong) because they didn't consider others' comfort, even if their reasons were personal. But if their tone was respectful, maybe B. However, the user's response to the lady was confrontational, which suggests they didn't take her concerns seriously, which could tip the scales towards A.\n"
