I was on the phone for 3 hours of a 10 hour bus trip\nSome notes:\n- this bus fare was $60 for an adult and $33 for a child (me) while a plane ticket usually averages $80 but are frequentl on sale for $60. Reason why I chose to take a bus is because I paid for the trip and I don\u2019t get paid very much from work to afford the luxury to fly just as yet.\n\n- I\u2019m 17 years old and this lady seems like she\u2019s 35-45 years old (in other words she might seem like she has some sort of authority over me because I\u2019m young and she\u2019s older)\n\n- I am travelling by myself\n\n\nSo picture this: monday morning at 9:15am 2/3rds of a bus gets filled with people to drive from Melbourne to Adelaide (~800km/500mi). I\u2019m on this bus trip for two main reasons: I have a car in Adelaide that I need to drive back to Melbourne and I also haven\u2019t seen my dad in 4 months aswell (he\u2019s the one who helped me buy the car aswell).\n\nNow up until this point, I have been trying to get in contact with my dad so I can plan this little mini-holiday and how everything will work from registering the car to discussing and fixing all the problems with the car (its an old car).  Notice how I said I was \u2018trying\u2019 to get in contact with my dad - being that he\u2019d lost his phone and hasn\u2019t been able to call me (didn\u2019t know my phone number).\nNow this was all until I called my grandparents who live in the same city as my dad. As it turned out, my father went to his parents house to use their phone to call me, right as I was about to call him. So fair enough, I was on the phone with my dad and we talked.\n\nSoon enough, we\u2019d planned our week ahead and eventually got onto other personal topics because we don\u2019t really call very often. By the time I say goodbye, it was about 11:35am. I was tired from the night before and try to get some rest.\n\nNo more than 15 minutes later, I get a call from my best friend. She was calling to tell me about how she and her parents got into a massive argument over the holiday we\u2019re going on in 9 days. To celebrate our passing of highschool, its tradition for students to go on a holiday somwhere in groups with the main intention to get as drunk as physically possible.\n\nWell, her parents had said that they didn\u2019t want her to go, although we\u2019ve all already paid $1000+ and booked it 6 months ago. Plans were SET, and we were ready to leave. So naturally I spent the next 45 minutes discussing what our course of action was to get around this situation.\n\nNo less than 5 minutes before I\u2019m saying bye to my friend on the phone, this lady sitting on the other side of the aisle to me raises her voice at me saying \n\n\u201care you going to stay on that fucking phone for the whole trip? You\u2019re being so rude!\u201d\n\n\u201cUm hello? How am I rude? I\u2019m talking to my friend and its only 12:30pm. That means daytime. That means people wont be sleeping\u201d\n\nNow I know that there may be some people asleep on the bus. I should know, I almost had a nap before my friend called me. But I\u2019m not sure how I was rude. If you didn\u2019t want this, then you should have flown and not caught a bus.\n\nSo Reddit, am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author is on a bus trip for 10 hours, and they were on the phone for about 3 hours. The main points are:\n\n1. The author is 17, traveling alone, and chose the bus because it's cheaper than a plane. They mention not being able to afford flying yet.\n2. They needed to talk to their dad because he lost his phone, which is why the call happened. Then they talked to their best friend about a holiday problem.\n3. A lady on the bus got upset and called them out for being rude by talking on the phone.\n\nThe question is whether the author is at fault. Let's break it down. \n\nFirst, bus etiquette: In many shared spaces like buses, it's generally considered courteous to avoid loud phone calls, even during the day. While it's daytime and not everyone might be asleep, others might still want to work, read, or rest. The author's call was about 3 hours, which is a significant portion of the trip. Even if they had a reason, like talking to family and a friend, the volume and duration could be an issue. \n\nHowever, the author mentions that after their nap attempt was interrupted by their friend's call, they were on the phone. The lady's complaint came after the author had already been on the phone for some time. The author also points out that the lady could have chosen a flight if she wanted more privacy, but that's a bit of a stretch because buses are inherently more crowded and shared than planes. \n\nThe key factors here are volume and consideration. If the author was using a headset, maybe it's less of an issue, but the story doesn't mention that. If they were on speakerphone or speaking loudly, that's more disruptive. Also, the length of time might be a factor\u20143 hours is a long time on a 10-hour trip. However, the author had valid reasons (family issues, planning a trip with a friend), which could mitigate the rudeness. \n\nBut in shared public transportation, there's an expectation to be considerate. Even if the author had reasons, they might have been inconsiderate by not using headphones or keeping the volume low. The lady's reaction, while maybe a bit harsh in her wording, is about the disruption caused. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might not be in the wrong if they were speaking normally and not disturbing others. The story doesn't specify if the author was being loud. However, the fact that the lady had to raise her voice suggests that the author's phone call was noticeable enough to be a disturbance. \n\nSo, considering the context, the author might not be entirely in the wrong, but they could have been more considerate. However, the decision between A and B is whether the author is in the wrong. If the community leans towards considering shared spaces and general etiquette, the author might be at fault for not using headphones or keeping the call quiet. Alternatively, if the call wasn't disruptive, then the answer might be B. But given the scenario, the lady's complaint implies that the author was indeed being disruptive. So the answer is probably A.\n"
