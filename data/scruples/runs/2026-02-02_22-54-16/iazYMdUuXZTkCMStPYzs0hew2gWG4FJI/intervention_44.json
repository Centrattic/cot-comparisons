I was on the phone for 3 hours of a 10 hour bus trip\nSome notes:\n- this bus fare was $60 for an adult and $33 for a child (me) while a plane ticket usually averages $80 but are frequentl on sale for $60. Reason why I chose to take a bus is because I paid for the trip and I don\u2019t get paid very much from work to afford the luxury to fly just as yet.\n\n- I\u2019m 17 years old and this lady seems like she\u2019s 35-45 years old (in other words she might seem like she has some sort of authority over me because I\u2019m young and she\u2019s older)\n\n- I am travelling by myself\n\n\nSo picture this: monday morning at 9:15am 2/3rds of a bus gets filled with people to drive from Melbourne to Adelaide (~800km/500mi). I\u2019m on this bus trip for two main reasons: I have a car in Adelaide that I need to drive back to Melbourne and I also haven\u2019t seen my dad in 4 months aswell (he\u2019s the one who helped me buy the car aswell).\n\nNow up until this point, I have been trying to get in contact with my dad so I can plan this little mini-holiday and how everything will work from registering the car to discussing and fixing all the problems with the car (its an old car).  Notice how I said I was \u2018trying\u2019 to get in contact with my dad - being that he\u2019d lost his phone and hasn\u2019t been able to call me (didn\u2019t know my phone number).\nNow this was all until I called my grandparents who live in the same city as my dad. As it turned out, my father went to his parents house to use their phone to call me, right as I was about to call him. So fair enough, I was on the phone with my dad and we talked.\n\nSoon enough, we\u2019d planned our week ahead and eventually got onto other personal topics because we don\u2019t really call very often. By the time I say goodbye, it was about 11:35am. I was tired from the night before and try to get some rest.\n\nNo more than 15 minutes later, I get a call from my best friend. She was calling to tell me about how she and her parents got into a massive argument over the holiday we\u2019re going on in 9 days. To celebrate our passing of highschool, its tradition for students to go on a holiday somwhere in groups with the main intention to get as drunk as physically possible.\n\nWell, her parents had said that they didn\u2019t want her to go, although we\u2019ve all already paid $1000+ and booked it 6 months ago. Plans were SET, and we were ready to leave. So naturally I spent the next 45 minutes discussing what our course of action was to get around this situation.\n\nNo less than 5 minutes before I\u2019m saying bye to my friend on the phone, this lady sitting on the other side of the aisle to me raises her voice at me saying \n\n\u201care you going to stay on that fucking phone for the whole trip? You\u2019re being so rude!\u201d\n\n\u201cUm hello? How am I rude? I\u2019m talking to my friend and its only 12:30pm. That means daytime. That means people wont be sleeping\u201d\n\nNow I know that there may be some people asleep on the bus. I should know, I almost had a nap before my friend called me. But I\u2019m not sure how I was rude. If you didn\u2019t want this, then you should have flown and not caught a bus.\n\nSo Reddit, am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author (the person writing the AITA post) is in the wrong for talking on the phone for three hours on a bus trip. Let me go through the details again.\n\nFirst, the situation: the author is a 17-year-old taking a 10-hour bus ride from Melbourne to Adelaide. They paid $33 for the bus fare, which they mention is cheaper than flying. They're traveling alone. The main points are that they were on the phone for 3 hours, which led to a confrontation with another passenger.\n\nThe author was on the phone with their dad to plan a car-related trip and then with their best friend about a holiday. The lady who confronted them said they were being rude by using the phone so much. The author counters that it's daytime and not everyone is asleep, and that if she didn't want to hear the phone calls, she should have flown instead.\n\nNow, considering the arguments. The author's defense is that they were using their phone during the day, when people are more likely to be awake, and they had valid reasons (planning with family and discussing a planned holiday). The lady's issue might be about the noise disturbing others. But buses are public spaces, and while some people might prefer quiet, others use phones. However, the author was on the phone for a long time, which could be disruptive even in a daytime setting.\n\nBut the author mentions they were using the phone for important, time-sensitive matters\u2014coordinating with their dad who had lost his phone and then discussing a holiday with a friend. The duration might be an issue, but the context is also important. The author is young, traveling alone, and using the phone for necessary communication. The lady's tone seems aggressive (\"fucking phone for the whole trip\"), which might indicate she was particularly bothered. However, the author's response was polite, pointing out that daytime is when people are awake and suggesting that flying would be a better option for a quiet trip.\n\nIn terms of social norms, while it's generally considered polite to not disturb others on public transport, the author had legitimate reasons. The length of the phone call might be a factor, but if the conversation is necessary, it's debatable. The key is whether the author was inconsiderate. They did mention trying to nap before the friend called, so maybe they were aware of others sleeping but chose to take the call. However, the conversation with the friend was about an urgent issue (a disagreement over a planned trip), which adds context.\n\nThe arguments for the author not being in the wrong: the reasons for the calls were valid, they were using daytime when people are usually active, and the confrontation was over a long duration but not during a time when others would expect silence. The lady's accusation of rudeness might be harsh, especially since the author was addressing important matters.\n\nOn the other hand, the author could have used a headset to avoid disturbing others, but that's not mentioned. Also, in a confined space like a bus, loud phone calls can be disruptive regardless of the time. However, the author didn't have malicious intent; they were handling personal business.\n\nConsidering all this, I think the author isn't in the wrong because the reasons for the phone calls were valid and they didn't have ill intent. The lady's reaction might be over the top, especially given the context. So the answer would be B.\n"
