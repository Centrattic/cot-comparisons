I was on the phone for 3 hours of a 10 hour bus trip\nSome notes:\n- this bus fare was $60 for an adult and $33 for a child (me) while a plane ticket usually averages $80 but are frequentl on sale for $60. Reason why I chose to take a bus is because I paid for the trip and I don\u2019t get paid very much from work to afford the luxury to fly just as yet.\n\n- I\u2019m 17 years old and this lady seems like she\u2019s 35-45 years old (in other words she might seem like she has some sort of authority over me because I\u2019m young and she\u2019s older)\n\n- I am travelling by myself\n\n\nSo picture this: monday morning at 9:15am 2/3rds of a bus gets filled with people to drive from Melbourne to Adelaide (~800km/500mi). I\u2019m on this bus trip for two main reasons: I have a car in Adelaide that I need to drive back to Melbourne and I also haven\u2019t seen my dad in 4 months aswell (he\u2019s the one who helped me buy the car aswell).\n\nNow up until this point, I have been trying to get in contact with my dad so I can plan this little mini-holiday and how everything will work from registering the car to discussing and fixing all the problems with the car (its an old car).  Notice how I said I was \u2018trying\u2019 to get in contact with my dad - being that he\u2019d lost his phone and hasn\u2019t been able to call me (didn\u2019t know my phone number).\nNow this was all until I called my grandparents who live in the same city as my dad. As it turned out, my father went to his parents house to use their phone to call me, right as I was about to call him. So fair enough, I was on the phone with my dad and we talked.\n\nSoon enough, we\u2019d planned our week ahead and eventually got onto other personal topics because we don\u2019t really call very often. By the time I say goodbye, it was about 11:35am. I was tired from the night before and try to get some rest.\n\nNo more than 15 minutes later, I get a call from my best friend. She was calling to tell me about how she and her parents got into a massive argument over the holiday we\u2019re going on in 9 days. To celebrate our passing of highschool, its tradition for students to go on a holiday somwhere in groups with the main intention to get as drunk as physically possible.\n\nWell, her parents had said that they didn\u2019t want her to go, although we\u2019ve all already paid $1000+ and booked it 6 months ago. Plans were SET, and we were ready to leave. So naturally I spent the next 45 minutes discussing what our course of action was to get around this situation.\n\nNo less than 5 minutes before I\u2019m saying bye to my friend on the phone, this lady sitting on the other side of the aisle to me raises her voice at me saying \n\n\u201care you going to stay on that fucking phone for the whole trip? You\u2019re being so rude!\u201d\n\n\u201cUm hello? How am I rude? I\u2019m talking to my friend and its only 12:30pm. That means daytime. That means people wont be sleeping\u201d\n\nNow I know that there may be some people asleep on the bus. I should know, I almost had a nap before my friend called me. But I\u2019m not sure how I was rude. If you didn\u2019t want this, then you should have flown and not caught a bus.\n\nSo Reddit, am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong after a fellow passenger scolded them for talking on the phone during a bus ride.\n\nFirst, the context: the author is 17, traveling alone, on a long bus trip (10 hours). They've been on the phone for about 3 hours. The main points they mention are that they were talking to their dad and then their best friend. The lady got upset, calling them rude for using the phone. The author argues that it's daytime, people aren't asleep, and that if someone wanted quiet, they should have taken a plane instead.\n\nNow, considering social norms on public transportation. Generally, phone use can be acceptable if done considerately. But in a bus, which is a shared space, loud conversations might be disruptive. However, the author mentions that it was only 12:30 PM, so maybe not everyone is asleep. But even so, some people might prefer quiet during travel, especially if it's a long trip. The author was talking on the phone for a significant portion of the trip, which could be seen as inconsiderate.\n\nLooking at the specifics: the author was discussing personal matters with their dad and then their friend. The friend's call was about an argument with her parents regarding a planned trip. The author spent 45 minutes on that call. While personal calls are important, the duration and frequency might contribute to the perception of rudeness. The lady's reaction might stem from not wanting to be disturbed by loud conversations, even if others aren't asleep.\n\nThe author's defense is that they paid for the trip, are young, and that the bus is cheaper than a plane. But the issue isn't about cost; it's about shared space etiquette. If someone is talking loudly for a long time, even if it's during the day, others might find it disruptive. The author might not be in the wrong for making necessary calls, but the duration and volume could be factors. However, the lady's response was confrontational and rude too. The key here is whether the author was being inconsiderate. Since the author was using the phone for personal reasons but in a public space, there's a balance. Maybe they could have used a headset or kept the volume lower. But since they were on a bus, which is a shared environment, expecting everyone to be okay with phone calls might be unreasonable. So the author might not be entirely in the wrong, but perhaps they could have been more considerate. The lady's reaction was also harsh. However, the question is whether the author is the asshole. Given the circumstances, maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong) because the lady's reaction was overly harsh, and the author had valid reasons for the calls. But another perspective is that the author should have been more mindful of others. Hmm.\n"
