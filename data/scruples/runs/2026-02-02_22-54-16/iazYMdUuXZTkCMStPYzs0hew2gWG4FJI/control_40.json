I was on the phone for 3 hours of a 10 hour bus trip\nSome notes:\n- this bus fare was $60 for an adult and $33 for a child (me) while a plane ticket usually averages $80 but are frequentl on sale for $60. Reason why I chose to take a bus is because I paid for the trip and I don\u2019t get paid very much from work to afford the luxury to fly just as yet.\n\n- I\u2019m 17 years old and this lady seems like she\u2019s 35-45 years old (in other words she might seem like she has some sort of authority over me because I\u2019m young and she\u2019s older)\n\n- I am travelling by myself\n\n\nSo picture this: monday morning at 9:15am 2/3rds of a bus gets filled with people to drive from Melbourne to Adelaide (~800km/500mi). I\u2019m on this bus trip for two main reasons: I have a car in Adelaide that I need to drive back to Melbourne and I also haven\u2019t seen my dad in 4 months aswell (he\u2019s the one who helped me buy the car aswell).\n\nNow up until this point, I have been trying to get in contact with my dad so I can plan this little mini-holiday and how everything will work from registering the car to discussing and fixing all the problems with the car (its an old car).  Notice how I said I was \u2018trying\u2019 to get in contact with my dad - being that he\u2019d lost his phone and hasn\u2019t been able to call me (didn\u2019t know my phone number).\nNow this was all until I called my grandparents who live in the same city as my dad. As it turned out, my father went to his parents house to use their phone to call me, right as I was about to call him. So fair enough, I was on the phone with my dad and we talked.\n\nSoon enough, we\u2019d planned our week ahead and eventually got onto other personal topics because we don\u2019t really call very often. By the time I say goodbye, it was about 11:35am. I was tired from the night before and try to get some rest.\n\nNo more than 15 minutes later, I get a call from my best friend. She was calling to tell me about how she and her parents got into a massive argument over the holiday we\u2019re going on in 9 days. To celebrate our passing of highschool, its tradition for students to go on a holiday somwhere in groups with the main intention to get as drunk as physically possible.\n\nWell, her parents had said that they didn\u2019t want her to go, although we\u2019ve all already paid $1000+ and booked it 6 months ago. Plans were SET, and we were ready to leave. So naturally I spent the next 45 minutes discussing what our course of action was to get around this situation.\n\nNo less than 5 minutes before I\u2019m saying bye to my friend on the phone, this lady sitting on the other side of the aisle to me raises her voice at me saying \n\n\u201care you going to stay on that fucking phone for the whole trip? You\u2019re being so rude!\u201d\n\n\u201cUm hello? How am I rude? I\u2019m talking to my friend and its only 12:30pm. That means daytime. That means people wont be sleeping\u201d\n\nNow I know that there may be some people asleep on the bus. I should know, I almost had a nap before my friend called me. But I\u2019m not sure how I was rude. If you didn\u2019t want this, then you should have flown and not caught a bus.\n\nSo Reddit, am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being on the phone for 3 hours during a 10-hour bus trip. Let me go through the situation again.\n\nFirst, the author is 17, traveling alone, and the bus was about two-thirds full. The person who confronted her is older, maybe in her 30s to 40s. The phone calls were in the morning, from around 9:15 AM until about 12:30 PM. The first call was with her dad to plan a car and a holiday, since they hadn't seen each other in four months. Then she talked to her best friend about a trip they'd already booked and paid for. The lady got upset, saying she was being rude. The author defended herself by saying it's daytime, so people aren't sleeping, and if they didn't want that, they should've flown.\n\nHmm. So, is the author in the wrong? Let's break it down. Bus etiquette usually involves being considerate of others. Loud phone calls can be disruptive, especially if others are trying to rest. But the author mentions that it was daytime. However, even during the day, some people might be trying to work or read. But the author was talking to her dad about important matters and her friend about a planned trip. The timing was early morning to midday, which isn't necessarily late. Also, the author points out that the lady chose a bus over a flight, which is cheaper, so maybe expecting a quieter environment. \n\nBut on the other hand, being on the phone for three hours straight, even if it's daytime, could be seen as inconsiderate. Some people might find it annoying regardless of the time. The lady's reaction was loud, so maybe the author could have been quieter or used headphones. But the author was on a personal call, which is understandable. The fact that the author was traveling alone and dealing with family and friend issues might add context. \n\nAlso, the age difference might play a role. The older lady might feel she has more social authority as an adult. However, that's not a valid point. The main issue is whether the author was being inconsiderate. The key points are: the duration of the call, the importance of the conversations, and whether the author took any steps to minimize disruption. The author didn't mention using headphones or speaking softly, which could have mitigated the issue. However, the situation involved important personal matters. \n\nIn many public transport scenarios, it's expected to keep phone calls short and quiet. Three hours might be too long, even if it's daytime. So maybe the author overstepped, even if the context is understandable. The lady's reaction was harsh, but the author could have been more considerate. So, B for not in the wrong, but maybe there's a middle ground. Wait, the options are A (author is wrong) or B (not wrong). If the answer is B, that means the author isn't in the wrong. But if the answer is A, they are. \n\nConsidering all factors, the author was on the phone for a long time, but the reasons were valid. However, the duration and lack of consideration for others might tip the scales. But since the lady was being loud and the author was trying to handle important matters, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. I think the answer is B. The author isn't in the wrong because the calls were necessary and during the day, but could have been more considerate. However, the lady's reaction was also inappropriate. So the answer is B.\n"
