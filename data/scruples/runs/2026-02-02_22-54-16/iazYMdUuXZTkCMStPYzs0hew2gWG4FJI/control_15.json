I was on the phone for 3 hours of a 10 hour bus trip\nSome notes:\n- this bus fare was $60 for an adult and $33 for a child (me) while a plane ticket usually averages $80 but are frequentl on sale for $60. Reason why I chose to take a bus is because I paid for the trip and I don\u2019t get paid very much from work to afford the luxury to fly just as yet.\n\n- I\u2019m 17 years old and this lady seems like she\u2019s 35-45 years old (in other words she might seem like she has some sort of authority over me because I\u2019m young and she\u2019s older)\n\n- I am travelling by myself\n\n\nSo picture this: monday morning at 9:15am 2/3rds of a bus gets filled with people to drive from Melbourne to Adelaide (~800km/500mi). I\u2019m on this bus trip for two main reasons: I have a car in Adelaide that I need to drive back to Melbourne and I also haven\u2019t seen my dad in 4 months aswell (he\u2019s the one who helped me buy the car aswell).\n\nNow up until this point, I have been trying to get in contact with my dad so I can plan this little mini-holiday and how everything will work from registering the car to discussing and fixing all the problems with the car (its an old car).  Notice how I said I was \u2018trying\u2019 to get in contact with my dad - being that he\u2019d lost his phone and hasn\u2019t been able to call me (didn\u2019t know my phone number).\nNow this was all until I called my grandparents who live in the same city as my dad. As it turned out, my father went to his parents house to use their phone to call me, right as I was about to call him. So fair enough, I was on the phone with my dad and we talked.\n\nSoon enough, we\u2019d planned our week ahead and eventually got onto other personal topics because we don\u2019t really call very often. By the time I say goodbye, it was about 11:35am. I was tired from the night before and try to get some rest.\n\nNo more than 15 minutes later, I get a call from my best friend. She was calling to tell me about how she and her parents got into a massive argument over the holiday we\u2019re going on in 9 days. To celebrate our passing of highschool, its tradition for students to go on a holiday somwhere in groups with the main intention to get as drunk as physically possible.\n\nWell, her parents had said that they didn\u2019t want her to go, although we\u2019ve all already paid $1000+ and booked it 6 months ago. Plans were SET, and we were ready to leave. So naturally I spent the next 45 minutes discussing what our course of action was to get around this situation.\n\nNo less than 5 minutes before I\u2019m saying bye to my friend on the phone, this lady sitting on the other side of the aisle to me raises her voice at me saying \n\n\u201care you going to stay on that fucking phone for the whole trip? You\u2019re being so rude!\u201d\n\n\u201cUm hello? How am I rude? I\u2019m talking to my friend and its only 12:30pm. That means daytime. That means people wont be sleeping\u201d\n\nNow I know that there may be some people asleep on the bus. I should know, I almost had a nap before my friend called me. But I\u2019m not sure how I was rude. If you didn\u2019t want this, then you should have flown and not caught a bus.\n\nSo Reddit, am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author is a 17-year-old traveling alone on a 10-hour bus trip. They were on the phone for 3 hours. The first call was with their dad, which makes sense because they hadn't seen him in 4 months and needed to plan things with the car. Then they talked to their best friend about a holiday argument. The lady next to them got upset and told them they were being rude.\n\nNow, the key points here. The bus is full, 2/3 capacity. The author is using a phone during the day, around noon. The lady complained about being loud. But the author argues that it's daytime, so people aren't sleeping. The author also mentions they paid a lower fare as a child, so maybe they feel it's justified. They also note that they were trying to get in touch with their dad, which is important.\n\nI need to consider etiquette on public transport. Generally, loud phone calls are considered rude because they disturb others, even if it's daytime. However, the author's situation might be excused because they were discussing important matters\u2014family and a friend's issue. But the problem is the volume and duration. Even if it's daytime, a 3-hour phone call could be disruptive. Also, the author didn't mention using headphones or keeping the volume low, which are common ways to avoid disturbing others.\n\nThe lady's complaint might be about the noise level rather than the duration. Even if you're on a phone call, being loud enough that others can hear is considered rude. The author's response was defensive, suggesting that the lady shouldn't have taken the bus if she didn't want to hear people. That's a bit confrontational and might not be the best approach. However, the author's reasons for the calls are valid. \n\nSo, who's in the wrong? The author might be at fault for not being considerate of others' space and volume, even if the calls were necessary. But the lady's approach was harsh, using a swear word and accusing the author without asking them to lower their voice first. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Public etiquette usually expects people to minimize disturbances. The author's actions, while understandable, might still be considered rude due to the loudness and duration. However, the lady's response was also inappropriate. \n\nIn Reddit's AITA context, sometimes the person is not the asshole if their actions are justified by valid reasons. But the author didn't use headphones or ask if it was okay, which are common courtesies. So maybe the author did something wrong but not entirely in the wrong. Alternatively, the lady overreacted. \n\nHmm. I think the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because they had valid reasons and the lady's response was more extreme. But wait, the author should have been considerate. Maybe the author is partially at fault but not entirely. However, in AITA, the answer is usually A or B. If the author did something wrong, even a little, but the lady overreacted, the answer might still be B. Or if the author's actions were clearly rude, then A. \n\nI think the key is that the author didn't mention using headphones or lowering their voice. If they were on speakerphone or loud, that's rude. So maybe the author is in the wrong. But if they were just talking normally, then maybe not. The story doesn't specify, but the lady called them out, so maybe the volume was an issue. \n\nGiven that, the author should have been more considerate. So answer A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because they didn't take steps to avoid disturbing others, even if their reasons were valid. But the lady's harsh reaction is also a problem. But the question is about the author's actions. So if the author was using a phone in a way that disturbed others, even if valid, they're in the wrong. So answer A.\n"
