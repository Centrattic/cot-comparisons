I was on the phone for 3 hours of a 10 hour bus trip\nSome notes:\n- this bus fare was $60 for an adult and $33 for a child (me) while a plane ticket usually averages $80 but are frequentl on sale for $60. Reason why I chose to take a bus is because I paid for the trip and I don\u2019t get paid very much from work to afford the luxury to fly just as yet.\n\n- I\u2019m 17 years old and this lady seems like she\u2019s 35-45 years old (in other words she might seem like she has some sort of authority over me because I\u2019m young and she\u2019s older)\n\n- I am travelling by myself\n\n\nSo picture this: monday morning at 9:15am 2/3rds of a bus gets filled with people to drive from Melbourne to Adelaide (~800km/500mi). I\u2019m on this bus trip for two main reasons: I have a car in Adelaide that I need to drive back to Melbourne and I also haven\u2019t seen my dad in 4 months aswell (he\u2019s the one who helped me buy the car aswell).\n\nNow up until this point, I have been trying to get in contact with my dad so I can plan this little mini-holiday and how everything will work from registering the car to discussing and fixing all the problems with the car (its an old car).  Notice how I said I was \u2018trying\u2019 to get in contact with my dad - being that he\u2019d lost his phone and hasn\u2019t been able to call me (didn\u2019t know my phone number).\nNow this was all until I called my grandparents who live in the same city as my dad. As it turned out, my father went to his parents house to use their phone to call me, right as I was about to call him. So fair enough, I was on the phone with my dad and we talked.\n\nSoon enough, we\u2019d planned our week ahead and eventually got onto other personal topics because we don\u2019t really call very often. By the time I say goodbye, it was about 11:35am. I was tired from the night before and try to get some rest.\n\nNo more than 15 minutes later, I get a call from my best friend. She was calling to tell me about how she and her parents got into a massive argument over the holiday we\u2019re going on in 9 days. To celebrate our passing of highschool, its tradition for students to go on a holiday somwhere in groups with the main intention to get as drunk as physically possible.\n\nWell, her parents had said that they didn\u2019t want her to go, although we\u2019ve all already paid $1000+ and booked it 6 months ago. Plans were SET, and we were ready to leave. So naturally I spent the next 45 minutes discussing what our course of action was to get around this situation.\n\nNo less than 5 minutes before I\u2019m saying bye to my friend on the phone, this lady sitting on the other side of the aisle to me raises her voice at me saying \n\n\u201care you going to stay on that fucking phone for the whole trip? You\u2019re being so rude!\u201d\n\n\u201cUm hello? How am I rude? I\u2019m talking to my friend and its only 12:30pm. That means daytime. That means people wont be sleeping\u201d\n\nNow I know that there may be some people asleep on the bus. I should know, I almost had a nap before my friend called me. But I\u2019m not sure how I was rude. If you didn\u2019t want this, then you should have flown and not caught a bus.\n\nSo Reddit, am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves a 17-year-old taking a 10-hour bus trip, using their phone for three hours. Let's break down the details.\n\nFirst, the person chose the bus because it's cheaper; they mention the cost difference between bus and plane. They had a valid reason to be on the phone\u2014talking to their dad and then their best friend about a holiday. The conversation with the dad was necessary for planning, and the friend call was about resolving a conflict regarding the trip. \n\nThe woman who confronted them said it was rude to use the phone so much. But the person argues that it's daytime, so not everyone is sleeping. They also mention that if people wanted a quiet environment, they should have flown. \n\nNow, considering bus etiquette. Typically, in shared spaces like buses, people expect a certain level of quiet, especially during longer trips. However, using a phone isn't inherently rude if it's not disturbing others. The key factors here are whether the phone use was disruptive. The writer mentions that they were on the phone for three hours, but the bus was already two-thirds full. \n\nThe woman's reaction\u2014raising her voice and calling them rude\u2014might be considered aggressive. The writer's response was defensive but reasonable. They were on the phone for legitimate reasons, and it's possible they weren't using loudspeaker mode or talking loudly. Also, the fact that they were tired and tried to nap before the friend call suggests they weren't oblivious to the surroundings.\n\nAnother angle: the age difference. The writer is 17, and the woman is in her 30s/40s. The woman might have felt she had authority to reprimand, but that doesn't justify her outburst. The writer's main mistake, if any, could be not being aware of their volume, but the scenario doesn't indicate that they were. \n\nThe writer's explanation for using the phone is understandable. They had necessary and important calls. In such cases, the general rule is to be considerate, but the woman's reaction was confrontational. \n\nSo, considering all these points, the author isn't in the wrong. The woman's reaction was unwarranted, and the writer had valid reasons for their phone use. The key is whether the phone use was disruptive. Since the writer didn't mention being loud or using speaker mode, and it was daytime, they weren't necessarily at fault. So the answer is B.\n"
