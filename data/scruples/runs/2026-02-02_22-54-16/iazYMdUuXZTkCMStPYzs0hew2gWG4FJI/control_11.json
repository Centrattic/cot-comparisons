I was on the phone for 3 hours of a 10 hour bus trip\nSome notes:\n- this bus fare was $60 for an adult and $33 for a child (me) while a plane ticket usually averages $80 but are frequentl on sale for $60. Reason why I chose to take a bus is because I paid for the trip and I don\u2019t get paid very much from work to afford the luxury to fly just as yet.\n\n- I\u2019m 17 years old and this lady seems like she\u2019s 35-45 years old (in other words she might seem like she has some sort of authority over me because I\u2019m young and she\u2019s older)\n\n- I am travelling by myself\n\n\nSo picture this: monday morning at 9:15am 2/3rds of a bus gets filled with people to drive from Melbourne to Adelaide (~800km/500mi). I\u2019m on this bus trip for two main reasons: I have a car in Adelaide that I need to drive back to Melbourne and I also haven\u2019t seen my dad in 4 months aswell (he\u2019s the one who helped me buy the car aswell).\n\nNow up until this point, I have been trying to get in contact with my dad so I can plan this little mini-holiday and how everything will work from registering the car to discussing and fixing all the problems with the car (its an old car).  Notice how I said I was \u2018trying\u2019 to get in contact with my dad - being that he\u2019d lost his phone and hasn\u2019t been able to call me (didn\u2019t know my phone number).\nNow this was all until I called my grandparents who live in the same city as my dad. As it turned out, my father went to his parents house to use their phone to call me, right as I was about to call him. So fair enough, I was on the phone with my dad and we talked.\n\nSoon enough, we\u2019d planned our week ahead and eventually got onto other personal topics because we don\u2019t really call very often. By the time I say goodbye, it was about 11:35am. I was tired from the night before and try to get some rest.\n\nNo more than 15 minutes later, I get a call from my best friend. She was calling to tell me about how she and her parents got into a massive argument over the holiday we\u2019re going on in 9 days. To celebrate our passing of highschool, its tradition for students to go on a holiday somwhere in groups with the main intention to get as drunk as physically possible.\n\nWell, her parents had said that they didn\u2019t want her to go, although we\u2019ve all already paid $1000+ and booked it 6 months ago. Plans were SET, and we were ready to leave. So naturally I spent the next 45 minutes discussing what our course of action was to get around this situation.\n\nNo less than 5 minutes before I\u2019m saying bye to my friend on the phone, this lady sitting on the other side of the aisle to me raises her voice at me saying \n\n\u201care you going to stay on that fucking phone for the whole trip? You\u2019re being so rude!\u201d\n\n\u201cUm hello? How am I rude? I\u2019m talking to my friend and its only 12:30pm. That means daytime. That means people wont be sleeping\u201d\n\nNow I know that there may be some people asleep on the bus. I should know, I almost had a nap before my friend called me. But I\u2019m not sure how I was rude. If you didn\u2019t want this, then you should have flown and not caught a bus.\n\nSo Reddit, am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author, a 17-year-old, was on the phone for three hours during a 10-hour bus trip. They had a valid reason\u2014talking to their dad and then their best friend about a planned holiday. The lady complained about being rude.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Bus etiquette usually implies that you shouldn't talk loudly on the phone during the trip, especially if people are trying to sleep. But the author mentioned it was daytime when the conversation happened, around 12:30pm. They also said they were almost asleep before the call but don't know how they were rude.\n\nThe author is traveling alone, which might add to the pressure of needing to talk to family and friends. They also had a financial reason to take the bus instead of a flight. The lady might have been annoyed by the phone use, but is that the author's fault? Did they do something objectively wrong?\n\nOn one hand, phone calls on buses can be disruptive. Even if it's daytime, some people might be trying to rest, especially on a long trip. The author didn't mention using headphones or keeping the volume low, which could be a factor. On the other hand, the author had important reasons for the calls, and the lady's reaction was loud and confrontational. The author's response was defensive, pointing out the time of day and suggesting flying if the lady wanted quiet.\n\nI think the key points are: 1) Using a phone on a bus isn't unheard of, especially during the day, but it's generally expected to be considerate. 2) The author's reasons for the calls were valid. 3) The lady's reaction was harsh, but the author might have been inconsiderate by not using headphones or keeping the conversation quiet. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? I think maybe partially. They could have been more considerate, but the lady's response was also inappropriate. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the author was on the phone for an extended period in a public space and didn't mention using headphones, it's possible they were being inconsiderate. But given the circumstances (important conversations, daytime), maybe not entirely. \n\nReddit's \"Am I the Asshole\" usually considers intent and context. The author didn't intentionally be rude, but maybe should have been aware of others. The answer might be B (No), but I'm a bit torn. The lady's reaction was harsh, but the author's actions were somewhat inconsiderate. I think the answer leans towards B, as the author isn't the asshole, but could have handled it better.\n"
