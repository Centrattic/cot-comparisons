I was on the phone for 3 hours of a 10 hour bus trip\nSome notes:\n- this bus fare was $60 for an adult and $33 for a child (me) while a plane ticket usually averages $80 but are frequentl on sale for $60. Reason why I chose to take a bus is because I paid for the trip and I don\u2019t get paid very much from work to afford the luxury to fly just as yet.\n\n- I\u2019m 17 years old and this lady seems like she\u2019s 35-45 years old (in other words she might seem like she has some sort of authority over me because I\u2019m young and she\u2019s older)\n\n- I am travelling by myself\n\n\nSo picture this: monday morning at 9:15am 2/3rds of a bus gets filled with people to drive from Melbourne to Adelaide (~800km/500mi). I\u2019m on this bus trip for two main reasons: I have a car in Adelaide that I need to drive back to Melbourne and I also haven\u2019t seen my dad in 4 months aswell (he\u2019s the one who helped me buy the car aswell).\n\nNow up until this point, I have been trying to get in contact with my dad so I can plan this little mini-holiday and how everything will work from registering the car to discussing and fixing all the problems with the car (its an old car).  Notice how I said I was \u2018trying\u2019 to get in contact with my dad - being that he\u2019d lost his phone and hasn\u2019t been able to call me (didn\u2019t know my phone number).\nNow this was all until I called my grandparents who live in the same city as my dad. As it turned out, my father went to his parents house to use their phone to call me, right as I was about to call him. So fair enough, I was on the phone with my dad and we talked.\n\nSoon enough, we\u2019d planned our week ahead and eventually got onto other personal topics because we don\u2019t really call very often. By the time I say goodbye, it was about 11:35am. I was tired from the night before and try to get some rest.\n\nNo more than 15 minutes later, I get a call from my best friend. She was calling to tell me about how she and her parents got into a massive argument over the holiday we\u2019re going on in 9 days. To celebrate our passing of highschool, its tradition for students to go on a holiday somwhere in groups with the main intention to get as drunk as physically possible.\n\nWell, her parents had said that they didn\u2019t want her to go, although we\u2019ve all already paid $1000+ and booked it 6 months ago. Plans were SET, and we were ready to leave. So naturally I spent the next 45 minutes discussing what our course of action was to get around this situation.\n\nNo less than 5 minutes before I\u2019m saying bye to my friend on the phone, this lady sitting on the other side of the aisle to me raises her voice at me saying \n\n\u201care you going to stay on that fucking phone for the whole trip? You\u2019re being so rude!\u201d\n\n\u201cUm hello? How am I rude? I\u2019m talking to my friend and its only 12:30pm. That means daytime. That means people wont be sleeping\u201d\n\nNow I know that there may be some people asleep on the bus. I should know, I almost had a nap before my friend called me. But I\u2019m not sure how I was rude. If you didn\u2019t want this, then you should have flown and not caught a bus.\n\nSo Reddit, am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that they were on a bus trip for 10 hours, and they were on the phone for 3 hours. The lady got angry and called them rude. \n\nFirst, the author mentions that they were talking to their dad first, then their best friend. The reason for the calls was important: coordinating with their dad about a car and discussing a planned holiday. The author also notes that it was daytime, around 12:30 pm, so maybe people weren't expecting to sleep. They also mention that they tried to rest before the friend called, but after that, they were on the phone.\n\nNow, the key points here. The author is 17, traveling alone, and had a legitimate need to communicate. The bus was 2/3 full, so there were other people, but maybe not everyone was asleep. The lady's complaint was about being rude for talking on the phone. But the author argues that if people didn't want that, they should have taken a flight instead. \n\nI think the issue here is about expectations on public transport. Bus rides, especially long ones, can be noisy. People might expect some noise, but if someone is talking loudly, it can disrupt others. However, the author was on the phone during the day, not the night. Some people might be working or resting on the bus, but the author had a valid reason for their calls. \n\nAlso, the author didn't mention using a headset, which might have been more considerate. But the lady's reaction was yelling, which is also unkind. The author's response was defensive, which is understandable. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The author had a reason to be on the phone, and it was daytime. However, being on the phone for 3 hours might be seen as inconsiderate to others. But since the author wasn't disturbing others (as they were in the middle of the day and the bus wasn't full), maybe they're not in the wrong. The lady's outburst was uncalled for. \n\nSo I think the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
