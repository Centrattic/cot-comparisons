I was on the phone for 3 hours of a 10 hour bus trip\nSome notes:\n- this bus fare was $60 for an adult and $33 for a child (me) while a plane ticket usually averages $80 but are frequentl on sale for $60. Reason why I chose to take a bus is because I paid for the trip and I don\u2019t get paid very much from work to afford the luxury to fly just as yet.\n\n- I\u2019m 17 years old and this lady seems like she\u2019s 35-45 years old (in other words she might seem like she has some sort of authority over me because I\u2019m young and she\u2019s older)\n\n- I am travelling by myself\n\n\nSo picture this: monday morning at 9:15am 2/3rds of a bus gets filled with people to drive from Melbourne to Adelaide (~800km/500mi). I\u2019m on this bus trip for two main reasons: I have a car in Adelaide that I need to drive back to Melbourne and I also haven\u2019t seen my dad in 4 months aswell (he\u2019s the one who helped me buy the car aswell).\n\nNow up until this point, I have been trying to get in contact with my dad so I can plan this little mini-holiday and how everything will work from registering the car to discussing and fixing all the problems with the car (its an old car).  Notice how I said I was \u2018trying\u2019 to get in contact with my dad - being that he\u2019d lost his phone and hasn\u2019t been able to call me (didn\u2019t know my phone number).\nNow this was all until I called my grandparents who live in the same city as my dad. As it turned out, my father went to his parents house to use their phone to call me, right as I was about to call him. So fair enough, I was on the phone with my dad and we talked.\n\nSoon enough, we\u2019d planned our week ahead and eventually got onto other personal topics because we don\u2019t really call very often. By the time I say goodbye, it was about 11:35am. I was tired from the night before and try to get some rest.\n\nNo more than 15 minutes later, I get a call from my best friend. She was calling to tell me about how she and her parents got into a massive argument over the holiday we\u2019re going on in 9 days. To celebrate our passing of highschool, its tradition for students to go on a holiday somwhere in groups with the main intention to get as drunk as physically possible.\n\nWell, her parents had said that they didn\u2019t want her to go, although we\u2019ve all already paid $1000+ and booked it 6 months ago. Plans were SET, and we were ready to leave. So naturally I spent the next 45 minutes discussing what our course of action was to get around this situation.\n\nNo less than 5 minutes before I\u2019m saying bye to my friend on the phone, this lady sitting on the other side of the aisle to me raises her voice at me saying \n\n\u201care you going to stay on that fucking phone for the whole trip? You\u2019re being so rude!\u201d\n\n\u201cUm hello? How am I rude? I\u2019m talking to my friend and its only 12:30pm. That means daytime. That means people wont be sleeping\u201d\n\nNow I know that there may be some people asleep on the bus. I should know, I almost had a nap before my friend called me. But I\u2019m not sure how I was rude. If you didn\u2019t want this, then you should have flown and not caught a bus.\n\nSo Reddit, am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a young person on a bus trip who used their phone for a long time and was criticized by another passenger. \n\nFirst, the writer is 17 years old and traveling alone. They paid for the trip themselves, which was a budget choice since they don't get paid much. The bus is a 10-hour trip, and they were on the phone for 3 hours. The main points here are the reasons for the phone calls and the context of the situation.\n\nThe phone calls were with their dad, who had lost his phone and they were trying to coordinate plans. Then there was a call with a friend about a holiday they already paid for and the potential conflict with the friend's parents. The friend's parents are opposing the trip, which is a significant issue. The writer spent 45 minutes discussing this with their friend.\n\nThe other passenger, an older woman, got angry and called them rude. The writer responds by saying that it's daytime, so people shouldn't be sleeping. They also mention that the woman could have flown if she wanted privacy. \n\nNow, considering the social norms and etiquette on public transport. Generally, loud phone calls can be disruptive, but there's also context. The writer had valid reasons for the calls\u2014family coordination and discussing a major event. The timing was early afternoon, not late at night, so maybe not the worst time. However, the duration of 3 hours is a lot. \n\nBut the key factors here are the necessity of the calls and the fact that the writer was using a budget option because of financial constraints. The other passenger's outburst seems harsh. The writer didn't mention using a headset or keeping their voice down, which could be a point, but the situation involves important family and friend matters. \n\nAlso, the writer's rebuttal about people choosing a bus over a flight is a bit defensive but not entirely off. The woman's choice to take a bus might imply she expects some level of shared space, but the writer's actions weren't inconsiderate given their reasons. \n\nSo, considering all that, the writer's actions were necessary for coordinating important plans and maintaining relationships. The outburst from the woman was uncalled for, and the writer wasn't inconsiderate beyond a reasonable extent. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
