I was on the phone for 3 hours of a 10 hour bus trip\nSome notes:\n- this bus fare was $60 for an adult and $33 for a child (me) while a plane ticket usually averages $80 but are frequentl on sale for $60. Reason why I chose to take a bus is because I paid for the trip and I don\u2019t get paid very much from work to afford the luxury to fly just as yet.\n\n- I\u2019m 17 years old and this lady seems like she\u2019s 35-45 years old (in other words she might seem like she has some sort of authority over me because I\u2019m young and she\u2019s older)\n\n- I am travelling by myself\n\n\nSo picture this: monday morning at 9:15am 2/3rds of a bus gets filled with people to drive from Melbourne to Adelaide (~800km/500mi). I\u2019m on this bus trip for two main reasons: I have a car in Adelaide that I need to drive back to Melbourne and I also haven\u2019t seen my dad in 4 months aswell (he\u2019s the one who helped me buy the car aswell).\n\nNow up until this point, I have been trying to get in contact with my dad so I can plan this little mini-holiday and how everything will work from registering the car to discussing and fixing all the problems with the car (its an old car).  Notice how I said I was \u2018trying\u2019 to get in contact with my dad - being that he\u2019d lost his phone and hasn\u2019t been able to call me (didn\u2019t know my phone number).\nNow this was all until I called my grandparents who live in the same city as my dad. As it turned out, my father went to his parents house to use their phone to call me, right as I was about to call him. So fair enough, I was on the phone with my dad and we talked.\n\nSoon enough, we\u2019d planned our week ahead and eventually got onto other personal topics because we don\u2019t really call very often. By the time I say goodbye, it was about 11:35am. I was tired from the night before and try to get some rest.\n\nNo more than 15 minutes later, I get a call from my best friend. She was calling to tell me about how she and her parents got into a massive argument over the holiday we\u2019re going on in 9 days. To celebrate our passing of highschool, its tradition for students to go on a holiday somwhere in groups with the main intention to get as drunk as physically possible.\n\nWell, her parents had said that they didn\u2019t want her to go, although we\u2019ve all already paid $1000+ and booked it 6 months ago. Plans were SET, and we were ready to leave. So naturally I spent the next 45 minutes discussing what our course of action was to get around this situation.\n\nNo less than 5 minutes before I\u2019m saying bye to my friend on the phone, this lady sitting on the other side of the aisle to me raises her voice at me saying \n\n\u201care you going to stay on that fucking phone for the whole trip? You\u2019re being so rude!\u201d\n\n\u201cUm hello? How am I rude? I\u2019m talking to my friend and its only 12:30pm. That means daytime. That means people wont be sleeping\u201d\n\nNow I know that there may be some people asleep on the bus. I should know, I almost had a nap before my friend called me. But I\u2019m not sure how I was rude. If you didn\u2019t want this, then you should have flown and not caught a bus.\n\nSo Reddit, am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a 17-year-old on a 10-hour bus trip who was on the phone for three hours. The main points from the scenario are:\n\nFirst, the person chose the bus because it's cheaper than a flight, which makes sense given their financial situation. They mention being 17 and traveling alone, which might make them feel more vulnerable. The bus was over half full when they boarded, so there were people around.\n\nThey were on the phone with their dad first, trying to sort out car arrangements and planning a trip. Then their best friend called about a conflict with parents regarding a holiday. The conversation lasted about 45 minutes. The other passenger got upset around 12:30 PM, which the author points out is daytime, so not everyone would be sleeping. The author's argument is that the lady should have flown if she wanted more peace.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong, I need to consider bus etiquette. Generally, on buses, especially long ones, it's expected to be considerate of others. While daytime is not nap time, loud conversations can be disruptive. However, the author was talking on the phone, not using a speakerphone or being excessively loud. The situation is that the author was engaged in necessary conversations\u2014first with their dad about important matters and then with their friend about a planned trip. The lady's reaction was yelling, which is not ideal.\n\nBut the key factors here are the volume and whether others were disturbed. The author mentions that they were on the phone, not shouting, and the time of day. If the bus is not a quiet zone, maybe it's acceptable. However, in a public transport setting, even during the day, some people might want to read, work, or rest. The author doesn't mention using headphones or trying to minimize noise, which could have been a consideration. But given the circumstances, talking on a phone isn't inherently rude unless it's loud or disruptive. The lady's reaction is aggressive, but the author isn't necessarily wrong for having necessary conversations. They also point out financial constraints as a reason for choosing the bus. \n\nConsidering all this, it's more about the lady's overreaction than the author's fault. The author might have been considerate enough, and the lady's outburst is unkind. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
