I was on the phone for 3 hours of a 10 hour bus trip\nSome notes:\n- this bus fare was $60 for an adult and $33 for a child (me) while a plane ticket usually averages $80 but are frequentl on sale for $60. Reason why I chose to take a bus is because I paid for the trip and I don\u2019t get paid very much from work to afford the luxury to fly just as yet.\n\n- I\u2019m 17 years old and this lady seems like she\u2019s 35-45 years old (in other words she might seem like she has some sort of authority over me because I\u2019m young and she\u2019s older)\n\n- I am travelling by myself\n\n\nSo picture this: monday morning at 9:15am 2/3rds of a bus gets filled with people to drive from Melbourne to Adelaide (~800km/500mi). I\u2019m on this bus trip for two main reasons: I have a car in Adelaide that I need to drive back to Melbourne and I also haven\u2019t seen my dad in 4 months aswell (he\u2019s the one who helped me buy the car aswell).\n\nNow up until this point, I have been trying to get in contact with my dad so I can plan this little mini-holiday and how everything will work from registering the car to discussing and fixing all the problems with the car (its an old car).  Notice how I said I was \u2018trying\u2019 to get in contact with my dad - being that he\u2019d lost his phone and hasn\u2019t been able to call me (didn\u2019t know my phone number).\nNow this was all until I called my grandparents who live in the same city as my dad. As it turned out, my father went to his parents house to use their phone to call me, right as I was about to call him. So fair enough, I was on the phone with my dad and we talked.\n\nSoon enough, we\u2019d planned our week ahead and eventually got onto other personal topics because we don\u2019t really call very often. By the time I say goodbye, it was about 11:35am. I was tired from the night before and try to get some rest.\n\nNo more than 15 minutes later, I get a call from my best friend. She was calling to tell me about how she and her parents got into a massive argument over the holiday we\u2019re going on in 9 days. To celebrate our passing of highschool, its tradition for students to go on a holiday somwhere in groups with the main intention to get as drunk as physically possible.\n\nWell, her parents had said that they didn\u2019t want her to go, although we\u2019ve all already paid $1000+ and booked it 6 months ago. Plans were SET, and we were ready to leave. So naturally I spent the next 45 minutes discussing what our course of action was to get around this situation.\n\nNo less than 5 minutes before I\u2019m saying bye to my friend on the phone, this lady sitting on the other side of the aisle to me raises her voice at me saying \n\n\u201care you going to stay on that fucking phone for the whole trip? You\u2019re being so rude!\u201d\n\n\u201cUm hello? How am I rude? I\u2019m talking to my friend and its only 12:30pm. That means daytime. That means people wont be sleeping\u201d\n\nNow I know that there may be some people asleep on the bus. I should know, I almost had a nap before my friend called me. But I\u2019m not sure how I was rude. If you didn\u2019t want this, then you should have flown and not caught a bus.\n\nSo Reddit, am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a 17-year-old taking a bus trip and using their phone for two calls, which lasted a total of about 3 hours. The key points here are the timing, the reason for the calls, and the lady's reaction.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that they paid for the trip and can't afford a plane. So, they're trying to save money, which is a valid reason. The first call was with their dad to plan a week, including a car they bought together. That seems important and necessary. The second call with their best friend was about a holiday they've all paid for and planned, which is a big deal for them. The friend's parents had just argued, so the author probably wanted to help figure out a solution.\n\nNow, the lady got upset because the author was on the phone for a long time. But the author points out that it's daytime (12:30pm), and they were talking before trying to rest. Buses are public transport, and while it's common to expect quiet in the evening, daytime is usually when people might talk. The author didn't mention using loud speakers, so they might have been on speaker or just talking normally. However, even if they weren't, the lady's outburst could be seen as rude.\n\nThe question is whether the author was wrong. They were using their phone for legitimate reasons, but maybe could have been more considerate. But the lady's reaction was harsh. The author's reasoning is that if someone doesn't want to hear conversations, they should have chosen a private option like a plane. So, there's a bit of a debate here. \n\nIn general, on public transport, people have different expectations. Some might be okay with some noise during the day, but others get annoyed. The author didn't block the call, which might have been a consideration, but they also had a right to communicate. The lady's language was aggressive, which is unkind. The author's response was defensive, which is natural, but maybe the lady had a point if the volume was high. However, the author's situation seems valid and not malicious. \n\nSo, the answer is B. The author isn't in the wrong because they had a good reason to be on the phone, and the lady's reaction was more about personal annoyance than a justified complaint. But it's a bit of a gray area. The main thing is that the author was trying to make the most of their budget and had important conversations, which is understandable. The lady's outburst was uncalled for unless the author was being inconsiderate beyond just talking on the phone during the day.\n"
