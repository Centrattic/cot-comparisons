I was on the phone for 3 hours of a 10 hour bus trip\nSome notes:\n- this bus fare was $60 for an adult and $33 for a child (me) while a plane ticket usually averages $80 but are frequentl on sale for $60. Reason why I chose to take a bus is because I paid for the trip and I don\u2019t get paid very much from work to afford the luxury to fly just as yet.\n\n- I\u2019m 17 years old and this lady seems like she\u2019s 35-45 years old (in other words she might seem like she has some sort of authority over me because I\u2019m young and she\u2019s older)\n\n- I am travelling by myself\n\n\nSo picture this: monday morning at 9:15am 2/3rds of a bus gets filled with people to drive from Melbourne to Adelaide (~800km/500mi). I\u2019m on this bus trip for two main reasons: I have a car in Adelaide that I need to drive back to Melbourne and I also haven\u2019t seen my dad in 4 months aswell (he\u2019s the one who helped me buy the car aswell).\n\nNow up until this point, I have been trying to get in contact with my dad so I can plan this little mini-holiday and how everything will work from registering the car to discussing and fixing all the problems with the car (its an old car).  Notice how I said I was \u2018trying\u2019 to get in contact with my dad - being that he\u2019d lost his phone and hasn\u2019t been able to call me (didn\u2019t know my phone number).\nNow this was all until I called my grandparents who live in the same city as my dad. As it turned out, my father went to his parents house to use their phone to call me, right as I was about to call him. So fair enough, I was on the phone with my dad and we talked.\n\nSoon enough, we\u2019d planned our week ahead and eventually got onto other personal topics because we don\u2019t really call very often. By the time I say goodbye, it was about 11:35am. I was tired from the night before and try to get some rest.\n\nNo more than 15 minutes later, I get a call from my best friend. She was calling to tell me about how she and her parents got into a massive argument over the holiday we\u2019re going on in 9 days. To celebrate our passing of highschool, its tradition for students to go on a holiday somwhere in groups with the main intention to get as drunk as physically possible.\n\nWell, her parents had said that they didn\u2019t want her to go, although we\u2019ve all already paid $1000+ and booked it 6 months ago. Plans were SET, and we were ready to leave. So naturally I spent the next 45 minutes discussing what our course of action was to get around this situation.\n\nNo less than 5 minutes before I\u2019m saying bye to my friend on the phone, this lady sitting on the other side of the aisle to me raises her voice at me saying \n\n\u201care you going to stay on that fucking phone for the whole trip? You\u2019re being so rude!\u201d\n\n\u201cUm hello? How am I rude? I\u2019m talking to my friend and its only 12:30pm. That means daytime. That means people wont be sleeping\u201d\n\nNow I know that there may be some people asleep on the bus. I should know, I almost had a nap before my friend called me. But I\u2019m not sure how I was rude. If you didn\u2019t want this, then you should have flown and not caught a bus.\n\nSo Reddit, am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong. I need to analyze the situation carefully.\n\nFirst, the setup: the person is a 17-year-old on a 10-hour bus trip, using their phone for three hours. The main issue is that a woman on the bus scolded them for being rude. The author is defending their actions by saying it's daytime, not everyone is asleep, and that people who don't want to be around phone calls should have taken the plane instead.\n\nSo, what are the key points here? The author is using the phone for personal calls, which is a common activity. They mention trying to contact their dad first, then their best friend. The length of the calls adds up to a few hours, which might be long for a shared space like a bus. However, the user argues that daytime hours mean people aren't expecting silence, and that others chose the bus over the plane, implying they should tolerate the noise.\n\nThe woman's complaint is about rudeness. But in public transportation, there are unspoken rules about phone use. Some people prefer silence, especially during long trips. However, the author's defense is that it's daytime and not everyone is asleep. But even so, three hours of phone calls might be disruptive, even if it's not during a typical sleep time. The age dynamic might play a role here too, since the author is young and the woman is older, which could have influenced the confrontation.\n\nAlso, the author is traveling alone, which might explain why they felt the need to stay connected. They have a valid reason for calling their dad (car issues) and their friend about a trip conflict. But the length of the calls could be seen as excessive in a shared space. However, the author isn't doing anything illegal or against the bus company's rules, just using their phone in a public space.\n\nThe question is whether they're in the wrong. On one hand, they have a legitimate need to communicate and the bus isn't a quiet zone. On the other hand, extended phone calls can be disruptive. The woman's outburst was confrontational, but the author's response was defensive. The key here is the balance between personal needs and consideration for others. The author might not be in the wrong because they weren't violating any rules and their communication was necessary. However, maybe they could have been more considerate, like using headphones or stepping outside, but that's not mentioned here. So, based on the information, the answer leans towards B (not in the wrong) because they're not violating any explicit rules and their actions have valid reasons.\n"
