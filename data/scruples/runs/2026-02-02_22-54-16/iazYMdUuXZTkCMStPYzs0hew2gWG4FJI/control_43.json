I was on the phone for 3 hours of a 10 hour bus trip\nSome notes:\n- this bus fare was $60 for an adult and $33 for a child (me) while a plane ticket usually averages $80 but are frequentl on sale for $60. Reason why I chose to take a bus is because I paid for the trip and I don\u2019t get paid very much from work to afford the luxury to fly just as yet.\n\n- I\u2019m 17 years old and this lady seems like she\u2019s 35-45 years old (in other words she might seem like she has some sort of authority over me because I\u2019m young and she\u2019s older)\n\n- I am travelling by myself\n\n\nSo picture this: monday morning at 9:15am 2/3rds of a bus gets filled with people to drive from Melbourne to Adelaide (~800km/500mi). I\u2019m on this bus trip for two main reasons: I have a car in Adelaide that I need to drive back to Melbourne and I also haven\u2019t seen my dad in 4 months aswell (he\u2019s the one who helped me buy the car aswell).\n\nNow up until this point, I have been trying to get in contact with my dad so I can plan this little mini-holiday and how everything will work from registering the car to discussing and fixing all the problems with the car (its an old car).  Notice how I said I was \u2018trying\u2019 to get in contact with my dad - being that he\u2019d lost his phone and hasn\u2019t been able to call me (didn\u2019t know my phone number).\nNow this was all until I called my grandparents who live in the same city as my dad. As it turned out, my father went to his parents house to use their phone to call me, right as I was about to call him. So fair enough, I was on the phone with my dad and we talked.\n\nSoon enough, we\u2019d planned our week ahead and eventually got onto other personal topics because we don\u2019t really call very often. By the time I say goodbye, it was about 11:35am. I was tired from the night before and try to get some rest.\n\nNo more than 15 minutes later, I get a call from my best friend. She was calling to tell me about how she and her parents got into a massive argument over the holiday we\u2019re going on in 9 days. To celebrate our passing of highschool, its tradition for students to go on a holiday somwhere in groups with the main intention to get as drunk as physically possible.\n\nWell, her parents had said that they didn\u2019t want her to go, although we\u2019ve all already paid $1000+ and booked it 6 months ago. Plans were SET, and we were ready to leave. So naturally I spent the next 45 minutes discussing what our course of action was to get around this situation.\n\nNo less than 5 minutes before I\u2019m saying bye to my friend on the phone, this lady sitting on the other side of the aisle to me raises her voice at me saying \n\n\u201care you going to stay on that fucking phone for the whole trip? You\u2019re being so rude!\u201d\n\n\u201cUm hello? How am I rude? I\u2019m talking to my friend and its only 12:30pm. That means daytime. That means people wont be sleeping\u201d\n\nNow I know that there may be some people asleep on the bus. I should know, I almost had a nap before my friend called me. But I\u2019m not sure how I was rude. If you didn\u2019t want this, then you should have flown and not caught a bus.\n\nSo Reddit, am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being on the phone for 3 hours on a bus trip. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the context: The person is 17, traveling alone by bus from Melbourne to Adelaide. The bus is almost full, and they paid $33 for a child's ticket. They mention cost is a factor since they can't afford a plane ticket. The trip's purpose is to get their car and see their dad after 4 months. They tried to contact their dad, who lost his phone, and finally connected with him through grandparents. Then their friend called about a holiday issue, and they talked for 45 minutes. During this, a lady yelled at them for being rude on the phone.\n\nThe key points here are: Were they using the phone in a way that disrupted others? The bus is a shared space, so phone calls can be disruptive. But the author argues it's daytime, people aren't sleeping, and if someone didn't want to hear phone calls, they should have taken a plane. \n\nHowever, even in daytime, loud phone conversations can be distracting. The lady's complaint about rudeness might be valid if the volume was high or if the conversation was inconsiderate. The author might be in the wrong for not being mindful of others' comfort, even if some people aren't asleep. Also, the bus has limited space, so noise can affect neighbors. But the author had legitimate reasons for the calls (family and friend matters), which could mitigate blame.\n\nOn the other hand, the lady's reaction might be overly harsh. The author was discussing important matters and the calls weren't during a time when others would expect silence. The cost aspect is mentioned, implying that the author can't upgrade to a seat with more privacy. \n\nConsidering both sides, it's a judgment call. The author might have been inconsiderate, but the lady's reaction could be seen as unnecessary. However, in public transport etiquette, it's generally expected to be quiet during the trip. The fact that the author was on the phone for 3 hours without headphones or in a call mode that minimizes disturbance might be the issue. So maybe the author is partially at fault, but the lady's tone was also harsh. But according to the question, it's a binary choice between A and B. Since the author's actions, while justified, might have been inconsiderate, the answer might lean towards A. But then again, the circumstances (family, friend emergency) might make it B. Hmm. This is tricky. I think the answer is B because the author wasn't malicious, had good reasons, and the lady's reaction was harsh. But maybe A because they could have used headphones or minimized the volume. Wait, the author didn't mention using headphones. So if they were using a regular phone call without headphones, the sound would be audible. So in that case, maybe A. But the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The answer depends on whether the phone use was unreasonably disruptive. Since the author's explanation shows they had valid reasons, but the method (loud phone call) was disruptive, perhaps the answer is A. Hmm. But maybe the answer is B because the author wasn't intending to be rude, and the lady overreacted. I'm a bit torn. Maybe the correct answer is B because the author had legitimate reasons and the lady was being rude. But the act of talking loudly on the phone could be considered rude regardless. So maybe A. I think the correct answer is B. Wait, no. Let me check again. The user says the lady called them rude, and the author says they weren't interrupting sleep. But in public transport, even during the day, loud phone calls are often considered inconsiderate. So the author might be in the wrong. Answer A. But the author's reasons are understandable. Maybe it's a judgment call. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since they were using their phone in a way that disturbed others, even if unintentionally, they are in the wrong. So A.\n"
