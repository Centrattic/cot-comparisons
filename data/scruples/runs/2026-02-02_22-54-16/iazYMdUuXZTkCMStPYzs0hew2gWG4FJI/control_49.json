I was on the phone for 3 hours of a 10 hour bus trip\nSome notes:\n- this bus fare was $60 for an adult and $33 for a child (me) while a plane ticket usually averages $80 but are frequentl on sale for $60. Reason why I chose to take a bus is because I paid for the trip and I don\u2019t get paid very much from work to afford the luxury to fly just as yet.\n\n- I\u2019m 17 years old and this lady seems like she\u2019s 35-45 years old (in other words she might seem like she has some sort of authority over me because I\u2019m young and she\u2019s older)\n\n- I am travelling by myself\n\n\nSo picture this: monday morning at 9:15am 2/3rds of a bus gets filled with people to drive from Melbourne to Adelaide (~800km/500mi). I\u2019m on this bus trip for two main reasons: I have a car in Adelaide that I need to drive back to Melbourne and I also haven\u2019t seen my dad in 4 months aswell (he\u2019s the one who helped me buy the car aswell).\n\nNow up until this point, I have been trying to get in contact with my dad so I can plan this little mini-holiday and how everything will work from registering the car to discussing and fixing all the problems with the car (its an old car).  Notice how I said I was \u2018trying\u2019 to get in contact with my dad - being that he\u2019d lost his phone and hasn\u2019t been able to call me (didn\u2019t know my phone number).\nNow this was all until I called my grandparents who live in the same city as my dad. As it turned out, my father went to his parents house to use their phone to call me, right as I was about to call him. So fair enough, I was on the phone with my dad and we talked.\n\nSoon enough, we\u2019d planned our week ahead and eventually got onto other personal topics because we don\u2019t really call very often. By the time I say goodbye, it was about 11:35am. I was tired from the night before and try to get some rest.\n\nNo more than 15 minutes later, I get a call from my best friend. She was calling to tell me about how she and her parents got into a massive argument over the holiday we\u2019re going on in 9 days. To celebrate our passing of highschool, its tradition for students to go on a holiday somwhere in groups with the main intention to get as drunk as physically possible.\n\nWell, her parents had said that they didn\u2019t want her to go, although we\u2019ve all already paid $1000+ and booked it 6 months ago. Plans were SET, and we were ready to leave. So naturally I spent the next 45 minutes discussing what our course of action was to get around this situation.\n\nNo less than 5 minutes before I\u2019m saying bye to my friend on the phone, this lady sitting on the other side of the aisle to me raises her voice at me saying \n\n\u201care you going to stay on that fucking phone for the whole trip? You\u2019re being so rude!\u201d\n\n\u201cUm hello? How am I rude? I\u2019m talking to my friend and its only 12:30pm. That means daytime. That means people wont be sleeping\u201d\n\nNow I know that there may be some people asleep on the bus. I should know, I almost had a nap before my friend called me. But I\u2019m not sure how I was rude. If you didn\u2019t want this, then you should have flown and not caught a bus.\n\nSo Reddit, am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a 17-year-old taking a 10-hour bus trip, where they were on the phone for three hours. The person got into a conflict with a passenger about being rude for talking on the phone.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The person chose a bus over a plane due to cost, which is understandable. They were traveling alone, which might make sense why they needed to stay connected. They had legitimate reasons for talking on the phone: coordinating with their dad about a car and discussing a trip with their friend. The timing was during the day, so maybe people weren't expecting to sleep then. The lady got upset and called them rude. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. Bus etiquette usually means that talking on the phone should be kept to a minimum to avoid disturbing others, especially in a confined space. However, the situation here is a 10-hour trip, and the person was only on the phone for three hours. If they were using a phone and not being loud, maybe it's acceptable. But if they were talking loudly or for an extended period, others might find it disruptive. \n\nThe user mentioned that the lady was upset because of the phone use, but the author argues that since it's daytime, people aren't sleeping. The author might not be wrong if they were being respectful and not causing a disturbance. However, the fact that the passenger had to raise their voice suggests that the phone conversation might have been disruptive. \n\nAlso, considering the bus is a shared space, even if you're not in a silent environment, excessive phone calls can be seen as rude. The author's defense is that if others didn't want that, they should have taken a flight. But maybe the bus company expects passengers to be considerate. \n\nOn the other hand, the author had valid reasons: coordinating with family and friends for important matters. The timing of the calls was during the day, not late at night. The conflict arose after a long period of phone use. Maybe the lady was just frustrated and chose a confrontational approach, but the author might have been inconsiderate by not being aware of others' comfort. \n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether three hours of phone calls in a day-time bus is acceptable. Some might say it's too long and disruptive, others might say it's reasonable given the circumstances. However, the author did mention trying to get some rest before the friend called, implying they were aware of the need for quiet. The friend's call extended the phone time, but the author might not have realized the disruption. \n\nIn the end, the author might not be entirely in the wrong because they had valid reasons, but they could have been more mindful of others' space. However, the lady's outburst was inappropriate as well. But the question is specifically about the author. Since the author was using the phone for necessary communication and during a time when people might not be sleeping, the answer could lean towards B (not in the wrong). But if the phone use was loud or disruptive despite being daytime, then maybe A. However, the details don't specify loudness, just that they were on the phone. So, the answer is B.\n"
