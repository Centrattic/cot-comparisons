I was on the phone for 3 hours of a 10 hour bus trip\nSome notes:\n- this bus fare was $60 for an adult and $33 for a child (me) while a plane ticket usually averages $80 but are frequentl on sale for $60. Reason why I chose to take a bus is because I paid for the trip and I don\u2019t get paid very much from work to afford the luxury to fly just as yet.\n\n- I\u2019m 17 years old and this lady seems like she\u2019s 35-45 years old (in other words she might seem like she has some sort of authority over me because I\u2019m young and she\u2019s older)\n\n- I am travelling by myself\n\n\nSo picture this: monday morning at 9:15am 2/3rds of a bus gets filled with people to drive from Melbourne to Adelaide (~800km/500mi). I\u2019m on this bus trip for two main reasons: I have a car in Adelaide that I need to drive back to Melbourne and I also haven\u2019t seen my dad in 4 months aswell (he\u2019s the one who helped me buy the car aswell).\n\nNow up until this point, I have been trying to get in contact with my dad so I can plan this little mini-holiday and how everything will work from registering the car to discussing and fixing all the problems with the car (its an old car).  Notice how I said I was \u2018trying\u2019 to get in contact with my dad - being that he\u2019d lost his phone and hasn\u2019t been able to call me (didn\u2019t know my phone number).\nNow this was all until I called my grandparents who live in the same city as my dad. As it turned out, my father went to his parents house to use their phone to call me, right as I was about to call him. So fair enough, I was on the phone with my dad and we talked.\n\nSoon enough, we\u2019d planned our week ahead and eventually got onto other personal topics because we don\u2019t really call very often. By the time I say goodbye, it was about 11:35am. I was tired from the night before and try to get some rest.\n\nNo more than 15 minutes later, I get a call from my best friend. She was calling to tell me about how she and her parents got into a massive argument over the holiday we\u2019re going on in 9 days. To celebrate our passing of highschool, its tradition for students to go on a holiday somwhere in groups with the main intention to get as drunk as physically possible.\n\nWell, her parents had said that they didn\u2019t want her to go, although we\u2019ve all already paid $1000+ and booked it 6 months ago. Plans were SET, and we were ready to leave. So naturally I spent the next 45 minutes discussing what our course of action was to get around this situation.\n\nNo less than 5 minutes before I\u2019m saying bye to my friend on the phone, this lady sitting on the other side of the aisle to me raises her voice at me saying \n\n\u201care you going to stay on that fucking phone for the whole trip? You\u2019re being so rude!\u201d\n\n\u201cUm hello? How am I rude? I\u2019m talking to my friend and its only 12:30pm. That means daytime. That means people wont be sleeping\u201d\n\nNow I know that there may be some people asleep on the bus. I should know, I almost had a nap before my friend called me. But I\u2019m not sure how I was rude. If you didn\u2019t want this, then you should have flown and not caught a bus.\n\nSo Reddit, am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again to make sure I understand all the details.\n\nThe author is 17 years old, taking a 10-hour bus trip from Melbourne to Adelaide. The bus ride cost $33 for them, which is cheaper than flying. They mention they can't afford to fly, so they chose the bus. They're traveling alone. On the bus, they spend a lot of time on the phone. First, they talk to their dad for about two and a half hours (from 9:15am to 11:35am), then talk to their best friend for 45 minutes (from around 11:50am to 12:35pm). Then, a woman sitting nearby yells at them for being rude. The author responds by saying that if the woman didn't want phone calls, she shouldn't have taken the bus. The question is whether the author is in the wrong here.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Bus travel is different from flying. On planes, there's usually a strict expectation of silence, especially during the flight. But buses are different. People often expect more noise because they can move around, maybe stop for breaks, and it's a longer distance. However, it's a 10-hour trip, which is quite long. Maybe people on the bus are looking for some rest or a quieter environment.\n\nThe author is on the phone for a significant portion of the trip. The first call is to their dad. They mention that they hadn't seen him in four months and needed to coordinate about a car. The dad had lost his phone, so they had to talk through grandparents. This seems like a legitimate reason for a long call. The second call is with a best friend about a planned holiday. The author argues that since it's daytime and not everyone is asleep, they're not being rude. The woman's complaint is about the phone use during the trip.\n\nNow, considering social norms. In public transport, especially when others are around, loud phone calls can be disruptive. Even if the author is sitting with their earphones, if they're speaking loudly or the conversation is lengthy, it can be bothersome. However, the author might be using a speakerphone or not using headphones, which would make it louder. The problem is whether the author was being considerate of others' space and comfort.\n\nThe author's response to the woman is defensive, suggesting that if she didn't want to hear phone calls, she should have flown. However, flying is more expensive, and the author is in a situation where they can't afford to fly. This seems a bit dismissive. The woman is expressing her discomfort, and the author is justifying their actions without considering her feelings.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is young, traveling alone, and has valid reasons for the calls. The first call is necessary for coordinating important matters with a parent. The second call is about a planned event they've been working towards. However, the duration of the calls is significant\u2014over 3 hours. Even if the reasons are valid, the length could be seen as excessive, especially if it affects others.\n\nAnother factor is that the author is on the phone for the majority of the trip. People might expect some quiet time on a long bus ride. The author might not realize that even during the day, some passengers prefer a quieter environment. Also, the woman's outburst suggests that she was disturbed by the phone calls, even if not everyone is asleep. Maybe the volume or the nature of the conversation was disruptive.\n\nIn terms of etiquette, using a phone on public transport isn't inherently wrong, but being considerate about volume and duration is important. The author might have been using the phone in a way that was intrusive. The woman's complaint is about rudeness, which implies that the author's actions were inconsiderate.\n\nHowever, the author's defense is that they're not in the wrong because the trip is daytime, and the woman could have chosen a different mode of transport. But the woman chose the bus because it's cheaper, just like the author. The author's argument that the woman should have flown if she didn't want to hear phone calls might be seen as dismissive and not acknowledging the other person's right to a comfortable journey.\n\nIn summary, the author had legitimate reasons for the first call. The second call, while about a personal matter, isn't inherently wrong, but the cumulative time and possible disruption could be considered inconsiderate. The author's response to the woman was defensive and not very empathetic. So, while the author isn't entirely to blame, there's a case to be made that they were inconsiderate in their phone use, making them at least partially in the wrong. However, given the circumstances and the fact that they had valid reasons, the answer might hinge on whether the duration and manner of the calls crossed a line.\n"
