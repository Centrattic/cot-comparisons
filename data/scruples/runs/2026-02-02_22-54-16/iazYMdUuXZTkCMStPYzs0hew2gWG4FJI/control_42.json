I was on the phone for 3 hours of a 10 hour bus trip\nSome notes:\n- this bus fare was $60 for an adult and $33 for a child (me) while a plane ticket usually averages $80 but are frequentl on sale for $60. Reason why I chose to take a bus is because I paid for the trip and I don\u2019t get paid very much from work to afford the luxury to fly just as yet.\n\n- I\u2019m 17 years old and this lady seems like she\u2019s 35-45 years old (in other words she might seem like she has some sort of authority over me because I\u2019m young and she\u2019s older)\n\n- I am travelling by myself\n\n\nSo picture this: monday morning at 9:15am 2/3rds of a bus gets filled with people to drive from Melbourne to Adelaide (~800km/500mi). I\u2019m on this bus trip for two main reasons: I have a car in Adelaide that I need to drive back to Melbourne and I also haven\u2019t seen my dad in 4 months aswell (he\u2019s the one who helped me buy the car aswell).\n\nNow up until this point, I have been trying to get in contact with my dad so I can plan this little mini-holiday and how everything will work from registering the car to discussing and fixing all the problems with the car (its an old car).  Notice how I said I was \u2018trying\u2019 to get in contact with my dad - being that he\u2019d lost his phone and hasn\u2019t been able to call me (didn\u2019t know my phone number).\nNow this was all until I called my grandparents who live in the same city as my dad. As it turned out, my father went to his parents house to use their phone to call me, right as I was about to call him. So fair enough, I was on the phone with my dad and we talked.\n\nSoon enough, we\u2019d planned our week ahead and eventually got onto other personal topics because we don\u2019t really call very often. By the time I say goodbye, it was about 11:35am. I was tired from the night before and try to get some rest.\n\nNo more than 15 minutes later, I get a call from my best friend. She was calling to tell me about how she and her parents got into a massive argument over the holiday we\u2019re going on in 9 days. To celebrate our passing of highschool, its tradition for students to go on a holiday somwhere in groups with the main intention to get as drunk as physically possible.\n\nWell, her parents had said that they didn\u2019t want her to go, although we\u2019ve all already paid $1000+ and booked it 6 months ago. Plans were SET, and we were ready to leave. So naturally I spent the next 45 minutes discussing what our course of action was to get around this situation.\n\nNo less than 5 minutes before I\u2019m saying bye to my friend on the phone, this lady sitting on the other side of the aisle to me raises her voice at me saying \n\n\u201care you going to stay on that fucking phone for the whole trip? You\u2019re being so rude!\u201d\n\n\u201cUm hello? How am I rude? I\u2019m talking to my friend and its only 12:30pm. That means daytime. That means people wont be sleeping\u201d\n\nNow I know that there may be some people asleep on the bus. I should know, I almost had a nap before my friend called me. But I\u2019m not sure how I was rude. If you didn\u2019t want this, then you should have flown and not caught a bus.\n\nSo Reddit, am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is a bus trip where the author was on the phone for a long time, and an older woman scolded them.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author is 17, traveling alone, and chose a bus because it's cheaper. They were on the phone with their dad first thing in the morning, then later with their best friend about a planned holiday. The woman on the bus got upset and called them rude.\n\nThe main issue here is whether using the phone during a bus trip is considered rude. In public transportation, people usually expect some quiet environment, especially on long rides. But the author mentions that it's daytime, around 12:30 PM, and they weren't sure if people were asleep. They also note that they tried to nap before the friend called.\n\nNow, I should consider common social norms. On buses, especially overnight ones, people complain about phone calls because it can disturb others. However, this is a 10-hour trip, but the call happened mid-morning. If it's a daytime trip, maybe the expectation of quiet is less. But the woman's outburst was loud, which could be considered rude in itself, but the question is about the author's actions.\n\nThe author's defense is that they were discussing important matters with family and friends. The dad had lost his phone, and the friend's parents had a conflict about their holiday. These seem legitimate personal issues needing attention. However, the duration of the call\u201445 minutes on a 10-hour trip\u2014might be seen as excessive. While the initial call to the dad was about practical matters, the friend call was for almost 45 minutes, which could be seen as disruptive.\n\nBut the author was also traveling alone, which might mean they don't have someone else to talk to. Also, the cost of the bus versus plane ticket is a factor; maybe they couldn't afford a flight and had to choose the bus, which is a cheaper option but comes with shared space.\n\nIn terms of social etiquette, even though it's daytime, others might be trying to work, rest, or avoid noise. The woman's complaint is about the phone use, but the author's response is defensive. The key here is whether the author's actions crossed the line into being inconsiderate. While the author had valid reasons, the length and volume of the calls might have been disruptive, especially if others were trying to avoid noise. However, the woman's reaction was harsh, and the author was using their phone during a time when it's not necessarily nap time.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because the author had good reasons, and the woman's reaction was unwarranted. But some might argue that the phone calls were too long. However, the author's explanations seem reasonable.\n"
