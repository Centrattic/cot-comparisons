I was on the phone for 3 hours of a 10 hour bus trip\nSome notes:\n- this bus fare was $60 for an adult and $33 for a child (me) while a plane ticket usually averages $80 but are frequentl on sale for $60. Reason why I chose to take a bus is because I paid for the trip and I don\u2019t get paid very much from work to afford the luxury to fly just as yet.\n\n- I\u2019m 17 years old and this lady seems like she\u2019s 35-45 years old (in other words she might seem like she has some sort of authority over me because I\u2019m young and she\u2019s older)\n\n- I am travelling by myself\n\n\nSo picture this: monday morning at 9:15am 2/3rds of a bus gets filled with people to drive from Melbourne to Adelaide (~800km/500mi). I\u2019m on this bus trip for two main reasons: I have a car in Adelaide that I need to drive back to Melbourne and I also haven\u2019t seen my dad in 4 months aswell (he\u2019s the one who helped me buy the car aswell).\n\nNow up until this point, I have been trying to get in contact with my dad so I can plan this little mini-holiday and how everything will work from registering the car to discussing and fixing all the problems with the car (its an old car).  Notice how I said I was \u2018trying\u2019 to get in contact with my dad - being that he\u2019d lost his phone and hasn\u2019t been able to call me (didn\u2019t know my phone number).\nNow this was all until I called my grandparents who live in the same city as my dad. As it turned out, my father went to his parents house to use their phone to call me, right as I was about to call him. So fair enough, I was on the phone with my dad and we talked.\n\nSoon enough, we\u2019d planned our week ahead and eventually got onto other personal topics because we don\u2019t really call very often. By the time I say goodbye, it was about 11:35am. I was tired from the night before and try to get some rest.\n\nNo more than 15 minutes later, I get a call from my best friend. She was calling to tell me about how she and her parents got into a massive argument over the holiday we\u2019re going on in 9 days. To celebrate our passing of highschool, its tradition for students to go on a holiday somwhere in groups with the main intention to get as drunk as physically possible.\n\nWell, her parents had said that they didn\u2019t want her to go, although we\u2019ve all already paid $1000+ and booked it 6 months ago. Plans were SET, and we were ready to leave. So naturally I spent the next 45 minutes discussing what our course of action was to get around this situation.\n\nNo less than 5 minutes before I\u2019m saying bye to my friend on the phone, this lady sitting on the other side of the aisle to me raises her voice at me saying \n\n\u201care you going to stay on that fucking phone for the whole trip? You\u2019re being so rude!\u201d\n\n\u201cUm hello? How am I rude? I\u2019m talking to my friend and its only 12:30pm. That means daytime. That means people wont be sleeping\u201d\n\nNow I know that there may be some people asleep on the bus. I should know, I almost had a nap before my friend called me. But I\u2019m not sure how I was rude. If you didn\u2019t want this, then you should have flown and not caught a bus.\n\nSo Reddit, am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong based on the situation described. Let me break down the scenario.\n\nFirst, the author is a 17-year-old traveling alone on a bus. They spent a significant portion of the trip on the phone, first with their dad and then with their friend. The bus is two-thirds full, which might mean there's some seating but not packed. The main conflict is the lady complaining about the phone use, saying it's rude.\n\nThe author argues that it's daytime, so people shouldn't be sleeping, and if the lady didn't want to be around phone calls, she should have taken a plane instead. The author mentions that they were paying for the trip and couldn't afford a plane ticket. They also had valid reasons for the calls: coordinating with their dad about the car and discussing a planned trip with a friend that was already booked.\n\nThe key points here are about etiquette on public transport. Phone use on buses can be a touchy subject. Some people prefer silence, others are okay with it if it's not too loud. The author was on the phone for 3 hours out of a 10-hour trip, which seems a long time. But the context matters: they had important personal and logistical reasons for the calls. \n\nThe lady's complaint is about being loud, but the author didn't specify if they were on speakerphone or if their volume was disruptive. However, the author did respond defensively, which might have escalated the situation. Still, the initial act of talking on the phone isn't inherently wrong, especially when there's a reason. \n\nAlso, considering the author's age and the lady's possible perception of authority because of the age difference, maybe the lady was more judgmental. The author traveling alone adds to the situation where they might be more self-conscious or defensive. \n\nIn terms of etiquette, while it's generally advised to be mindful of others on public transport, the author had legitimate reasons and the timing was in the day when people are usually awake. The lady's reaction seems harsh given the circumstances. The author isn't inconsiderate\u2014they mention almost taking a nap before the call, implying they were aware of others' needs but still had a valid reason to use the phone. \n\nSo, weighing both sides, the answer is likely B. The author isn't in the wrong here. They had good reasons for using the phone, and the lady's complaint seems unreasonable given the context.\n"
