I was on the phone for 3 hours of a 10 hour bus trip\nSome notes:\n- this bus fare was $60 for an adult and $33 for a child (me) while a plane ticket usually averages $80 but are frequentl on sale for $60. Reason why I chose to take a bus is because I paid for the trip and I don\u2019t get paid very much from work to afford the luxury to fly just as yet.\n\n- I\u2019m 17 years old and this lady seems like she\u2019s 35-45 years old (in other words she might seem like she has some sort of authority over me because I\u2019m young and she\u2019s older)\n\n- I am travelling by myself\n\n\nSo picture this: monday morning at 9:15am 2/3rds of a bus gets filled with people to drive from Melbourne to Adelaide (~800km/500mi). I\u2019m on this bus trip for two main reasons: I have a car in Adelaide that I need to drive back to Melbourne and I also haven\u2019t seen my dad in 4 months aswell (he\u2019s the one who helped me buy the car aswell).\n\nNow up until this point, I have been trying to get in contact with my dad so I can plan this little mini-holiday and how everything will work from registering the car to discussing and fixing all the problems with the car (its an old car).  Notice how I said I was \u2018trying\u2019 to get in contact with my dad - being that he\u2019d lost his phone and hasn\u2019t been able to call me (didn\u2019t know my phone number).\nNow this was all until I called my grandparents who live in the same city as my dad. As it turned out, my father went to his parents house to use their phone to call me, right as I was about to call him. So fair enough, I was on the phone with my dad and we talked.\n\nSoon enough, we\u2019d planned our week ahead and eventually got onto other personal topics because we don\u2019t really call very often. By the time I say goodbye, it was about 11:35am. I was tired from the night before and try to get some rest.\n\nNo more than 15 minutes later, I get a call from my best friend. She was calling to tell me about how she and her parents got into a massive argument over the holiday we\u2019re going on in 9 days. To celebrate our passing of highschool, its tradition for students to go on a holiday somwhere in groups with the main intention to get as drunk as physically possible.\n\nWell, her parents had said that they didn\u2019t want her to go, although we\u2019ve all already paid $1000+ and booked it 6 months ago. Plans were SET, and we were ready to leave. So naturally I spent the next 45 minutes discussing what our course of action was to get around this situation.\n\nNo less than 5 minutes before I\u2019m saying bye to my friend on the phone, this lady sitting on the other side of the aisle to me raises her voice at me saying \n\n\u201care you going to stay on that fucking phone for the whole trip? You\u2019re being so rude!\u201d\n\n\u201cUm hello? How am I rude? I\u2019m talking to my friend and its only 12:30pm. That means daytime. That means people wont be sleeping\u201d\n\nNow I know that there may be some people asleep on the bus. I should know, I almost had a nap before my friend called me. But I\u2019m not sure how I was rude. If you didn\u2019t want this, then you should have flown and not caught a bus.\n\nSo Reddit, am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this story is in the wrong. The situation is about a 17-year-old taking a bus trip and being on the phone for a long time, leading to confrontation with another passenger.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author is on a 10-hour bus ride, and by the time the conflict arises, it's only the first hour or so. The person is using their phone to talk to their dad and then a friend. The older lady gets upset and calls them out for being rude. \n\nThe author justifies their actions by saying it's daytime, people aren't asleep yet, and that the lady could've flown if she wanted privacy. The context includes that the author is traveling alone, paying for the trip, and has a lower income. The reasons for the calls are important: reconnecting with a dad they haven't seen in 4 months and discussing a planned trip with a friend. \n\nNow, the main question is whether the author was in the wrong. The lady's complaint is about being loud and disruptive. But the author is in the first few hours of the trip, not the entire duration. Bus etiquette usually allows for some phone use, especially when there's no sleeping. Also, the author didn't use a headset, which might contribute to the disturbance. However, the timing is early in the trip, so expecting someone to be on the phone for a couple of hours right from the start might be reasonable. \n\nThe author's defense is that the lady should choose a different mode of transport if she's uncomfortable with shared space. Public transport inherently involves shared space, so maybe the author isn't entirely to blame here. However, using a loudspeaker without a headset could be considered rude. The author does mention they tried to rest earlier, implying they might have been aware of others. \n\nConsidering all factors: The author had valid reasons for the calls, but maybe not using a headset or being mindful of volume could be a point against them. However, the timing and the fact that it's not the entire trip might mitigate the blame. Public transport etiquette usually allows some phone use, especially in the early parts. The lady's reaction might be over the top, but the author could have been more considerate by using a headset. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a toss-up. If the phone calls were loud and disruptive, maybe they should have used a headset. But given the circumstances and the early time, it might not be entirely their fault. The answer might be B (not in the wrong), but there's a slight element of responsibility for not considering volume. However, the main issue is the lady's reaction and the context of the situation. So probably B.\n"
