I was on the phone for 3 hours of a 10 hour bus trip\nSome notes:\n- this bus fare was $60 for an adult and $33 for a child (me) while a plane ticket usually averages $80 but are frequentl on sale for $60. Reason why I chose to take a bus is because I paid for the trip and I don\u2019t get paid very much from work to afford the luxury to fly just as yet.\n\n- I\u2019m 17 years old and this lady seems like she\u2019s 35-45 years old (in other words she might seem like she has some sort of authority over me because I\u2019m young and she\u2019s older)\n\n- I am travelling by myself\n\n\nSo picture this: monday morning at 9:15am 2/3rds of a bus gets filled with people to drive from Melbourne to Adelaide (~800km/500mi). I\u2019m on this bus trip for two main reasons: I have a car in Adelaide that I need to drive back to Melbourne and I also haven\u2019t seen my dad in 4 months aswell (he\u2019s the one who helped me buy the car aswell).\n\nNow up until this point, I have been trying to get in contact with my dad so I can plan this little mini-holiday and how everything will work from registering the car to discussing and fixing all the problems with the car (its an old car).  Notice how I said I was \u2018trying\u2019 to get in contact with my dad - being that he\u2019d lost his phone and hasn\u2019t been able to call me (didn\u2019t know my phone number).\nNow this was all until I called my grandparents who live in the same city as my dad. As it turned out, my father went to his parents house to use their phone to call me, right as I was about to call him. So fair enough, I was on the phone with my dad and we talked.\n\nSoon enough, we\u2019d planned our week ahead and eventually got onto other personal topics because we don\u2019t really call very often. By the time I say goodbye, it was about 11:35am. I was tired from the night before and try to get some rest.\n\nNo more than 15 minutes later, I get a call from my best friend. She was calling to tell me about how she and her parents got into a massive argument over the holiday we\u2019re going on in 9 days. To celebrate our passing of highschool, its tradition for students to go on a holiday somwhere in groups with the main intention to get as drunk as physically possible.\n\nWell, her parents had said that they didn\u2019t want her to go, although we\u2019ve all already paid $1000+ and booked it 6 months ago. Plans were SET, and we were ready to leave. So naturally I spent the next 45 minutes discussing what our course of action was to get around this situation.\n\nNo less than 5 minutes before I\u2019m saying bye to my friend on the phone, this lady sitting on the other side of the aisle to me raises her voice at me saying \n\n\u201care you going to stay on that fucking phone for the whole trip? You\u2019re being so rude!\u201d\n\n\u201cUm hello? How am I rude? I\u2019m talking to my friend and its only 12:30pm. That means daytime. That means people wont be sleeping\u201d\n\nNow I know that there may be some people asleep on the bus. I should know, I almost had a nap before my friend called me. But I\u2019m not sure how I was rude. If you didn\u2019t want this, then you should have flown and not caught a bus.\n\nSo Reddit, am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that they were on a 10-hour bus trip and were on the phone for 3 hours. The main points they mention are the cost difference between bus and plane, their age, and the context of why they were on the phone.\n\nFirst, the bus is cheaper, and since they're young and not making a lot of money, choosing the bus makes sense. The lady got angry at them for talking on the phone, saying it was rude. The author argues that since it's daytime, people aren't sleeping, and if the lady didn't want to hear phones, she should have flown instead.\n\nI need to consider bus etiquette. Usually, on buses, especially long ones, people expect some noise but also expect others to be considerate. Phone calls can be disruptive if loud, especially if others are trying to rest. The author was on the phone for 3 hours, which is a significant portion of the trip. Even in the daytime, maybe the volume was an issue, but the author didn't mention talking loudly. However, just having a phone conversation might be seen as intrusive by some.\n\nThe age factor is mentioned. The author is 17, and the lady is older. The author might feel that the lady is acting like she has authority just because she's older. But age shouldn't dictate who is in the wrong. The key is the behavior and the impact on others.\n\nThe reason for the calls: talking to dad about important plans and then discussing a holiday issue with a friend. Both are valid reasons. But maybe the duration and frequency of calls matter. If the author was on the phone intermittently, it's different from being on the phone non-stop. The timeline shows that the first call was with dad, then a long call with the friend, totaling 3 hours. That's a lot of time in a confined space where others might be trying to work or read.\n\nAlso, the author mentions they were tired and tried to nap before the friend called. So maybe the context of being in a bus where some people do rest is relevant. Even if it's daytime, not everyone is active. The lady's complaint could be because she wanted to work or read quietly.\n\nThe author's response to the lady was defensive. They could have apologized or adjusted their volume, but instead, they made a sarcastic comment about flying. That might have escalated the situation. However, the lady's initial outburst was aggressive, using strong language.\n\nBus policies vary, but generally, it's considered polite to keep phone calls short and quiet. The author might not be in the wrong if they were using a headset and talking softly, but if they were loud and long, it's more of an issue. The author didn't specify the volume, though. \n\nConsidering all factors, the author's actions might be seen as inconsiderate, even if their reasons are valid. The length of the call and the setting of a shared space where others might want quiet could tip the balance. So maybe the answer is A, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, if the lady was being overly harsh without cause, maybe B. But most people would agree that long phone calls on public transport can be disruptive, even if not outright rude. So I think the answer is A.\n"
