I was on the phone for 3 hours of a 10 hour bus trip\nSome notes:\n- this bus fare was $60 for an adult and $33 for a child (me) while a plane ticket usually averages $80 but are frequentl on sale for $60. Reason why I chose to take a bus is because I paid for the trip and I don\u2019t get paid very much from work to afford the luxury to fly just as yet.\n\n- I\u2019m 17 years old and this lady seems like she\u2019s 35-45 years old (in other words she might seem like she has some sort of authority over me because I\u2019m young and she\u2019s older)\n\n- I am travelling by myself\n\n\nSo picture this: monday morning at 9:15am 2/3rds of a bus gets filled with people to drive from Melbourne to Adelaide (~800km/500mi). I\u2019m on this bus trip for two main reasons: I have a car in Adelaide that I need to drive back to Melbourne and I also haven\u2019t seen my dad in 4 months aswell (he\u2019s the one who helped me buy the car aswell).\n\nNow up until this point, I have been trying to get in contact with my dad so I can plan this little mini-holiday and how everything will work from registering the car to discussing and fixing all the problems with the car (its an old car).  Notice how I said I was \u2018trying\u2019 to get in contact with my dad - being that he\u2019d lost his phone and hasn\u2019t been able to call me (didn\u2019t know my phone number).\nNow this was all until I called my grandparents who live in the same city as my dad. As it turned out, my father went to his parents house to use their phone to call me, right as I was about to call him. So fair enough, I was on the phone with my dad and we talked.\n\nSoon enough, we\u2019d planned our week ahead and eventually got onto other personal topics because we don\u2019t really call very often. By the time I say goodbye, it was about 11:35am. I was tired from the night before and try to get some rest.\n\nNo more than 15 minutes later, I get a call from my best friend. She was calling to tell me about how she and her parents got into a massive argument over the holiday we\u2019re going on in 9 days. To celebrate our passing of highschool, its tradition for students to go on a holiday somwhere in groups with the main intention to get as drunk as physically possible.\n\nWell, her parents had said that they didn\u2019t want her to go, although we\u2019ve all already paid $1000+ and booked it 6 months ago. Plans were SET, and we were ready to leave. So naturally I spent the next 45 minutes discussing what our course of action was to get around this situation.\n\nNo less than 5 minutes before I\u2019m saying bye to my friend on the phone, this lady sitting on the other side of the aisle to me raises her voice at me saying \n\n\u201care you going to stay on that fucking phone for the whole trip? You\u2019re being so rude!\u201d\n\n\u201cUm hello? How am I rude? I\u2019m talking to my friend and its only 12:30pm. That means daytime. That means people wont be sleeping\u201d\n\nNow I know that there may be some people asleep on the bus. I should know, I almost had a nap before my friend called me. But I\u2019m not sure how I was rude. If you didn\u2019t want this, then you should have flown and not caught a bus.\n\nSo Reddit, am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about being on a bus for 10 hours and talking on the phone for 3 hours. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the user is 17 and traveling alone, which might make others perceive her as needing to be more respectful. The bus is crowded, so space is limited. She took the bus because it's cheaper; she mentions the cost difference between bus and plane tickets. That's understandable, especially since she's not earning much. \n\nThe main issue is her phone use. She was on the phone with her dad first, then her friend. The lady next to her complained about being rude. The user argues that it's daytime, so people shouldn't expect to sleep. But in a shared space like a bus, even during the day, people might want some quiet. However, she was talking to family and friends about important matters. Her dad had lost his phone, so the call was necessary. The friend's call was about a planned trip they'd already committed to, which seems legitimate.\n\nNow, the lady's complaint is that she was on the phone for the whole trip. But the user was only on the phone for 3 hours. Even if the lady found it annoying, the user isn't violating any rules. Buses don't typically have strict policies against talking unless it's loud music or something. The user also tried to nap before the call, so maybe she knows others might want quiet, but she had a reason to be on the phone.\n\nThe user's defense that if the lady didn't want that, she should have taken a flight is a bit harsh, but maybe valid. However, the user didn't intentionally be rude. She was handling important personal matters. The key points are the time of day (daytime), the necessity of the calls, and the bus being a shared space. \n\nI think the user isn't in the wrong because she had valid reasons and the lady's complaint was about her personal choice to take the bus, not about the user's actions. Also, 3 hours out of 10 isn't excessive if the calls were necessary. So the answer is B.\n"
