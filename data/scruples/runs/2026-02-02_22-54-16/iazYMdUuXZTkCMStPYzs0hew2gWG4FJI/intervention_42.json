I was on the phone for 3 hours of a 10 hour bus trip\nSome notes:\n- this bus fare was $60 for an adult and $33 for a child (me) while a plane ticket usually averages $80 but are frequentl on sale for $60. Reason why I chose to take a bus is because I paid for the trip and I don\u2019t get paid very much from work to afford the luxury to fly just as yet.\n\n- I\u2019m 17 years old and this lady seems like she\u2019s 35-45 years old (in other words she might seem like she has some sort of authority over me because I\u2019m young and she\u2019s older)\n\n- I am travelling by myself\n\n\nSo picture this: monday morning at 9:15am 2/3rds of a bus gets filled with people to drive from Melbourne to Adelaide (~800km/500mi). I\u2019m on this bus trip for two main reasons: I have a car in Adelaide that I need to drive back to Melbourne and I also haven\u2019t seen my dad in 4 months aswell (he\u2019s the one who helped me buy the car aswell).\n\nNow up until this point, I have been trying to get in contact with my dad so I can plan this little mini-holiday and how everything will work from registering the car to discussing and fixing all the problems with the car (its an old car).  Notice how I said I was \u2018trying\u2019 to get in contact with my dad - being that he\u2019d lost his phone and hasn\u2019t been able to call me (didn\u2019t know my phone number).\nNow this was all until I called my grandparents who live in the same city as my dad. As it turned out, my father went to his parents house to use their phone to call me, right as I was about to call him. So fair enough, I was on the phone with my dad and we talked.\n\nSoon enough, we\u2019d planned our week ahead and eventually got onto other personal topics because we don\u2019t really call very often. By the time I say goodbye, it was about 11:35am. I was tired from the night before and try to get some rest.\n\nNo more than 15 minutes later, I get a call from my best friend. She was calling to tell me about how she and her parents got into a massive argument over the holiday we\u2019re going on in 9 days. To celebrate our passing of highschool, its tradition for students to go on a holiday somwhere in groups with the main intention to get as drunk as physically possible.\n\nWell, her parents had said that they didn\u2019t want her to go, although we\u2019ve all already paid $1000+ and booked it 6 months ago. Plans were SET, and we were ready to leave. So naturally I spent the next 45 minutes discussing what our course of action was to get around this situation.\n\nNo less than 5 minutes before I\u2019m saying bye to my friend on the phone, this lady sitting on the other side of the aisle to me raises her voice at me saying \n\n\u201care you going to stay on that fucking phone for the whole trip? You\u2019re being so rude!\u201d\n\n\u201cUm hello? How am I rude? I\u2019m talking to my friend and its only 12:30pm. That means daytime. That means people wont be sleeping\u201d\n\nNow I know that there may be some people asleep on the bus. I should know, I almost had a nap before my friend called me. But I\u2019m not sure how I was rude. If you didn\u2019t want this, then you should have flown and not caught a bus.\n\nSo Reddit, am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the AITA story is in the wrong. Let me read through the details carefully.\n\nSo the situation is that a 17-year-old is on a 10-hour bus trip. They used their phone for three hours. The main points: they were talking to their dad to plan a car return and a holiday, then their best friend called about a conflict with the friend's parents. The lady on the bus yelled at them for being rude. The person is defending that they were on a daytime call and people can't sleep if they're awake. Also, they mention the bus is cheaper, and maybe the lady chose the bus for that reason too.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the social norms around phone use on public transport. Generally, loud phone conversations can be disruptive, especially on long trips where people might be trying to rest. But the time of day is a factor here\u2014early afternoon, so maybe not as many people are asleep. The person did mention they were trying to nap before the call, so maybe others were trying to rest too.\n\nThe user's argument is that they were on the phone for a valid reason\u2014important family matters and planning. The friend's call was about a last-minute issue affecting a pre-booked holiday. That seems reasonable. However, the duration of the call\u2014three hours\u2014is quite long. Even if it was two separate calls (one to the dad and one to the friend), the total time adds up. \n\nAlso, the person's response to the lady was defensive. They said if the lady didn't want that, she should have flown. That part might come off as dismissive or rude. Even if the person is in the right, their reaction could have been better. However, the question is about being in the wrong in the situation, not the response.\n\nThe lady's complaint was about being rude. The standard for phone use on public transport often considers both volume and duration. If the person was speaking at a normal level and not disturbing others, maybe not. But if they were loud, that's a problem. The story doesn't mention volume, just that they were on the phone. The person is defensive, so maybe they didn't realize their volume or the length was an issue.\n\nThe person's age and traveling alone might also play a role. They might not have much experience with such situations. The lady's age is mentioned as possibly 35-45, which might make her feel like she has authority. But that's a bit of a stretch. The main issue is the phone use.\n\nSo, is the person in the wrong? If the lady was disturbed by the phone calls, even if they were daytime, maybe the person should have been more considerate. But the reason for the calls seems valid. The key is whether the phone use was disruptive. If they were talking loudly, then yes. If not, then maybe not. The story doesn't specify the volume, but the person didn't consider that others might be trying to rest. The lady's complaint is about rudeness, which is subjective. \n\nIn similar AITA situations, often the person using the phone in public is considered the asshole if they're disruptive. However, the context here includes important family matters. But public spaces require consideration for others. Even important calls should be done quietly and not for extended periods. The three-hour total might be too long for a shared space like a bus. \n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong for not considering others' need for quiet, even if the calls were necessary. But the lady's reaction was also aggressive (\"fucking phone\"), which is uncalled for. However, the question is about the author being in the wrong. \n\nGiven that, I think the answer is B\u2014No, the author is not in the wrong. The calls were for important reasons, and the time was daytime. The lady's complaint was harsh, and the author didn't do anything obviously rude. The duration might be an issue, but it's a 10-hour trip, so three hours is a third of the trip. Maybe acceptable if it's necessary and done at a reasonable volume. The author's response was defensive but not necessarily wrong. So, B.\n"
