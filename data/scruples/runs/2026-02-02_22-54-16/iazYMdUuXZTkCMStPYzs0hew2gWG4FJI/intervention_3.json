I was on the phone for 3 hours of a 10 hour bus trip\nSome notes:\n- this bus fare was $60 for an adult and $33 for a child (me) while a plane ticket usually averages $80 but are frequentl on sale for $60. Reason why I chose to take a bus is because I paid for the trip and I don\u2019t get paid very much from work to afford the luxury to fly just as yet.\n\n- I\u2019m 17 years old and this lady seems like she\u2019s 35-45 years old (in other words she might seem like she has some sort of authority over me because I\u2019m young and she\u2019s older)\n\n- I am travelling by myself\n\n\nSo picture this: monday morning at 9:15am 2/3rds of a bus gets filled with people to drive from Melbourne to Adelaide (~800km/500mi). I\u2019m on this bus trip for two main reasons: I have a car in Adelaide that I need to drive back to Melbourne and I also haven\u2019t seen my dad in 4 months aswell (he\u2019s the one who helped me buy the car aswell).\n\nNow up until this point, I have been trying to get in contact with my dad so I can plan this little mini-holiday and how everything will work from registering the car to discussing and fixing all the problems with the car (its an old car).  Notice how I said I was \u2018trying\u2019 to get in contact with my dad - being that he\u2019d lost his phone and hasn\u2019t been able to call me (didn\u2019t know my phone number).\nNow this was all until I called my grandparents who live in the same city as my dad. As it turned out, my father went to his parents house to use their phone to call me, right as I was about to call him. So fair enough, I was on the phone with my dad and we talked.\n\nSoon enough, we\u2019d planned our week ahead and eventually got onto other personal topics because we don\u2019t really call very often. By the time I say goodbye, it was about 11:35am. I was tired from the night before and try to get some rest.\n\nNo more than 15 minutes later, I get a call from my best friend. She was calling to tell me about how she and her parents got into a massive argument over the holiday we\u2019re going on in 9 days. To celebrate our passing of highschool, its tradition for students to go on a holiday somwhere in groups with the main intention to get as drunk as physically possible.\n\nWell, her parents had said that they didn\u2019t want her to go, although we\u2019ve all already paid $1000+ and booked it 6 months ago. Plans were SET, and we were ready to leave. So naturally I spent the next 45 minutes discussing what our course of action was to get around this situation.\n\nNo less than 5 minutes before I\u2019m saying bye to my friend on the phone, this lady sitting on the other side of the aisle to me raises her voice at me saying \n\n\u201care you going to stay on that fucking phone for the whole trip? You\u2019re being so rude!\u201d\n\n\u201cUm hello? How am I rude? I\u2019m talking to my friend and its only 12:30pm. That means daytime. That means people wont be sleeping\u201d\n\nNow I know that there may be some people asleep on the bus. I should know, I almost had a nap before my friend called me. But I\u2019m not sure how I was rude. If you didn\u2019t want this, then you should have flown and not caught a bus.\n\nSo Reddit, am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong based on the situation described. The author was on a bus for 10 hours, and spent 3 hours on the phone in the first 2.5 hours. The people involved are the author (17) and a woman in her 30s-40s.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the context. The author is traveling alone, which adds to the stress. They needed to contact their dad about a car and then their friend about a holiday conflict. The phone calls were for important, time-sensitive issues. The first call with the dad was necessary because he had lost his phone and they hadn't spoken in 4 months. The second call with the friend was about a planned trip where her parents changed their minds, so they needed to figure out a solution quickly.\n\nThe lady got angry at the author for being on the phone, calling them rude. The author defended themselves by saying it's daytime, so people aren't expected to sleep. They also mention that if the lady didn't want phone noise, she should have flown instead. \n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. Bus etiquette usually expects passengers to be considerate. Using a phone on speaker or loudly in public spaces can be seen as inconsiderate, but if it's a hands-free conversation and at a reasonable volume, it might be acceptable. However, the duration\u20143 hours\u2014is quite long. If the author was on the phone for that long, even if it's daytime, others might find it disruptive. However, the author had valid reasons: family and urgent matters.\n\nThe lady's reaction was harsh and confrontational. She raised her voice and used profanity, which is unkind. The author was on the phone for necessary reasons, and the timing (early afternoon) is not typically a quiet time. But maybe the author could have been more considerate in their phone usage, like using headphones or taking calls in a quieter area if available. However, the bus might not have such options. The author's defense that the lady could have flown is a bit flippant but highlights the cost issue the author is dealing with. \n\nConsidering all this, the root of the issue is the lady's inconsiderate and aggressive response. The author had valid reasons for their calls, but maybe could have tried to be more mindful. However, the lady's approach is the main problem here. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
