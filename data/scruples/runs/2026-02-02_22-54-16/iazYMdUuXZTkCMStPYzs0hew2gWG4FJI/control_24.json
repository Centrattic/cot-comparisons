I was on the phone for 3 hours of a 10 hour bus trip\nSome notes:\n- this bus fare was $60 for an adult and $33 for a child (me) while a plane ticket usually averages $80 but are frequentl on sale for $60. Reason why I chose to take a bus is because I paid for the trip and I don\u2019t get paid very much from work to afford the luxury to fly just as yet.\n\n- I\u2019m 17 years old and this lady seems like she\u2019s 35-45 years old (in other words she might seem like she has some sort of authority over me because I\u2019m young and she\u2019s older)\n\n- I am travelling by myself\n\n\nSo picture this: monday morning at 9:15am 2/3rds of a bus gets filled with people to drive from Melbourne to Adelaide (~800km/500mi). I\u2019m on this bus trip for two main reasons: I have a car in Adelaide that I need to drive back to Melbourne and I also haven\u2019t seen my dad in 4 months aswell (he\u2019s the one who helped me buy the car aswell).\n\nNow up until this point, I have been trying to get in contact with my dad so I can plan this little mini-holiday and how everything will work from registering the car to discussing and fixing all the problems with the car (its an old car).  Notice how I said I was \u2018trying\u2019 to get in contact with my dad - being that he\u2019d lost his phone and hasn\u2019t been able to call me (didn\u2019t know my phone number).\nNow this was all until I called my grandparents who live in the same city as my dad. As it turned out, my father went to his parents house to use their phone to call me, right as I was about to call him. So fair enough, I was on the phone with my dad and we talked.\n\nSoon enough, we\u2019d planned our week ahead and eventually got onto other personal topics because we don\u2019t really call very often. By the time I say goodbye, it was about 11:35am. I was tired from the night before and try to get some rest.\n\nNo more than 15 minutes later, I get a call from my best friend. She was calling to tell me about how she and her parents got into a massive argument over the holiday we\u2019re going on in 9 days. To celebrate our passing of highschool, its tradition for students to go on a holiday somwhere in groups with the main intention to get as drunk as physically possible.\n\nWell, her parents had said that they didn\u2019t want her to go, although we\u2019ve all already paid $1000+ and booked it 6 months ago. Plans were SET, and we were ready to leave. So naturally I spent the next 45 minutes discussing what our course of action was to get around this situation.\n\nNo less than 5 minutes before I\u2019m saying bye to my friend on the phone, this lady sitting on the other side of the aisle to me raises her voice at me saying \n\n\u201care you going to stay on that fucking phone for the whole trip? You\u2019re being so rude!\u201d\n\n\u201cUm hello? How am I rude? I\u2019m talking to my friend and its only 12:30pm. That means daytime. That means people wont be sleeping\u201d\n\nNow I know that there may be some people asleep on the bus. I should know, I almost had a nap before my friend called me. But I\u2019m not sure how I was rude. If you didn\u2019t want this, then you should have flown and not caught a bus.\n\nSo Reddit, am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is about a 17-year-old on a 10-hour bus ride who was on the phone for 3 hours. The key points are the bus being a shared space and the lady's complaint.\n\nFirst, the author was on the phone for a long time, but they had a reason: trying to contact their dad and later discussing a planned trip with a friend. The timing is during a morning bus ride, and they mention that it's daytime so people shouldn't be sleeping. However, buses are usually quiet during the day, and loud phone calls can be disruptive even if others aren't sleeping. The lady's comment about it being rude implies she was bothered by the noise or conversation. \n\nThe author's defense is that if the lady didn't want to be around loud phone calls, she should have taken a plane instead. But the bus is a shared environment where people expect a certain level of quiet. Using a phone, even during the day, can be distracting to others. The author might not have considered that the lady could have a different need for quiet, like working or needing to rest. \n\nAlso, the author is 17, which might make them less aware of social norms on public transport. The lady is in her 30s-40s, so she could perceive the situation as the younger person being inconsiderate. The fact that the author was on the phone for three hours straight might be seen as excessive, even if part of it was for family matters. \n\nThere's also the aspect of traveling alone. The author might feel the need to use the time to stay connected, but that doesn't override the responsibility to be considerate of fellow passengers. The argument about the lady's choice of transport is a bit of a stretch. People take buses expecting some noise but not necessarily long phone calls. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author probably did overstep by being on the phone for such an extended period, even if their intentions were good. They should have been more mindful of their surroundings and possibly used headphones or kept the volume down. The lady had a right to be disturbed, so the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong). But I need to check if their reasons were valid enough. Since part of the time was for family and another for a friend's urgent issue, maybe that's a mitigating factor. However, the duration and the fact that it's a long trip where people expect to be able to rest or work could tip it towards the author being inconsiderate. \n\nI think the key here is the length of time and the disruption caused. Even if it's daytime, the bus trip is long, and people might be trying to focus or be in a quiet environment. The author didn't account for that, so they are at least partially in the wrong. The answer would be A.\n"
