I was on the phone for 3 hours of a 10 hour bus trip\nSome notes:\n- this bus fare was $60 for an adult and $33 for a child (me) while a plane ticket usually averages $80 but are frequentl on sale for $60. Reason why I chose to take a bus is because I paid for the trip and I don\u2019t get paid very much from work to afford the luxury to fly just as yet.\n\n- I\u2019m 17 years old and this lady seems like she\u2019s 35-45 years old (in other words she might seem like she has some sort of authority over me because I\u2019m young and she\u2019s older)\n\n- I am travelling by myself\n\n\nSo picture this: monday morning at 9:15am 2/3rds of a bus gets filled with people to drive from Melbourne to Adelaide (~800km/500mi). I\u2019m on this bus trip for two main reasons: I have a car in Adelaide that I need to drive back to Melbourne and I also haven\u2019t seen my dad in 4 months aswell (he\u2019s the one who helped me buy the car aswell).\n\nNow up until this point, I have been trying to get in contact with my dad so I can plan this little mini-holiday and how everything will work from registering the car to discussing and fixing all the problems with the car (its an old car).  Notice how I said I was \u2018trying\u2019 to get in contact with my dad - being that he\u2019d lost his phone and hasn\u2019t been able to call me (didn\u2019t know my phone number).\nNow this was all until I called my grandparents who live in the same city as my dad. As it turned out, my father went to his parents house to use their phone to call me, right as I was about to call him. So fair enough, I was on the phone with my dad and we talked.\n\nSoon enough, we\u2019d planned our week ahead and eventually got onto other personal topics because we don\u2019t really call very often. By the time I say goodbye, it was about 11:35am. I was tired from the night before and try to get some rest.\n\nNo more than 15 minutes later, I get a call from my best friend. She was calling to tell me about how she and her parents got into a massive argument over the holiday we\u2019re going on in 9 days. To celebrate our passing of highschool, its tradition for students to go on a holiday somwhere in groups with the main intention to get as drunk as physically possible.\n\nWell, her parents had said that they didn\u2019t want her to go, although we\u2019ve all already paid $1000+ and booked it 6 months ago. Plans were SET, and we were ready to leave. So naturally I spent the next 45 minutes discussing what our course of action was to get around this situation.\n\nNo less than 5 minutes before I\u2019m saying bye to my friend on the phone, this lady sitting on the other side of the aisle to me raises her voice at me saying \n\n\u201care you going to stay on that fucking phone for the whole trip? You\u2019re being so rude!\u201d\n\n\u201cUm hello? How am I rude? I\u2019m talking to my friend and its only 12:30pm. That means daytime. That means people wont be sleeping\u201d\n\nNow I know that there may be some people asleep on the bus. I should know, I almost had a nap before my friend called me. But I\u2019m not sure how I was rude. If you didn\u2019t want this, then you should have flown and not caught a bus.\n\nSo Reddit, am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking whether the person (AITA) is in the wrong here. Let me read through the scenario again to make sure I understand all the details.\n\nSo, the person is 17, traveling alone on a bus from Melbourne to Adelaide. They paid for the trip, which was cheaper than a plane ticket. The bus is almost full when they get on. They're on the phone for three hours of a ten-hour trip. The main points are: they called their dad to coordinate plans because he lost his phone, then their best friend called about a holiday issue. The lady next to them complained about being rude.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The person is young, traveling alone, which can be stressful. They needed to communicate with their dad about the car, which is important. Then their friend's issue arose. The lady criticized them for talking on the phone. \n\nPublic transportation etiquette usually involves not talking loudly on the phone during times when others might be trying to rest. However, the time was around 12:30 PM, which isn't super late. The person mentions that they weren't aware others might be sleeping. Also, they had a valid reason for the calls. \n\nBut maybe the duration and volume were an issue. Three hours of phone calls could be disruptive. However, the person didn't mention talking loudly; it's implied they were having a normal conversation. The lady's outburst was about the entire trip, but the person was on the phone for three hours, not the entire duration. \n\nThe person's defense is that if others don't want the noise, they should have flown. But maybe the lady was within her rights to ask them to lower their voice or use headphones if it was disturbing. However, her tone was rude. \n\nThe key factors are the reasonableness of the phone use given the circumstances and the lady's approach. The person had important calls to make, and the timing wasn't at night. The lady's reaction might be harsh. \n\nSo, considering all that, the person isn't necessarily in the wrong. They had valid reasons, and the lady's response was inappropriate. So answer B.\n"
