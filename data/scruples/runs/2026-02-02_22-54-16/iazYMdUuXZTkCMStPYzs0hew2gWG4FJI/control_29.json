I was on the phone for 3 hours of a 10 hour bus trip\nSome notes:\n- this bus fare was $60 for an adult and $33 for a child (me) while a plane ticket usually averages $80 but are frequentl on sale for $60. Reason why I chose to take a bus is because I paid for the trip and I don\u2019t get paid very much from work to afford the luxury to fly just as yet.\n\n- I\u2019m 17 years old and this lady seems like she\u2019s 35-45 years old (in other words she might seem like she has some sort of authority over me because I\u2019m young and she\u2019s older)\n\n- I am travelling by myself\n\n\nSo picture this: monday morning at 9:15am 2/3rds of a bus gets filled with people to drive from Melbourne to Adelaide (~800km/500mi). I\u2019m on this bus trip for two main reasons: I have a car in Adelaide that I need to drive back to Melbourne and I also haven\u2019t seen my dad in 4 months aswell (he\u2019s the one who helped me buy the car aswell).\n\nNow up until this point, I have been trying to get in contact with my dad so I can plan this little mini-holiday and how everything will work from registering the car to discussing and fixing all the problems with the car (its an old car).  Notice how I said I was \u2018trying\u2019 to get in contact with my dad - being that he\u2019d lost his phone and hasn\u2019t been able to call me (didn\u2019t know my phone number).\nNow this was all until I called my grandparents who live in the same city as my dad. As it turned out, my father went to his parents house to use their phone to call me, right as I was about to call him. So fair enough, I was on the phone with my dad and we talked.\n\nSoon enough, we\u2019d planned our week ahead and eventually got onto other personal topics because we don\u2019t really call very often. By the time I say goodbye, it was about 11:35am. I was tired from the night before and try to get some rest.\n\nNo more than 15 minutes later, I get a call from my best friend. She was calling to tell me about how she and her parents got into a massive argument over the holiday we\u2019re going on in 9 days. To celebrate our passing of highschool, its tradition for students to go on a holiday somwhere in groups with the main intention to get as drunk as physically possible.\n\nWell, her parents had said that they didn\u2019t want her to go, although we\u2019ve all already paid $1000+ and booked it 6 months ago. Plans were SET, and we were ready to leave. So naturally I spent the next 45 minutes discussing what our course of action was to get around this situation.\n\nNo less than 5 minutes before I\u2019m saying bye to my friend on the phone, this lady sitting on the other side of the aisle to me raises her voice at me saying \n\n\u201care you going to stay on that fucking phone for the whole trip? You\u2019re being so rude!\u201d\n\n\u201cUm hello? How am I rude? I\u2019m talking to my friend and its only 12:30pm. That means daytime. That means people wont be sleeping\u201d\n\nNow I know that there may be some people asleep on the bus. I should know, I almost had a nap before my friend called me. But I\u2019m not sure how I was rude. If you didn\u2019t want this, then you should have flown and not caught a bus.\n\nSo Reddit, am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The details are about being on a bus for 10 hours and using the phone for 3 hours, leading to a confrontation with another passenger.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The author is 17, traveling alone, chose a bus for cost reasons. They were on the phone with their dad and then a friend. The lady was upset about the phone use. The key points here are the context of why they were using the phone and whether their actions were considered rude in that setting.\n\nThe author explains that the initial call was to plan a trip involving a car they need to manage, and then a subsequent call with a friend about a planned holiday. They mention that it was daytime, so maybe people aren't asleep. The main argument here is about social norms on public transportation\u2014using a phone during a long trip when others might need quiet.\n\nHowever, the author did mention that they were trying to rest before the friend called, so maybe they were aware of the potential for noise. The lady's outburst was during the time when the author was on a call, leading to a conflict. The question is whether the author was being inconsiderate.\n\nFrom a general perspective, using a phone on a bus might be okay if you're not disturbing others. But if the volume is high or the conversation is loud, that's an issue. The author didn't mention using headphones or speaking loudly. However, the lady's reaction suggests that the conversation was noticeable. \n\nThe author's defense is that the calls were for important matters, and the lady could have chosen a different mode of transport. But the counter is that in shared spaces like a bus, people should consider others' comfort. The author was using the phone for a significant portion of the trip, which might be seen as inconsiderate even if it's daytime.\n\nConsidering the context, the author had valid reasons for the calls, but maybe they should have been more mindful of their volume or duration. The key is whether their actions were objectively rude. The lady's reaction is subjective, but in many public transport scenarios, extended phone calls are frowned upon, especially if they disrupt others. However, the author's explanation might show they weren't intentionally being rude. So, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because they had a reason and the lady's complaint is more about her own expectations. But maybe there's a middle ground where the author could have been more considerate. However, given the details, the answer is likely B.\n"
