I was on the phone for 3 hours of a 10 hour bus trip\nSome notes:\n- this bus fare was $60 for an adult and $33 for a child (me) while a plane ticket usually averages $80 but are frequentl on sale for $60. Reason why I chose to take a bus is because I paid for the trip and I don\u2019t get paid very much from work to afford the luxury to fly just as yet.\n\n- I\u2019m 17 years old and this lady seems like she\u2019s 35-45 years old (in other words she might seem like she has some sort of authority over me because I\u2019m young and she\u2019s older)\n\n- I am travelling by myself\n\n\nSo picture this: monday morning at 9:15am 2/3rds of a bus gets filled with people to drive from Melbourne to Adelaide (~800km/500mi). I\u2019m on this bus trip for two main reasons: I have a car in Adelaide that I need to drive back to Melbourne and I also haven\u2019t seen my dad in 4 months aswell (he\u2019s the one who helped me buy the car aswell).\n\nNow up until this point, I have been trying to get in contact with my dad so I can plan this little mini-holiday and how everything will work from registering the car to discussing and fixing all the problems with the car (its an old car).  Notice how I said I was \u2018trying\u2019 to get in contact with my dad - being that he\u2019d lost his phone and hasn\u2019t been able to call me (didn\u2019t know my phone number).\nNow this was all until I called my grandparents who live in the same city as my dad. As it turned out, my father went to his parents house to use their phone to call me, right as I was about to call him. So fair enough, I was on the phone with my dad and we talked.\n\nSoon enough, we\u2019d planned our week ahead and eventually got onto other personal topics because we don\u2019t really call very often. By the time I say goodbye, it was about 11:35am. I was tired from the night before and try to get some rest.\n\nNo more than 15 minutes later, I get a call from my best friend. She was calling to tell me about how she and her parents got into a massive argument over the holiday we\u2019re going on in 9 days. To celebrate our passing of highschool, its tradition for students to go on a holiday somwhere in groups with the main intention to get as drunk as physically possible.\n\nWell, her parents had said that they didn\u2019t want her to go, although we\u2019ve all already paid $1000+ and booked it 6 months ago. Plans were SET, and we were ready to leave. So naturally I spent the next 45 minutes discussing what our course of action was to get around this situation.\n\nNo less than 5 minutes before I\u2019m saying bye to my friend on the phone, this lady sitting on the other side of the aisle to me raises her voice at me saying \n\n\u201care you going to stay on that fucking phone for the whole trip? You\u2019re being so rude!\u201d\n\n\u201cUm hello? How am I rude? I\u2019m talking to my friend and its only 12:30pm. That means daytime. That means people wont be sleeping\u201d\n\nNow I know that there may be some people asleep on the bus. I should know, I almost had a nap before my friend called me. But I\u2019m not sure how I was rude. If you didn\u2019t want this, then you should have flown and not caught a bus.\n\nSo Reddit, am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in the given situation. They were on a bus for 10 hours, using their phone for three hours, talking to family and friends. The main issue is a lady yelling at them for being rude.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The author is 17, traveling alone, which might make them more defensive. They paid for the bus trip themselves, and the cost was a factor in choosing the bus over a plane. The phone calls were to their dad about important plans and to their friend about a holiday issue.\n\nThe lady complained about the phone use. The key points here are about bus etiquette. Is talking on the phone during the day considered rude? Some people might be sensitive to noise, especially in a confined space. But the author points out it's daytime and mentions others might be sleeping. However, the lady's outburst was loud, which could be disruptive.\n\nI should consider both sides. The author has a reason to be on the phone\u2014important family matters and a friend's problem. But using a phone in a public transport space can be considered impolite to others. However, the lady's reaction was aggressive, which might be the bigger issue. The author's defense is valid about choosing the bus due to cost and the lady's choice to not fly. \n\nPublic transport etiquette often involves keeping noise levels down, especially in shared spaces. But daytime might be more forgiving than night. The duration of the calls adds up, but the author was on the phone for 3 hours out of 10. It's possible the lady was just having a bad day, but the tone of her comments was harsh.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Maybe not entirely. They had valid reasons, but perhaps they could have been more considerate in volume or location (like using a headset). However, the lady's approach was confrontational. The author might not be the asshole here, but there's room for both to be more considerate. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) because the primary responsibility for the outburst is on the lady's side.\n"
