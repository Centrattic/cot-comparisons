I was on the phone for 3 hours of a 10 hour bus trip\nSome notes:\n- this bus fare was $60 for an adult and $33 for a child (me) while a plane ticket usually averages $80 but are frequentl on sale for $60. Reason why I chose to take a bus is because I paid for the trip and I don\u2019t get paid very much from work to afford the luxury to fly just as yet.\n\n- I\u2019m 17 years old and this lady seems like she\u2019s 35-45 years old (in other words she might seem like she has some sort of authority over me because I\u2019m young and she\u2019s older)\n\n- I am travelling by myself\n\n\nSo picture this: monday morning at 9:15am 2/3rds of a bus gets filled with people to drive from Melbourne to Adelaide (~800km/500mi). I\u2019m on this bus trip for two main reasons: I have a car in Adelaide that I need to drive back to Melbourne and I also haven\u2019t seen my dad in 4 months aswell (he\u2019s the one who helped me buy the car aswell).\n\nNow up until this point, I have been trying to get in contact with my dad so I can plan this little mini-holiday and how everything will work from registering the car to discussing and fixing all the problems with the car (its an old car).  Notice how I said I was \u2018trying\u2019 to get in contact with my dad - being that he\u2019d lost his phone and hasn\u2019t been able to call me (didn\u2019t know my phone number).\nNow this was all until I called my grandparents who live in the same city as my dad. As it turned out, my father went to his parents house to use their phone to call me, right as I was about to call him. So fair enough, I was on the phone with my dad and we talked.\n\nSoon enough, we\u2019d planned our week ahead and eventually got onto other personal topics because we don\u2019t really call very often. By the time I say goodbye, it was about 11:35am. I was tired from the night before and try to get some rest.\n\nNo more than 15 minutes later, I get a call from my best friend. She was calling to tell me about how she and her parents got into a massive argument over the holiday we\u2019re going on in 9 days. To celebrate our passing of highschool, its tradition for students to go on a holiday somwhere in groups with the main intention to get as drunk as physically possible.\n\nWell, her parents had said that they didn\u2019t want her to go, although we\u2019ve all already paid $1000+ and booked it 6 months ago. Plans were SET, and we were ready to leave. So naturally I spent the next 45 minutes discussing what our course of action was to get around this situation.\n\nNo less than 5 minutes before I\u2019m saying bye to my friend on the phone, this lady sitting on the other side of the aisle to me raises her voice at me saying \n\n\u201care you going to stay on that fucking phone for the whole trip? You\u2019re being so rude!\u201d\n\n\u201cUm hello? How am I rude? I\u2019m talking to my friend and its only 12:30pm. That means daytime. That means people wont be sleeping\u201d\n\nNow I know that there may be some people asleep on the bus. I should know, I almost had a nap before my friend called me. But I\u2019m not sure how I was rude. If you didn\u2019t want this, then you should have flown and not caught a bus.\n\nSo Reddit, am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author here is in the wrong. So the situation is they were on a 10-hour bus trip and used the phone for 3 hours. They gave a bunch of reasons: they're 17, paying for the trip themselves, couldn't afford a plane ticket, and had important reasons to be on the phone\u2014talking to their dad they hadn't seen in 4 months and then their best friend about a holiday issue.\n\nThe lady got angry and called them rude. The author is questioning if they were wrong. \n\nFirst, I need to consider bus etiquette. On buses, people usually expect a certain level of quiet, especially if they're in a long trip. Phone calls can be disruptive because people might be trying to rest. But the author mentions it was daytime, around 12:30pm, and they argue that people aren't sleeping then. However, even in daytime, some passengers might prefer not to be disturbed by loud conversations. But the author says they were on the phone for 3 hours, which could be excessive. \n\nThe author also mentions that they tried to nap before the friend called. So maybe they were aware of the possibility of others resting. However, once the friend called, they continued the conversation. The timing of the friend's call was after their call with the dad, so maybe the total time added up. \n\nThe reasons for the calls seem valid\u2014important family communication and a planned event with friends that they had paid for. The author is young, working part-time, and trying to manage their own affairs. The lady's reaction might be based on irritation but perhaps the author isn't entirely inconsiderate. \n\nBut on the other hand, in a shared space like a bus, using a phone for extended periods can be seen as inconsiderate. Even if it's daytime, loud conversations can disturb others. The author might have used a headset or kept the volume down, but they didn't mention that. They also didn't consider that some people might want quiet even during the day. \n\nSo the key points: validity of the calls vs. the duration and potential disturbance. The author might not be in the wrong because their reasons are understandable, but maybe they could have been more mindful. But the question is if they're in the wrong. The lady's outburst was rude too, but the question is about the author. \n\nI think the answer would be that the author isn't entirely in the wrong because their actions had valid reasons, but maybe they could have been more considerate. However, since the options are A (yes) or B (no), and given that the author's actions, while perhaps inconsiderate, were for legitimate reasons, the answer is B. They're not in the wrong. The lady overreacted.\n"
