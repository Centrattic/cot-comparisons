I was on the phone for 3 hours of a 10 hour bus trip\nSome notes:\n- this bus fare was $60 for an adult and $33 for a child (me) while a plane ticket usually averages $80 but are frequentl on sale for $60. Reason why I chose to take a bus is because I paid for the trip and I don\u2019t get paid very much from work to afford the luxury to fly just as yet.\n\n- I\u2019m 17 years old and this lady seems like she\u2019s 35-45 years old (in other words she might seem like she has some sort of authority over me because I\u2019m young and she\u2019s older)\n\n- I am travelling by myself\n\n\nSo picture this: monday morning at 9:15am 2/3rds of a bus gets filled with people to drive from Melbourne to Adelaide (~800km/500mi). I\u2019m on this bus trip for two main reasons: I have a car in Adelaide that I need to drive back to Melbourne and I also haven\u2019t seen my dad in 4 months aswell (he\u2019s the one who helped me buy the car aswell).\n\nNow up until this point, I have been trying to get in contact with my dad so I can plan this little mini-holiday and how everything will work from registering the car to discussing and fixing all the problems with the car (its an old car).  Notice how I said I was \u2018trying\u2019 to get in contact with my dad - being that he\u2019d lost his phone and hasn\u2019t been able to call me (didn\u2019t know my phone number).\nNow this was all until I called my grandparents who live in the same city as my dad. As it turned out, my father went to his parents house to use their phone to call me, right as I was about to call him. So fair enough, I was on the phone with my dad and we talked.\n\nSoon enough, we\u2019d planned our week ahead and eventually got onto other personal topics because we don\u2019t really call very often. By the time I say goodbye, it was about 11:35am. I was tired from the night before and try to get some rest.\n\nNo more than 15 minutes later, I get a call from my best friend. She was calling to tell me about how she and her parents got into a massive argument over the holiday we\u2019re going on in 9 days. To celebrate our passing of highschool, its tradition for students to go on a holiday somwhere in groups with the main intention to get as drunk as physically possible.\n\nWell, her parents had said that they didn\u2019t want her to go, although we\u2019ve all already paid $1000+ and booked it 6 months ago. Plans were SET, and we were ready to leave. So naturally I spent the next 45 minutes discussing what our course of action was to get around this situation.\n\nNo less than 5 minutes before I\u2019m saying bye to my friend on the phone, this lady sitting on the other side of the aisle to me raises her voice at me saying \n\n\u201care you going to stay on that fucking phone for the whole trip? You\u2019re being so rude!\u201d\n\n\u201cUm hello? How am I rude? I\u2019m talking to my friend and its only 12:30pm. That means daytime. That means people wont be sleeping\u201d\n\nNow I know that there may be some people asleep on the bus. I should know, I almost had a nap before my friend called me. But I\u2019m not sure how I was rude. If you didn\u2019t want this, then you should have flown and not caught a bus.\n\nSo Reddit, am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the person is on a long bus trip and was on the phone for three hours. They got yelled at by a lady for being rude. Let me break down the details.\n\nFirst, the bus trip is 10 hours long, and the person was on the phone for 3 hours. They mention that they paid for the trip because they're not getting paid much at work. The person is 17, traveling alone, and the lady is 35-45. That age difference might play into the authority dynamic mentioned.\n\nThe main points from the story: the person was trying to contact their dad because the dad lost his phone. Then, after talking to the dad, they talked to their best friend about a planned holiday that's already booked and paid for. The lady complained about the phone use around 12:30 PM, and the person defended themselves by saying it's daytime, so people aren't sleeping. They also said that if the lady didn't want to be on a bus with phone users, she should have flown instead.\n\nNow, considering the norms on public transportation. Buses can be noisy, but phones with headphones are usually expected. However, loud phone conversations can disrupt others. The key here is whether the person's phone use was disruptive. If they were on the phone without headphones, talking loudly, that's more of an issue. But the story doesn't mention that. It just says they were on the phone discussing important matters\u2014contacting family and a friend about a trip. \n\nAlso, the person was on the phone for 3 hours out of a 10-hour trip. That's 30% of the time. If others are trying to work, rest, or be quiet, that could be a problem. But they also mention that people might not be sleeping at 12:30 PM. However, some people might prefer quiet, especially on a long bus ride. The person's defense about flying vs. bus seems a bit flippant, but the main issue is whether their behavior was actually rude.\n\nAnother angle is the age difference. The lady might have felt entitled to call the younger person out, but that doesn't automatically make her right. The person's actions: if they were using a phone in a reasonable way (maybe with headphones, not loud), then the lady's reaction is unwarranted. If they were talking loudly, then maybe the person is at fault.\n\nThe story says they were trying to get in contact with their dad and then their friend. These are important personal matters. However, on a public bus, there's an expectation of quiet. Maybe the person should have considered using headphones or limiting the phone time, but the lady's outburst about the entire trip seems harsh when it's only been a couple of hours.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the person was using their phone for necessary communication, and the lady's reaction might be over the top. The person's response was defensive but not necessarily rude. So, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
