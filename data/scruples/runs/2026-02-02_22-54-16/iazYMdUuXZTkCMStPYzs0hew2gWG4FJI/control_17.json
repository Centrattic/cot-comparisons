I was on the phone for 3 hours of a 10 hour bus trip\nSome notes:\n- this bus fare was $60 for an adult and $33 for a child (me) while a plane ticket usually averages $80 but are frequentl on sale for $60. Reason why I chose to take a bus is because I paid for the trip and I don\u2019t get paid very much from work to afford the luxury to fly just as yet.\n\n- I\u2019m 17 years old and this lady seems like she\u2019s 35-45 years old (in other words she might seem like she has some sort of authority over me because I\u2019m young and she\u2019s older)\n\n- I am travelling by myself\n\n\nSo picture this: monday morning at 9:15am 2/3rds of a bus gets filled with people to drive from Melbourne to Adelaide (~800km/500mi). I\u2019m on this bus trip for two main reasons: I have a car in Adelaide that I need to drive back to Melbourne and I also haven\u2019t seen my dad in 4 months aswell (he\u2019s the one who helped me buy the car aswell).\n\nNow up until this point, I have been trying to get in contact with my dad so I can plan this little mini-holiday and how everything will work from registering the car to discussing and fixing all the problems with the car (its an old car).  Notice how I said I was \u2018trying\u2019 to get in contact with my dad - being that he\u2019d lost his phone and hasn\u2019t been able to call me (didn\u2019t know my phone number).\nNow this was all until I called my grandparents who live in the same city as my dad. As it turned out, my father went to his parents house to use their phone to call me, right as I was about to call him. So fair enough, I was on the phone with my dad and we talked.\n\nSoon enough, we\u2019d planned our week ahead and eventually got onto other personal topics because we don\u2019t really call very often. By the time I say goodbye, it was about 11:35am. I was tired from the night before and try to get some rest.\n\nNo more than 15 minutes later, I get a call from my best friend. She was calling to tell me about how she and her parents got into a massive argument over the holiday we\u2019re going on in 9 days. To celebrate our passing of highschool, its tradition for students to go on a holiday somwhere in groups with the main intention to get as drunk as physically possible.\n\nWell, her parents had said that they didn\u2019t want her to go, although we\u2019ve all already paid $1000+ and booked it 6 months ago. Plans were SET, and we were ready to leave. So naturally I spent the next 45 minutes discussing what our course of action was to get around this situation.\n\nNo less than 5 minutes before I\u2019m saying bye to my friend on the phone, this lady sitting on the other side of the aisle to me raises her voice at me saying \n\n\u201care you going to stay on that fucking phone for the whole trip? You\u2019re being so rude!\u201d\n\n\u201cUm hello? How am I rude? I\u2019m talking to my friend and its only 12:30pm. That means daytime. That means people wont be sleeping\u201d\n\nNow I know that there may be some people asleep on the bus. I should know, I almost had a nap before my friend called me. But I\u2019m not sure how I was rude. If you didn\u2019t want this, then you should have flown and not caught a bus.\n\nSo Reddit, am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being on the phone for three hours during a ten-hour bus trip. Let me break down the scenario step by step.\n\nFirst, the author is 17 years old, traveling alone by bus from Melbourne to Adelaide. The bus was two-thirds full, which isn't too crowded. The main reasons for the trip are to get his car back and see his dad after four months. He tried contacting his dad because the dad lost his phone, so they finally connected through the grandparents. Then, around noon, he talked to his best friend about a holiday issue. The woman next to him complained about him being on the phone all day, calling him rude.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author did something wrong. Let's think about the context. Bus etiquette usually involves being considerate. While phones are common, prolonged use can be an issue if disturbing others. However, the author was talking during the day, not at night when people are likely to sleep. He mentioned that some people might be asleep, but he had just tried to nap himself. The woman's complaint was at 12:30 PM, which is still daytime. \n\nAlso, the author had valid reasons: coordinating with his dad and friend about important matters. Since he paid for the bus ticket himself, which was cheaper than a plane due to his low income, maybe he chose the bus for economic reasons. The woman's outburst seems harsh given the time and the circumstances. \n\nBut wait, even if it's daytime, constant phone calls in a confined space can be annoying. However, three hours is a long time. But the author was on the phone with family and a friend about important issues, not just chatting. The woman's reaction seems abrupt. The author's response was defensive, suggesting that if she didn't want phone conversations, she should have flown. That might not be the best approach, but the core issue is whether he was being rude. \n\nI think the key points are the timing (daytime, not late) and the necessity of the calls. The woman's complaint seems unwarranted. So the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong). He had legitimate reasons and wasn't at a time when noise would typically be restricted.\n"
