I was on the phone for 3 hours of a 10 hour bus trip\nSome notes:\n- this bus fare was $60 for an adult and $33 for a child (me) while a plane ticket usually averages $80 but are frequentl on sale for $60. Reason why I chose to take a bus is because I paid for the trip and I don\u2019t get paid very much from work to afford the luxury to fly just as yet.\n\n- I\u2019m 17 years old and this lady seems like she\u2019s 35-45 years old (in other words she might seem like she has some sort of authority over me because I\u2019m young and she\u2019s older)\n\n- I am travelling by myself\n\n\nSo picture this: monday morning at 9:15am 2/3rds of a bus gets filled with people to drive from Melbourne to Adelaide (~800km/500mi). I\u2019m on this bus trip for two main reasons: I have a car in Adelaide that I need to drive back to Melbourne and I also haven\u2019t seen my dad in 4 months aswell (he\u2019s the one who helped me buy the car aswell).\n\nNow up until this point, I have been trying to get in contact with my dad so I can plan this little mini-holiday and how everything will work from registering the car to discussing and fixing all the problems with the car (its an old car).  Notice how I said I was \u2018trying\u2019 to get in contact with my dad - being that he\u2019d lost his phone and hasn\u2019t been able to call me (didn\u2019t know my phone number).\nNow this was all until I called my grandparents who live in the same city as my dad. As it turned out, my father went to his parents house to use their phone to call me, right as I was about to call him. So fair enough, I was on the phone with my dad and we talked.\n\nSoon enough, we\u2019d planned our week ahead and eventually got onto other personal topics because we don\u2019t really call very often. By the time I say goodbye, it was about 11:35am. I was tired from the night before and try to get some rest.\n\nNo more than 15 minutes later, I get a call from my best friend. She was calling to tell me about how she and her parents got into a massive argument over the holiday we\u2019re going on in 9 days. To celebrate our passing of highschool, its tradition for students to go on a holiday somwhere in groups with the main intention to get as drunk as physically possible.\n\nWell, her parents had said that they didn\u2019t want her to go, although we\u2019ve all already paid $1000+ and booked it 6 months ago. Plans were SET, and we were ready to leave. So naturally I spent the next 45 minutes discussing what our course of action was to get around this situation.\n\nNo less than 5 minutes before I\u2019m saying bye to my friend on the phone, this lady sitting on the other side of the aisle to me raises her voice at me saying \n\n\u201care you going to stay on that fucking phone for the whole trip? You\u2019re being so rude!\u201d\n\n\u201cUm hello? How am I rude? I\u2019m talking to my friend and its only 12:30pm. That means daytime. That means people wont be sleeping\u201d\n\nNow I know that there may be some people asleep on the bus. I should know, I almost had a nap before my friend called me. But I\u2019m not sure how I was rude. If you didn\u2019t want this, then you should have flown and not caught a bus.\n\nSo Reddit, am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is during a 10-hour bus trip, the author was on the phone for 3 hours. The key points are the reasons for the calls, the time of day, and the response from the other passenger.\n\nFirst, the author is 17, traveling alone, and chose the bus because it's cheaper. They had a valid reason to call their dad about a car and family stuff. Then they talked to their best friend about a holiday conflict. The lady got upset at the end when the author was talking to the friend, saying they're being rude. The author argues that it's daytime, so people shouldn't be asleep, and if they didn't want phone noise, they should have flown.\n\nI need to decide if the author was wrong. Let's think about social norms on buses. Generally, people expect some quiet, especially in long trips. But the time was around noon, so maybe fewer people are asleep then. The author was using a phone, which is common, but the duration might be a factor. However, the author had legitimate reasons for the calls. The lady's outburst seems harsh. Also, the author was talking to their dad first, which is a family matter, then a friend. But the friend call was after the dad, and the lady complained after that. The author's response is defensive, pointing out the time and implying it's the lady's choice to take the bus.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Maybe not entirely. They had valid reasons for the calls. However, using a phone on a bus for 3 hours could be disruptive even in daytime. But the lady's reaction might be over the top. Maybe the author could have used headphones or tried to keep the volume down, but the situation might not be entirely their fault. The key is whether their actions were unreasonable. Since they were dealing with important personal matters and the time was daytime, perhaps the author isn't in the wrong. The lady's complaint might be unwarranted. So, answer B.\n"
