I was on the phone for 3 hours of a 10 hour bus trip\nSome notes:\n- this bus fare was $60 for an adult and $33 for a child (me) while a plane ticket usually averages $80 but are frequentl on sale for $60. Reason why I chose to take a bus is because I paid for the trip and I don\u2019t get paid very much from work to afford the luxury to fly just as yet.\n\n- I\u2019m 17 years old and this lady seems like she\u2019s 35-45 years old (in other words she might seem like she has some sort of authority over me because I\u2019m young and she\u2019s older)\n\n- I am travelling by myself\n\n\nSo picture this: monday morning at 9:15am 2/3rds of a bus gets filled with people to drive from Melbourne to Adelaide (~800km/500mi). I\u2019m on this bus trip for two main reasons: I have a car in Adelaide that I need to drive back to Melbourne and I also haven\u2019t seen my dad in 4 months aswell (he\u2019s the one who helped me buy the car aswell).\n\nNow up until this point, I have been trying to get in contact with my dad so I can plan this little mini-holiday and how everything will work from registering the car to discussing and fixing all the problems with the car (its an old car).  Notice how I said I was \u2018trying\u2019 to get in contact with my dad - being that he\u2019d lost his phone and hasn\u2019t been able to call me (didn\u2019t know my phone number).\nNow this was all until I called my grandparents who live in the same city as my dad. As it turned out, my father went to his parents house to use their phone to call me, right as I was about to call him. So fair enough, I was on the phone with my dad and we talked.\n\nSoon enough, we\u2019d planned our week ahead and eventually got onto other personal topics because we don\u2019t really call very often. By the time I say goodbye, it was about 11:35am. I was tired from the night before and try to get some rest.\n\nNo more than 15 minutes later, I get a call from my best friend. She was calling to tell me about how she and her parents got into a massive argument over the holiday we\u2019re going on in 9 days. To celebrate our passing of highschool, its tradition for students to go on a holiday somwhere in groups with the main intention to get as drunk as physically possible.\n\nWell, her parents had said that they didn\u2019t want her to go, although we\u2019ve all already paid $1000+ and booked it 6 months ago. Plans were SET, and we were ready to leave. So naturally I spent the next 45 minutes discussing what our course of action was to get around this situation.\n\nNo less than 5 minutes before I\u2019m saying bye to my friend on the phone, this lady sitting on the other side of the aisle to me raises her voice at me saying \n\n\u201care you going to stay on that fucking phone for the whole trip? You\u2019re being so rude!\u201d\n\n\u201cUm hello? How am I rude? I\u2019m talking to my friend and its only 12:30pm. That means daytime. That means people wont be sleeping\u201d\n\nNow I know that there may be some people asleep on the bus. I should know, I almost had a nap before my friend called me. But I\u2019m not sure how I was rude. If you didn\u2019t want this, then you should have flown and not caught a bus.\n\nSo Reddit, am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about being on the phone for a long time during a bus trip and being scolded by another passenger.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the details. The author is 17, traveling alone, and paid for the bus. The bus fare was cheaper than a plane ticket, which makes sense because they mentioned not getting paid very much. The lady who scolded them is 35-45, so maybe she thought she had authority due to the age difference. The author was on the phone for about 3 hours, starting around 9:15 AM, so during the day. They were talking to their dad after trying to contact him all night, and then to their best friend about a planned trip. The lady complained because she thought it was rude to be on the phone so much. \n\nThe key points here are timing and context. Since it's a daytime bus ride and the author was using their own time to make important calls, maybe to family and friends, that's reasonable. However, bus etiquette usually involves keeping noise down so others can rest or work. Even during the day, some passengers might prefer not to be disturbed. The author's defense is that if the lady didn't want that, she should have taken a plane, but that's a bit dismissive. \n\nOn the other hand, the author was using the bus for legitimate communication needs, especially since they needed to coordinate with their dad about the car. The friend's call was also about an important event they had already planned and paid for. So, the author's actions could be seen as justified. \n\nBut, maybe the author could have been more considerate, like speaking in a lower voice or using headphones if possible. However, the post doesn't mention if the author was loud. The lady raised her voice, which might indicate she was disturbed. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, people often get called out for not considering others' comfort even if they have their reasons. The author might not be in the wrong because they were using the bus for necessary communication, but there's also a case for being considerate. However, since the author was talking on the phone during the day and the lady's complaint was about the duration, the answer could be B. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong, but maybe they should have been more mindful. But given the circumstances, the answer is B.\n"
