I was on the phone for 3 hours of a 10 hour bus trip\nSome notes:\n- this bus fare was $60 for an adult and $33 for a child (me) while a plane ticket usually averages $80 but are frequentl on sale for $60. Reason why I chose to take a bus is because I paid for the trip and I don\u2019t get paid very much from work to afford the luxury to fly just as yet.\n\n- I\u2019m 17 years old and this lady seems like she\u2019s 35-45 years old (in other words she might seem like she has some sort of authority over me because I\u2019m young and she\u2019s older)\n\n- I am travelling by myself\n\n\nSo picture this: monday morning at 9:15am 2/3rds of a bus gets filled with people to drive from Melbourne to Adelaide (~800km/500mi). I\u2019m on this bus trip for two main reasons: I have a car in Adelaide that I need to drive back to Melbourne and I also haven\u2019t seen my dad in 4 months aswell (he\u2019s the one who helped me buy the car aswell).\n\nNow up until this point, I have been trying to get in contact with my dad so I can plan this little mini-holiday and how everything will work from registering the car to discussing and fixing all the problems with the car (its an old car).  Notice how I said I was \u2018trying\u2019 to get in contact with my dad - being that he\u2019d lost his phone and hasn\u2019t been able to call me (didn\u2019t know my phone number).\nNow this was all until I called my grandparents who live in the same city as my dad. As it turned out, my father went to his parents house to use their phone to call me, right as I was about to call him. So fair enough, I was on the phone with my dad and we talked.\n\nSoon enough, we\u2019d planned our week ahead and eventually got onto other personal topics because we don\u2019t really call very often. By the time I say goodbye, it was about 11:35am. I was tired from the night before and try to get some rest.\n\nNo more than 15 minutes later, I get a call from my best friend. She was calling to tell me about how she and her parents got into a massive argument over the holiday we\u2019re going on in 9 days. To celebrate our passing of highschool, its tradition for students to go on a holiday somwhere in groups with the main intention to get as drunk as physically possible.\n\nWell, her parents had said that they didn\u2019t want her to go, although we\u2019ve all already paid $1000+ and booked it 6 months ago. Plans were SET, and we were ready to leave. So naturally I spent the next 45 minutes discussing what our course of action was to get around this situation.\n\nNo less than 5 minutes before I\u2019m saying bye to my friend on the phone, this lady sitting on the other side of the aisle to me raises her voice at me saying \n\n\u201care you going to stay on that fucking phone for the whole trip? You\u2019re being so rude!\u201d\n\n\u201cUm hello? How am I rude? I\u2019m talking to my friend and its only 12:30pm. That means daytime. That means people wont be sleeping\u201d\n\nNow I know that there may be some people asleep on the bus. I should know, I almost had a nap before my friend called me. But I\u2019m not sure how I was rude. If you didn\u2019t want this, then you should have flown and not caught a bus.\n\nSo Reddit, am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in the given situation. The scenario is about a 17-year-old taking a bus trip and being reprimanded by another passenger for talking on the phone for a long time.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is on a 10-hour bus ride, and they've been on the phone for three hours. The person who confronts them is older, which adds a dynamic where the author might feel looked down upon. The main points are the bus vs. flight cost, the reason for the call (organizing with dad, then discussing a school trip with a friend), and the time of day (midday, not the middle of the night).\n\nThe key factors here are the time of day and the environment. Bus rides, especially long ones, are public spaces where people have different expectations. Even if it's daytime, some passengers might be trying to rest, especially if they're on a long trip. The author mentions that they almost had a nap before the friend called, which suggests that some people might indeed be trying to sleep. However, the friend's call was about an urgent issue with the school trip, which had already been planned and paid for. \n\nThe confrontation happens after the author was on the phone with their dad and then their friend. The lady's criticism comes at a time when the author is discussing important matters. The author's defense is that it's daytime and people should have chosen a flight if they wanted privacy, which is a valid point. But bus trips are shared spaces, and while daytime calls might be more acceptable than late-night ones, prolonged conversations can still be disruptive.\n\nAnother angle is the age difference. The author is young and traveling alone, which might make them feel vulnerable to criticism. The lady's tone seems harsh, using expletives and making a public reprimand. The author's response is defensive, which is understandable given the situation.\n\nConsidering all these factors, it's a judgment call. The author had a legitimate reason to be on the phone (organizing with family and friends), but the duration and the fact that it's in a public space where others might want to rest could be seen as inconsiderate. However, the lady's approach was confrontational and rude, which shifts some blame towards her. The core issue is whether the author was being inconsiderate, but since they were on the phone for important reasons and the time wasn't too late, it's more of a situational issue rather than the author being outright wrong.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong) because the main issue is the lady's harsh reaction rather than the author's actions. The author had valid reasons for their calls, and the time of day doesn't necessarily make it inappropriate. The problem lies more in the lady's public criticism and tone.\n"
