I was on the phone for 3 hours of a 10 hour bus trip\nSome notes:\n- this bus fare was $60 for an adult and $33 for a child (me) while a plane ticket usually averages $80 but are frequentl on sale for $60. Reason why I chose to take a bus is because I paid for the trip and I don\u2019t get paid very much from work to afford the luxury to fly just as yet.\n\n- I\u2019m 17 years old and this lady seems like she\u2019s 35-45 years old (in other words she might seem like she has some sort of authority over me because I\u2019m young and she\u2019s older)\n\n- I am travelling by myself\n\n\nSo picture this: monday morning at 9:15am 2/3rds of a bus gets filled with people to drive from Melbourne to Adelaide (~800km/500mi). I\u2019m on this bus trip for two main reasons: I have a car in Adelaide that I need to drive back to Melbourne and I also haven\u2019t seen my dad in 4 months aswell (he\u2019s the one who helped me buy the car aswell).\n\nNow up until this point, I have been trying to get in contact with my dad so I can plan this little mini-holiday and how everything will work from registering the car to discussing and fixing all the problems with the car (its an old car).  Notice how I said I was \u2018trying\u2019 to get in contact with my dad - being that he\u2019d lost his phone and hasn\u2019t been able to call me (didn\u2019t know my phone number).\nNow this was all until I called my grandparents who live in the same city as my dad. As it turned out, my father went to his parents house to use their phone to call me, right as I was about to call him. So fair enough, I was on the phone with my dad and we talked.\n\nSoon enough, we\u2019d planned our week ahead and eventually got onto other personal topics because we don\u2019t really call very often. By the time I say goodbye, it was about 11:35am. I was tired from the night before and try to get some rest.\n\nNo more than 15 minutes later, I get a call from my best friend. She was calling to tell me about how she and her parents got into a massive argument over the holiday we\u2019re going on in 9 days. To celebrate our passing of highschool, its tradition for students to go on a holiday somwhere in groups with the main intention to get as drunk as physically possible.\n\nWell, her parents had said that they didn\u2019t want her to go, although we\u2019ve all already paid $1000+ and booked it 6 months ago. Plans were SET, and we were ready to leave. So naturally I spent the next 45 minutes discussing what our course of action was to get around this situation.\n\nNo less than 5 minutes before I\u2019m saying bye to my friend on the phone, this lady sitting on the other side of the aisle to me raises her voice at me saying \n\n\u201care you going to stay on that fucking phone for the whole trip? You\u2019re being so rude!\u201d\n\n\u201cUm hello? How am I rude? I\u2019m talking to my friend and its only 12:30pm. That means daytime. That means people wont be sleeping\u201d\n\nNow I know that there may be some people asleep on the bus. I should know, I almost had a nap before my friend called me. But I\u2019m not sure how I was rude. If you didn\u2019t want this, then you should have flown and not caught a bus.\n\nSo Reddit, am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being on the phone for three hours on a bus trip. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author is 17, traveling alone, and took a bus because it's cheaper. They were on the phone for three hours, starting around 9:15 AM. The main points are the reason for the phone call and the lady's reaction.\n\nThe author explains that they were trying to contact their dad, who had lost his phone, and eventually connected through grandparents. Then they talked to their best friend about a holiday argument. The lady got upset, calling them rude, and the author defended themselves by saying it's daytime and people aren't asleep.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B). The key factors here might be:\n\n1. **Context of the phone call**: The author had legitimate reasons\u2014planning with their dad and discussing a friend's issue. These are important personal matters, especially since they were traveling alone and needed to coordinate things.\n\n2. **Timing and environment**: The bus was only 2/3 full, and the call started in the morning. The author mentions they were going to nap but the friend's call happened. The lady's complaint was after the author had been on the phone for a while. However, bus trips can be noisy, and phone calls might be disruptive even if others aren't asleep.\n\n3. **Volume and consideration**: The question is whether the author was using a loudspeaker or if the call was disturbing others. The author didn't mention using speakerphone, but even regular calls can be intrusive in a confined space. However, the author didn't acknowledge the lady's concern immediately and was defensive. That might come off as dismissive.\n\n4. **Age and authority dynamics**: The lady might have felt the teenager needed to be corrected, but that doesn't make the author right. However, the author's response was defensive, which could be seen as disrespectful.\n\n5. **Public vs. private spaces**: Buses are shared spaces, and while phone calls are common, extended ones can be seen as inconsiderate. However, the author had valid reasons. The length (3 hours) is a factor here. Even if the call is important, 3 hours on a 10-hour trip might be too long.\n\n6. **Alternatives**: The author could have moved to a less crowded part of the bus or used headphones with the friend if possible. But given the situation, maybe that wasn't feasible.\n\nConsidering all these factors, the author had legitimate reasons but the duration might have been excessive. The lady's reaction could be seen as harsh, but the author's response was defensive. However, in public transportation, there's an expectation of some consideration for others. So, the author might share some responsibility for not being mindful of the duration and volume, even if the reasons were valid. But given the circumstances, maybe it's not entirely their fault. Hmm. It's a tough call. I think the answer is B (not in the wrong) because the reasons are valid and the complaint came from the lady. The author's response was defensive but not necessarily wrong. The main point is that the author had important calls to make and the lady's reaction was over the top. So, the answer is B.\n"
