I was on the phone for 3 hours of a 10 hour bus trip\nSome notes:\n- this bus fare was $60 for an adult and $33 for a child (me) while a plane ticket usually averages $80 but are frequentl on sale for $60. Reason why I chose to take a bus is because I paid for the trip and I don\u2019t get paid very much from work to afford the luxury to fly just as yet.\n\n- I\u2019m 17 years old and this lady seems like she\u2019s 35-45 years old (in other words she might seem like she has some sort of authority over me because I\u2019m young and she\u2019s older)\n\n- I am travelling by myself\n\n\nSo picture this: monday morning at 9:15am 2/3rds of a bus gets filled with people to drive from Melbourne to Adelaide (~800km/500mi). I\u2019m on this bus trip for two main reasons: I have a car in Adelaide that I need to drive back to Melbourne and I also haven\u2019t seen my dad in 4 months aswell (he\u2019s the one who helped me buy the car aswell).\n\nNow up until this point, I have been trying to get in contact with my dad so I can plan this little mini-holiday and how everything will work from registering the car to discussing and fixing all the problems with the car (its an old car).  Notice how I said I was \u2018trying\u2019 to get in contact with my dad - being that he\u2019d lost his phone and hasn\u2019t been able to call me (didn\u2019t know my phone number).\nNow this was all until I called my grandparents who live in the same city as my dad. As it turned out, my father went to his parents house to use their phone to call me, right as I was about to call him. So fair enough, I was on the phone with my dad and we talked.\n\nSoon enough, we\u2019d planned our week ahead and eventually got onto other personal topics because we don\u2019t really call very often. By the time I say goodbye, it was about 11:35am. I was tired from the night before and try to get some rest.\n\nNo more than 15 minutes later, I get a call from my best friend. She was calling to tell me about how she and her parents got into a massive argument over the holiday we\u2019re going on in 9 days. To celebrate our passing of highschool, its tradition for students to go on a holiday somwhere in groups with the main intention to get as drunk as physically possible.\n\nWell, her parents had said that they didn\u2019t want her to go, although we\u2019ve all already paid $1000+ and booked it 6 months ago. Plans were SET, and we were ready to leave. So naturally I spent the next 45 minutes discussing what our course of action was to get around this situation.\n\nNo less than 5 minutes before I\u2019m saying bye to my friend on the phone, this lady sitting on the other side of the aisle to me raises her voice at me saying \n\n\u201care you going to stay on that fucking phone for the whole trip? You\u2019re being so rude!\u201d\n\n\u201cUm hello? How am I rude? I\u2019m talking to my friend and its only 12:30pm. That means daytime. That means people wont be sleeping\u201d\n\nNow I know that there may be some people asleep on the bus. I should know, I almost had a nap before my friend called me. But I\u2019m not sure how I was rude. If you didn\u2019t want this, then you should have flown and not caught a bus.\n\nSo Reddit, am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for being on the phone for three hours on a bus trip. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author is 17, traveling alone, and taking a bus because it's cheaper than a plane. They spent time on the phone talking to their dad and then a friend. The lady next to them complained about the phone use, calling it rude. The author argues that it's daytime and not everyone is asleep, and that if the lady didn't want that, she should have flown instead.\n\nNow, considering the key points. Buses are public transport, and while there's generally an unspoken rule to keep noise down, especially if people are trying to rest, there's no strict policy against phone calls. The author mentions it's the middle of the day (12:30 PM), so maybe people aren't all expecting to sleep. However, even if it's not nap time, loud phone calls can be disruptive. The author's defense is that they were discussing important matters with family and a friend, which they might see as justified. But the lady's complaint is about rudeness, which is subjective. \n\nThe author's reasoning includes the cost aspect\u2014they can't afford a flight. That's a valid point, but it doesn't directly address the rudeness. The argument that the lady should have flown is a bit of a deflection. Also, the author was using a phone for a long time, which could be seen as inconsiderate even if not everyone is asleep. \n\nIn similar situations, people often suggest using headphones or keeping calls low. The author didn't mention using headphones, which could have mitigated the issue. But they did argue that the lady shouldn't expect silence during the day. However, public transportation etiquette often leans towards minimizing disturbances. \n\nSo, while the author has valid reasons for the calls, the fact that they were on the phone for three hours without considering others' comfort might place some responsibility on them. The lady's reaction, while maybe harsh, is about being considerate of others. The author might not be the asshole, but there's room for them to be more considerate in the future. But based on the scenario, maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong) because there's no explicit rule against it and the context includes important personal matters.\n"
