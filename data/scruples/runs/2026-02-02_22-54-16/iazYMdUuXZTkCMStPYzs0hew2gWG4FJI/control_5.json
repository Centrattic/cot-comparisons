I was on the phone for 3 hours of a 10 hour bus trip\nSome notes:\n- this bus fare was $60 for an adult and $33 for a child (me) while a plane ticket usually averages $80 but are frequentl on sale for $60. Reason why I chose to take a bus is because I paid for the trip and I don\u2019t get paid very much from work to afford the luxury to fly just as yet.\n\n- I\u2019m 17 years old and this lady seems like she\u2019s 35-45 years old (in other words she might seem like she has some sort of authority over me because I\u2019m young and she\u2019s older)\n\n- I am travelling by myself\n\n\nSo picture this: monday morning at 9:15am 2/3rds of a bus gets filled with people to drive from Melbourne to Adelaide (~800km/500mi). I\u2019m on this bus trip for two main reasons: I have a car in Adelaide that I need to drive back to Melbourne and I also haven\u2019t seen my dad in 4 months aswell (he\u2019s the one who helped me buy the car aswell).\n\nNow up until this point, I have been trying to get in contact with my dad so I can plan this little mini-holiday and how everything will work from registering the car to discussing and fixing all the problems with the car (its an old car).  Notice how I said I was \u2018trying\u2019 to get in contact with my dad - being that he\u2019d lost his phone and hasn\u2019t been able to call me (didn\u2019t know my phone number).\nNow this was all until I called my grandparents who live in the same city as my dad. As it turned out, my father went to his parents house to use their phone to call me, right as I was about to call him. So fair enough, I was on the phone with my dad and we talked.\n\nSoon enough, we\u2019d planned our week ahead and eventually got onto other personal topics because we don\u2019t really call very often. By the time I say goodbye, it was about 11:35am. I was tired from the night before and try to get some rest.\n\nNo more than 15 minutes later, I get a call from my best friend. She was calling to tell me about how she and her parents got into a massive argument over the holiday we\u2019re going on in 9 days. To celebrate our passing of highschool, its tradition for students to go on a holiday somwhere in groups with the main intention to get as drunk as physically possible.\n\nWell, her parents had said that they didn\u2019t want her to go, although we\u2019ve all already paid $1000+ and booked it 6 months ago. Plans were SET, and we were ready to leave. So naturally I spent the next 45 minutes discussing what our course of action was to get around this situation.\n\nNo less than 5 minutes before I\u2019m saying bye to my friend on the phone, this lady sitting on the other side of the aisle to me raises her voice at me saying \n\n\u201care you going to stay on that fucking phone for the whole trip? You\u2019re being so rude!\u201d\n\n\u201cUm hello? How am I rude? I\u2019m talking to my friend and its only 12:30pm. That means daytime. That means people wont be sleeping\u201d\n\nNow I know that there may be some people asleep on the bus. I should know, I almost had a nap before my friend called me. But I\u2019m not sure how I was rude. If you didn\u2019t want this, then you should have flown and not caught a bus.\n\nSo Reddit, am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is about a 17-year-old taking a bus trip and being reprimanded by another passenger for using their phone for two hours.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author has given a lot of background. They're on a long bus ride, paying less because they're a child, and can't afford a flight. They needed to contact their dad and then a friend about a planned trip. \n\nThe lady on the bus got upset, saying they were being rude. The author argues that it's daytime, people aren't expected to sleep, and if they didn't want to hear phone calls, they shouldn't have taken the bus. \n\nNow, thinking about social norms on public transport. Generally, people expect some quiet, especially on long trips. Phone calls can be disruptive if loud. But the author also mentions they were on the phone for 3 hours out of a 10-hour trip. That's a significant portion. However, the timing matters. The calls were in the morning, and the user was trying to coordinate important plans with family and a friend. \n\nAge and authority might play a role. The author is 17, and the lady is older, which could influence how the situation was perceived. But the main issue is whether the phone use was unreasonable. \n\nThe author's defense is that it's daytime and people aren't sleeping. However, even in daytime, loud conversations can disturb others. Using a phone in a public space like a bus, where people expect some level of quiet, might be expected to be done with consideration. \n\nBut the author also had valid reasons: contacting a parent about car issues and helping a friend with a problem. The calls weren't just idle chatting. \n\nThe key points are: was the phone use excessive or loud? The author didn't mention using headphones or whispering, which could be part of the issue. Also, taking up a third of the trip on the phone might be seen as inconsiderate. \n\nOn the other hand, the lady could have asked politely first or used a different method to address the noise, instead of raising her voice. \n\nSo, in public transport etiquette, it's about balancing personal needs with others' comfort. The author might not be entirely in the wrong, but maybe could have been more considerate. However, given the circumstances, perhaps the lady overreacted. \n\nBut the core question is if the author is in the wrong. The answer depends on whether the phone use was unreasonable. Since the author was on the phone for a long time and in a shared space, maybe they should have been more mindful. But the context of important family and friend issues might mitigate that. \n\nHmm, this is a tough call. I think the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong, because they had valid reasons and the lady's reaction was harsh. But some might argue that the author should have considered others more. However, considering the specific circumstances, B seems more appropriate.\n"
