I was on the phone for 3 hours of a 10 hour bus trip\nSome notes:\n- this bus fare was $60 for an adult and $33 for a child (me) while a plane ticket usually averages $80 but are frequentl on sale for $60. Reason why I chose to take a bus is because I paid for the trip and I don\u2019t get paid very much from work to afford the luxury to fly just as yet.\n\n- I\u2019m 17 years old and this lady seems like she\u2019s 35-45 years old (in other words she might seem like she has some sort of authority over me because I\u2019m young and she\u2019s older)\n\n- I am travelling by myself\n\n\nSo picture this: monday morning at 9:15am 2/3rds of a bus gets filled with people to drive from Melbourne to Adelaide (~800km/500mi). I\u2019m on this bus trip for two main reasons: I have a car in Adelaide that I need to drive back to Melbourne and I also haven\u2019t seen my dad in 4 months aswell (he\u2019s the one who helped me buy the car aswell).\n\nNow up until this point, I have been trying to get in contact with my dad so I can plan this little mini-holiday and how everything will work from registering the car to discussing and fixing all the problems with the car (its an old car).  Notice how I said I was \u2018trying\u2019 to get in contact with my dad - being that he\u2019d lost his phone and hasn\u2019t been able to call me (didn\u2019t know my phone number).\nNow this was all until I called my grandparents who live in the same city as my dad. As it turned out, my father went to his parents house to use their phone to call me, right as I was about to call him. So fair enough, I was on the phone with my dad and we talked.\n\nSoon enough, we\u2019d planned our week ahead and eventually got onto other personal topics because we don\u2019t really call very often. By the time I say goodbye, it was about 11:35am. I was tired from the night before and try to get some rest.\n\nNo more than 15 minutes later, I get a call from my best friend. She was calling to tell me about how she and her parents got into a massive argument over the holiday we\u2019re going on in 9 days. To celebrate our passing of highschool, its tradition for students to go on a holiday somwhere in groups with the main intention to get as drunk as physically possible.\n\nWell, her parents had said that they didn\u2019t want her to go, although we\u2019ve all already paid $1000+ and booked it 6 months ago. Plans were SET, and we were ready to leave. So naturally I spent the next 45 minutes discussing what our course of action was to get around this situation.\n\nNo less than 5 minutes before I\u2019m saying bye to my friend on the phone, this lady sitting on the other side of the aisle to me raises her voice at me saying \n\n\u201care you going to stay on that fucking phone for the whole trip? You\u2019re being so rude!\u201d\n\n\u201cUm hello? How am I rude? I\u2019m talking to my friend and its only 12:30pm. That means daytime. That means people wont be sleeping\u201d\n\nNow I know that there may be some people asleep on the bus. I should know, I almost had a nap before my friend called me. But I\u2019m not sure how I was rude. If you didn\u2019t want this, then you should have flown and not caught a bus.\n\nSo Reddit, am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this AITA post is in the wrong. So, the situation is about a 17-year-old taking a bus trip and using the phone for two long calls, leading to a confrontation with a fellow passenger.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author is on a 10-hour bus ride, which is expensive for them since they can't afford a flight. They're traveling alone and need to coordinate with their dad and a friend. The calls are important: one with their dad about a car and family matters, and another with a friend about a planned holiday. The lady yelled at them for being on the phone so much.\n\nNow, the key points to consider. Bus etiquette usually says that loud phone calls can be considered rude because others can't control their environment like in a private car. The time is 12:30 PM, so it's not the middle of the night, but some people might still want quiet. The author mentions that they were on the phone for 3 hours, which is a significant portion of the trip. However, the reason for the calls is important\u2014family and planning.\n\nThe lady's reaction is based on personal discomfort. But is the author in the wrong? They were using their own phone, not disturbing others beyond the audible level. However, if the author was speaking loudly, that's a different story. The author says they were talking to their friend and dad, but it's not clear if they were using headphones or keeping their volume down. If they were, then maybe the lady's complaint is about the volume. If not, then maybe the author was being inconsiderate.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's circumstances are understandable. They paid for the trip, have a limited budget, and the calls are for important matters. The lady's comment about flying is a bit harsh, but it's a common saying. The author's defense that it's daytime is valid, but some people still prefer quiet during transit regardless of the time.\n\nThe main issue is the balance between personal needs and consideration for others. The author had the right to make necessary calls but should have been mindful of not disturbing others. If they were respectful in their communication (using headphones, speaking quietly), maybe they're not in the wrong. If they were loud and disrupting, then they might be. The post doesn't specify the volume, but the initial reaction from the lady suggests she was disturbed.\n\nOverall, the author's actions are a bit in the gray area. They had valid reasons but should have been considerate. However, given the context and the lack of information about volume, the answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong) because the calls were important and the time wasn't too late. But some might argue that even then, loud phone calls are generally frowned upon on shared transportation.\n"
