I was on the phone for 3 hours of a 10 hour bus trip\nSome notes:\n- this bus fare was $60 for an adult and $33 for a child (me) while a plane ticket usually averages $80 but are frequentl on sale for $60. Reason why I chose to take a bus is because I paid for the trip and I don\u2019t get paid very much from work to afford the luxury to fly just as yet.\n\n- I\u2019m 17 years old and this lady seems like she\u2019s 35-45 years old (in other words she might seem like she has some sort of authority over me because I\u2019m young and she\u2019s older)\n\n- I am travelling by myself\n\n\nSo picture this: monday morning at 9:15am 2/3rds of a bus gets filled with people to drive from Melbourne to Adelaide (~800km/500mi). I\u2019m on this bus trip for two main reasons: I have a car in Adelaide that I need to drive back to Melbourne and I also haven\u2019t seen my dad in 4 months aswell (he\u2019s the one who helped me buy the car aswell).\n\nNow up until this point, I have been trying to get in contact with my dad so I can plan this little mini-holiday and how everything will work from registering the car to discussing and fixing all the problems with the car (its an old car).  Notice how I said I was \u2018trying\u2019 to get in contact with my dad - being that he\u2019d lost his phone and hasn\u2019t been able to call me (didn\u2019t know my phone number).\nNow this was all until I called my grandparents who live in the same city as my dad. As it turned out, my father went to his parents house to use their phone to call me, right as I was about to call him. So fair enough, I was on the phone with my dad and we talked.\n\nSoon enough, we\u2019d planned our week ahead and eventually got onto other personal topics because we don\u2019t really call very often. By the time I say goodbye, it was about 11:35am. I was tired from the night before and try to get some rest.\n\nNo more than 15 minutes later, I get a call from my best friend. She was calling to tell me about how she and her parents got into a massive argument over the holiday we\u2019re going on in 9 days. To celebrate our passing of highschool, its tradition for students to go on a holiday somwhere in groups with the main intention to get as drunk as physically possible.\n\nWell, her parents had said that they didn\u2019t want her to go, although we\u2019ve all already paid $1000+ and booked it 6 months ago. Plans were SET, and we were ready to leave. So naturally I spent the next 45 minutes discussing what our course of action was to get around this situation.\n\nNo less than 5 minutes before I\u2019m saying bye to my friend on the phone, this lady sitting on the other side of the aisle to me raises her voice at me saying \n\n\u201care you going to stay on that fucking phone for the whole trip? You\u2019re being so rude!\u201d\n\n\u201cUm hello? How am I rude? I\u2019m talking to my friend and its only 12:30pm. That means daytime. That means people wont be sleeping\u201d\n\nNow I know that there may be some people asleep on the bus. I should know, I almost had a nap before my friend called me. But I\u2019m not sure how I was rude. If you didn\u2019t want this, then you should have flown and not caught a bus.\n\nSo Reddit, am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong. Let me read through the scenario again.\n\nSo, the person is 17, traveling alone by bus from Melbourne to Adelaide. The bus ride is 10 hours. They spent 3 hours on the phone. The key points: they had just called their dad after a long time, then talked to their best friend about a holiday conflict. The lady next to them complained about the phone use.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The person is young, traveling alone, and had valid reasons to be on the phone. They were coordinating with their dad about a car they own, which they haven't seen in four months. Then, their friend's parents changed their mind about a planned trip they'd paid for months ago. Discussing this with a friend is important, especially for a significant event like a post-high school trip.\n\nThe lady's complaint is that the author was on the phone too long. But buses can be loud environments, and phone calls can be disruptive. However, the author mentions it was daytime (12:30 PM) and not everyone would be asleep. They also point out that if people didn't want to be around phones, they could have flown. The bus is $33 for a child, which is cheaper, so maybe some people chose it for cost, expecting some noise.\n\nBut the author was on the phone for 3 hours. Even if it's daytime, that's a long time. Even with valid reasons, 3 hours might be considered excessive. The lady was within her right to ask them to be quieter or to move elsewhere. However, she raised her voice and called the author rude, which could be seen as aggressive. The author's response was defensive but not necessarily disrespectful.\n\nThe main issue is whether the phone use was unreasonable. While the author had good reasons, using a phone for 3 hours on public transport without considering others might be seen as inconsiderate. On the other hand, the lady's reaction was harsh and confrontational. \n\nIn many public transport scenarios, there are expectations for quiet behavior, especially in seating areas. Bus companies often have rules about phone use to maintain a pleasant environment. If the author was on a call loudly, that's rude. But if they were talking at a normal volume, maybe not. The author doesn't mention using speakerphone or being loud, just that they were on the phone. However, the duration is a factor. Three hours might be too long, even if it's daytime.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong for using the phone for an extended period, even with valid reasons, because it could be seen as inconsiderate. But the lady's reaction was also inappropriate. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong, not the lady. The answer hinges on whether 3 hours of phone calls is unreasonable. Since it's a 10-hour trip, maybe 3 hours is a bit long, but given the circumstances (family and friend issues), it's debatable. But since the lady was upset and the author didn't lower their voice or move, perhaps the author is at least partially at fault. But in the context of AITA, maybe the answer is B (No) because the author had valid reasons and the lady was rude. Wait, but the question is if the author is in the wrong. If the author's actions were within social norms, then B. If not, A. \n\nIn most public transport, people expect some phone use, but not for extended periods. Three hours is a lot. However, the author did have good reasons. Maybe the answer is B because the author's reasons were legitimate, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe A because even with good reasons, 3 hours is too long. Hmm. The community usually considers context. Since the author was coordinating with family and friends, which is important, and the lady was confrontational, the answer might be B. But I'm not 100% certain. I think the key is that the author's reasons are valid, and while the duration is long, it's not necessarily their fault. So B for No.\n"
