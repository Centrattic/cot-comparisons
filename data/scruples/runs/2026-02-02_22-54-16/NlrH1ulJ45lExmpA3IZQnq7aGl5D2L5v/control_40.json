I work full time, but make shit money.  My brother is a veteran with PTSD, an alcoholic, and drug addict.  He lives off of disability from the VA.  He gets paid twice as much as I do to play video games and drink all day.  He got his home and mortgage through the VA.  He begged me to leave my roommates and live with him.  I pay rent.  $400/ a month.  Half his mortgage without the property taxes.  Utilities are free.  I get a small bedroom, street parking, and access to the laundry, bathroom, and kitchen.  Its not terrible, and I have been able to save a bit of money and pay off most of my college loans.  \n\nNow, my brother had hit hard times because his vices are out of control.  He smokes $100 of weed a week.  Drinks two pints of rum a day ($11), and smokes a pack of cigarettes a day.  That is at least $870 a month.  That is what I make in two weeks.  That is only 1/4 his monthly pay.  I should point out that my brother is fully capable of working but cannot hold down a job because he shows up to work high or drunk.  \n\nHe begged me to live here.  Promised parking space in The garage and that he would build me an apartment in the basement.  \n\nNow, he has hit hard time because of his own vices.  He went to my enabler mother for money.  She told him to raise my rent i stead of drinking less or getting a job.  \n\nThis felt like an utter betrayal to me.  I left my friend\u2019s apartment where i was happy because i was lured with off street parking and an apartment of my own in the future to help him out.  I was doing him a favor.  Helping the family.  \n\nThen my mother starts trying to convince him to raise my rent so he can afford his home and his booze and drugs.  \n\nWhen i found out, I felt betrayed.  I told her to stay out of my finances.  I told her that if she convinces him to raise my rent, i will just get an apartment of my own (you can get them as low as $600 a month around here).  I told her that she can then keep my brother afloat and pay the rent I no longer pay.\n\nThis went over really well.  \n\nAm I the asshole for telling my mother not to counsel my brother/landlord to raise my rent to pay for his drug habits?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for telling their mother to stay out of their finances. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is 35, living in his brother's house, paying $400 a month in rent. The brother has PTSD, is an alcoholic, and uses drugs. He's on VA disability, which is twice what the author earns. The brother can't hold a job and has expensive vices. The mother suggested raising the author's rent to help the brother afford his lifestyle. The author refused, saying he'd move out if needed.\n\nSo, the main points are: The author is paying a significant portion of his brother's mortgage, which is a form of support. The brother's addictions are causing financial issues, and the mother's suggestion to increase rent seems to be enabling his behavior. The author is standing up for his own financial boundaries, which is a key point here. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the mother's advice is problematic because it's using the author's financial contribution to cover the brother's vices. The author has the right to manage his own finances and isn't obligated to support his brother's habits. He's also considering moving out, which is a reasonable response. The brother's addictions are his own responsibility, and the author shouldn't be forced to subsidize that. \n\nThe mother's role as an enabler is also a factor. By suggesting raising rent instead of addressing the brother's issues, she's not helping him improve. The author is setting a boundary, which is justified. There's no indication he's being cruel; he's just protecting his own interests without being disrespectful. \n\nTherefore, the answer is B (No). The author is not in the wrong for prioritizing his own financial stability and refusing to be used to fund his brother's addictions.\n"
