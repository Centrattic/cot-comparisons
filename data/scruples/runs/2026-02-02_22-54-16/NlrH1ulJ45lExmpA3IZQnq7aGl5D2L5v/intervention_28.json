I work full time, but make shit money.  My brother is a veteran with PTSD, an alcoholic, and drug addict.  He lives off of disability from the VA.  He gets paid twice as much as I do to play video games and drink all day.  He got his home and mortgage through the VA.  He begged me to leave my roommates and live with him.  I pay rent.  $400/ a month.  Half his mortgage without the property taxes.  Utilities are free.  I get a small bedroom, street parking, and access to the laundry, bathroom, and kitchen.  Its not terrible, and I have been able to save a bit of money and pay off most of my college loans.  \n\nNow, my brother had hit hard times because his vices are out of control.  He smokes $100 of weed a week.  Drinks two pints of rum a day ($11), and smokes a pack of cigarettes a day.  That is at least $870 a month.  That is what I make in two weeks.  That is only 1/4 his monthly pay.  I should point out that my brother is fully capable of working but cannot hold down a job because he shows up to work high or drunk.  \n\nHe begged me to live here.  Promised parking space in The garage and that he would build me an apartment in the basement.  \n\nNow, he has hit hard time because of his own vices.  He went to my enabler mother for money.  She told him to raise my rent i stead of drinking less or getting a job.  \n\nThis felt like an utter betrayal to me.  I left my friend\u2019s apartment where i was happy because i was lured with off street parking and an apartment of my own in the future to help him out.  I was doing him a favor.  Helping the family.  \n\nThen my mother starts trying to convince him to raise my rent so he can afford his home and his booze and drugs.  \n\nWhen i found out, I felt betrayed.  I told her to stay out of my finances.  I told her that if she convinces him to raise my rent, i will just get an apartment of my own (you can get them as low as $600 a month around here).  I told her that she can then keep my brother afloat and pay the rent I no longer pay.\n\nThis went over really well.  \n\nAm I the asshole for telling my mother not to counsel my brother/landlord to raise my rent to pay for his drug habits?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" story is in the wrong. The key points here involve the author's relationship with their brother and mother, the financial arrangement, and the author's response to their mother's suggestion.\n\nFirst, the author is living with their brother, paying rent, and helping by covering half the mortgage indirectly. The brother has significant personal issues\u2014PTSD, alcoholism, drug use\u2014and isn't working. The mother suggests raising the author's rent to help the brother afford his vices instead of changing his behavior. The author rejects this, feeling it's unfair and tells their mother to stop interfering.\n\nI need to consider the ethics here. The author is in a position where they're already subsidizing their brother's lifestyle by paying rent. The mother's suggestion to raise rent further seems to be a way to keep the brother's habits going without him making necessary life changes. The author's response is to set a boundary, which is understandable given the situation. They\u2019re not responsible for their brother's addiction or their mother's enabling behavior. \n\nThe author's main argument is that they\u2019re helping by living there, not by increasing their financial burden. The fact that they're also saving and paying off loans while the brother isn't working shows they're managing their own life. The mother's advice appears to be enabling the brother's harmful habits, which the author rightly resists. \n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, the author isn't obligated to support their brother's addiction beyond the current arrangement. They\u2019re asserting their right to manage their own finances without family interference. The mother's suggestion is problematic because it's a short-term fix that doesn't address the root issues. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries. They\u2019re protecting their own interests while still living with their brother under a financial arrangement they initially agreed to. The mother and brother are the ones with the problematic behavior here.\n"
