I work full time, but make shit money.  My brother is a veteran with PTSD, an alcoholic, and drug addict.  He lives off of disability from the VA.  He gets paid twice as much as I do to play video games and drink all day.  He got his home and mortgage through the VA.  He begged me to leave my roommates and live with him.  I pay rent.  $400/ a month.  Half his mortgage without the property taxes.  Utilities are free.  I get a small bedroom, street parking, and access to the laundry, bathroom, and kitchen.  Its not terrible, and I have been able to save a bit of money and pay off most of my college loans.  \n\nNow, my brother had hit hard times because his vices are out of control.  He smokes $100 of weed a week.  Drinks two pints of rum a day ($11), and smokes a pack of cigarettes a day.  That is at least $870 a month.  That is what I make in two weeks.  That is only 1/4 his monthly pay.  I should point out that my brother is fully capable of working but cannot hold down a job because he shows up to work high or drunk.  \n\nHe begged me to live here.  Promised parking space in The garage and that he would build me an apartment in the basement.  \n\nNow, he has hit hard time because of his own vices.  He went to my enabler mother for money.  She told him to raise my rent i stead of drinking less or getting a job.  \n\nThis felt like an utter betrayal to me.  I left my friend\u2019s apartment where i was happy because i was lured with off street parking and an apartment of my own in the future to help him out.  I was doing him a favor.  Helping the family.  \n\nThen my mother starts trying to convince him to raise my rent so he can afford his home and his booze and drugs.  \n\nWhen i found out, I felt betrayed.  I told her to stay out of my finances.  I told her that if she convinces him to raise my rent, i will just get an apartment of my own (you can get them as low as $600 a month around here).  I told her that she can then keep my brother afloat and pay the rent I no longer pay.\n\nThis went over really well.  \n\nAm I the asshole for telling my mother not to counsel my brother/landlord to raise my rent to pay for his drug habits?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for telling his mother to stay out of his finances. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nSo, the author is 35, living in his brother's home. The brother is a veteran with PTSD, alcoholism, and drug addiction, living off VA disability. The brother got the house through VA benefits and the author pays $400 a month in rent, which is half the mortgage without taxes. The author has been saving and paying off loans, which is good. \n\nThe brother's problem is his vices: weed, rum, cigarettes. That's $870 a month, which the author says is what he makes in two weeks. The brother can't work because he's high or drunk. The brother had initially offered the author a garage spot and a basement apartment in exchange for moving in. Now, because the brother is struggling with his expenses, the mother suggests raising the author's rent instead of the brother cutting his vices. The author feels betrayed and tells his mother to stop interfering.\n\nThe main issue here is whether the author is wrong to refuse his mother's advice. The author's stance is that he's helping the family by living there cheaply, but the mother's suggestion might be exploiting him further. The brother's habits are the root cause of the financial trouble. The author is in a tough spot, balancing his own financial needs with family responsibilities.\n\nThe author's argument is that he's already making a sacrifice by paying rent that's a significant portion of his income. The mother's suggestion to raise rent could push the author into financial strain or force him to move out, which might not be feasible since he's been saving. The brother isn't holding up his end of the deal (building the apartment, garage spot), so the author is justified in feeling used.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the author is protecting his own financial stability. The mother's advice seems to be enabling the brother's habits by shifting the burden onto the author. The brother's responsibility is to manage his own finances and address his addictions, not make his sibling cover the costs. The author is setting a boundary, which is reasonable. There's no indication that the author is being selfish; he's trying to maintain his own financial health while the brother isn't meeting his obligations.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. He's asserting his right to control his finances and refusing to be a part of enabling his brother's poor choices. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
