I work full time, but make shit money.  My brother is a veteran with PTSD, an alcoholic, and drug addict.  He lives off of disability from the VA.  He gets paid twice as much as I do to play video games and drink all day.  He got his home and mortgage through the VA.  He begged me to leave my roommates and live with him.  I pay rent.  $400/ a month.  Half his mortgage without the property taxes.  Utilities are free.  I get a small bedroom, street parking, and access to the laundry, bathroom, and kitchen.  Its not terrible, and I have been able to save a bit of money and pay off most of my college loans.  \n\nNow, my brother had hit hard times because his vices are out of control.  He smokes $100 of weed a week.  Drinks two pints of rum a day ($11), and smokes a pack of cigarettes a day.  That is at least $870 a month.  That is what I make in two weeks.  That is only 1/4 his monthly pay.  I should point out that my brother is fully capable of working but cannot hold down a job because he shows up to work high or drunk.  \n\nHe begged me to live here.  Promised parking space in The garage and that he would build me an apartment in the basement.  \n\nNow, he has hit hard time because of his own vices.  He went to my enabler mother for money.  She told him to raise my rent i stead of drinking less or getting a job.  \n\nThis felt like an utter betrayal to me.  I left my friend\u2019s apartment where i was happy because i was lured with off street parking and an apartment of my own in the future to help him out.  I was doing him a favor.  Helping the family.  \n\nThen my mother starts trying to convince him to raise my rent so he can afford his home and his booze and drugs.  \n\nWhen i found out, I felt betrayed.  I told her to stay out of my finances.  I told her that if she convinces him to raise my rent, i will just get an apartment of my own (you can get them as low as $600 a month around here).  I told her that she can then keep my brother afloat and pay the rent I no longer pay.\n\nThis went over really well.  \n\nAm I the asshole for telling my mother not to counsel my brother/landlord to raise my rent to pay for his drug habits?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves their brother, a veteran with PTSD, alcoholism, and drug addiction, living off disability. The author is paying rent to live with him, but the mother suggests raising the rent to help the brother cover his expenses from his vices.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the dynamics here. The author is paying a significant portion of the brother's mortgage and utilities. The brother's habits are costing a lot, and the mother's suggestion is to increase the rent. The author feels this is unfair since they're already contributing a lot. They tell their mom to stay out of their finances and threaten to leave if the rent is raised. \n\nIs the author wrong? Well, the key points are autonomy over one's finances and the expectations in a family arrangement. The author is helping out the brother by living there, but it's not a fair exchange. The brother's expenses are due to his own choices, so the author isn't responsible for his vices. The mother's suggestion to raise rent seems to be shifting the burden onto the author, which is unfair. The author is within their rights to set boundaries, especially if they're not willing to support the brother's habits. \n\nAlso, the brother promised things like garage parking and a basement apartment, which didn't materialize. The author felt they were helping the family, but now it's becoming a financial burden. Staying in the situation isn't sustainable if it's costing the author more than necessary. So, the author's response to protect their finances is justified.\n"
