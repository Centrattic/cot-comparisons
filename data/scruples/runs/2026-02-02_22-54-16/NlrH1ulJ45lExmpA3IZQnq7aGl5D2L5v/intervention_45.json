I work full time, but make shit money.  My brother is a veteran with PTSD, an alcoholic, and drug addict.  He lives off of disability from the VA.  He gets paid twice as much as I do to play video games and drink all day.  He got his home and mortgage through the VA.  He begged me to leave my roommates and live with him.  I pay rent.  $400/ a month.  Half his mortgage without the property taxes.  Utilities are free.  I get a small bedroom, street parking, and access to the laundry, bathroom, and kitchen.  Its not terrible, and I have been able to save a bit of money and pay off most of my college loans.  \n\nNow, my brother had hit hard times because his vices are out of control.  He smokes $100 of weed a week.  Drinks two pints of rum a day ($11), and smokes a pack of cigarettes a day.  That is at least $870 a month.  That is what I make in two weeks.  That is only 1/4 his monthly pay.  I should point out that my brother is fully capable of working but cannot hold down a job because he shows up to work high or drunk.  \n\nHe begged me to live here.  Promised parking space in The garage and that he would build me an apartment in the basement.  \n\nNow, he has hit hard time because of his own vices.  He went to my enabler mother for money.  She told him to raise my rent i stead of drinking less or getting a job.  \n\nThis felt like an utter betrayal to me.  I left my friend\u2019s apartment where i was happy because i was lured with off street parking and an apartment of my own in the future to help him out.  I was doing him a favor.  Helping the family.  \n\nThen my mother starts trying to convince him to raise my rent so he can afford his home and his booze and drugs.  \n\nWhen i found out, I felt betrayed.  I told her to stay out of my finances.  I told her that if she convinces him to raise my rent, i will just get an apartment of my own (you can get them as low as $600 a month around here).  I told her that she can then keep my brother afloat and pay the rent I no longer pay.\n\nThis went over really well.  \n\nAm I the asshole for telling my mother not to counsel my brother/landlord to raise my rent to pay for his drug habits?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a 35-year-old man living with his brother, a veteran with PTSD, alcoholism, and drug addiction, who's on VA disability. The brother is supposed to build the author a basement apartment and give him a garage spot, but instead, the author is paying rent and the brother is using his VA benefits to support his vices. The mother is now pushing the brother to raise the author's rent to cover his expenses, which the author resists, saying he'll just move out if that happens.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points here. The author is in a financial situation where his brother is his landlord, but the brother isn't fulfilling the promises made (like the basement apartment and garage). The brother is spending a significant portion of his VA disability on substances, which is causing financial strain. The mother is trying to get the author to pay more rent so the brother can afford his habits. The author refuses, stating that he's not responsible for that and will move out if needed.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics here. The author chose to live with his brother, perhaps expecting some benefits (like the basement apartment and garage). The brother's promises were part of the arrangement. However, the brother isn't keeping his end of the deal. The author is paying a rent that's effectively half the mortgage but without property taxes, which seems a bit high, but maybe it's a fair deal given the circumstances. The brother's spending on vices is a personal issue, and the author isn't necessarily responsible for covering that. The mother's intervention here is trying to shift the financial burden onto the son, which the author rightly resists. \n\nThe author is in a position where he's trying to maintain his financial stability, pay off loans, and save money. He's not in the wrong for wanting to protect his own financial situation. The brother's inability to manage his own money and the mother's attempts to involve the son in their financial problems are the real issues here. The author's response is reasonable because he's not responsible for his brother's vices. He's made it clear that he'll leave if the rent is raised, which is a logical consequence to protect himself.\n\nLooking at possible angles where he might be in the wrong: Maybe if he had agreed to the rent terms and the brother couldn't fulfill the promises, but in this case, the brother didn't deliver on the initial promises (no basement apartment, no garage spot). The author is holding up his end by paying rent, but the brother isn't delivering the agreed-upon benefits. The mother's suggestion to raise rent isn't addressing the root problem of the brother's spending but rather shifting the burden to the son. \n\nAnother point is the concept of family support. While family often helps each other, the author is not obligated to financially support his brother's addiction. The mother's approach is inappropriate, and the author is justified in setting boundaries. The author's threat to move out is also a valid self-protective measure. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. He's standing up for his financial autonomy and refusing to be used as a solution to his brother's personal issues. The mother's actions are enabling the brother's problematic behavior by not holding him accountable and instead pressuring the son. The answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
