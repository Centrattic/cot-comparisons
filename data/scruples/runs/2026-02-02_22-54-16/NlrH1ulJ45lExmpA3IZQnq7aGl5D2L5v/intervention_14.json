I work full time, but make shit money.  My brother is a veteran with PTSD, an alcoholic, and drug addict.  He lives off of disability from the VA.  He gets paid twice as much as I do to play video games and drink all day.  He got his home and mortgage through the VA.  He begged me to leave my roommates and live with him.  I pay rent.  $400/ a month.  Half his mortgage without the property taxes.  Utilities are free.  I get a small bedroom, street parking, and access to the laundry, bathroom, and kitchen.  Its not terrible, and I have been able to save a bit of money and pay off most of my college loans.  \n\nNow, my brother had hit hard times because his vices are out of control.  He smokes $100 of weed a week.  Drinks two pints of rum a day ($11), and smokes a pack of cigarettes a day.  That is at least $870 a month.  That is what I make in two weeks.  That is only 1/4 his monthly pay.  I should point out that my brother is fully capable of working but cannot hold down a job because he shows up to work high or drunk.  \n\nHe begged me to live here.  Promised parking space in The garage and that he would build me an apartment in the basement.  \n\nNow, he has hit hard time because of his own vices.  He went to my enabler mother for money.  She told him to raise my rent i stead of drinking less or getting a job.  \n\nThis felt like an utter betrayal to me.  I left my friend\u2019s apartment where i was happy because i was lured with off street parking and an apartment of my own in the future to help him out.  I was doing him a favor.  Helping the family.  \n\nThen my mother starts trying to convince him to raise my rent so he can afford his home and his booze and drugs.  \n\nWhen i found out, I felt betrayed.  I told her to stay out of my finances.  I told her that if she convinces him to raise my rent, i will just get an apartment of my own (you can get them as low as $600 a month around here).  I told her that she can then keep my brother afloat and pay the rent I no longer pay.\n\nThis went over really well.  \n\nAm I the asshole for telling my mother not to counsel my brother/landlord to raise my rent to pay for his drug habits?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the scenario. The author is a 35-year-old man living with his brother, who is a veteran with PTSD, alcoholism, and drug addiction. The brother is on VA disability, making twice as much as the author. The author pays $400 a month in rent, which is half the brother's mortgage (excluding taxes), and gets a small room, parking, and access to utilities. The brother's vices cost around $870 a month, which is a significant portion of his income.\n\nThe brother asked the author to move in, promising future improvements like a basement apartment and garage parking. Now, the brother is in financial trouble because of his vices and asked the author's mother for help. The mother suggested raising the rent instead of the brother cutting expenses. The author feels betrayed and told his mother to stay out of his finances, threatening to move out if the rent is raised.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. I need to evaluate if the author is justified. \n\nKey points to consider: The author is paying rent, which is a significant part of the brother's income, but the brother is spending a large portion on vices. The mother's suggestion to raise rent could be seen as unfair because the brother's expenses are self-inflicted. The author is in a vulnerable position, working low-paying job, saving money, and has taken on a financial burden to help the family. The brother's promises (garage, basement apartment) haven't been fulfilled, which adds to the author's sense of betrayal.\n\nIs the author obligated to continue paying rent to help his brother's addiction? Probably not. The author is setting boundaries, which is reasonable. The mother's intervention seems to be enabling the brother's bad habits rather than encouraging responsibility. The author's response\u2014telling his mother to stay out of his finances and threatening to move if the rent is raised\u2014is about protecting his own financial interests.\n\nPossible counterarguments: Family obligations, the idea that the author should help a relative in need. However, the brother's addiction is self-inflicted, and the author isn't responsible for that. The author is already contributing financially, but it's not reasonable to expect him to cover the brother's vices. The mother's role as an enabler might be part of the problem, so the author standing up to her is justified.\n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
