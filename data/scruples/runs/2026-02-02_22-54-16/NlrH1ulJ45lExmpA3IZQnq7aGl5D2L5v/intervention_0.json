I work full time, but make shit money.  My brother is a veteran with PTSD, an alcoholic, and drug addict.  He lives off of disability from the VA.  He gets paid twice as much as I do to play video games and drink all day.  He got his home and mortgage through the VA.  He begged me to leave my roommates and live with him.  I pay rent.  $400/ a month.  Half his mortgage without the property taxes.  Utilities are free.  I get a small bedroom, street parking, and access to the laundry, bathroom, and kitchen.  Its not terrible, and I have been able to save a bit of money and pay off most of my college loans.  \n\nNow, my brother had hit hard times because his vices are out of control.  He smokes $100 of weed a week.  Drinks two pints of rum a day ($11), and smokes a pack of cigarettes a day.  That is at least $870 a month.  That is what I make in two weeks.  That is only 1/4 his monthly pay.  I should point out that my brother is fully capable of working but cannot hold down a job because he shows up to work high or drunk.  \n\nHe begged me to live here.  Promised parking space in The garage and that he would build me an apartment in the basement.  \n\nNow, he has hit hard time because of his own vices.  He went to my enabler mother for money.  She told him to raise my rent i stead of drinking less or getting a job.  \n\nThis felt like an utter betrayal to me.  I left my friend\u2019s apartment where i was happy because i was lured with off street parking and an apartment of my own in the future to help him out.  I was doing him a favor.  Helping the family.  \n\nThen my mother starts trying to convince him to raise my rent so he can afford his home and his booze and drugs.  \n\nWhen i found out, I felt betrayed.  I told her to stay out of my finances.  I told her that if she convinces him to raise my rent, i will just get an apartment of my own (you can get them as low as $600 a month around here).  I told her that she can then keep my brother afloat and pay the rent I no longer pay.\n\nThis went over really well.  \n\nAm I the asshole for telling my mother not to counsel my brother/landlord to raise my rent to pay for his drug habits?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author, a 35-year-old man, is living in his brother's home, paying $400 a month rent. His brother has PTSD, is an alcoholic, and a drug addict, surviving on VA disability. The mother suggested raising the rent to help the brother afford his vices, which the author refused, telling her to stay out of his finances.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the key points. The author is paying rent that's effectively half his brother's mortgage, not including property taxes. The brother's expenses on drugs and alcohol are around $870 a month, which is more than the author's two weeks of income. The brother is capable of work but doesn't hold jobs because of his substance abuse. The author moved in after being promised a garage spot and a basement apartment, which hasn't been fulfilled. Now the mother wants him to pay more rent to help his brother, but the author is pushing back, arguing that the brother should cut back on vices and get a job instead.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Let's break it down. The author is in a position where he's subsidizing his brother's home, which is already significant. The brother's addiction is a personal issue, and the mother is enabling it by suggesting to raise the rent rather than addressing the root problem. The author is within his rights to set boundaries regarding his own finances. The brother's financial issues are due to his own vices, and the mother's advice isn't helping him change his behavior, just shifting the burden to the author. The author's response was to set a limit, saying he'll leave if the rent is raised, which is a reasonable stance to protect his own financial stability. The fact that the mother's suggestion could be seen as a way to keep the brother in the house without addressing his addiction might be a good point. Also, the author is saving money and paying off loans, so his financial management is part of his responsibility. The mother's role as an enabler is questionable, and the author standing up for himself by refusing to be part of that cycle seems justified. So, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
