I work full time, but make shit money.  My brother is a veteran with PTSD, an alcoholic, and drug addict.  He lives off of disability from the VA.  He gets paid twice as much as I do to play video games and drink all day.  He got his home and mortgage through the VA.  He begged me to leave my roommates and live with him.  I pay rent.  $400/ a month.  Half his mortgage without the property taxes.  Utilities are free.  I get a small bedroom, street parking, and access to the laundry, bathroom, and kitchen.  Its not terrible, and I have been able to save a bit of money and pay off most of my college loans.  \n\nNow, my brother had hit hard times because his vices are out of control.  He smokes $100 of weed a week.  Drinks two pints of rum a day ($11), and smokes a pack of cigarettes a day.  That is at least $870 a month.  That is what I make in two weeks.  That is only 1/4 his monthly pay.  I should point out that my brother is fully capable of working but cannot hold down a job because he shows up to work high or drunk.  \n\nHe begged me to live here.  Promised parking space in The garage and that he would build me an apartment in the basement.  \n\nNow, he has hit hard time because of his own vices.  He went to my enabler mother for money.  She told him to raise my rent i stead of drinking less or getting a job.  \n\nThis felt like an utter betrayal to me.  I left my friend\u2019s apartment where i was happy because i was lured with off street parking and an apartment of my own in the future to help him out.  I was doing him a favor.  Helping the family.  \n\nThen my mother starts trying to convince him to raise my rent so he can afford his home and his booze and drugs.  \n\nWhen i found out, I felt betrayed.  I told her to stay out of my finances.  I told her that if she convinces him to raise my rent, i will just get an apartment of my own (you can get them as low as $600 a month around here).  I told her that she can then keep my brother afloat and pay the rent I no longer pay.\n\nThis went over really well.  \n\nAm I the asshole for telling my mother not to counsel my brother/landlord to raise my rent to pay for his drug habits?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their mother to stay out of their finances. The situation is a bit complex, so I need to break it down.\n\nFirst, the author is 35, living with his brother, who's a veteran with PTSD, addiction issues, and on VA disability. The brother makes more money than the author, who is working full-time but not making much. The author pays $400 a month in rent, which is half the brother's mortgage without property taxes. The utilities are free, and the author has a small bedroom. The brother has expensive vices: $100 a week on weed, two pints of rum daily, and a pack of cigarettes a day. That's about $870 a month, which is roughly what the author makes in two weeks. The brother is capable of working but can't hold a job because he's high or drunk.\n\nThe brother asked the author to move in, promising a garage parking and a basement apartment. Now, the brother is in trouble due to his habits and asked the author's mother for money. The mother suggested raising the rent instead of the brother cutting down on his vices. The author felt betrayed and told his mother to stay out of his finances, saying he'd move out if the rent increased. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author is in a financial arrangement with his brother, who is struggling with addiction. The mother is trying to influence the rent, which affects the author's finances. The author is defending his right to manage his own money.\n\nIs the author wrong? Let's see. The brother is the landlord, but he's also family. The author is paying rent, which is a significant portion of the brother's income. The mother's suggestion to raise rent might be to help the brother manage his money better, but the author sees it as enabling his vices. The author's response is to say no and possibly move out, which would mean the brother loses that income and has to find another solution.\n\nFrom a financial independence perspective, the author has the right to control his own expenses. The brother's addiction is his responsibility, and the author isn't the one causing the problem. The mother's advice could be seen as enabling the brother's bad habits, so the author is justified in protecting his own finances. The brother might need to face the consequences of his actions, and the author is trying to set boundaries. \n\nAdditionally, the author is paying a significant amount in rent, and if that's raised, it could strain him further. The author's threat to move out is a practical step, as he can find an apartment for $600, which is feasible. The mother's intervention here is crossing a line into the author's personal financial decisions. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for standing up for himself.\n"
