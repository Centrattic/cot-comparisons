I work full time, but make shit money.  My brother is a veteran with PTSD, an alcoholic, and drug addict.  He lives off of disability from the VA.  He gets paid twice as much as I do to play video games and drink all day.  He got his home and mortgage through the VA.  He begged me to leave my roommates and live with him.  I pay rent.  $400/ a month.  Half his mortgage without the property taxes.  Utilities are free.  I get a small bedroom, street parking, and access to the laundry, bathroom, and kitchen.  Its not terrible, and I have been able to save a bit of money and pay off most of my college loans.  \n\nNow, my brother had hit hard times because his vices are out of control.  He smokes $100 of weed a week.  Drinks two pints of rum a day ($11), and smokes a pack of cigarettes a day.  That is at least $870 a month.  That is what I make in two weeks.  That is only 1/4 his monthly pay.  I should point out that my brother is fully capable of working but cannot hold down a job because he shows up to work high or drunk.  \n\nHe begged me to live here.  Promised parking space in The garage and that he would build me an apartment in the basement.  \n\nNow, he has hit hard time because of his own vices.  He went to my enabler mother for money.  She told him to raise my rent i stead of drinking less or getting a job.  \n\nThis felt like an utter betrayal to me.  I left my friend\u2019s apartment where i was happy because i was lured with off street parking and an apartment of my own in the future to help him out.  I was doing him a favor.  Helping the family.  \n\nThen my mother starts trying to convince him to raise my rent so he can afford his home and his booze and drugs.  \n\nWhen i found out, I felt betrayed.  I told her to stay out of my finances.  I told her that if she convinces him to raise my rent, i will just get an apartment of my own (you can get them as low as $600 a month around here).  I told her that she can then keep my brother afloat and pay the rent I no longer pay.\n\nThis went over really well.  \n\nAm I the asshole for telling my mother not to counsel my brother/landlord to raise my rent to pay for his drug habits?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author living with his brother, who has addiction issues and relies on disability. The mother suggests raising the author's rent to help the brother manage his finances, but the author refuses, saying his mother should stay out of his finances.\n\nFirst, the author is paying rent to his brother, who is his landlord. The brother's financial problems are due to substance abuse, and the mother's solution is to increase the rent. The author finds this unfair because he's already contributing significantly, and he's worried about his own financial stability. He's also helping the brother out by living there and saving money while paying off loans.\n\nFrom a fairness standpoint, should the author be expected to take on more financial responsibility for his brother's vices? The author was lured into the arrangement with promises of future improvements (basement apartment, garage parking) that haven't materialized. Now, the brother is in trouble due to his own habits, and the mother is pushing for a rent increase. The author is standing his ground, prioritizing his own finances.\n\nLegally, the brother is the landlord, but the arrangement is informal. The author has the right to his financial autonomy. Ethically, it's about boundaries. The author isn't responsible for his brother's addiction or financial mismanagement. The mother's suggestion to raise rent is essentially shifting the burden from the brother's vices to the author. The author's response is reasonable to protect his own interests and not enable his brother's destructive behavior.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. He's setting boundaries and refusing to be a financial lifeline for his brother's habits. The mother's approach is not fair, and the author is justified in his stance."
