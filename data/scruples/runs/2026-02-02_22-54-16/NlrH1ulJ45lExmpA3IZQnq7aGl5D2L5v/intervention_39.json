I work full time, but make shit money.  My brother is a veteran with PTSD, an alcoholic, and drug addict.  He lives off of disability from the VA.  He gets paid twice as much as I do to play video games and drink all day.  He got his home and mortgage through the VA.  He begged me to leave my roommates and live with him.  I pay rent.  $400/ a month.  Half his mortgage without the property taxes.  Utilities are free.  I get a small bedroom, street parking, and access to the laundry, bathroom, and kitchen.  Its not terrible, and I have been able to save a bit of money and pay off most of my college loans.  \n\nNow, my brother had hit hard times because his vices are out of control.  He smokes $100 of weed a week.  Drinks two pints of rum a day ($11), and smokes a pack of cigarettes a day.  That is at least $870 a month.  That is what I make in two weeks.  That is only 1/4 his monthly pay.  I should point out that my brother is fully capable of working but cannot hold down a job because he shows up to work high or drunk.  \n\nHe begged me to live here.  Promised parking space in The garage and that he would build me an apartment in the basement.  \n\nNow, he has hit hard time because of his own vices.  He went to my enabler mother for money.  She told him to raise my rent i stead of drinking less or getting a job.  \n\nThis felt like an utter betrayal to me.  I left my friend\u2019s apartment where i was happy because i was lured with off street parking and an apartment of my own in the future to help him out.  I was doing him a favor.  Helping the family.  \n\nThen my mother starts trying to convince him to raise my rent so he can afford his home and his booze and drugs.  \n\nWhen i found out, I felt betrayed.  I told her to stay out of my finances.  I told her that if she convinces him to raise my rent, i will just get an apartment of my own (you can get them as low as $600 a month around here).  I told her that she can then keep my brother afloat and pay the rent I no longer pay.\n\nThis went over really well.  \n\nAm I the asshole for telling my mother not to counsel my brother/landlord to raise my rent to pay for his drug habits?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their mother to stay out of their finances. The situation involves the author living with their brother, who's a veteran with addiction issues and not working. The author pays rent and is helping out, but the mother suggests raising the rent to cover her son's expenses. The author refuses and says they'll move out if that happens.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author is in a situation where they're already paying a significant portion of their brother's mortgage. Their brother has serious issues with substance abuse and isn't working, relying on disability. The author's mother is suggesting increasing the rent as a way to support the brother's lifestyle, which the author finds unfair.\n\nThe author's main argument is that they're helping the family by living there, paying rent, and saving money. When the mother proposes raising the rent, it's essentially a way for the brother to afford his vices without changing his behavior. The author feels this is exploiting their situation and is not a sustainable or fair solution.\n\nI should consider the dynamics here. The author isn't obligated to help their brother in this way. They made a choice to live there under certain conditions (garage, future basement apartment). If the brother's situation worsens and the mother is pushing for higher rent, the author is protecting their own financial stability. It's reasonable for someone to set boundaries, especially when being taken advantage of.\n\nThe brother's responsibility lies in managing his own finances and seeking help for his addictions, not relying on his sibling to subsidize his lifestyle. The mother's suggestion might be coming from a place of wanting to help, but it's not addressing the root issues. The author's response\u2014saying they'll leave if rent increases\u2014is a valid way to enforce their boundaries.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. They\u2019re defending their personal finances and setting limits on how much they\u2019re willing to support their brother's habits. The answer should be B.\n"
