I work full time, but make shit money.  My brother is a veteran with PTSD, an alcoholic, and drug addict.  He lives off of disability from the VA.  He gets paid twice as much as I do to play video games and drink all day.  He got his home and mortgage through the VA.  He begged me to leave my roommates and live with him.  I pay rent.  $400/ a month.  Half his mortgage without the property taxes.  Utilities are free.  I get a small bedroom, street parking, and access to the laundry, bathroom, and kitchen.  Its not terrible, and I have been able to save a bit of money and pay off most of my college loans.  \n\nNow, my brother had hit hard times because his vices are out of control.  He smokes $100 of weed a week.  Drinks two pints of rum a day ($11), and smokes a pack of cigarettes a day.  That is at least $870 a month.  That is what I make in two weeks.  That is only 1/4 his monthly pay.  I should point out that my brother is fully capable of working but cannot hold down a job because he shows up to work high or drunk.  \n\nHe begged me to live here.  Promised parking space in The garage and that he would build me an apartment in the basement.  \n\nNow, he has hit hard time because of his own vices.  He went to my enabler mother for money.  She told him to raise my rent i stead of drinking less or getting a job.  \n\nThis felt like an utter betrayal to me.  I left my friend\u2019s apartment where i was happy because i was lured with off street parking and an apartment of my own in the future to help him out.  I was doing him a favor.  Helping the family.  \n\nThen my mother starts trying to convince him to raise my rent so he can afford his home and his booze and drugs.  \n\nWhen i found out, I felt betrayed.  I told her to stay out of my finances.  I told her that if she convinces him to raise my rent, i will just get an apartment of my own (you can get them as low as $600 a month around here).  I told her that she can then keep my brother afloat and pay the rent I no longer pay.\n\nThis went over really well.  \n\nAm I the asshole for telling my mother not to counsel my brother/landlord to raise my rent to pay for his drug habits?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for telling his mother to stop advising his brother to raise his rent to cover the brother's expenses related to his vices.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author is 35, living in his brother's home, paying $400 a month rent. The brother is a veteran with PTSD, an alcoholic, and a drug addict, living on VA disability. The brother's expenses on drugs and alcohol are high, and the mother suggests raising the rent to cover these costs. The author tells his mother to stay out of his finances, threatening to move out if she continues.\n\nSo, the key points here. The author is paying a significant portion of the brother's mortgage. The brother is struggling with addiction and can't hold a job. The mother's suggestion is to increase the rent as a way for the brother to manage his finances. The author feels this is unfair, as he's already making less money and contributing a lot without getting the benefits of homeownership.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, he's setting boundaries. He's not obligated to support his brother financially, especially when the brother is capable of working but doesn't. The mother's advice is enabling the brother's addiction by not addressing the root problem (his vices) and instead shifting the cost to the author. The author is essentially saying he won't be part of that cycle. He's also being practical, noting he can afford to move out if needed.\n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, the author is protecting his own finances and setting limits on family obligations. The brother's situation is his own responsibility, and the author isn't the one enabling him. The mother, by trying to get the author to pay more, is perhaps not helping the brother to address his issues. So, the author isn't in the wrong for standing up for himself.\n"
