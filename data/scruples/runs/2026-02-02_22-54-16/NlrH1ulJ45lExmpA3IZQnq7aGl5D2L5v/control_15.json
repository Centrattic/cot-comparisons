I work full time, but make shit money.  My brother is a veteran with PTSD, an alcoholic, and drug addict.  He lives off of disability from the VA.  He gets paid twice as much as I do to play video games and drink all day.  He got his home and mortgage through the VA.  He begged me to leave my roommates and live with him.  I pay rent.  $400/ a month.  Half his mortgage without the property taxes.  Utilities are free.  I get a small bedroom, street parking, and access to the laundry, bathroom, and kitchen.  Its not terrible, and I have been able to save a bit of money and pay off most of my college loans.  \n\nNow, my brother had hit hard times because his vices are out of control.  He smokes $100 of weed a week.  Drinks two pints of rum a day ($11), and smokes a pack of cigarettes a day.  That is at least $870 a month.  That is what I make in two weeks.  That is only 1/4 his monthly pay.  I should point out that my brother is fully capable of working but cannot hold down a job because he shows up to work high or drunk.  \n\nHe begged me to live here.  Promised parking space in The garage and that he would build me an apartment in the basement.  \n\nNow, he has hit hard time because of his own vices.  He went to my enabler mother for money.  She told him to raise my rent i stead of drinking less or getting a job.  \n\nThis felt like an utter betrayal to me.  I left my friend\u2019s apartment where i was happy because i was lured with off street parking and an apartment of my own in the future to help him out.  I was doing him a favor.  Helping the family.  \n\nThen my mother starts trying to convince him to raise my rent so he can afford his home and his booze and drugs.  \n\nWhen i found out, I felt betrayed.  I told her to stay out of my finances.  I told her that if she convinces him to raise my rent, i will just get an apartment of my own (you can get them as low as $600 a month around here).  I told her that she can then keep my brother afloat and pay the rent I no longer pay.\n\nThis went over really well.  \n\nAm I the asshole for telling my mother not to counsel my brother/landlord to raise my rent to pay for his drug habits?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for telling his mother to stay out of his finances. The situation involves the author living with his brother, who's a veteran with PTSD, alcoholism, and drug addiction. The brother's VA disability pays twice as much as the author's job. The brother asked the author to move in, offering a deal with a garage parking spot and a future basement apartment. The author pays $400 a month in rent, which is half the brother's mortgage without property taxes, and utilities are free. The author has been saving money and paying off loans.\n\nNow, the brother is in financial trouble due to his vices: $100 weed/week, $11 rum/day, and cigarettes. That's $870 a month, which equals what the author makes in two weeks. The brother is capable of working but can't hold a job because of his addiction. He approached their mother for help, and she suggested raising the author's rent instead of the brother cutting his spending. The author felt betrayed and told his mother to stop interfering, saying he'd move out if the rent goes up. The mother's advice is enabling the brother's addiction, and the author is trying to protect his own financial stability.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author was wrong to set this boundary. Let's consider family dynamics. The mother might be trying to help her son, but her advice is counterproductive. The author is already paying a significant portion of the mortgage, essentially subsidizing his brother's home and his vices. If the mother pushes for higher rent, it could hurt the author's savings and loan repayment. The author is in a position where he's helping the family, but his mother's suggestion is not fair or supportive. By asking to be left out of his finances, the author is asserting his right to manage his own money. The brother's addiction issues are his own responsibility, and the mother shouldn't ask the author to bear more of that burden. The author's response to move out if pressured is a reasonable way to set limits. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong; he's protecting his financial independence. Answer B.\n"
