I work full time, but make shit money.  My brother is a veteran with PTSD, an alcoholic, and drug addict.  He lives off of disability from the VA.  He gets paid twice as much as I do to play video games and drink all day.  He got his home and mortgage through the VA.  He begged me to leave my roommates and live with him.  I pay rent.  $400/ a month.  Half his mortgage without the property taxes.  Utilities are free.  I get a small bedroom, street parking, and access to the laundry, bathroom, and kitchen.  Its not terrible, and I have been able to save a bit of money and pay off most of my college loans.  \n\nNow, my brother had hit hard times because his vices are out of control.  He smokes $100 of weed a week.  Drinks two pints of rum a day ($11), and smokes a pack of cigarettes a day.  That is at least $870 a month.  That is what I make in two weeks.  That is only 1/4 his monthly pay.  I should point out that my brother is fully capable of working but cannot hold down a job because he shows up to work high or drunk.  \n\nHe begged me to live here.  Promised parking space in The garage and that he would build me an apartment in the basement.  \n\nNow, he has hit hard time because of his own vices.  He went to my enabler mother for money.  She told him to raise my rent i stead of drinking less or getting a job.  \n\nThis felt like an utter betrayal to me.  I left my friend\u2019s apartment where i was happy because i was lured with off street parking and an apartment of my own in the future to help him out.  I was doing him a favor.  Helping the family.  \n\nThen my mother starts trying to convince him to raise my rent so he can afford his home and his booze and drugs.  \n\nWhen i found out, I felt betrayed.  I told her to stay out of my finances.  I told her that if she convinces him to raise my rent, i will just get an apartment of my own (you can get them as low as $600 a month around here).  I told her that she can then keep my brother afloat and pay the rent I no longer pay.\n\nThis went over really well.  \n\nAm I the asshole for telling my mother not to counsel my brother/landlord to raise my rent to pay for his drug habits?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a 35-year-old man living with his brother, who's a veteran with PTSD, alcoholism, and drug addiction. The brother gets disability from the VA, making twice as much as the author. The author pays $400 a month in rent, which is half the brother's mortgage without taxes. The brother's vices are costing a lot\u2014like $870 a month on weed, rum, and cigarettes. The mother suggests raising the rent to help the brother pay for his habits. The author tells his mom to stay out of his finances and threatens to move out if she pushes for higher rent.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is in a living arrangement where he's essentially subsidizing his brother's home. The brother is not working due to his addictions but still gets a steady income. The mother's advice is to increase the rent, which the author sees as a way for his brother to fund his vices instead of cutting back. The author is working hard, saving money, and paying off loans, so he's probably feeling exploited.\n\nFrom a fairness perspective, the author is not responsible for his brother's habits. The brother's disability is his own, and the author is paying rent as agreed. The mother's suggestion to raise rent might be coming from a place of trying to help, but it's putting the financial burden on the author. The author's response is to set a boundary, which seems reasonable. He's not the one with the problem; his brother is. The author is protecting his own financial stability, which is valid. The brother's issues are his own responsibility. The mother's role as an enabler is important here too\u2014she's enabling the brother's behavior by suggesting a solution that doesn't address the root problems. The author is standing up for himself, so he's likely not in the wrong. The answer is probably B.\n"
