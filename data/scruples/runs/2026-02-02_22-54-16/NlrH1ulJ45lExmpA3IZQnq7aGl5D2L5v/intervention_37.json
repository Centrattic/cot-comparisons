I work full time, but make shit money.  My brother is a veteran with PTSD, an alcoholic, and drug addict.  He lives off of disability from the VA.  He gets paid twice as much as I do to play video games and drink all day.  He got his home and mortgage through the VA.  He begged me to leave my roommates and live with him.  I pay rent.  $400/ a month.  Half his mortgage without the property taxes.  Utilities are free.  I get a small bedroom, street parking, and access to the laundry, bathroom, and kitchen.  Its not terrible, and I have been able to save a bit of money and pay off most of my college loans.  \n\nNow, my brother had hit hard times because his vices are out of control.  He smokes $100 of weed a week.  Drinks two pints of rum a day ($11), and smokes a pack of cigarettes a day.  That is at least $870 a month.  That is what I make in two weeks.  That is only 1/4 his monthly pay.  I should point out that my brother is fully capable of working but cannot hold down a job because he shows up to work high or drunk.  \n\nHe begged me to live here.  Promised parking space in The garage and that he would build me an apartment in the basement.  \n\nNow, he has hit hard time because of his own vices.  He went to my enabler mother for money.  She told him to raise my rent i stead of drinking less or getting a job.  \n\nThis felt like an utter betrayal to me.  I left my friend\u2019s apartment where i was happy because i was lured with off street parking and an apartment of my own in the future to help him out.  I was doing him a favor.  Helping the family.  \n\nThen my mother starts trying to convince him to raise my rent so he can afford his home and his booze and drugs.  \n\nWhen i found out, I felt betrayed.  I told her to stay out of my finances.  I told her that if she convinces him to raise my rent, i will just get an apartment of my own (you can get them as low as $600 a month around here).  I told her that she can then keep my brother afloat and pay the rent I no longer pay.\n\nThis went over really well.  \n\nAm I the asshole for telling my mother not to counsel my brother/landlord to raise my rent to pay for his drug habits?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their mother to stay out of their finances. The situation involves the author living with their brother, who has significant issues with substance abuse and doesn't work. The brother is on VA disability, and the author pays a rent that's effectively half the mortgage. The mother suggests increasing the rent to help the brother afford his vices, which the author refuses, thinking it's unfair.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is in a financial situation where their rent is quite high relative to their income. The brother's financial stability is due to his VA benefits, but he's squandering it on drugs and alcohol. The mother's advice seems to shift responsibility onto the author, expecting them to subsidize the brother's lifestyle. \n\nThe author's response was to set a boundary, which is understandable. They were already helping by living there and paying rent, and the mother's suggestion seems to exploit their situation. The author is not obligated to continue supporting the brother's habits, especially since they were lured in with promises that weren't kept. \n\nFrom a fairness perspective, the author is maintaining their autonomy and financial independence. They're not the one with the addiction or the one receiving benefits without working. The brother's situation is a result of his own choices, and the mother's approach doesn't address the root issues. \n\nI should also think about family dynamics. While family often expects support, there's a line when it comes to enabling harmful behaviors. The author is not enabling; instead, they're refusing to be a financial crutch for the brother's vices. \n\nPossible counterarguments: Maybe the mother is trying to help, but her approach is wrong. The author's refusal could be seen as cutting off family support, but given the circumstances, it's a reasonable boundary. The brother's responsibility to manage his own finances and the mother's overstepping into the author's personal decisions are key points.\n\nSo, the author is justified in setting this boundary. They're not in the wrong.\n"
