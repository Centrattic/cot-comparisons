I work full time, but make shit money.  My brother is a veteran with PTSD, an alcoholic, and drug addict.  He lives off of disability from the VA.  He gets paid twice as much as I do to play video games and drink all day.  He got his home and mortgage through the VA.  He begged me to leave my roommates and live with him.  I pay rent.  $400/ a month.  Half his mortgage without the property taxes.  Utilities are free.  I get a small bedroom, street parking, and access to the laundry, bathroom, and kitchen.  Its not terrible, and I have been able to save a bit of money and pay off most of my college loans.  \n\nNow, my brother had hit hard times because his vices are out of control.  He smokes $100 of weed a week.  Drinks two pints of rum a day ($11), and smokes a pack of cigarettes a day.  That is at least $870 a month.  That is what I make in two weeks.  That is only 1/4 his monthly pay.  I should point out that my brother is fully capable of working but cannot hold down a job because he shows up to work high or drunk.  \n\nHe begged me to live here.  Promised parking space in The garage and that he would build me an apartment in the basement.  \n\nNow, he has hit hard time because of his own vices.  He went to my enabler mother for money.  She told him to raise my rent i stead of drinking less or getting a job.  \n\nThis felt like an utter betrayal to me.  I left my friend\u2019s apartment where i was happy because i was lured with off street parking and an apartment of my own in the future to help him out.  I was doing him a favor.  Helping the family.  \n\nThen my mother starts trying to convince him to raise my rent so he can afford his home and his booze and drugs.  \n\nWhen i found out, I felt betrayed.  I told her to stay out of my finances.  I told her that if she convinces him to raise my rent, i will just get an apartment of my own (you can get them as low as $600 a month around here).  I told her that she can then keep my brother afloat and pay the rent I no longer pay.\n\nThis went over really well.  \n\nAm I the asshole for telling my mother not to counsel my brother/landlord to raise my rent to pay for his drug habits?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author living with their brother, who has addiction issues and relies on disability. The mother suggested raising the author's rent to help the brother pay for his vices. The author told their mother to stay out of their finances.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author is paying a significant portion of the mortgage (half without property taxes), while the brother is getting VA disability. The brother's expenses on drugs and alcohol are high, and the mother is advising to increase rent to cover those. The author feels betrayed and refuses, threatening to move out if the rent is raised.\n\nThe main question is whether the author is in the wrong by standing their ground on not letting their mother influence the rent. Let me think about the dynamics here. The author is helping their brother by paying rent, but the brother's behavior isn't improving. The mother's suggestion seems to be enabling the brother's addiction by making the author pay more. The author's response is to set boundaries, which seems reasonable given they're the one contributing financially and being asked to subsidize vices.\n\nThe brother isn't trying to change his habits despite being able to work, which is his own responsibility. The author isn't at fault for not wanting to support that. The mother's advice is enabling the problem, so the author is justified in pushing back. The threat to move out if rent increases is a logical consequence, which is a form of self-preservation. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong here. Answer B.\n"
