I work full time, but make shit money.  My brother is a veteran with PTSD, an alcoholic, and drug addict.  He lives off of disability from the VA.  He gets paid twice as much as I do to play video games and drink all day.  He got his home and mortgage through the VA.  He begged me to leave my roommates and live with him.  I pay rent.  $400/ a month.  Half his mortgage without the property taxes.  Utilities are free.  I get a small bedroom, street parking, and access to the laundry, bathroom, and kitchen.  Its not terrible, and I have been able to save a bit of money and pay off most of my college loans.  \n\nNow, my brother had hit hard times because his vices are out of control.  He smokes $100 of weed a week.  Drinks two pints of rum a day ($11), and smokes a pack of cigarettes a day.  That is at least $870 a month.  That is what I make in two weeks.  That is only 1/4 his monthly pay.  I should point out that my brother is fully capable of working but cannot hold down a job because he shows up to work high or drunk.  \n\nHe begged me to live here.  Promised parking space in The garage and that he would build me an apartment in the basement.  \n\nNow, he has hit hard time because of his own vices.  He went to my enabler mother for money.  She told him to raise my rent i stead of drinking less or getting a job.  \n\nThis felt like an utter betrayal to me.  I left my friend\u2019s apartment where i was happy because i was lured with off street parking and an apartment of my own in the future to help him out.  I was doing him a favor.  Helping the family.  \n\nThen my mother starts trying to convince him to raise my rent so he can afford his home and his booze and drugs.  \n\nWhen i found out, I felt betrayed.  I told her to stay out of my finances.  I told her that if she convinces him to raise my rent, i will just get an apartment of my own (you can get them as low as $600 a month around here).  I told her that she can then keep my brother afloat and pay the rent I no longer pay.\n\nThis went over really well.  \n\nAm I the asshole for telling my mother not to counsel my brother/landlord to raise my rent to pay for his drug habits?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their mother to stay out of their finances. The situation involves the author living with their brother, who has significant issues with alcohol and drug use, and a mother who's suggesting increasing the author's rent to help the brother's financial situation.\n\nFirst, the author is paying rent that's actually a fraction of the brother's disability income. The brother's habits are costing him a lot, but he's not taking responsibility. The mother's suggestion to raise the rent is essentially shifting the burden onto the author, which seems unfair. The author is trying to manage their own finances and has even managed to save and pay off loans, so they're in a better position than the brother. \n\nThe brother initially lured the author with promises of a garage and basement apartment, but hasn't delivered on those. Now, the mother wants to raise the rent, which could undermine the author's financial stability. The author's response is to set a boundary, saying they'll move out if the rent increases. This is a self-protective measure, ensuring they don't get taken advantage of. \n\nConsidering the brother's inability to manage his own finances responsibly, the mother's advice isn't helping; it's exploiting the author. The author isn't wrong for standing up for their own financial well-being. They're not in a position to support the brother's vices, and setting a boundary is reasonable. So, the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
