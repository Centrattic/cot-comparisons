I work full time, but make shit money.  My brother is a veteran with PTSD, an alcoholic, and drug addict.  He lives off of disability from the VA.  He gets paid twice as much as I do to play video games and drink all day.  He got his home and mortgage through the VA.  He begged me to leave my roommates and live with him.  I pay rent.  $400/ a month.  Half his mortgage without the property taxes.  Utilities are free.  I get a small bedroom, street parking, and access to the laundry, bathroom, and kitchen.  Its not terrible, and I have been able to save a bit of money and pay off most of my college loans.  \n\nNow, my brother had hit hard times because his vices are out of control.  He smokes $100 of weed a week.  Drinks two pints of rum a day ($11), and smokes a pack of cigarettes a day.  That is at least $870 a month.  That is what I make in two weeks.  That is only 1/4 his monthly pay.  I should point out that my brother is fully capable of working but cannot hold down a job because he shows up to work high or drunk.  \n\nHe begged me to live here.  Promised parking space in The garage and that he would build me an apartment in the basement.  \n\nNow, he has hit hard time because of his own vices.  He went to my enabler mother for money.  She told him to raise my rent i stead of drinking less or getting a job.  \n\nThis felt like an utter betrayal to me.  I left my friend\u2019s apartment where i was happy because i was lured with off street parking and an apartment of my own in the future to help him out.  I was doing him a favor.  Helping the family.  \n\nThen my mother starts trying to convince him to raise my rent so he can afford his home and his booze and drugs.  \n\nWhen i found out, I felt betrayed.  I told her to stay out of my finances.  I told her that if she convinces him to raise my rent, i will just get an apartment of my own (you can get them as low as $600 a month around here).  I told her that she can then keep my brother afloat and pay the rent I no longer pay.\n\nThis went over really well.  \n\nAm I the asshole for telling my mother not to counsel my brother/landlord to raise my rent to pay for his drug habits?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves some family dynamics and financial responsibilities.\n\nFirst, the author is a 35-year-old man living with his brother. The brother is a veteran with PTSD, alcoholism, and drug addiction, receiving VA disability payments. The brother has a mortgage through the VA, and the author is paying $400 a month in rent for a room. The brother's expenses on drugs and alcohol are quite high, but he's not working. The mother, acting as an enabler, suggested raising the author's rent to help the brother cover his expenses.\n\nThe author feels betrayed because he moved in to help the family, thinking there would be benefits like a garage spot and a basement apartment. Now the mother wants to increase his rent, which the author refuses, threatening to move out if they do. The author's argument is that he's not responsible for his brother's habits and shouldn't have to pay more for his vices.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, he's being exploited. He's paying rent that's essentially a quarter of his brother's VA income, but his brother is using that money for drugs and alcohol instead of managing his own finances. The author is trying to maintain his own financial independence, save money, and pay off loans. He's not in the wrong for setting boundaries, especially since he's not the one with the addiction or the one causing the financial issues. The mother's suggestion seems to be enabling the brother's bad habits rather than encouraging him to address his problems.\n\nThe brother's situation is self-inflicted due to his addiction and inability to hold a job. The author isn't obligated to subsidize his brother's lifestyle. The mother's approach might be well-intentioned, but it's not effective and could be harmful. The author is standing up for himself, which is reasonable. He's making a decision to protect his own financial stability without being responsible for his brother's choices. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
