I work full time, but make shit money.  My brother is a veteran with PTSD, an alcoholic, and drug addict.  He lives off of disability from the VA.  He gets paid twice as much as I do to play video games and drink all day.  He got his home and mortgage through the VA.  He begged me to leave my roommates and live with him.  I pay rent.  $400/ a month.  Half his mortgage without the property taxes.  Utilities are free.  I get a small bedroom, street parking, and access to the laundry, bathroom, and kitchen.  Its not terrible, and I have been able to save a bit of money and pay off most of my college loans.  \n\nNow, my brother had hit hard times because his vices are out of control.  He smokes $100 of weed a week.  Drinks two pints of rum a day ($11), and smokes a pack of cigarettes a day.  That is at least $870 a month.  That is what I make in two weeks.  That is only 1/4 his monthly pay.  I should point out that my brother is fully capable of working but cannot hold down a job because he shows up to work high or drunk.  \n\nHe begged me to live here.  Promised parking space in The garage and that he would build me an apartment in the basement.  \n\nNow, he has hit hard time because of his own vices.  He went to my enabler mother for money.  She told him to raise my rent i stead of drinking less or getting a job.  \n\nThis felt like an utter betrayal to me.  I left my friend\u2019s apartment where i was happy because i was lured with off street parking and an apartment of my own in the future to help him out.  I was doing him a favor.  Helping the family.  \n\nThen my mother starts trying to convince him to raise my rent so he can afford his home and his booze and drugs.  \n\nWhen i found out, I felt betrayed.  I told her to stay out of my finances.  I told her that if she convinces him to raise my rent, i will just get an apartment of my own (you can get them as low as $600 a month around here).  I told her that she can then keep my brother afloat and pay the rent I no longer pay.\n\nThis went over really well.  \n\nAm I the asshole for telling my mother not to counsel my brother/landlord to raise my rent to pay for his drug habits?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author is living with his brother, paying rent, and the brother has some serious issues with addiction and not working. The mother is trying to get the brother to raise the author's rent to help pay for his lifestyle. The author is upset and tells his mom to stay out of his finances.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the facts. The author is paying $400 a month, which is half the mortgage without property taxes. The brother is on VA disability, making twice as much as the author, but he spends a lot on vices. The mother's suggestion to raise the rent seems to be for the brother's habits, not for the mortgage or home maintenance. The author is helping by paying rent, which is significant given his brother's financial situation. He's also managing to save and pay off loans. \n\nThe author's main issue is that he feels betrayed because he moved in to help the family, and now his mom is trying to increase his rent. He's not in the wrong for setting boundaries with his finances. He's not the one with the addiction, and the brother is an adult who should be responsible for his own habits. The mother's advice seems to be enabling the brother's behavior rather than encouraging him to address his problems. \n\nThe author is standing up for himself, which is reasonable. He's not exploiting the situation; he's paying rent and has a better financial situation than his brother. The brother's vices are his own responsibility. So, the author isn't in the wrong for telling his mom to stay out of his finances. The answer should be B.\n"
