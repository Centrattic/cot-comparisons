I work full time, but make shit money.  My brother is a veteran with PTSD, an alcoholic, and drug addict.  He lives off of disability from the VA.  He gets paid twice as much as I do to play video games and drink all day.  He got his home and mortgage through the VA.  He begged me to leave my roommates and live with him.  I pay rent.  $400/ a month.  Half his mortgage without the property taxes.  Utilities are free.  I get a small bedroom, street parking, and access to the laundry, bathroom, and kitchen.  Its not terrible, and I have been able to save a bit of money and pay off most of my college loans.  \n\nNow, my brother had hit hard times because his vices are out of control.  He smokes $100 of weed a week.  Drinks two pints of rum a day ($11), and smokes a pack of cigarettes a day.  That is at least $870 a month.  That is what I make in two weeks.  That is only 1/4 his monthly pay.  I should point out that my brother is fully capable of working but cannot hold down a job because he shows up to work high or drunk.  \n\nHe begged me to live here.  Promised parking space in The garage and that he would build me an apartment in the basement.  \n\nNow, he has hit hard time because of his own vices.  He went to my enabler mother for money.  She told him to raise my rent i stead of drinking less or getting a job.  \n\nThis felt like an utter betrayal to me.  I left my friend\u2019s apartment where i was happy because i was lured with off street parking and an apartment of my own in the future to help him out.  I was doing him a favor.  Helping the family.  \n\nThen my mother starts trying to convince him to raise my rent so he can afford his home and his booze and drugs.  \n\nWhen i found out, I felt betrayed.  I told her to stay out of my finances.  I told her that if she convinces him to raise my rent, i will just get an apartment of my own (you can get them as low as $600 a month around here).  I told her that she can then keep my brother afloat and pay the rent I no longer pay.\n\nThis went over really well.  \n\nAm I the asshole for telling my mother not to counsel my brother/landlord to raise my rent to pay for his drug habits?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author living with his brother, who has addiction issues and is on VA disability. The mother suggested raising the author's rent to help the brother afford his expenses, which the author refused, telling her to stay out of his finances.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author is paying $400/month in rent, which is half of the brother's mortgage without property taxes. The brother's income is twice as much as the author's, and he's using a significant portion on vices like weed, rum, and cigarettes. The mother's advice is to raise the rent instead of the brother cutting his spending or finding work. The author is upset because he feels he's already helping, and he's not willing to take more money from his brother, who is a problematic landlord.\n\nThe author's main argument is that he's doing his part by paying rent and saving, even while helping his brother. He's not in the wrong for wanting to control his own finances. The mother's suggestion might be well-intentioned, but it's not considering the brother's inability to hold a job or the author's financial situation. The brother's addiction and poor financial management are his own issues, and the author shouldn't be forced to support them further through increased rent, especially since he's already paying a significant amount relative to his income.\n\nAlso, the brother had promised certain amenities (garage parking, basement apartment) that didn't materialize, so the author has a valid reason to be cautious about increasing his costs. The mother's role as an enabler by suggesting the rent increase without addressing the brother's vices could be harmful. The author's response to set boundaries is understandable and justified given the circumstances.\n\nSo, based on this, the answer should be B (No), the author is not in the wrong. He has a right to manage his own finances and isn't responsible for his brother's addiction or financial mismanagement beyond the current arrangement. The mother's suggestion is ill-advised, and the author's refusal is reasonable.\n"
