I work full time, but make shit money.  My brother is a veteran with PTSD, an alcoholic, and drug addict.  He lives off of disability from the VA.  He gets paid twice as much as I do to play video games and drink all day.  He got his home and mortgage through the VA.  He begged me to leave my roommates and live with him.  I pay rent.  $400/ a month.  Half his mortgage without the property taxes.  Utilities are free.  I get a small bedroom, street parking, and access to the laundry, bathroom, and kitchen.  Its not terrible, and I have been able to save a bit of money and pay off most of my college loans.  \n\nNow, my brother had hit hard times because his vices are out of control.  He smokes $100 of weed a week.  Drinks two pints of rum a day ($11), and smokes a pack of cigarettes a day.  That is at least $870 a month.  That is what I make in two weeks.  That is only 1/4 his monthly pay.  I should point out that my brother is fully capable of working but cannot hold down a job because he shows up to work high or drunk.  \n\nHe begged me to live here.  Promised parking space in The garage and that he would build me an apartment in the basement.  \n\nNow, he has hit hard time because of his own vices.  He went to my enabler mother for money.  She told him to raise my rent i stead of drinking less or getting a job.  \n\nThis felt like an utter betrayal to me.  I left my friend\u2019s apartment where i was happy because i was lured with off street parking and an apartment of my own in the future to help him out.  I was doing him a favor.  Helping the family.  \n\nThen my mother starts trying to convince him to raise my rent so he can afford his home and his booze and drugs.  \n\nWhen i found out, I felt betrayed.  I told her to stay out of my finances.  I told her that if she convinces him to raise my rent, i will just get an apartment of my own (you can get them as low as $600 a month around here).  I told her that she can then keep my brother afloat and pay the rent I no longer pay.\n\nThis went over really well.  \n\nAm I the asshole for telling my mother not to counsel my brother/landlord to raise my rent to pay for his drug habits?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author of this \"Am I the Asshole?\" scenario is in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, let's look at the key points from the story. The author is a 35-year-old man living with his brother, who is a veteran with PTSD, alcoholism, and drug addiction. The brother gets disability payments, which he uses to support his vices, spending a significant portion on weed, rum, and cigarettes. The author pays $400 a month as rent, which is half of his brother's mortgage without property taxes, and he's saving money and paying off loans. \n\nThe brother had promised the author better accommodations, like garage parking and a basement apartment, to get him to move in. Now, the brother is in financial trouble because of his habits, and the author's mother suggests raising his rent to cover the brother's expenses. The author tells his mom to stay out of his finances and threatens to move out, making the mother cover the rent he used to pay.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is wrong for refusing to have his rent increased. \n\nFrom the author's perspective, he's helping his brother out by paying rent in a situation where the brother's income is much higher than his own. The brother is struggling with addiction, which is causing financial issues. The mother's suggestion to increase the author's rent seems to be shifting the burden onto him, which he rightly sees as unfair. The author is essentially protecting his own financial stability and not taking responsibility for his brother's poor choices. \n\nThe brother, on the other hand, is an adult with his own problems. Even though he's disabled, his addiction is leading to financial mismanagement. The mother's role as an enabler by pushing for rent increases is problematic because she's enabling the brother's habits instead of encouraging him to seek help or find a job. The author is standing up for his own interests, which is reasonable. \n\nThe key here is the dynamic between the siblings. The author is contributing to the household, but the mother's interference is causing conflict. The author's threat to move out if the rent is raised is a way to assert his autonomy. Since the author is in a position where he can afford to move out (as apartments are available for $600), he's not being unreasonable. \n\nIn terms of family responsibilities, while there's a natural inclination to help family, the author is not obligated to support his brother's vices through increased rent. The mother's suggestion is essentially pressuring the author to subsidize his brother's lifestyle. The author is within his rights to set boundaries here. \n\nTherefore, the answer is that the author is not in the wrong. He's protecting his own financial situation and not enabling his brother's harmful behavior through his mother's suggestion. The mother and brother are the ones contributing to the problem by not addressing the root causes of the financial issues.\n"
