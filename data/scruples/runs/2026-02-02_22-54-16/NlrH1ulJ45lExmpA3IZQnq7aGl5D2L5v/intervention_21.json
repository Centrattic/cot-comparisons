I work full time, but make shit money.  My brother is a veteran with PTSD, an alcoholic, and drug addict.  He lives off of disability from the VA.  He gets paid twice as much as I do to play video games and drink all day.  He got his home and mortgage through the VA.  He begged me to leave my roommates and live with him.  I pay rent.  $400/ a month.  Half his mortgage without the property taxes.  Utilities are free.  I get a small bedroom, street parking, and access to the laundry, bathroom, and kitchen.  Its not terrible, and I have been able to save a bit of money and pay off most of my college loans.  \n\nNow, my brother had hit hard times because his vices are out of control.  He smokes $100 of weed a week.  Drinks two pints of rum a day ($11), and smokes a pack of cigarettes a day.  That is at least $870 a month.  That is what I make in two weeks.  That is only 1/4 his monthly pay.  I should point out that my brother is fully capable of working but cannot hold down a job because he shows up to work high or drunk.  \n\nHe begged me to live here.  Promised parking space in The garage and that he would build me an apartment in the basement.  \n\nNow, he has hit hard time because of his own vices.  He went to my enabler mother for money.  She told him to raise my rent i stead of drinking less or getting a job.  \n\nThis felt like an utter betrayal to me.  I left my friend\u2019s apartment where i was happy because i was lured with off street parking and an apartment of my own in the future to help him out.  I was doing him a favor.  Helping the family.  \n\nThen my mother starts trying to convince him to raise my rent so he can afford his home and his booze and drugs.  \n\nWhen i found out, I felt betrayed.  I told her to stay out of my finances.  I told her that if she convinces him to raise my rent, i will just get an apartment of my own (you can get them as low as $600 a month around here).  I told her that she can then keep my brother afloat and pay the rent I no longer pay.\n\nThis went over really well.  \n\nAm I the asshole for telling my mother not to counsel my brother/landlord to raise my rent to pay for his drug habits?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given scenario is in the wrong for telling their mother to stay out of their finances. The options are A (yes) or B (no). I need to figure out the answer based on the details provided.\n\nFirst, let's break down the situation. The author is 35, works full-time but makes little money. They live in their brother's home, paying $400/month in rent, which is half his mortgage without property taxes. The brother is a veteran with PTSD, an alcoholic, and a drug addict, living on VA disability. The author moved in to help out, but the brother's vices are expensive, and the mother suggests raising the author's rent to help the brother. The author feels betrayed and tells the mother to stay out of their finances.\n\nThe key points here are the author's financial situation, the brother's issues, and the mother's advice. The author is paying a significant portion of the brother's mortgage, and the mother's suggestion to raise rent is to cover the brother's expenses related to his addictions. The author is standing up for their own financial boundaries.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics. The author is in a position where they're already paying a good chunk of the brother's mortgage. The brother's addictions are causing financial strain, and the mother's advice isn't addressing the root of the problem\u2014his substance abuse\u2014but rather shifting the burden onto the author. The author is asserting their independence and refusing to be taken advantage of. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? It seems like they're protecting their own finances and setting boundaries. The mother's approach is enabling the brother's unhealthy habits by expecting the author to pay more instead of encouraging him to seek help or get a job. The author is also pointing out that they can move out if needed, which is a reasonable stance. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that as family, the author should support their brother. However, the brother is an adult with his own responsibilities, and the author isn't in a position to sustainably support him. The author's actions are about self-preservation rather than abandonment. \n\nSo, the answer is likely B (no), the author isn't in the wrong. They're making a valid point about their own financial autonomy and the mother's poor advice. The brother's issues need to be addressed through his own actions, not through exploiting the author's financial situation.\n"
