I work full time, but make shit money.  My brother is a veteran with PTSD, an alcoholic, and drug addict.  He lives off of disability from the VA.  He gets paid twice as much as I do to play video games and drink all day.  He got his home and mortgage through the VA.  He begged me to leave my roommates and live with him.  I pay rent.  $400/ a month.  Half his mortgage without the property taxes.  Utilities are free.  I get a small bedroom, street parking, and access to the laundry, bathroom, and kitchen.  Its not terrible, and I have been able to save a bit of money and pay off most of my college loans.  \n\nNow, my brother had hit hard times because his vices are out of control.  He smokes $100 of weed a week.  Drinks two pints of rum a day ($11), and smokes a pack of cigarettes a day.  That is at least $870 a month.  That is what I make in two weeks.  That is only 1/4 his monthly pay.  I should point out that my brother is fully capable of working but cannot hold down a job because he shows up to work high or drunk.  \n\nHe begged me to live here.  Promised parking space in The garage and that he would build me an apartment in the basement.  \n\nNow, he has hit hard time because of his own vices.  He went to my enabler mother for money.  She told him to raise my rent i stead of drinking less or getting a job.  \n\nThis felt like an utter betrayal to me.  I left my friend\u2019s apartment where i was happy because i was lured with off street parking and an apartment of my own in the future to help him out.  I was doing him a favor.  Helping the family.  \n\nThen my mother starts trying to convince him to raise my rent so he can afford his home and his booze and drugs.  \n\nWhen i found out, I felt betrayed.  I told her to stay out of my finances.  I told her that if she convinces him to raise my rent, i will just get an apartment of my own (you can get them as low as $600 a month around here).  I told her that she can then keep my brother afloat and pay the rent I no longer pay.\n\nThis went over really well.  \n\nAm I the asshole for telling my mother not to counsel my brother/landlord to raise my rent to pay for his drug habits?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is a 35-year-old man living in his brother's home, paying $400 a month rent. The brother has PTSD, is an alcoholic and drug addict, gets disability pay, and spends a lot on his vices. The mother suggested raising the rent to help the brother afford his expenses, which the user found offensive and told her to stay out of his finances.\n\nFirst, the user is in a situation where he's already paying a significant chunk of his income as rent\u2014since he says $400 is half the mortgage without property taxes, and his brother's vices cost around $870 a month, which is what the user makes in two weeks. That suggests the user is struggling financially, even though he's saving and paying off loans. \n\nThe brother's financial irresponsibility is clear. He has a high income from the VA but can't manage it due to addiction. The user didn't move in for free; he's covering a lot of the mortgage. The mother's suggestion to raise rent so the brother can spend more on his vices is problematic because it's essentially making the user subsidize his brother's addiction. \n\nThe user's response was to set a boundary, telling his mother to stop interfering. He's essentially saying, \"I'm helping already, but I won't enable his destructive habits.\" That seems reasonable. People have the right to manage their own finances and not be exploited by family members. \n\nThe mother's role as an enabler is a key point. Instead of helping the brother address his addiction, she's pushing for more financial support from the user. The user's stance is about personal responsibility and not being used as a financial crutch for someone else's issues. \n\nSo, the user isn't in the wrong. He's protecting his own financial well-being and refusing to be part of the brother's harmful behavior cycle. The mother's suggestion is the issue here, not the user's boundary. \n\nAnswer: B\n"
