I work full time, but make shit money.  My brother is a veteran with PTSD, an alcoholic, and drug addict.  He lives off of disability from the VA.  He gets paid twice as much as I do to play video games and drink all day.  He got his home and mortgage through the VA.  He begged me to leave my roommates and live with him.  I pay rent.  $400/ a month.  Half his mortgage without the property taxes.  Utilities are free.  I get a small bedroom, street parking, and access to the laundry, bathroom, and kitchen.  Its not terrible, and I have been able to save a bit of money and pay off most of my college loans.  \n\nNow, my brother had hit hard times because his vices are out of control.  He smokes $100 of weed a week.  Drinks two pints of rum a day ($11), and smokes a pack of cigarettes a day.  That is at least $870 a month.  That is what I make in two weeks.  That is only 1/4 his monthly pay.  I should point out that my brother is fully capable of working but cannot hold down a job because he shows up to work high or drunk.  \n\nHe begged me to live here.  Promised parking space in The garage and that he would build me an apartment in the basement.  \n\nNow, he has hit hard time because of his own vices.  He went to my enabler mother for money.  She told him to raise my rent i stead of drinking less or getting a job.  \n\nThis felt like an utter betrayal to me.  I left my friend\u2019s apartment where i was happy because i was lured with off street parking and an apartment of my own in the future to help him out.  I was doing him a favor.  Helping the family.  \n\nThen my mother starts trying to convince him to raise my rent so he can afford his home and his booze and drugs.  \n\nWhen i found out, I felt betrayed.  I told her to stay out of my finances.  I told her that if she convinces him to raise my rent, i will just get an apartment of my own (you can get them as low as $600 a month around here).  I told her that she can then keep my brother afloat and pay the rent I no longer pay.\n\nThis went over really well.  \n\nAm I the asshole for telling my mother not to counsel my brother/landlord to raise my rent to pay for his drug habits?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author of the given situation is in the wrong for telling his mother to stay out of his finances. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is a 35-year-old man living with his brother, who is a veteran with PTSD, alcoholism, and drug addiction. The brother gets disability payments and makes twice as much as the author. The author pays $400 a month in rent, which is about half the brother's mortgage without property taxes, and gets a small bedroom with access to utilities. The brother's vices cost him around $870 a month, which is about a quarter of his VA pay. The author is saving money and paying off college loans.\n\nThe brother is struggling with his vices and asked their mother to get the author to raise his rent instead of cutting back on spending. The author found out and told his mother to stay out of his finances, saying he would move out if the rent was raised. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nLooking at the details: The author is paying rent, which is a significant portion of the brother's mortgage. The brother's spending on vices is high, and he's not working. The mother's suggestion to raise rent seems to be enabling the brother's bad habits. The author is standing up for himself, protecting his finances, and is willing to move out if the rent increases. \n\nThe key points are consent and boundaries. The author is not obligated to subsidize his brother's lifestyle. The mother's intervention is pushing the author to pay more, which he's not comfortable with. The author is in a position where he can leave if needed. So, he's not in the wrong for setting that boundary. The answer should be B (No).\n"
