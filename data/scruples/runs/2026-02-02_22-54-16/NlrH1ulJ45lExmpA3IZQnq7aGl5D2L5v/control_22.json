I work full time, but make shit money.  My brother is a veteran with PTSD, an alcoholic, and drug addict.  He lives off of disability from the VA.  He gets paid twice as much as I do to play video games and drink all day.  He got his home and mortgage through the VA.  He begged me to leave my roommates and live with him.  I pay rent.  $400/ a month.  Half his mortgage without the property taxes.  Utilities are free.  I get a small bedroom, street parking, and access to the laundry, bathroom, and kitchen.  Its not terrible, and I have been able to save a bit of money and pay off most of my college loans.  \n\nNow, my brother had hit hard times because his vices are out of control.  He smokes $100 of weed a week.  Drinks two pints of rum a day ($11), and smokes a pack of cigarettes a day.  That is at least $870 a month.  That is what I make in two weeks.  That is only 1/4 his monthly pay.  I should point out that my brother is fully capable of working but cannot hold down a job because he shows up to work high or drunk.  \n\nHe begged me to live here.  Promised parking space in The garage and that he would build me an apartment in the basement.  \n\nNow, he has hit hard time because of his own vices.  He went to my enabler mother for money.  She told him to raise my rent i stead of drinking less or getting a job.  \n\nThis felt like an utter betrayal to me.  I left my friend\u2019s apartment where i was happy because i was lured with off street parking and an apartment of my own in the future to help him out.  I was doing him a favor.  Helping the family.  \n\nThen my mother starts trying to convince him to raise my rent so he can afford his home and his booze and drugs.  \n\nWhen i found out, I felt betrayed.  I told her to stay out of my finances.  I told her that if she convinces him to raise my rent, i will just get an apartment of my own (you can get them as low as $600 a month around here).  I told her that she can then keep my brother afloat and pay the rent I no longer pay.\n\nThis went over really well.  \n\nAm I the asshole for telling my mother not to counsel my brother/landlord to raise my rent to pay for his drug habits?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author of the given scenario is in the wrong when they told their mother to stay out of their finances. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, the author is a 35-year-old man living with his brother, who is a veteran with PTSD, alcoholism, and drug addiction. He makes twice as much as the author from disability and uses VA benefits to own a home. The author pays $400 a month in rent, which is half the brother's mortgage without property taxes. The utilities are free, and he's saving money while paying off loans. \n\nThe brother has expensive vices: $870 a month on weed, rum, and cigarettes. The author feels this is more than what he makes in two weeks. The brother had promised a garage parking spot and a basement apartment, but now the mother suggests raising the author's rent to help the brother afford his expenses. The author refuses and threatens to move out if the rent is raised, leading to the question if he's the asshole.\n\nSo, is the author wrong? Let's consider the dynamics. The brother is an adult with his own issues. The author is helping by paying rent, but the mother's suggestion to raise rent for the brother's vices seems unfair. The author is essentially subsidizing his brother's bad habits through increased rent. By refusing, the author is protecting his own finances. \n\nThe brother is capable of work but can't hold a job due to his addictions. The mother's approach doesn't address the root problem (brother's habits) but instead shifts the burden to the author. The author's response is to set a boundary, which is reasonable. People can't be expected to fund others' vices indefinitely. \n\nThe author is not in the wrong because he's standing up for his own financial well-being. The mother's suggestion is exploitative, and the author's threat to move out (which he can afford) is a valid response. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
