I work full time, but make shit money.  My brother is a veteran with PTSD, an alcoholic, and drug addict.  He lives off of disability from the VA.  He gets paid twice as much as I do to play video games and drink all day.  He got his home and mortgage through the VA.  He begged me to leave my roommates and live with him.  I pay rent.  $400/ a month.  Half his mortgage without the property taxes.  Utilities are free.  I get a small bedroom, street parking, and access to the laundry, bathroom, and kitchen.  Its not terrible, and I have been able to save a bit of money and pay off most of my college loans.  \n\nNow, my brother had hit hard times because his vices are out of control.  He smokes $100 of weed a week.  Drinks two pints of rum a day ($11), and smokes a pack of cigarettes a day.  That is at least $870 a month.  That is what I make in two weeks.  That is only 1/4 his monthly pay.  I should point out that my brother is fully capable of working but cannot hold down a job because he shows up to work high or drunk.  \n\nHe begged me to live here.  Promised parking space in The garage and that he would build me an apartment in the basement.  \n\nNow, he has hit hard time because of his own vices.  He went to my enabler mother for money.  She told him to raise my rent i stead of drinking less or getting a job.  \n\nThis felt like an utter betrayal to me.  I left my friend\u2019s apartment where i was happy because i was lured with off street parking and an apartment of my own in the future to help him out.  I was doing him a favor.  Helping the family.  \n\nThen my mother starts trying to convince him to raise my rent so he can afford his home and his booze and drugs.  \n\nWhen i found out, I felt betrayed.  I told her to stay out of my finances.  I told her that if she convinces him to raise my rent, i will just get an apartment of my own (you can get them as low as $600 a month around here).  I told her that she can then keep my brother afloat and pay the rent I no longer pay.\n\nThis went over really well.  \n\nAm I the asshole for telling my mother not to counsel my brother/landlord to raise my rent to pay for his drug habits?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. So, first, I need to understand the situation thoroughly.\n\nThe author is a 35-year-old man living in his brother's home. He pays $400 a month as rent, which is half the brother's mortgage without property taxes. The utilities are free, and he gets a small bedroom, street parking, access to laundry, bathroom, and kitchen. His brother is a veteran with PTSD, an alcoholic, and a drug addict, receiving VA disability. The brother's income is twice what the author makes, but he spends a lot on his vices: $100 weed/week, $11 rum/day, and cigarettes. That adds up to about $870 a month, which is what the author makes in two weeks. The brother is capable of working but can't hold a job because he's high or drunk when he shows up.\n\nThe brother originally asked the author to move in, promising a garage parking spot and a basement apartment in the future. The author did this, thinking it was a favor and helping the family. Now, the brother is in trouble due to his vices and asked the mother for help. She suggested raising the author's rent instead of the brother cutting his expenses. The author told his mother to stay out of his finances and threatened to leave if she pushes for a rent increase. The mother's reaction was not good.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, let's break down the key points. The author is paying rent, but it's significantly lower than market rate (since he mentions getting an apartment for $600). His brother is the landlord and is using the income from the author's rent, which is half the mortgage, to support his own lifestyle. The mother's advice is to increase the rent to cover the brother's expenses, which the author sees as unfair because the brother's vices are the problem. The author is standing up for himself, setting boundaries, and not wanting to subsidize his brother's habits.\n\nFrom a fairness perspective, the author is paying a fair amount already. The brother's disability payments are meant for his own living expenses. The mother's suggestion to raise the author's rent to cover the brother's vices is problematic because the author shouldn't be responsible for his brother's spending. The brother's inability to manage his finances is his own issue, not the author's. The author is just trying to maintain his current living situation without being taken advantage of.\n\nAlso, the brother's promises of building a basement apartment and garage parking haven't been fulfilled. The author was lured under false pretenses. Now, after moving in, the brother is asking for more money from the author, which the author is rightly objecting to. The author is not in a position to support his brother's lifestyle, especially when he's struggling financially himself. \n\nThe mother's role as an enabler is important here. If she keeps enabling her son's vices by suggesting the author pay more, it doesn't help the brother address his addiction issues. The author's stance is about personal responsibility and boundaries. He's not the one with the financial problems; his brother is, due to his own choices. The author is just trying to protect his own finances.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author is not in the wrong. He's being reasonable in setting limits and holding his brother accountable for his own actions. Therefore, the answer is B (No).\n"
