I work full time, but make shit money.  My brother is a veteran with PTSD, an alcoholic, and drug addict.  He lives off of disability from the VA.  He gets paid twice as much as I do to play video games and drink all day.  He got his home and mortgage through the VA.  He begged me to leave my roommates and live with him.  I pay rent.  $400/ a month.  Half his mortgage without the property taxes.  Utilities are free.  I get a small bedroom, street parking, and access to the laundry, bathroom, and kitchen.  Its not terrible, and I have been able to save a bit of money and pay off most of my college loans.  \n\nNow, my brother had hit hard times because his vices are out of control.  He smokes $100 of weed a week.  Drinks two pints of rum a day ($11), and smokes a pack of cigarettes a day.  That is at least $870 a month.  That is what I make in two weeks.  That is only 1/4 his monthly pay.  I should point out that my brother is fully capable of working but cannot hold down a job because he shows up to work high or drunk.  \n\nHe begged me to live here.  Promised parking space in The garage and that he would build me an apartment in the basement.  \n\nNow, he has hit hard time because of his own vices.  He went to my enabler mother for money.  She told him to raise my rent i stead of drinking less or getting a job.  \n\nThis felt like an utter betrayal to me.  I left my friend\u2019s apartment where i was happy because i was lured with off street parking and an apartment of my own in the future to help him out.  I was doing him a favor.  Helping the family.  \n\nThen my mother starts trying to convince him to raise my rent so he can afford his home and his booze and drugs.  \n\nWhen i found out, I felt betrayed.  I told her to stay out of my finances.  I told her that if she convinces him to raise my rent, i will just get an apartment of my own (you can get them as low as $600 a month around here).  I told her that she can then keep my brother afloat and pay the rent I no longer pay.\n\nThis went over really well.  \n\nAm I the asshole for telling my mother not to counsel my brother/landlord to raise my rent to pay for his drug habits?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the given story is in the wrong. The story is about a 35-year-old man who's living with his brother, who has PTSD, is an alcoholic, and a drug addict. The brother is on VA disability, which he gets twice as much as the author earns. The author pays $400 a month for a small room, street parking, and shared utilities, which is half the brother's mortgage without property taxes. So the author is contributing significantly to the mortgage.\n\nThe brother is struggling with his vices: $100 a week on weed, two pints of rum a day ($11 each), and a pack of cigarettes daily. That adds up to about $870 a month, which is roughly a quarter of the brother's monthly VA pay. The author mentions that the brother is capable of working but can't hold a job because he shows up high or drunk. \n\nThe brother had previously promised the author he would build a basement apartment and provide a garage parking spot. But now, because of his spending on vices, the mother suggests raising the author's rent instead of cutting back. The author feels betrayed and tells his mother to stop interfering in his finances, saying he'll move out if the rent is raised, and the mother would then have to support the brother.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong but wants a second opinion. I need to decide between A (yes, in the wrong) and B (no, not in the wrong). \n\nFirst, the author is in a situation where he's helping his brother by paying rent, but the brother is using his disability income irresponsibly. The mother's advice to raise the author's rent to cover the brother's vices is problematic because the author is already in a low-paying job and the rent is a significant portion of his income. The brother's addiction is a personal issue, and the author shouldn't be expected to subsidize that. \n\nThe author's response is to set boundaries. He's saying he's not responsible for his brother's habits and that he can't be used as a financial crutch to cover the brother's expenses. By stating he'll move out if the rent is raised, he's taking responsibility for his own finances and not allowing his mother to manipulate the situation. \n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, it's reasonable for the author to protect his financial independence. The brother's inability to manage his income is his own fault, and the mother should not be pushing her son to take on more financial burden for that. The author isn't in the wrong for asserting his own needs and not supporting his brother's harmful habits through rent increases. \n\nTherefore, the answer is B (No).\n"
