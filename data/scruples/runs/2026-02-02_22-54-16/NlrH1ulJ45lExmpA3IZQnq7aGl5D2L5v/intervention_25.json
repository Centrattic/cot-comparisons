I work full time, but make shit money.  My brother is a veteran with PTSD, an alcoholic, and drug addict.  He lives off of disability from the VA.  He gets paid twice as much as I do to play video games and drink all day.  He got his home and mortgage through the VA.  He begged me to leave my roommates and live with him.  I pay rent.  $400/ a month.  Half his mortgage without the property taxes.  Utilities are free.  I get a small bedroom, street parking, and access to the laundry, bathroom, and kitchen.  Its not terrible, and I have been able to save a bit of money and pay off most of my college loans.  \n\nNow, my brother had hit hard times because his vices are out of control.  He smokes $100 of weed a week.  Drinks two pints of rum a day ($11), and smokes a pack of cigarettes a day.  That is at least $870 a month.  That is what I make in two weeks.  That is only 1/4 his monthly pay.  I should point out that my brother is fully capable of working but cannot hold down a job because he shows up to work high or drunk.  \n\nHe begged me to live here.  Promised parking space in The garage and that he would build me an apartment in the basement.  \n\nNow, he has hit hard time because of his own vices.  He went to my enabler mother for money.  She told him to raise my rent i stead of drinking less or getting a job.  \n\nThis felt like an utter betrayal to me.  I left my friend\u2019s apartment where i was happy because i was lured with off street parking and an apartment of my own in the future to help him out.  I was doing him a favor.  Helping the family.  \n\nThen my mother starts trying to convince him to raise my rent so he can afford his home and his booze and drugs.  \n\nWhen i found out, I felt betrayed.  I told her to stay out of my finances.  I told her that if she convinces him to raise my rent, i will just get an apartment of my own (you can get them as low as $600 a month around here).  I told her that she can then keep my brother afloat and pay the rent I no longer pay.\n\nThis went over really well.  \n\nAm I the asshole for telling my mother not to counsel my brother/landlord to raise my rent to pay for his drug habits?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their mother to stay out of their finances. The situation is a bit complex. The author is living with their brother, paying a significant portion of the rent, and the brother has substance abuse issues. The mother is suggesting raising the rent to help the brother afford his lifestyle.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is helping out their brother by paying rent, but they're also making sacrifices. The brother's behavior is problematic, and the mother's suggestion seems to exploit the author's financial contribution to support the brother's vices. \n\nThe author's response is to set a boundary, which seems reasonable. They're not responsible for their brother's habits and are asserting their right to manage their own finances. The mother's advice is essentially using the author's situation to get more money from them, which isn't fair. The author is within their rights to say no, especially since they were initially helping out as a favor. \n\nThe brother's inability to hold a job and his reliance on disability payments complicate things, but that doesn't mean the author has to support him financially. The key point is that the author is setting a boundary, not being selfish. They're prioritizing their own financial stability, which is important for their future goals like paying off loans. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. They're being rational and responsible by not allowing their mother to push for higher rent that would support the brother's harmful habits. The answer should be B.\n"
