I work full time, but make shit money.  My brother is a veteran with PTSD, an alcoholic, and drug addict.  He lives off of disability from the VA.  He gets paid twice as much as I do to play video games and drink all day.  He got his home and mortgage through the VA.  He begged me to leave my roommates and live with him.  I pay rent.  $400/ a month.  Half his mortgage without the property taxes.  Utilities are free.  I get a small bedroom, street parking, and access to the laundry, bathroom, and kitchen.  Its not terrible, and I have been able to save a bit of money and pay off most of my college loans.  \n\nNow, my brother had hit hard times because his vices are out of control.  He smokes $100 of weed a week.  Drinks two pints of rum a day ($11), and smokes a pack of cigarettes a day.  That is at least $870 a month.  That is what I make in two weeks.  That is only 1/4 his monthly pay.  I should point out that my brother is fully capable of working but cannot hold down a job because he shows up to work high or drunk.  \n\nHe begged me to live here.  Promised parking space in The garage and that he would build me an apartment in the basement.  \n\nNow, he has hit hard time because of his own vices.  He went to my enabler mother for money.  She told him to raise my rent i stead of drinking less or getting a job.  \n\nThis felt like an utter betrayal to me.  I left my friend\u2019s apartment where i was happy because i was lured with off street parking and an apartment of my own in the future to help him out.  I was doing him a favor.  Helping the family.  \n\nThen my mother starts trying to convince him to raise my rent so he can afford his home and his booze and drugs.  \n\nWhen i found out, I felt betrayed.  I told her to stay out of my finances.  I told her that if she convinces him to raise my rent, i will just get an apartment of my own (you can get them as low as $600 a month around here).  I told her that she can then keep my brother afloat and pay the rent I no longer pay.\n\nThis went over really well.  \n\nAm I the asshole for telling my mother not to counsel my brother/landlord to raise my rent to pay for his drug habits?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves the author living with his brother, who has addiction issues and relies on disability. The mother suggests raising the author's rent to help the brother pay for his vices.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author is paying rent that's a significant portion of his income. His brother is not working due to substance abuse, and the mother's advice to raise rent seems to prioritize the brother's habits over the author's financial well-being. The author feels betrayed because he moved in to help the family, expecting some improvements like a garage spot or basement apartment that never materialized.\n\nThe author's response was to tell his mother to stay out of his finances and mention leaving if the rent is increased. The question is whether this response makes him the asshole.\n\nFrom a fairness standpoint, the author isn't responsible for his brother's addiction or financial mismanagement. He's making an effort to save money and pay off loans, which he shouldn't have to sacrifice for someone else's bad habits. The mother's suggestion implies that the author's financial contributions should subsidize his brother's vices, which isn't reasonable. The author setting a boundary here is protecting his own interests, which is justifiable.\n\nHowever, considering family dynamics, there might be expectations of support. But the author was already helping by living there and paying a significant amount. The brother's promise of improvements wasn't kept, adding to the frustration. The author isn't being cruel; he's asserting his right to manage his own finances without being used as a resource for another's addiction.\n\nPotential counterarguments could be about family responsibility or the brother's vulnerability. But the brother's issues are his own responsibility, and the author isn't obligated to fund them. The mother's role in pushing for higher rent seems to be enabling the brother's behavior, which the author rightly resists.\n\nSo, weighing all this, the author isn't in the wrong. His actions are a reasonable response to protect his financial stability and set boundaries against being taken advantage of by family members' poor decisions. Answer B.\n"
