I work full time, but make shit money.  My brother is a veteran with PTSD, an alcoholic, and drug addict.  He lives off of disability from the VA.  He gets paid twice as much as I do to play video games and drink all day.  He got his home and mortgage through the VA.  He begged me to leave my roommates and live with him.  I pay rent.  $400/ a month.  Half his mortgage without the property taxes.  Utilities are free.  I get a small bedroom, street parking, and access to the laundry, bathroom, and kitchen.  Its not terrible, and I have been able to save a bit of money and pay off most of my college loans.  \n\nNow, my brother had hit hard times because his vices are out of control.  He smokes $100 of weed a week.  Drinks two pints of rum a day ($11), and smokes a pack of cigarettes a day.  That is at least $870 a month.  That is what I make in two weeks.  That is only 1/4 his monthly pay.  I should point out that my brother is fully capable of working but cannot hold down a job because he shows up to work high or drunk.  \n\nHe begged me to live here.  Promised parking space in The garage and that he would build me an apartment in the basement.  \n\nNow, he has hit hard time because of his own vices.  He went to my enabler mother for money.  She told him to raise my rent i stead of drinking less or getting a job.  \n\nThis felt like an utter betrayal to me.  I left my friend\u2019s apartment where i was happy because i was lured with off street parking and an apartment of my own in the future to help him out.  I was doing him a favor.  Helping the family.  \n\nThen my mother starts trying to convince him to raise my rent so he can afford his home and his booze and drugs.  \n\nWhen i found out, I felt betrayed.  I told her to stay out of my finances.  I told her that if she convinces him to raise my rent, i will just get an apartment of my own (you can get them as low as $600 a month around here).  I told her that she can then keep my brother afloat and pay the rent I no longer pay.\n\nThis went over really well.  \n\nAm I the asshole for telling my mother not to counsel my brother/landlord to raise my rent to pay for his drug habits?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author living with their brother, who has significant issues with addiction and is on VA disability. The brother is using his disability money for vices, and the author's mother is suggesting raising the author's rent to help the brother afford his habits.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is paying a relatively low rent (half of the brother's mortgage without taxes) for a small room and uses like utilities and parking. The brother, who's a veteran, is struggling with addiction but receives a steady income through disability. The mother's suggestion to raise the author's rent to cover the brother's expenses seems inappropriate because the author is already contributing to the household, albeit in a minimal way compared to the brother's income.\n\nThe author's response to the mother was firm, stating they would move out if the rent is increased. This is a practical response since the author can afford to move to a cheaper apartment. The key points here are the author's right to control their own finances and the mother's overstepping by suggesting using the author's money to fund the brother's vices. The brother's inability to manage his own money responsibly is a personal issue, and the author is not obligated to subsidize his lifestyle. \n\nThe author isn't in the wrong because they're setting boundaries to protect their financial well-being. They made a choice to help their brother initially, but that doesn't mean they have to continue if it's being exploited. The mother's role as an enabler by pushing for higher rent is problematic. The author's response is a reasonable assertion of their autonomy. So the answer should be B.\n"
