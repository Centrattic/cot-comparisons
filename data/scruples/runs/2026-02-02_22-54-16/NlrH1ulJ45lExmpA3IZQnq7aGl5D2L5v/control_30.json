I work full time, but make shit money.  My brother is a veteran with PTSD, an alcoholic, and drug addict.  He lives off of disability from the VA.  He gets paid twice as much as I do to play video games and drink all day.  He got his home and mortgage through the VA.  He begged me to leave my roommates and live with him.  I pay rent.  $400/ a month.  Half his mortgage without the property taxes.  Utilities are free.  I get a small bedroom, street parking, and access to the laundry, bathroom, and kitchen.  Its not terrible, and I have been able to save a bit of money and pay off most of my college loans.  \n\nNow, my brother had hit hard times because his vices are out of control.  He smokes $100 of weed a week.  Drinks two pints of rum a day ($11), and smokes a pack of cigarettes a day.  That is at least $870 a month.  That is what I make in two weeks.  That is only 1/4 his monthly pay.  I should point out that my brother is fully capable of working but cannot hold down a job because he shows up to work high or drunk.  \n\nHe begged me to live here.  Promised parking space in The garage and that he would build me an apartment in the basement.  \n\nNow, he has hit hard time because of his own vices.  He went to my enabler mother for money.  She told him to raise my rent i stead of drinking less or getting a job.  \n\nThis felt like an utter betrayal to me.  I left my friend\u2019s apartment where i was happy because i was lured with off street parking and an apartment of my own in the future to help him out.  I was doing him a favor.  Helping the family.  \n\nThen my mother starts trying to convince him to raise my rent so he can afford his home and his booze and drugs.  \n\nWhen i found out, I felt betrayed.  I told her to stay out of my finances.  I told her that if she convinces him to raise my rent, i will just get an apartment of my own (you can get them as low as $600 a month around here).  I told her that she can then keep my brother afloat and pay the rent I no longer pay.\n\nThis went over really well.  \n\nAm I the asshole for telling my mother not to counsel my brother/landlord to raise my rent to pay for his drug habits?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. Let's look at the situation step by step.\n\nFirst, the author is a 35-year-old man living in his brother's home. His brother is a veteran with PTSD, an alcoholic, and a drug addict. The brother lives off VA disability and has a mortgage through the VA. The author moved in with his brother after his brother convinced him by promising a garage parking space and a future basement apartment. The author pays $400 a month in rent, which is half the brother's mortgage without property taxes. The utilities are free, and the author has a small bedroom. Despite the brother's issues, the author is saving money and paying off his student loans.\n\nNow, the brother's vices are costing him a lot\u2014weed, rum, cigarettes add up to $870 a month, which is about a quarter of his VA pay. The author makes that in two weeks. The brother is capable of working but can't hold down a job due to his addictions. The brother went to the author's mother for help, and the mother suggested raising the author's rent instead of the brother cutting his vices. The author felt betrayed because he moved in to help the family. When the mother tried to push for a rent increase, the author told her to stay out of his finances and threatened to move out if the rent was raised, saying the mother would have to cover the rent he stops paying.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nLet's consider the key points. The author is in a situation where he's helping out his brother by paying rent, which is a significant portion of the brother's income. The brother's financial problems are due to his own addictions. The mother's suggestion to raise rent seems to be enabling the brother's habits rather than addressing the root issues. The author is standing up for his own financial stability and setting boundaries. \n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, the author is not obligated to subsidize his brother's drug and alcohol habits. He's already paying a substantial amount, and the mother's advice is essentially asking him to pay more so the brother can maintain his lifestyle. The author's response\u2014telling his mother to stay out of it and threatening to move out\u2014is a way to protect his own interests. \n\nThe brother is an adult, even if he has issues. The author isn't responsible for his brother's choices. The mother's role as an enabler is problematic because she's not encouraging the brother to seek help or cut down on his spending. The author's financial independence and his ability to move out if needed (as apartments are available for $600) give him a reasonable option to leave without being stuck in a bad situation.\n\nIn summary, the author isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries and prioritizing his own finances over his brother's vices. The mother's suggestion is enabling the brother's harmful behavior, and the author is right to push back. So the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
