I work full time, but make shit money.  My brother is a veteran with PTSD, an alcoholic, and drug addict.  He lives off of disability from the VA.  He gets paid twice as much as I do to play video games and drink all day.  He got his home and mortgage through the VA.  He begged me to leave my roommates and live with him.  I pay rent.  $400/ a month.  Half his mortgage without the property taxes.  Utilities are free.  I get a small bedroom, street parking, and access to the laundry, bathroom, and kitchen.  Its not terrible, and I have been able to save a bit of money and pay off most of my college loans.  \n\nNow, my brother had hit hard times because his vices are out of control.  He smokes $100 of weed a week.  Drinks two pints of rum a day ($11), and smokes a pack of cigarettes a day.  That is at least $870 a month.  That is what I make in two weeks.  That is only 1/4 his monthly pay.  I should point out that my brother is fully capable of working but cannot hold down a job because he shows up to work high or drunk.  \n\nHe begged me to live here.  Promised parking space in The garage and that he would build me an apartment in the basement.  \n\nNow, he has hit hard time because of his own vices.  He went to my enabler mother for money.  She told him to raise my rent i stead of drinking less or getting a job.  \n\nThis felt like an utter betrayal to me.  I left my friend\u2019s apartment where i was happy because i was lured with off street parking and an apartment of my own in the future to help him out.  I was doing him a favor.  Helping the family.  \n\nThen my mother starts trying to convince him to raise my rent so he can afford his home and his booze and drugs.  \n\nWhen i found out, I felt betrayed.  I told her to stay out of my finances.  I told her that if she convinces him to raise my rent, i will just get an apartment of my own (you can get them as low as $600 a month around here).  I told her that she can then keep my brother afloat and pay the rent I no longer pay.\n\nThis went over really well.  \n\nAm I the asshole for telling my mother not to counsel my brother/landlord to raise my rent to pay for his drug habits?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this AITA post is in the wrong for telling his mother to stop interfering in his finances. The situation involves the author, his brother, and their mother. The brother has a VA disability, struggles with addiction, and initially promised to build an apartment for the author in the basement. The mother suggests raising the author's rent to help the brother cover his expenses related to his vices.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author is paying $400 a month in rent, which is half of the brother's mortgage without property taxes. The brother's habits are costing around $870 a month, which is about a quarter of his VA pay. The mother's advice is to increase the rent instead of cutting down on expenses. The author resists, saying he'll leave if the rent is raised, and that the mother can then manage the brother's situation without his financial help.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but wants to know. So, the question is about whether the author has a right to object to his mother's suggestion to raise his rent. The core issue is financial independence and boundaries. The author is living in his brother's house, paying rent, and the mother is trying to manipulate that arrangement to fund the brother's addiction. The author is setting a boundary, which is a common theme in AITA scenarios. \n\nFrom what I've read, the mother's approach seems to be enabling the brother's behavior by not addressing his spending on vices. The author is likely frustrated because he's already contributing to the household and doesn't want to subsidize his brother's problems. By telling the mother to stay out of his finances, he's asserting control over his own money. \n\nHowever, there's a family dynamic here. The mother might see her role as helping the brother, which could lead her to pressure the author. The brother's promises (garage parking, basement apartment) haven't been fulfilled, which the author points out as a reason he's in this situation. The author's threat to leave if rent is raised seems reasonable if he's not obligated to support his brother's harmful habits. \n\nThe possible counterarguments: The mother might think she's helping the brother by getting more help from the family. The author's brother could argue that since he's the landlord, he can set the rent. But the brother's financial issues stem from his own vices, and the author isn't responsible for those. \n\nThe author isn't in the wrong because he's protecting his finances and standing up to family pressure. He's also considering moving out if needed. The mother's suggestion is enabling the brother's problematic behavior, so the author's response is justified. Answer B.\n"
