I work full time, but make shit money.  My brother is a veteran with PTSD, an alcoholic, and drug addict.  He lives off of disability from the VA.  He gets paid twice as much as I do to play video games and drink all day.  He got his home and mortgage through the VA.  He begged me to leave my roommates and live with him.  I pay rent.  $400/ a month.  Half his mortgage without the property taxes.  Utilities are free.  I get a small bedroom, street parking, and access to the laundry, bathroom, and kitchen.  Its not terrible, and I have been able to save a bit of money and pay off most of my college loans.  \n\nNow, my brother had hit hard times because his vices are out of control.  He smokes $100 of weed a week.  Drinks two pints of rum a day ($11), and smokes a pack of cigarettes a day.  That is at least $870 a month.  That is what I make in two weeks.  That is only 1/4 his monthly pay.  I should point out that my brother is fully capable of working but cannot hold down a job because he shows up to work high or drunk.  \n\nHe begged me to live here.  Promised parking space in The garage and that he would build me an apartment in the basement.  \n\nNow, he has hit hard time because of his own vices.  He went to my enabler mother for money.  She told him to raise my rent i stead of drinking less or getting a job.  \n\nThis felt like an utter betrayal to me.  I left my friend\u2019s apartment where i was happy because i was lured with off street parking and an apartment of my own in the future to help him out.  I was doing him a favor.  Helping the family.  \n\nThen my mother starts trying to convince him to raise my rent so he can afford his home and his booze and drugs.  \n\nWhen i found out, I felt betrayed.  I told her to stay out of my finances.  I told her that if she convinces him to raise my rent, i will just get an apartment of my own (you can get them as low as $600 a month around here).  I told her that she can then keep my brother afloat and pay the rent I no longer pay.\n\nThis went over really well.  \n\nAm I the asshole for telling my mother not to counsel my brother/landlord to raise my rent to pay for his drug habits?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is a 35-year-old man living in his brother's home. He pays $400 a month in rent, which is half the mortgage without property taxes, and utilities are free. His brother is a veteran with PTSD, alcoholism, and drug addiction, receiving VA disability. The brother promised a garage parking space and a basement apartment in exchange for him moving in, but now the brother is struggling financially because of his vices. The mother, as an enabler, suggested raising the son's rent so the brother can afford his expenses. The son told his mother to stay out of his finances and threatened to move out if she pushed for a rent increase.\n\nFirst, the son is paying a significant portion of the mortgage. The brother's income is from disability, which is meant to cover his needs. The mother's advice seems to be enabling the brother's addiction by expecting the son to pay more so the brother can continue his habits. The son is essentially being asked to subsidize his brother's lifestyle, which is problematic. \n\nThe son has a right to his financial autonomy. The brother's inability to manage his money due to addiction isn't the son's responsibility. The son is already paying rent, and the mother's suggestion to raise it further for the brother's vices could be seen as unfair. The threat to move out if the rent is increased is a logical step, as he's not willing to take on more financial burden. \n\nThe brother's promises (garage parking, basement apartment) haven't materialized, so the son's initial decision to move in might have been based on unfulfilled commitments. The brother's addiction is affecting his ability to work, but the son isn't at fault for that. The mother's role as an enabler might be complicating the situation, but the son's stance on his finances is justifiable. \n\nNo clear rules about family responsibilities, but the son isn't obligated to support his brother's addiction. The answer is B.\n"
