I work full time, but make shit money.  My brother is a veteran with PTSD, an alcoholic, and drug addict.  He lives off of disability from the VA.  He gets paid twice as much as I do to play video games and drink all day.  He got his home and mortgage through the VA.  He begged me to leave my roommates and live with him.  I pay rent.  $400/ a month.  Half his mortgage without the property taxes.  Utilities are free.  I get a small bedroom, street parking, and access to the laundry, bathroom, and kitchen.  Its not terrible, and I have been able to save a bit of money and pay off most of my college loans.  \n\nNow, my brother had hit hard times because his vices are out of control.  He smokes $100 of weed a week.  Drinks two pints of rum a day ($11), and smokes a pack of cigarettes a day.  That is at least $870 a month.  That is what I make in two weeks.  That is only 1/4 his monthly pay.  I should point out that my brother is fully capable of working but cannot hold down a job because he shows up to work high or drunk.  \n\nHe begged me to live here.  Promised parking space in The garage and that he would build me an apartment in the basement.  \n\nNow, he has hit hard time because of his own vices.  He went to my enabler mother for money.  She told him to raise my rent i stead of drinking less or getting a job.  \n\nThis felt like an utter betrayal to me.  I left my friend\u2019s apartment where i was happy because i was lured with off street parking and an apartment of my own in the future to help him out.  I was doing him a favor.  Helping the family.  \n\nThen my mother starts trying to convince him to raise my rent so he can afford his home and his booze and drugs.  \n\nWhen i found out, I felt betrayed.  I told her to stay out of my finances.  I told her that if she convinces him to raise my rent, i will just get an apartment of my own (you can get them as low as $600 a month around here).  I told her that she can then keep my brother afloat and pay the rent I no longer pay.\n\nThis went over really well.  \n\nAm I the asshole for telling my mother not to counsel my brother/landlord to raise my rent to pay for his drug habits?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about family dynamics and finances.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The author is 35, living with his brother who's a veteran with PTSD, alcoholism, and drug addiction. The brother is on VA disability, which pays twice as much as the author's salary. The author pays $400 a month in rent, which is half the brother's mortgage without property taxes. The brother's vices cost him about $870 a month, which is a significant portion of his income. The mother suggests raising the rent to help the brother afford his expenses, but the author refuses, telling the mother to stay out of his finances.\n\nThe key points here: the author is contributing to the household, paying rent, and trying to save and pay off loans. The brother is struggling with addiction and can't hold a job. The mother's suggestion to increase rent is to help the brother with his addiction costs. The author feels this is a betrayal because he moved in to help, expecting future benefits like a basement apartment. Now, he's pushing back against the rent increase.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Let's think. The mother is trying to help her son (the author's brother) by suggesting a way to manage finances. However, the author is paying rent and might feel exploited. The brother's addiction is a problem, but the mother's solution is to increase the rent, which could add pressure on the author. The author is making a living with a lower income and is trying to save. He's not obligated to support his brother's drug habits through higher rent. The brother's addiction is his own issue, and the author is setting boundaries. The mother's suggestion might not be fair, as it's asking the author to subsidize the brother's vices. The author's response to refuse and perhaps leave if the rent is increased seems reasonable as he's protecting his own financial stability. So, the author isn't in the wrong here. Answer B.\n"
