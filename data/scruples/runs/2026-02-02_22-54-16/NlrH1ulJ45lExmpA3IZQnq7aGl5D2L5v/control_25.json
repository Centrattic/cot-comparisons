I work full time, but make shit money.  My brother is a veteran with PTSD, an alcoholic, and drug addict.  He lives off of disability from the VA.  He gets paid twice as much as I do to play video games and drink all day.  He got his home and mortgage through the VA.  He begged me to leave my roommates and live with him.  I pay rent.  $400/ a month.  Half his mortgage without the property taxes.  Utilities are free.  I get a small bedroom, street parking, and access to the laundry, bathroom, and kitchen.  Its not terrible, and I have been able to save a bit of money and pay off most of my college loans.  \n\nNow, my brother had hit hard times because his vices are out of control.  He smokes $100 of weed a week.  Drinks two pints of rum a day ($11), and smokes a pack of cigarettes a day.  That is at least $870 a month.  That is what I make in two weeks.  That is only 1/4 his monthly pay.  I should point out that my brother is fully capable of working but cannot hold down a job because he shows up to work high or drunk.  \n\nHe begged me to live here.  Promised parking space in The garage and that he would build me an apartment in the basement.  \n\nNow, he has hit hard time because of his own vices.  He went to my enabler mother for money.  She told him to raise my rent i stead of drinking less or getting a job.  \n\nThis felt like an utter betrayal to me.  I left my friend\u2019s apartment where i was happy because i was lured with off street parking and an apartment of my own in the future to help him out.  I was doing him a favor.  Helping the family.  \n\nThen my mother starts trying to convince him to raise my rent so he can afford his home and his booze and drugs.  \n\nWhen i found out, I felt betrayed.  I told her to stay out of my finances.  I told her that if she convinces him to raise my rent, i will just get an apartment of my own (you can get them as low as $600 a month around here).  I told her that she can then keep my brother afloat and pay the rent I no longer pay.\n\nThis went over really well.  \n\nAm I the asshole for telling my mother not to counsel my brother/landlord to raise my rent to pay for his drug habits?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The author is a 35-year-old man living with his brother, a veteran with PTSD, alcoholism, and drug addiction. The brother receives VA disability and uses the money for vices, while the author pays rent but finds it's a significant portion of his income.\n\nThe key issue here is the mother convincing the brother to raise the rent. The author feels betrayed and tells his mother to stay out of his finances. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for doing so.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author chose to live with his brother, possibly to help out, given the brother's situation. He's working a full-time job with low pay, managing to save and pay off loans. The brother's expenses on drugs and alcohol are high, and the mother suggests increasing the rent instead of addressing his vices.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the author is protecting his own financial stability. If the rent goes up, it could strain his already limited income. He's also setting boundaries with his family, which is reasonable. The brother's habits are self-destructive, and the mother's advice doesn't address the root problem but shifts the burden onto the author.\n\nHowever, some might argue that as family, the author should support his brother despite the challenges. But the author is already contributing by living there and paying rent. The mother's suggestion to raise rent is not helping the brother's addiction but enabling it further. The author's response to set a limit and leave if necessary is a self-preservation tactic.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that he was lured to move in with promises like garage parking and a basement apartment. The brother hasn't delivered on those promises, adding to the betrayal. The author's decision to prioritize his own well-being and financial security seems justified.\n\nIn conclusion, the author is not in the wrong. He's taking responsibility for his own situation and setting boundaries, which is necessary given the circumstances. The mother's approach is enabling the brother's harmful behavior without addressing the core issues.\n"
