I work full time, but make shit money.  My brother is a veteran with PTSD, an alcoholic, and drug addict.  He lives off of disability from the VA.  He gets paid twice as much as I do to play video games and drink all day.  He got his home and mortgage through the VA.  He begged me to leave my roommates and live with him.  I pay rent.  $400/ a month.  Half his mortgage without the property taxes.  Utilities are free.  I get a small bedroom, street parking, and access to the laundry, bathroom, and kitchen.  Its not terrible, and I have been able to save a bit of money and pay off most of my college loans.  \n\nNow, my brother had hit hard times because his vices are out of control.  He smokes $100 of weed a week.  Drinks two pints of rum a day ($11), and smokes a pack of cigarettes a day.  That is at least $870 a month.  That is what I make in two weeks.  That is only 1/4 his monthly pay.  I should point out that my brother is fully capable of working but cannot hold down a job because he shows up to work high or drunk.  \n\nHe begged me to live here.  Promised parking space in The garage and that he would build me an apartment in the basement.  \n\nNow, he has hit hard time because of his own vices.  He went to my enabler mother for money.  She told him to raise my rent i stead of drinking less or getting a job.  \n\nThis felt like an utter betrayal to me.  I left my friend\u2019s apartment where i was happy because i was lured with off street parking and an apartment of my own in the future to help him out.  I was doing him a favor.  Helping the family.  \n\nThen my mother starts trying to convince him to raise my rent so he can afford his home and his booze and drugs.  \n\nWhen i found out, I felt betrayed.  I told her to stay out of my finances.  I told her that if she convinces him to raise my rent, i will just get an apartment of my own (you can get them as low as $600 a month around here).  I told her that she can then keep my brother afloat and pay the rent I no longer pay.\n\nThis went over really well.  \n\nAm I the asshole for telling my mother not to counsel my brother/landlord to raise my rent to pay for his drug habits?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling his mother to stay out of his finances. The situation is that the author is living with his brother, who has addiction issues and is getting money from their mother to raise the rent to support his vices.\n\nFirst, the author is paying rent, which is a significant portion of his brother's income. The brother is on disability, so he's not working, and spends a lot on drugs and alcohol. The mother suggests increasing the rent to help the brother pay for his habits. The author feels this is unfair since he's already helping out by living there for a lower rate compared to other apartments. He's also paying off loans and saving money, which is his own financial goal.\n\nThe key points here are about boundaries and mutual support. The author moved in to help his brother, but the brother isn't reciprocating by managing his own spending. The mother's suggestion might be coming from a place of trying to help the brother, but it's using the author's situation to cover the brother's expenses. The author is setting a boundary to protect his own finances, which is reasonable. It's important to consider that the author isn't responsible for his brother's addiction and shouldn't have to subsidize it. The mother's approach is not addressing the root problem (the brother's addiction) but shifting the burden onto the author. \n\nThe author's response was to set a limit, which is a healthy approach. He's not in the wrong for asserting his own financial needs and refusing to be used as a financial support system for the brother's vices. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
