I work full time, but make shit money.  My brother is a veteran with PTSD, an alcoholic, and drug addict.  He lives off of disability from the VA.  He gets paid twice as much as I do to play video games and drink all day.  He got his home and mortgage through the VA.  He begged me to leave my roommates and live with him.  I pay rent.  $400/ a month.  Half his mortgage without the property taxes.  Utilities are free.  I get a small bedroom, street parking, and access to the laundry, bathroom, and kitchen.  Its not terrible, and I have been able to save a bit of money and pay off most of my college loans.  \n\nNow, my brother had hit hard times because his vices are out of control.  He smokes $100 of weed a week.  Drinks two pints of rum a day ($11), and smokes a pack of cigarettes a day.  That is at least $870 a month.  That is what I make in two weeks.  That is only 1/4 his monthly pay.  I should point out that my brother is fully capable of working but cannot hold down a job because he shows up to work high or drunk.  \n\nHe begged me to live here.  Promised parking space in The garage and that he would build me an apartment in the basement.  \n\nNow, he has hit hard time because of his own vices.  He went to my enabler mother for money.  She told him to raise my rent i stead of drinking less or getting a job.  \n\nThis felt like an utter betrayal to me.  I left my friend\u2019s apartment where i was happy because i was lured with off street parking and an apartment of my own in the future to help him out.  I was doing him a favor.  Helping the family.  \n\nThen my mother starts trying to convince him to raise my rent so he can afford his home and his booze and drugs.  \n\nWhen i found out, I felt betrayed.  I told her to stay out of my finances.  I told her that if she convinces him to raise my rent, i will just get an apartment of my own (you can get them as low as $600 a month around here).  I told her that she can then keep my brother afloat and pay the rent I no longer pay.\n\nThis went over really well.  \n\nAm I the asshole for telling my mother not to counsel my brother/landlord to raise my rent to pay for his drug habits?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for telling his mother to stay out of his finances. The situation involves the author living with his brother, who has a VA disability, and the mother suggesting increasing the rent to help the brother pay for his vices.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author is paying $400/month for a small room, which is half of his brother's mortgage without taxes. The brother has addiction issues and isn't working. The mother suggests raising the rent to help the brother cover his expenses, but the author refuses, feeling it's unfair since he's already contributing a significant amount relative to his income. The author argues that he's already helping by living there, and he's not responsible for his brother's habits.\n\nThe author feels betrayed because he left his previous apartment to help his brother, expecting some benefits like garage parking and a basement apartment. Now, the mother's suggestion is seen as a betrayal since it's putting more financial pressure on him to support the brother's lifestyle.\n\nI need to evaluate if the author is wrong. From a fairness perspective, the author is paying a significant portion of the rent (half the mortgage), which is a considerable amount given his low income. The brother's habits are causing financial strain, but the author isn't responsible for fixing that by raising the rent. The author is also trying to save and pay off loans, so increasing rent would hinder his financial goals.\n\nThe mother's approach might be coming from a place of trying to help the brother, but she's shifting the burden onto her son. The author is setting a boundary, which is reasonable. He's not obligated to support his brother's lifestyle through higher rent. The brother's responsibility is to manage his own expenses, not pass them on to others. The author's threat to move out if the rent is raised is a logical response to protect his finances.\n\nHowever, there's a family dynamic here. The mother might feel she's helping both the brother and the author by suggesting the rent increase, but she's not considering the author's financial limits. The brother's actions are self-destructive, and the mother's advice could be enabling by not holding him accountable for his habits.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong for asserting his financial boundaries. He's prioritizing his own stability and isn't responsible for his brother's choices. The mother's suggestion is imposing an unfair financial burden, and the author's refusal is a reasonable self-defense.\n"
