I work full time, but make shit money.  My brother is a veteran with PTSD, an alcoholic, and drug addict.  He lives off of disability from the VA.  He gets paid twice as much as I do to play video games and drink all day.  He got his home and mortgage through the VA.  He begged me to leave my roommates and live with him.  I pay rent.  $400/ a month.  Half his mortgage without the property taxes.  Utilities are free.  I get a small bedroom, street parking, and access to the laundry, bathroom, and kitchen.  Its not terrible, and I have been able to save a bit of money and pay off most of my college loans.  \n\nNow, my brother had hit hard times because his vices are out of control.  He smokes $100 of weed a week.  Drinks two pints of rum a day ($11), and smokes a pack of cigarettes a day.  That is at least $870 a month.  That is what I make in two weeks.  That is only 1/4 his monthly pay.  I should point out that my brother is fully capable of working but cannot hold down a job because he shows up to work high or drunk.  \n\nHe begged me to live here.  Promised parking space in The garage and that he would build me an apartment in the basement.  \n\nNow, he has hit hard time because of his own vices.  He went to my enabler mother for money.  She told him to raise my rent i stead of drinking less or getting a job.  \n\nThis felt like an utter betrayal to me.  I left my friend\u2019s apartment where i was happy because i was lured with off street parking and an apartment of my own in the future to help him out.  I was doing him a favor.  Helping the family.  \n\nThen my mother starts trying to convince him to raise my rent so he can afford his home and his booze and drugs.  \n\nWhen i found out, I felt betrayed.  I told her to stay out of my finances.  I told her that if she convinces him to raise my rent, i will just get an apartment of my own (you can get them as low as $600 a month around here).  I told her that she can then keep my brother afloat and pay the rent I no longer pay.\n\nThis went over really well.  \n\nAm I the asshole for telling my mother not to counsel my brother/landlord to raise my rent to pay for his drug habits?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The story is about a 35-year-old man who's living with his brother, who has a lot of issues\u2014PTSD, substance abuse, and is on VA disability. The author pays rent, which is half the brother's mortgage without taxes, and has been managing to save and pay off loans.\n\nThe brother is spending a lot on drugs and alcohol, and when he runs into financial trouble, he goes to their mom. The mom's solution is to have the brother raise the author's rent. The author feels betrayed and tells his mom to stay out of his finances, saying he'll move out if the rent is increased. The question is whether he's the asshole here.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author is in a situation where he's helping his brother by living there and paying rent, which is a significant portion of the brother's mortgage. The brother's spending on vices is high, and the mom is essentially shifting the burden onto the author. The author is standing up for himself, saying he's not responsible for his brother's financial mismanagement and vices.\n\nThe main ethical question here is about personal responsibility and boundaries. The author isn't at fault for choosing not to subsidize his brother's bad habits. He's working hard, making less money, and managing his own finances. By setting a boundary and refusing to have his rent increased, he's protecting his own interests, which is a reasonable action.\n\nThe mother's approach seems to be enabling the brother's behavior rather than encouraging him to address his problems. The author is right to point out that he's already helping by paying rent, and he shouldn't have to pay more to support his brother's addictions. His threat to move out if the rent increases is a logical consequence, as he's not obligated to continue living there if the terms change unfairly.\n\nThere's also the aspect of the brother's own responsibility. He's capable of work but chooses not to, so the author isn't responsible for his job choices. The author's decision to enforce his boundaries is justified, so the answer would likely be B (Not the Asshole).\n"
