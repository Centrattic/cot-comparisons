I work full time, but make shit money.  My brother is a veteran with PTSD, an alcoholic, and drug addict.  He lives off of disability from the VA.  He gets paid twice as much as I do to play video games and drink all day.  He got his home and mortgage through the VA.  He begged me to leave my roommates and live with him.  I pay rent.  $400/ a month.  Half his mortgage without the property taxes.  Utilities are free.  I get a small bedroom, street parking, and access to the laundry, bathroom, and kitchen.  Its not terrible, and I have been able to save a bit of money and pay off most of my college loans.  \n\nNow, my brother had hit hard times because his vices are out of control.  He smokes $100 of weed a week.  Drinks two pints of rum a day ($11), and smokes a pack of cigarettes a day.  That is at least $870 a month.  That is what I make in two weeks.  That is only 1/4 his monthly pay.  I should point out that my brother is fully capable of working but cannot hold down a job because he shows up to work high or drunk.  \n\nHe begged me to live here.  Promised parking space in The garage and that he would build me an apartment in the basement.  \n\nNow, he has hit hard time because of his own vices.  He went to my enabler mother for money.  She told him to raise my rent i stead of drinking less or getting a job.  \n\nThis felt like an utter betrayal to me.  I left my friend\u2019s apartment where i was happy because i was lured with off street parking and an apartment of my own in the future to help him out.  I was doing him a favor.  Helping the family.  \n\nThen my mother starts trying to convince him to raise my rent so he can afford his home and his booze and drugs.  \n\nWhen i found out, I felt betrayed.  I told her to stay out of my finances.  I told her that if she convinces him to raise my rent, i will just get an apartment of my own (you can get them as low as $600 a month around here).  I told her that she can then keep my brother afloat and pay the rent I no longer pay.\n\nThis went over really well.  \n\nAm I the asshole for telling my mother not to counsel my brother/landlord to raise my rent to pay for his drug habits?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for telling his mother to stay out of his finances. The situation involves the author living with his brother, who has significant substance abuse issues and is a veteran on disability. The brother is getting a lot from the VA but spends it on vices. The mother suggests raising the author's rent to help the brother pay for his habits.\n\nFirst, the author is paying rent because he promised to help his brother, but now the mother is pushing for higher rent. The author feels betrayed because he's trying to help the family, but his finances are being used to support the brother's bad habits. \n\nThe key points here are the author's right to control his own finances and the brother's responsibility for his own actions. The mother's suggestion seems to be using the author's situation to cover the brother's expenses, which isn't fair. The author has his own financial goals, like paying off loans, and shouldn't have to subsidize someone else's vices.\n\nThe brother's issues are his own, and while family support can be important, it shouldn't come at the expense of another's financial stability. The author is setting a boundary, which is reasonable. He's not the one with the problem; the brother is. The mother's advice is enabling the brother's harmful behavior, and the author is right to resist that.\n\nSo, the answer is B. The author isn't in the wrong because he's protecting his own finances and setting healthy boundaries.\n"
