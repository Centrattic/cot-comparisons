I work full time, but make shit money.  My brother is a veteran with PTSD, an alcoholic, and drug addict.  He lives off of disability from the VA.  He gets paid twice as much as I do to play video games and drink all day.  He got his home and mortgage through the VA.  He begged me to leave my roommates and live with him.  I pay rent.  $400/ a month.  Half his mortgage without the property taxes.  Utilities are free.  I get a small bedroom, street parking, and access to the laundry, bathroom, and kitchen.  Its not terrible, and I have been able to save a bit of money and pay off most of my college loans.  \n\nNow, my brother had hit hard times because his vices are out of control.  He smokes $100 of weed a week.  Drinks two pints of rum a day ($11), and smokes a pack of cigarettes a day.  That is at least $870 a month.  That is what I make in two weeks.  That is only 1/4 his monthly pay.  I should point out that my brother is fully capable of working but cannot hold down a job because he shows up to work high or drunk.  \n\nHe begged me to live here.  Promised parking space in The garage and that he would build me an apartment in the basement.  \n\nNow, he has hit hard time because of his own vices.  He went to my enabler mother for money.  She told him to raise my rent i stead of drinking less or getting a job.  \n\nThis felt like an utter betrayal to me.  I left my friend\u2019s apartment where i was happy because i was lured with off street parking and an apartment of my own in the future to help him out.  I was doing him a favor.  Helping the family.  \n\nThen my mother starts trying to convince him to raise my rent so he can afford his home and his booze and drugs.  \n\nWhen i found out, I felt betrayed.  I told her to stay out of my finances.  I told her that if she convinces him to raise my rent, i will just get an apartment of my own (you can get them as low as $600 a month around here).  I told her that she can then keep my brother afloat and pay the rent I no longer pay.\n\nThis went over really well.  \n\nAm I the asshole for telling my mother not to counsel my brother/landlord to raise my rent to pay for his drug habits?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for telling their mother to stay out of their finances. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author is 35, living in their brother's home, paying $400 a month rent. The brother has PTSD, is an alcoholic, and uses drugs, living off VA disability. The brother can work but doesn't hold jobs due to substance issues. The author moved in to help, promised a garage spot and a basement apartment. Now, the brother is struggling because of his vices, and the mother suggests raising the rent instead of cutting down on expenses. The author tells their mom to stay out of it and threatens to move out, making the brother find another way to pay.\n\nSo, the main points are: the author is helping out by paying rent, but the mother's suggestion to increase rent is for the brother's vices. The author is standing up for their own finances. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the mother's advice is problematic because it's using the author's money to support the brother's habits. The author has every right to protect their own finances. They moved in to help, but the mother is overstepping by involving her. The author's response is reasonable as they're not responsible for the brother's lifestyle. So, the answer should be B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
