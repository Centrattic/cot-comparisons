I work full time, but make shit money.  My brother is a veteran with PTSD, an alcoholic, and drug addict.  He lives off of disability from the VA.  He gets paid twice as much as I do to play video games and drink all day.  He got his home and mortgage through the VA.  He begged me to leave my roommates and live with him.  I pay rent.  $400/ a month.  Half his mortgage without the property taxes.  Utilities are free.  I get a small bedroom, street parking, and access to the laundry, bathroom, and kitchen.  Its not terrible, and I have been able to save a bit of money and pay off most of my college loans.  \n\nNow, my brother had hit hard times because his vices are out of control.  He smokes $100 of weed a week.  Drinks two pints of rum a day ($11), and smokes a pack of cigarettes a day.  That is at least $870 a month.  That is what I make in two weeks.  That is only 1/4 his monthly pay.  I should point out that my brother is fully capable of working but cannot hold down a job because he shows up to work high or drunk.  \n\nHe begged me to live here.  Promised parking space in The garage and that he would build me an apartment in the basement.  \n\nNow, he has hit hard time because of his own vices.  He went to my enabler mother for money.  She told him to raise my rent i stead of drinking less or getting a job.  \n\nThis felt like an utter betrayal to me.  I left my friend\u2019s apartment where i was happy because i was lured with off street parking and an apartment of my own in the future to help him out.  I was doing him a favor.  Helping the family.  \n\nThen my mother starts trying to convince him to raise my rent so he can afford his home and his booze and drugs.  \n\nWhen i found out, I felt betrayed.  I told her to stay out of my finances.  I told her that if she convinces him to raise my rent, i will just get an apartment of my own (you can get them as low as $600 a month around here).  I told her that she can then keep my brother afloat and pay the rent I no longer pay.\n\nThis went over really well.  \n\nAm I the asshole for telling my mother not to counsel my brother/landlord to raise my rent to pay for his drug habits?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author of the situation described is in the wrong for telling their mother to stay out of their finances.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author is 35, lives with their brother who's a veteran with PTSD, addiction issues, and lives on VA disability. The brother pays a VA disability that's twice the author's income. The author moved in because the brother promised things like a garage spot and a basement apartment. The author pays $400 a month rent, which is half the brother's mortgage without property taxes, and utilities are free. The brother's vices cost around $870 a month, which is equivalent to the author's two weeks of work. The mother suggested raising the rent to help the brother cover his expenses, and the author told her to stay out of it, saying they might move out if the rent is increased.\n\nSo, the key points here: the author is in a living arrangement where they're paying rent to a family member who has addiction issues. The mother is trying to meddle by suggesting a rent increase, which the author sees as enabling the brother's bad habits. The author's response is to set a boundary about their finances, which is the core of the question.\n\nNow, I need to determine if the author is in the wrong. The author is setting a boundary, which is a common way to handle personal finances. The brother is an adult with his own problems, and the author is trying to maintain their own financial stability. The mother's suggestion to raise rent to cover the brother's vices seems like it's enabling his behavior. The author is essentially saying they won't be part of that enablement. \n\nIn typical AITA scenarios, people are often wronged when they overstep or are unreasonable. Here, the author is standing up for their own financial interests, which is reasonable. The brother's situation is his own responsibility, and the author isn't obligated to subsidize his vices. The mother's interference is the issue here, not the author's response. The author's threat to move out if the rent is raised is a logical consequence, as they have options for cheaper housing.\n\nTherefore, the author is not in the wrong. They are protecting their own financial well-being and setting boundaries with family members who are enabling harmful behavior. The mother's approach is problematic, and the author's reaction is a justifiable boundary. Answer B makes sense here."
