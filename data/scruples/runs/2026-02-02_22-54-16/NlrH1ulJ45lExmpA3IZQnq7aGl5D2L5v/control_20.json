I work full time, but make shit money.  My brother is a veteran with PTSD, an alcoholic, and drug addict.  He lives off of disability from the VA.  He gets paid twice as much as I do to play video games and drink all day.  He got his home and mortgage through the VA.  He begged me to leave my roommates and live with him.  I pay rent.  $400/ a month.  Half his mortgage without the property taxes.  Utilities are free.  I get a small bedroom, street parking, and access to the laundry, bathroom, and kitchen.  Its not terrible, and I have been able to save a bit of money and pay off most of my college loans.  \n\nNow, my brother had hit hard times because his vices are out of control.  He smokes $100 of weed a week.  Drinks two pints of rum a day ($11), and smokes a pack of cigarettes a day.  That is at least $870 a month.  That is what I make in two weeks.  That is only 1/4 his monthly pay.  I should point out that my brother is fully capable of working but cannot hold down a job because he shows up to work high or drunk.  \n\nHe begged me to live here.  Promised parking space in The garage and that he would build me an apartment in the basement.  \n\nNow, he has hit hard time because of his own vices.  He went to my enabler mother for money.  She told him to raise my rent i stead of drinking less or getting a job.  \n\nThis felt like an utter betrayal to me.  I left my friend\u2019s apartment where i was happy because i was lured with off street parking and an apartment of my own in the future to help him out.  I was doing him a favor.  Helping the family.  \n\nThen my mother starts trying to convince him to raise my rent so he can afford his home and his booze and drugs.  \n\nWhen i found out, I felt betrayed.  I told her to stay out of my finances.  I told her that if she convinces him to raise my rent, i will just get an apartment of my own (you can get them as low as $600 a month around here).  I told her that she can then keep my brother afloat and pay the rent I no longer pay.\n\nThis went over really well.  \n\nAm I the asshole for telling my mother not to counsel my brother/landlord to raise my rent to pay for his drug habits?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their mother to stay out of their finances. Let me break down the situation.\n\nThe author is 35, living with their brother who's a veteran with PTSD, an alcoholic, and a drug addict. The brother gets VA disability, which is twice what the author earns. The author pays $400 a month rent for a small room, utilities included, and has been saving and paying off loans. The brother's vices cost him around $870 a month, which is a quarter of his VA pay. The brother promised garage parking and a basement apartment but didn't follow through.\n\nNow, the mother suggests the brother raise the author's rent so the brother can afford his habits. The author tells the mother to stay out of their finances and says they'll move out if the rent is increased. The user is asking if the author is wrong here.\n\nFirst, the author is paying rent to their brother who is both a family member and their landlord. The mother's suggestion is to increase the rent to cover the brother's expenses. The author is objecting to this, which seems reasonable because they were lured into moving in with promises, not to cover the brother's vices. The brother's addiction is his responsibility, and the author shouldn't have to subsidize that. The author is protecting their own financial interests, which is understandable. The mother's role as an enabler might be problematic here. The author's response is firm but justified given the circumstances. So, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
