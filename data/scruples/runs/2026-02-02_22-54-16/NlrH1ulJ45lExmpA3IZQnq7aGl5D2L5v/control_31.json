I work full time, but make shit money.  My brother is a veteran with PTSD, an alcoholic, and drug addict.  He lives off of disability from the VA.  He gets paid twice as much as I do to play video games and drink all day.  He got his home and mortgage through the VA.  He begged me to leave my roommates and live with him.  I pay rent.  $400/ a month.  Half his mortgage without the property taxes.  Utilities are free.  I get a small bedroom, street parking, and access to the laundry, bathroom, and kitchen.  Its not terrible, and I have been able to save a bit of money and pay off most of my college loans.  \n\nNow, my brother had hit hard times because his vices are out of control.  He smokes $100 of weed a week.  Drinks two pints of rum a day ($11), and smokes a pack of cigarettes a day.  That is at least $870 a month.  That is what I make in two weeks.  That is only 1/4 his monthly pay.  I should point out that my brother is fully capable of working but cannot hold down a job because he shows up to work high or drunk.  \n\nHe begged me to live here.  Promised parking space in The garage and that he would build me an apartment in the basement.  \n\nNow, he has hit hard time because of his own vices.  He went to my enabler mother for money.  She told him to raise my rent i stead of drinking less or getting a job.  \n\nThis felt like an utter betrayal to me.  I left my friend\u2019s apartment where i was happy because i was lured with off street parking and an apartment of my own in the future to help him out.  I was doing him a favor.  Helping the family.  \n\nThen my mother starts trying to convince him to raise my rent so he can afford his home and his booze and drugs.  \n\nWhen i found out, I felt betrayed.  I told her to stay out of my finances.  I told her that if she convinces him to raise my rent, i will just get an apartment of my own (you can get them as low as $600 a month around here).  I told her that she can then keep my brother afloat and pay the rent I no longer pay.\n\nThis went over really well.  \n\nAm I the asshole for telling my mother not to counsel my brother/landlord to raise my rent to pay for his drug habits?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The story is about a 35-year-old man living with his brother, who's a veteran with PTSD, alcoholism, and drug addiction. The brother gets disability from the VA, which is twice what the narrator earns. The narrator pays $400 a month rent, which is half the brother's mortgage without property taxes. The brother's expenses on drugs and alcohol are high, and the mother suggests raising the rent to help him afford it.\n\nThe main issue is whether the narrator was wrong to tell his mother to stay out of his finances. Let me break it down. The narrator is helping out by living with his brother, which he thought would lead to a basement apartment and garage parking. Now the mother wants to increase his rent to support the brother's vices. The narrator refuses and says he'll move out if they do that.\n\nFirst, the brother's situation: he has a disability, but he's also using his income for drugs and alcohol instead of managing it responsibly. The narrator is contributing to the mortgage, which is a significant help, but he's not getting the benefits he expected. The mother's advice seems to be trying to shift the financial burden onto the narrator further, which might not be fair.\n\nThe narrator's response is to set boundaries. He's saying he's not responsible for his brother's habits and that he has his own financial goals. That makes sense because people shouldn't be forced to support others' vices beyond a certain point. The brother's addiction is a personal issue, and the narrator is prioritizing his own financial stability.\n\nIs the narrator in the wrong? He's standing up for himself after being lured in with promises. The mother's suggestion seems to be taking advantage of his goodwill. The brother is an adult, so the mother shouldn't be dictating financial decisions. The narrator isn't being unreasonable; he's asserting his rights. So the answer is B (No), he's not in the wrong.\n"
