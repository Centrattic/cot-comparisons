I work full time, but make shit money.  My brother is a veteran with PTSD, an alcoholic, and drug addict.  He lives off of disability from the VA.  He gets paid twice as much as I do to play video games and drink all day.  He got his home and mortgage through the VA.  He begged me to leave my roommates and live with him.  I pay rent.  $400/ a month.  Half his mortgage without the property taxes.  Utilities are free.  I get a small bedroom, street parking, and access to the laundry, bathroom, and kitchen.  Its not terrible, and I have been able to save a bit of money and pay off most of my college loans.  \n\nNow, my brother had hit hard times because his vices are out of control.  He smokes $100 of weed a week.  Drinks two pints of rum a day ($11), and smokes a pack of cigarettes a day.  That is at least $870 a month.  That is what I make in two weeks.  That is only 1/4 his monthly pay.  I should point out that my brother is fully capable of working but cannot hold down a job because he shows up to work high or drunk.  \n\nHe begged me to live here.  Promised parking space in The garage and that he would build me an apartment in the basement.  \n\nNow, he has hit hard time because of his own vices.  He went to my enabler mother for money.  She told him to raise my rent i stead of drinking less or getting a job.  \n\nThis felt like an utter betrayal to me.  I left my friend\u2019s apartment where i was happy because i was lured with off street parking and an apartment of my own in the future to help him out.  I was doing him a favor.  Helping the family.  \n\nThen my mother starts trying to convince him to raise my rent so he can afford his home and his booze and drugs.  \n\nWhen i found out, I felt betrayed.  I told her to stay out of my finances.  I told her that if she convinces him to raise my rent, i will just get an apartment of my own (you can get them as low as $600 a month around here).  I told her that she can then keep my brother afloat and pay the rent I no longer pay.\n\nThis went over really well.  \n\nAm I the asshole for telling my mother not to counsel my brother/landlord to raise my rent to pay for his drug habits?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong. The story is about a 35-year-old man living with his brother, who has a disability and gets a lot of benefits. The brother is struggling with addiction and his mother suggests increasing the rent to help him. The author tells his mother to stay out of his finances.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The author is paying rent, which is half his brother's mortgage without taxes. The brother is getting disability payments, which is a form of income based on his service and medical condition. The mother's suggestion is to raise the rent so the brother can afford his vices. The author objects, feeling it's unfair to take money from his own income (which is already low) to support his brother's addictions.\n\nNow, the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The author is a working individual with limited income. He's contributing to the household, but his brother's expenses are primarily covered by VA benefits. The mother's advice seems to be pushing the author to subsidize his brother's lifestyle, which is problematic because the author's financial situation is already tight. The brother's addiction is his own responsibility, and the author isn't obligated to help him with that, especially when the mother is acting as an enabler by not addressing the root issue of the brother's behavior.\n\nThe author's response is to set boundaries, which is reasonable. He's not the one with the addiction, so he's not responsible for fixing it. The mother's approach is enabling the brother's harmful habits instead of encouraging him to seek help or find a job. The author's stance is self-respect and financial autonomy. He's not in the wrong for protecting his own finances from being used to support someone else's vices. \n\nAlso, the brother was the one who lured the author into the arrangement with promises that weren't kept. The author is now asserting his right to not be taken advantage of. The mother's suggestion is essentially exploiting the author's rent to fund the brother's addictions, which is unfair. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for setting that boundary. The answer should be B (No)."
