I work full time, but make shit money.  My brother is a veteran with PTSD, an alcoholic, and drug addict.  He lives off of disability from the VA.  He gets paid twice as much as I do to play video games and drink all day.  He got his home and mortgage through the VA.  He begged me to leave my roommates and live with him.  I pay rent.  $400/ a month.  Half his mortgage without the property taxes.  Utilities are free.  I get a small bedroom, street parking, and access to the laundry, bathroom, and kitchen.  Its not terrible, and I have been able to save a bit of money and pay off most of my college loans.  \n\nNow, my brother had hit hard times because his vices are out of control.  He smokes $100 of weed a week.  Drinks two pints of rum a day ($11), and smokes a pack of cigarettes a day.  That is at least $870 a month.  That is what I make in two weeks.  That is only 1/4 his monthly pay.  I should point out that my brother is fully capable of working but cannot hold down a job because he shows up to work high or drunk.  \n\nHe begged me to live here.  Promised parking space in The garage and that he would build me an apartment in the basement.  \n\nNow, he has hit hard time because of his own vices.  He went to my enabler mother for money.  She told him to raise my rent i stead of drinking less or getting a job.  \n\nThis felt like an utter betrayal to me.  I left my friend\u2019s apartment where i was happy because i was lured with off street parking and an apartment of my own in the future to help him out.  I was doing him a favor.  Helping the family.  \n\nThen my mother starts trying to convince him to raise my rent so he can afford his home and his booze and drugs.  \n\nWhen i found out, I felt betrayed.  I told her to stay out of my finances.  I told her that if she convinces him to raise my rent, i will just get an apartment of my own (you can get them as low as $600 a month around here).  I told her that she can then keep my brother afloat and pay the rent I no longer pay.\n\nThis went over really well.  \n\nAm I the asshole for telling my mother not to counsel my brother/landlord to raise my rent to pay for his drug habits?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling his mother to stop interfering with his finances. The situation involves a brother with significant personal issues\u2014PTSD, alcoholism, drug addiction, and inability to hold a job. The brother is on VA disability, which is more than what the author earns. The author moved in to help out, paying rent, but now the brother is struggling again, and the mother suggests raising the rent to cover his vices.\n\nFirst, consider the author's perspective. He's working full-time with a low income, managing to save money and pay off loans. He's in a living arrangement where he's essentially subsidizing his brother's home and habits, which might be taking a toll. When the mother suggests increasing rent, the author feels betrayed because he's already supporting the household. He's clear that he's not willing to sacrifice his financial stability further for his brother's issues. \n\nFrom a fairness standpoint, the author isn't obligated to support his brother's vices. The brother is an adult, and while family support is common, it's not a one-way responsibility. The author's mother stepping in to encourage higher rent might be trying to help, but it's misdirected. The real problem is the brother's addiction and lack of employment, not the rent. The author has the right to set boundaries, especially since he's already contributing and not the one with the addiction. \n\nAlso, the brother's promise of future improvements (garage parking, basement apartment) didn't materialize, which adds to the author's frustration. The mother's advice could force the author to leave, which might be the only way to make the brother face the consequences of his actions. \n\nPotential counterarguments: The mother might be trying to help the family, but the method is flawed. The author could be seen as being selfish, but given the circumstances and his financial limitations, it's more about self-preservation. The brother's issues are his own to manage. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. He's setting a boundary to protect his financial well-being. The mother's approach is misguided, and the author's response is reasonable.\n"
