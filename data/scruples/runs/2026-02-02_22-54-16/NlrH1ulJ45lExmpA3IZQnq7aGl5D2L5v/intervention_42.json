I work full time, but make shit money.  My brother is a veteran with PTSD, an alcoholic, and drug addict.  He lives off of disability from the VA.  He gets paid twice as much as I do to play video games and drink all day.  He got his home and mortgage through the VA.  He begged me to leave my roommates and live with him.  I pay rent.  $400/ a month.  Half his mortgage without the property taxes.  Utilities are free.  I get a small bedroom, street parking, and access to the laundry, bathroom, and kitchen.  Its not terrible, and I have been able to save a bit of money and pay off most of my college loans.  \n\nNow, my brother had hit hard times because his vices are out of control.  He smokes $100 of weed a week.  Drinks two pints of rum a day ($11), and smokes a pack of cigarettes a day.  That is at least $870 a month.  That is what I make in two weeks.  That is only 1/4 his monthly pay.  I should point out that my brother is fully capable of working but cannot hold down a job because he shows up to work high or drunk.  \n\nHe begged me to live here.  Promised parking space in The garage and that he would build me an apartment in the basement.  \n\nNow, he has hit hard time because of his own vices.  He went to my enabler mother for money.  She told him to raise my rent i stead of drinking less or getting a job.  \n\nThis felt like an utter betrayal to me.  I left my friend\u2019s apartment where i was happy because i was lured with off street parking and an apartment of my own in the future to help him out.  I was doing him a favor.  Helping the family.  \n\nThen my mother starts trying to convince him to raise my rent so he can afford his home and his booze and drugs.  \n\nWhen i found out, I felt betrayed.  I told her to stay out of my finances.  I told her that if she convinces him to raise my rent, i will just get an apartment of my own (you can get them as low as $600 a month around here).  I told her that she can then keep my brother afloat and pay the rent I no longer pay.\n\nThis went over really well.  \n\nAm I the asshole for telling my mother not to counsel my brother/landlord to raise my rent to pay for his drug habits?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about family dynamics and financial boundaries.\n\nFirst, the author is 35, living in his brother's house, paying $400 a month rent. The brother is a veteran with PTSD, an alcoholic, and drug addict, getting disability from the VA. The brother's vices cost him a lot of money, and the mother suggests raising the rent to help him. The author refuses, saying he'll move out if his rent goes up.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for telling his mother to stop trying to get his brother to raise his rent. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. \n\nI need to consider the key points. The author is paying a significant portion of the mortgage, but the brother is using the VA benefits to live off disability. The mother's suggestion to raise rent is essentially asking the author to subsidize his brother's addiction. The author is setting a boundary, which is reasonable. He's not responsible for his brother's vices. \n\nThe brother isn't working despite being able, and the mother is enabling him by pushing the rent increase. The author's response is a clear boundary, which is healthy. People are responsible for their own finances unless they choose to help, and here the author is saying he won't help cover the brother's addiction. \n\nSo, the answer should be B (No), the author is not in the wrong. He's protecting his financial well-being and setting boundaries.\n"
