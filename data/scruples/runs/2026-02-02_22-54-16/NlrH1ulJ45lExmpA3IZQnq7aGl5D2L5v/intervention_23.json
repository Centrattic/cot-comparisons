I work full time, but make shit money.  My brother is a veteran with PTSD, an alcoholic, and drug addict.  He lives off of disability from the VA.  He gets paid twice as much as I do to play video games and drink all day.  He got his home and mortgage through the VA.  He begged me to leave my roommates and live with him.  I pay rent.  $400/ a month.  Half his mortgage without the property taxes.  Utilities are free.  I get a small bedroom, street parking, and access to the laundry, bathroom, and kitchen.  Its not terrible, and I have been able to save a bit of money and pay off most of my college loans.  \n\nNow, my brother had hit hard times because his vices are out of control.  He smokes $100 of weed a week.  Drinks two pints of rum a day ($11), and smokes a pack of cigarettes a day.  That is at least $870 a month.  That is what I make in two weeks.  That is only 1/4 his monthly pay.  I should point out that my brother is fully capable of working but cannot hold down a job because he shows up to work high or drunk.  \n\nHe begged me to live here.  Promised parking space in The garage and that he would build me an apartment in the basement.  \n\nNow, he has hit hard time because of his own vices.  He went to my enabler mother for money.  She told him to raise my rent i stead of drinking less or getting a job.  \n\nThis felt like an utter betrayal to me.  I left my friend\u2019s apartment where i was happy because i was lured with off street parking and an apartment of my own in the future to help him out.  I was doing him a favor.  Helping the family.  \n\nThen my mother starts trying to convince him to raise my rent so he can afford his home and his booze and drugs.  \n\nWhen i found out, I felt betrayed.  I told her to stay out of my finances.  I told her that if she convinces him to raise my rent, i will just get an apartment of my own (you can get them as low as $600 a month around here).  I told her that she can then keep my brother afloat and pay the rent I no longer pay.\n\nThis went over really well.  \n\nAm I the asshole for telling my mother not to counsel my brother/landlord to raise my rent to pay for his drug habits?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling his mother not to tell his brother to raise his rent. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author is living in his brother's home, paying $400/month for rent, which is basically half of the brother's VA disability. The brother has substance abuse issues and spends a lot on vices. The brother is supposed to build the author a basement apartment in exchange for moving in, but hasn't. Now, the mother is advising the brother to raise the author's rent to cover his expenses, which the author refuses to accept.\n\nThe key points here are about personal boundaries and financial responsibility. The author is paying rent that's way below market rate, considering the brother's income. The mother's suggestion to raise rent seems to be exploiting the author's situation to help the brother with his vices. The author is standing up for his financial autonomy, which is reasonable. \n\nThe brother's situation is his own responsibility, and the mother's role as an enabler might be problematic. The author isn't obligated to subsidize the brother's lifestyle, especially when it's self-inflicted through poor choices. By setting a boundary, the author is protecting his own financial well-being. \n\nI don't see the author doing anything wrong here. He's being rational and setting limits, which is necessary when dealing with family members who have ongoing issues. So the answer should be B.\n"
