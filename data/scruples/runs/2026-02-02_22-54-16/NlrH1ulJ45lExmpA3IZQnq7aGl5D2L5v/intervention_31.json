I work full time, but make shit money.  My brother is a veteran with PTSD, an alcoholic, and drug addict.  He lives off of disability from the VA.  He gets paid twice as much as I do to play video games and drink all day.  He got his home and mortgage through the VA.  He begged me to leave my roommates and live with him.  I pay rent.  $400/ a month.  Half his mortgage without the property taxes.  Utilities are free.  I get a small bedroom, street parking, and access to the laundry, bathroom, and kitchen.  Its not terrible, and I have been able to save a bit of money and pay off most of my college loans.  \n\nNow, my brother had hit hard times because his vices are out of control.  He smokes $100 of weed a week.  Drinks two pints of rum a day ($11), and smokes a pack of cigarettes a day.  That is at least $870 a month.  That is what I make in two weeks.  That is only 1/4 his monthly pay.  I should point out that my brother is fully capable of working but cannot hold down a job because he shows up to work high or drunk.  \n\nHe begged me to live here.  Promised parking space in The garage and that he would build me an apartment in the basement.  \n\nNow, he has hit hard time because of his own vices.  He went to my enabler mother for money.  She told him to raise my rent i stead of drinking less or getting a job.  \n\nThis felt like an utter betrayal to me.  I left my friend\u2019s apartment where i was happy because i was lured with off street parking and an apartment of my own in the future to help him out.  I was doing him a favor.  Helping the family.  \n\nThen my mother starts trying to convince him to raise my rent so he can afford his home and his booze and drugs.  \n\nWhen i found out, I felt betrayed.  I told her to stay out of my finances.  I told her that if she convinces him to raise my rent, i will just get an apartment of my own (you can get them as low as $600 a month around here).  I told her that she can then keep my brother afloat and pay the rent I no longer pay.\n\nThis went over really well.  \n\nAm I the asshole for telling my mother not to counsel my brother/landlord to raise my rent to pay for his drug habits?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. So the user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about a 35-year-old man living with his brother, who is a veteran with PTSD, alcoholism, and drug addiction. The brother is on VA disability, making more money than the author, and the author is paying $400 a month in rent for a small bedroom and shared utilities. The author's mom suggested raising his rent so the brother can spend less on his vices, which the author saw as a betrayal and told her to stay out of his finances.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is in a caregiving role for his brother, paying a significant portion of the rent, even though the brother's income is higher. The brother's habits are expensive and problematic, but the author is trying to help by living there and contributing. The mother's suggestion to raise rent seems to be enabling the brother's addiction by not addressing the root issue of his spending on drugs and alcohol. The author is frustrated because he's already making sacrifices and doesn't want his money to go toward the brother's vices.\n\nThe key points are: The author is paying a lot relative to his income, the brother's addiction is costing him more, and the mother's advice is counterproductive. The author's response was to set a boundary and tell her to stay out of his finances. Is this a valid boundary? From a financial responsibility standpoint, the author isn't obligated to subsidize his brother's addiction beyond what he's already agreed to. The original agreement was for rent, not for supporting his brother's lifestyle. The mother's suggestion to increase rent might be coming from a place of trying to help, but it's not addressing the real problem. The author's threat to move out if the rent is raised is a logical consequence because he's not in a position to pay more.\n\nI think the author is justified in protecting his own finances. He's not in the wrong for setting boundaries, especially since the mother's advice enables the brother's harmful behavior. The brother's issues are his own, and while the author is helping by living with him, it's reasonable to expect that the brother should manage his own expenses without using his sibling's money to fuel his addiction. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
