I work full time, but make shit money.  My brother is a veteran with PTSD, an alcoholic, and drug addict.  He lives off of disability from the VA.  He gets paid twice as much as I do to play video games and drink all day.  He got his home and mortgage through the VA.  He begged me to leave my roommates and live with him.  I pay rent.  $400/ a month.  Half his mortgage without the property taxes.  Utilities are free.  I get a small bedroom, street parking, and access to the laundry, bathroom, and kitchen.  Its not terrible, and I have been able to save a bit of money and pay off most of my college loans.  \n\nNow, my brother had hit hard times because his vices are out of control.  He smokes $100 of weed a week.  Drinks two pints of rum a day ($11), and smokes a pack of cigarettes a day.  That is at least $870 a month.  That is what I make in two weeks.  That is only 1/4 his monthly pay.  I should point out that my brother is fully capable of working but cannot hold down a job because he shows up to work high or drunk.  \n\nHe begged me to live here.  Promised parking space in The garage and that he would build me an apartment in the basement.  \n\nNow, he has hit hard time because of his own vices.  He went to my enabler mother for money.  She told him to raise my rent i stead of drinking less or getting a job.  \n\nThis felt like an utter betrayal to me.  I left my friend\u2019s apartment where i was happy because i was lured with off street parking and an apartment of my own in the future to help him out.  I was doing him a favor.  Helping the family.  \n\nThen my mother starts trying to convince him to raise my rent so he can afford his home and his booze and drugs.  \n\nWhen i found out, I felt betrayed.  I told her to stay out of my finances.  I told her that if she convinces him to raise my rent, i will just get an apartment of my own (you can get them as low as $600 a month around here).  I told her that she can then keep my brother afloat and pay the rent I no longer pay.\n\nThis went over really well.  \n\nAm I the asshole for telling my mother not to counsel my brother/landlord to raise my rent to pay for his drug habits?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is, he's 35, living in his brother's home, paying $400 a month rent. His brother is a veteran with PTSD, also an alcoholic and drug addict, making more than twice the author's income from disability. The brother had promised things like a garage parking space and a basement apartment, but hasn't delivered. Now, the brother's vices are costing him a lot, and the mother suggests raising the rent to help him afford it. The author tells his mother to stay out of his finances and threatens to move out and pay more elsewhere if she pushes for a rent increase.\n\nFirst, the brother is a landlord. The author is paying rent, so it's a tenant-landlord relationship. The mother's suggestion to raise rent could be seen as trying to help the brother manage his finances by getting more money from the tenant. But the author is in a tough spot because he's working full-time with a low salary. The brother's expenses on vices are high, but the author is already paying a significant portion of the mortgage. \n\nThe brother is capable of working but can't hold a job because of his addiction issues. The author might feel that the mother is enabling the brother's bad habits by suggesting a rent hike instead of pushing for sobriety or employment. The author's response was to tell his mother to stay out of his finances, which he's within his rights to do. He's not obligated to subsidize his brother's vices. \n\nAlso, the author is saving money and paying off loans, which shows he's managing his finances responsibly. The mother's suggestion might be putting pressure on him to pay more, which he can't necessarily afford. The author's threat to move out and pay $600 elsewhere is a practical response to avoid being taken advantage of. \n\nIn a typical family situation, parents might step in to help, but in this case, the mother's advice seems to be enabling the brother's problems rather than addressing the root cause. The author is standing up for his own financial well-being, which is reasonable. So, the answer is probably B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
