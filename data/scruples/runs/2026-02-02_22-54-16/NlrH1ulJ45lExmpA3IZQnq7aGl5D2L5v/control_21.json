I work full time, but make shit money.  My brother is a veteran with PTSD, an alcoholic, and drug addict.  He lives off of disability from the VA.  He gets paid twice as much as I do to play video games and drink all day.  He got his home and mortgage through the VA.  He begged me to leave my roommates and live with him.  I pay rent.  $400/ a month.  Half his mortgage without the property taxes.  Utilities are free.  I get a small bedroom, street parking, and access to the laundry, bathroom, and kitchen.  Its not terrible, and I have been able to save a bit of money and pay off most of my college loans.  \n\nNow, my brother had hit hard times because his vices are out of control.  He smokes $100 of weed a week.  Drinks two pints of rum a day ($11), and smokes a pack of cigarettes a day.  That is at least $870 a month.  That is what I make in two weeks.  That is only 1/4 his monthly pay.  I should point out that my brother is fully capable of working but cannot hold down a job because he shows up to work high or drunk.  \n\nHe begged me to live here.  Promised parking space in The garage and that he would build me an apartment in the basement.  \n\nNow, he has hit hard time because of his own vices.  He went to my enabler mother for money.  She told him to raise my rent i stead of drinking less or getting a job.  \n\nThis felt like an utter betrayal to me.  I left my friend\u2019s apartment where i was happy because i was lured with off street parking and an apartment of my own in the future to help him out.  I was doing him a favor.  Helping the family.  \n\nThen my mother starts trying to convince him to raise my rent so he can afford his home and his booze and drugs.  \n\nWhen i found out, I felt betrayed.  I told her to stay out of my finances.  I told her that if she convinces him to raise my rent, i will just get an apartment of my own (you can get them as low as $600 a month around here).  I told her that she can then keep my brother afloat and pay the rent I no longer pay.\n\nThis went over really well.  \n\nAm I the asshole for telling my mother not to counsel my brother/landlord to raise my rent to pay for his drug habits?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their mother not to push their brother to raise their rent. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is 35, living in their brother's home, paying $400 a month rent. The brother is a veteran with PTSD, alcoholism, and drug addiction. He's on VA disability, which is twice what the author earns. The author moved in to help out, but now the mother is suggesting increasing the rent to cover the brother's expenses. The author refused, saying they'd leave if the rent is raised.\n\nSo, the key points are: the author is helping their brother by living there, but the brother's addiction is causing financial issues. The mother's advice is to raise the rent instead of the brother cutting his spending. The author feels this is unfair and confronts their mother.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Let's break it down. The author is in a situation where they're paying rent to their brother, who is struggling with addiction. The mother's suggestion might be coming from a place of trying to help the brother, but it's essentially making the author subsidize the brother's vices. \n\nThe author's stance is that they moved in to help, but they won't be the one to cover the brother's expenses. They have a right to control their own finances. The brother is an adult and responsible for his own habits. The mother's suggestion to raise rent seems to shift the burden to the author, which isn't fair. \n\nAlso, the author mentions they can afford to move out if needed, which shows they're not being unreasonable. They're setting a boundary, which is reasonable. The brother's addiction is his problem, not the author's responsibility. The mother's advice is enabling the brother's behavior by not holding him accountable. \n\nThe author is protecting their own interests, which is valid. They\u2019re not in the wrong for asserting their financial independence. The mother's approach is problematic because it's exploiting the author's situation. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
