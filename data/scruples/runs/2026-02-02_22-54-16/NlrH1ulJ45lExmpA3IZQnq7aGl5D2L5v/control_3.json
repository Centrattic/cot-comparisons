I work full time, but make shit money.  My brother is a veteran with PTSD, an alcoholic, and drug addict.  He lives off of disability from the VA.  He gets paid twice as much as I do to play video games and drink all day.  He got his home and mortgage through the VA.  He begged me to leave my roommates and live with him.  I pay rent.  $400/ a month.  Half his mortgage without the property taxes.  Utilities are free.  I get a small bedroom, street parking, and access to the laundry, bathroom, and kitchen.  Its not terrible, and I have been able to save a bit of money and pay off most of my college loans.  \n\nNow, my brother had hit hard times because his vices are out of control.  He smokes $100 of weed a week.  Drinks two pints of rum a day ($11), and smokes a pack of cigarettes a day.  That is at least $870 a month.  That is what I make in two weeks.  That is only 1/4 his monthly pay.  I should point out that my brother is fully capable of working but cannot hold down a job because he shows up to work high or drunk.  \n\nHe begged me to live here.  Promised parking space in The garage and that he would build me an apartment in the basement.  \n\nNow, he has hit hard time because of his own vices.  He went to my enabler mother for money.  She told him to raise my rent i stead of drinking less or getting a job.  \n\nThis felt like an utter betrayal to me.  I left my friend\u2019s apartment where i was happy because i was lured with off street parking and an apartment of my own in the future to help him out.  I was doing him a favor.  Helping the family.  \n\nThen my mother starts trying to convince him to raise my rent so he can afford his home and his booze and drugs.  \n\nWhen i found out, I felt betrayed.  I told her to stay out of my finances.  I told her that if she convinces him to raise my rent, i will just get an apartment of my own (you can get them as low as $600 a month around here).  I told her that she can then keep my brother afloat and pay the rent I no longer pay.\n\nThis went over really well.  \n\nAm I the asshole for telling my mother not to counsel my brother/landlord to raise my rent to pay for his drug habits?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person is in the wrong for telling their mother to stay out of their finances in a specific situation.\n\nFirst, the person is 35, lives in their brother's home, pays $400 rent a month, which is half the brother's mortgage (without taxes). The brother has a VA disability, which is more than the person's income, but the brother uses a lot of it on vices like weed, rum, and cigarettes. The mother suggested raising the rent instead of the brother cutting down on his expenses or finding work.\n\nThe person felt betrayed because they moved in to help the brother out, thinking they would get a basement apartment and garage parking. Now, the mother wants them to pay more rent to cover the brother's costs. The person says they'll leave for a $600 apartment if the rent is increased and tells the mother to stay out of their finances.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is wrong for doing this. Let me break it down. \n\nThe brother is an adult, even if he has issues. The mother's suggestion to raise rent is essentially using the son's money to fund her son's vices. The author is paying a significant amount already, which is a third of their income. They have the right to set boundaries, especially if the brother's habits are unsustainable and the mother isn't helping him address them. \n\nThe author is being responsible with their finances, trying to save and pay off loans. If the rent increases, they might not be able to do that. Also, the brother was supposed to build an apartment for the author, which he hasn't done. The author is standing up for themselves, which is understandable. The mother seems to be enabling the brother's bad habits instead of encouraging better behavior. \n\nIn most cases, adults should handle their own finances. The mother's interference is problematic here. The author isn't in the wrong for protecting their own financial situation. They provided a valid reason for not increasing the rent. The fact that they offered to leave if the rent is increased shows they're not trying to take advantage but rather set a limit.\n\nI think the answer is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. They're being reasonable and protecting their own interests, especially since they were already helping by living there at a lower rent. The mother's suggestion is enabling, so the author's response is justified.\n"
