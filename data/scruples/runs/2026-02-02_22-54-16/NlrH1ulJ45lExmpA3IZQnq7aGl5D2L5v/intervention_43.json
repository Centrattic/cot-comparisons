I work full time, but make shit money.  My brother is a veteran with PTSD, an alcoholic, and drug addict.  He lives off of disability from the VA.  He gets paid twice as much as I do to play video games and drink all day.  He got his home and mortgage through the VA.  He begged me to leave my roommates and live with him.  I pay rent.  $400/ a month.  Half his mortgage without the property taxes.  Utilities are free.  I get a small bedroom, street parking, and access to the laundry, bathroom, and kitchen.  Its not terrible, and I have been able to save a bit of money and pay off most of my college loans.  \n\nNow, my brother had hit hard times because his vices are out of control.  He smokes $100 of weed a week.  Drinks two pints of rum a day ($11), and smokes a pack of cigarettes a day.  That is at least $870 a month.  That is what I make in two weeks.  That is only 1/4 his monthly pay.  I should point out that my brother is fully capable of working but cannot hold down a job because he shows up to work high or drunk.  \n\nHe begged me to live here.  Promised parking space in The garage and that he would build me an apartment in the basement.  \n\nNow, he has hit hard time because of his own vices.  He went to my enabler mother for money.  She told him to raise my rent i stead of drinking less or getting a job.  \n\nThis felt like an utter betrayal to me.  I left my friend\u2019s apartment where i was happy because i was lured with off street parking and an apartment of my own in the future to help him out.  I was doing him a favor.  Helping the family.  \n\nThen my mother starts trying to convince him to raise my rent so he can afford his home and his booze and drugs.  \n\nWhen i found out, I felt betrayed.  I told her to stay out of my finances.  I told her that if she convinces him to raise my rent, i will just get an apartment of my own (you can get them as low as $600 a month around here).  I told her that she can then keep my brother afloat and pay the rent I no longer pay.\n\nThis went over really well.  \n\nAm I the asshole for telling my mother not to counsel my brother/landlord to raise my rent to pay for his drug habits?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their mother to stay out of their finances. The situation is that the author is living in their brother's house, paying rent, and the brother has addiction issues and is getting money from their mother instead of cutting down on his vices.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author is 35, works full-time but makes low wages. Their brother is a veteran with PTSD, alcoholism, and drug addiction, relying on VA disability. The author moved in to help the family, paying $400 a month rent, which is about half the mortgage without property taxes. The brother's vices cost around $870 a month, which is what the author makes in two weeks. The mother suggested raising the rent to help the brother cover his expenses, but the author refused, saying they'd leave if that happened.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is wrong for setting a boundary here. The user thinks the author isn't wrong, but wants a second opinion. \n\nFrom a financial responsibility standpoint, the author is already paying a significant portion of the mortgage. The brother's lifestyle is costing more than the author's income, and the mother is suggesting increasing rent instead of addressing the brother's issues. The author is essentially saying they won't be exploited further. \n\nIn such situations, people often have different views. Some might argue that the author should help family, but others would say that the brother is not in a position to require rent, especially when his spending is self-destructive. The author's decision to leave if the rent is increased seems reasonable because they can't be held responsible for the brother's addictions. \n\nThe mother's advice to raise rent instead of cutting back on vices could be seen as enabling the brother's behavior rather than helping him. The author standing up for their own financial well-being makes sense. They're not in the wrong for setting boundaries, especially when the mother is trying to shift the burden onto them. \n\nAlso, the author was promised a garage space and a basement apartment, which didn't happen, so there's some broken promises there too. They're helping the family but shouldn't have to sacrifice their own financial stability. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because they're protecting their own interests and the situation isn't their fault. The brother's addiction and the mother's approach are problematic, and the author is right to assert their independence.\n"
