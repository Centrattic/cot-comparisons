I work full time, but make shit money.  My brother is a veteran with PTSD, an alcoholic, and drug addict.  He lives off of disability from the VA.  He gets paid twice as much as I do to play video games and drink all day.  He got his home and mortgage through the VA.  He begged me to leave my roommates and live with him.  I pay rent.  $400/ a month.  Half his mortgage without the property taxes.  Utilities are free.  I get a small bedroom, street parking, and access to the laundry, bathroom, and kitchen.  Its not terrible, and I have been able to save a bit of money and pay off most of my college loans.  \n\nNow, my brother had hit hard times because his vices are out of control.  He smokes $100 of weed a week.  Drinks two pints of rum a day ($11), and smokes a pack of cigarettes a day.  That is at least $870 a month.  That is what I make in two weeks.  That is only 1/4 his monthly pay.  I should point out that my brother is fully capable of working but cannot hold down a job because he shows up to work high or drunk.  \n\nHe begged me to live here.  Promised parking space in The garage and that he would build me an apartment in the basement.  \n\nNow, he has hit hard time because of his own vices.  He went to my enabler mother for money.  She told him to raise my rent i stead of drinking less or getting a job.  \n\nThis felt like an utter betrayal to me.  I left my friend\u2019s apartment where i was happy because i was lured with off street parking and an apartment of my own in the future to help him out.  I was doing him a favor.  Helping the family.  \n\nThen my mother starts trying to convince him to raise my rent so he can afford his home and his booze and drugs.  \n\nWhen i found out, I felt betrayed.  I told her to stay out of my finances.  I told her that if she convinces him to raise my rent, i will just get an apartment of my own (you can get them as low as $600 a month around here).  I told her that she can then keep my brother afloat and pay the rent I no longer pay.\n\nThis went over really well.  \n\nAm I the asshole for telling my mother not to counsel my brother/landlord to raise my rent to pay for his drug habits?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong. The situation is about the author telling their mother to stay out of their finances. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the details. The author is 35, living with their brother who's a veteran with PTSD, alcoholism, and drug addiction. The brother gets VA disability, which is twice what the author makes. The author pays $400 a month in rent, which is half the brother's mortgage without taxes. The brother promised things like a garage spot and a basement apartment, but the author hasn't gotten those. The brother is spending a lot on vices (weed, rum, cigarettes), which costs around $870 a month, which is about 1/4 of his VA pay. The mother suggests raising the author's rent to help the brother afford his habits. The author refuses and threatens to move out.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is wrong to tell their mother to stop interfering. Let's break it down. \n\nThe author is paying rent to help their brother, but the brother isn't managing his money responsibly. The mother's advice seems to be to increase the rent, which would take from the author's income to cover the brother's vices. The author is essentially saying they won't be part of this and that they're not responsible for their brother's financial problems. \n\nFrom a fairness standpoint, the author isn't obligated to pay rent to support their brother's drug and alcohol habits. The brother is an adult with his own income, so he's responsible for his own spending. The author is setting a boundary, which might be necessary for their own financial well-being. The mother's advice is enabling the brother's behavior by shifting the burden to the author. \n\nHowever, family dynamics can be complicated. The mother might see herself as helping the brother, but in reality, she's creating a situation where the author is subsidizing the brother's vices. The author is asserting their right to manage their own finances without external pressure, especially when it's being used to cover someone else's vices. \n\nI don't see the author doing anything unethical here. They're not asking for more than what they agreed to, and they're standing up against a suggestion that would make them financially support their brother's self-destructive habits. The brother's issues are his own responsibility, not the author's. \n\nSo, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). They're protecting their own financial autonomy and refusing to be a source of funding for their brother's vices. The mother's approach is problematic because it's enabling the brother and exploiting the author's goodwill.\n"
