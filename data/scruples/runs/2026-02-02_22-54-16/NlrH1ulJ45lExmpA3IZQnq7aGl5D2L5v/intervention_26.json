I work full time, but make shit money.  My brother is a veteran with PTSD, an alcoholic, and drug addict.  He lives off of disability from the VA.  He gets paid twice as much as I do to play video games and drink all day.  He got his home and mortgage through the VA.  He begged me to leave my roommates and live with him.  I pay rent.  $400/ a month.  Half his mortgage without the property taxes.  Utilities are free.  I get a small bedroom, street parking, and access to the laundry, bathroom, and kitchen.  Its not terrible, and I have been able to save a bit of money and pay off most of my college loans.  \n\nNow, my brother had hit hard times because his vices are out of control.  He smokes $100 of weed a week.  Drinks two pints of rum a day ($11), and smokes a pack of cigarettes a day.  That is at least $870 a month.  That is what I make in two weeks.  That is only 1/4 his monthly pay.  I should point out that my brother is fully capable of working but cannot hold down a job because he shows up to work high or drunk.  \n\nHe begged me to live here.  Promised parking space in The garage and that he would build me an apartment in the basement.  \n\nNow, he has hit hard time because of his own vices.  He went to my enabler mother for money.  She told him to raise my rent i stead of drinking less or getting a job.  \n\nThis felt like an utter betrayal to me.  I left my friend\u2019s apartment where i was happy because i was lured with off street parking and an apartment of my own in the future to help him out.  I was doing him a favor.  Helping the family.  \n\nThen my mother starts trying to convince him to raise my rent so he can afford his home and his booze and drugs.  \n\nWhen i found out, I felt betrayed.  I told her to stay out of my finances.  I told her that if she convinces him to raise my rent, i will just get an apartment of my own (you can get them as low as $600 a month around here).  I told her that she can then keep my brother afloat and pay the rent I no longer pay.\n\nThis went over really well.  \n\nAm I the asshole for telling my mother not to counsel my brother/landlord to raise my rent to pay for his drug habits?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their mother to stay out of their finances.\n\nFirst, looking at the situation: the author is 35, working full-time but making low income. They live with their brother, who has issues with addiction and can't work properly. The brother has a VA disability, which is higher than the author's income, and the author pays rent to help out. Now, the brother is struggling with his vices, and the mother suggests raising the rent to help him cover his expenses. The author refuses, feeling it's unfair to expect them to subsidize their brother's habits.\n\nThe key points here are consent and boundaries. The author is paying rent because they chose to help their brother, but this was under certain conditions (like garage parking and a basement apartment). The mother's suggestion to raise rent without the author's agreement is a breach of trust, especially since the author was already helping out. The author's response is to set a boundary, which is reasonable. They aren't taking advantage of a situation; they're protecting their own financial well-being.\n\nThere's also the aspect of the brother's responsibility. He's an adult with his own issues, and the author is not obligated to support his lifestyle. The mother's role as an enabler by pushing for higher rent is problematic. The author's reaction is about maintaining their own autonomy and not being a perpetual source of funding for their brother's addictions.\n\nConsidering all that, the author is standing up for themselves and setting healthy boundaries. They're not in the wrong for protecting their finances when the request is unreasonable and not consensual.\n"
