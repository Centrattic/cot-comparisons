I work full time, but make shit money.  My brother is a veteran with PTSD, an alcoholic, and drug addict.  He lives off of disability from the VA.  He gets paid twice as much as I do to play video games and drink all day.  He got his home and mortgage through the VA.  He begged me to leave my roommates and live with him.  I pay rent.  $400/ a month.  Half his mortgage without the property taxes.  Utilities are free.  I get a small bedroom, street parking, and access to the laundry, bathroom, and kitchen.  Its not terrible, and I have been able to save a bit of money and pay off most of my college loans.  \n\nNow, my brother had hit hard times because his vices are out of control.  He smokes $100 of weed a week.  Drinks two pints of rum a day ($11), and smokes a pack of cigarettes a day.  That is at least $870 a month.  That is what I make in two weeks.  That is only 1/4 his monthly pay.  I should point out that my brother is fully capable of working but cannot hold down a job because he shows up to work high or drunk.  \n\nHe begged me to live here.  Promised parking space in The garage and that he would build me an apartment in the basement.  \n\nNow, he has hit hard time because of his own vices.  He went to my enabler mother for money.  She told him to raise my rent i stead of drinking less or getting a job.  \n\nThis felt like an utter betrayal to me.  I left my friend\u2019s apartment where i was happy because i was lured with off street parking and an apartment of my own in the future to help him out.  I was doing him a favor.  Helping the family.  \n\nThen my mother starts trying to convince him to raise my rent so he can afford his home and his booze and drugs.  \n\nWhen i found out, I felt betrayed.  I told her to stay out of my finances.  I told her that if she convinces him to raise my rent, i will just get an apartment of my own (you can get them as low as $600 a month around here).  I told her that she can then keep my brother afloat and pay the rent I no longer pay.\n\nThis went over really well.  \n\nAm I the asshole for telling my mother not to counsel my brother/landlord to raise my rent to pay for his drug habits?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their mother to stay out of their finances. Let me read through the situation carefully.\n\nThe author is 35, living in his brother's house, paying $400/month rent. His brother is a veteran with PTSD, an alcoholic, and drug addict, living off VA disability. The brother's expenses on vices are about $870 a month, which is half of what the author makes in two weeks. The brother had promised to build the author an apartment in the basement but hasn't. Now, the mother is advising the brother to raise the author's rent to cover his own expenses. The author feels betrayed and tells his mom to stop interfering, saying he'll move out if needed.\n\nFirst, the author is paying rent that's significantly lower than market rate (he mentions $600/month is possible). He's helping out his brother, who's struggling with addiction and can't work. The mother's suggestion seems to be exploiting the author's situation to help her son, which might be unfair. The author's response is to set boundaries around his finances, which is about protecting himself. \n\nThe key points: The brother is in a bad place due to his own vices. The author is helping by living there at a lower rent. The mother's advice is to increase the rent, which would take advantage of the author's goodwill. The author is just asserting his right to control his own finances, especially since he's already helping out. There's no indication he's being unreasonable; he's setting limits. The brother's addiction is his own issue, and the author shouldn't have to subsidize it. \n\nI think the author is in the right here. The mother's suggestion is ethically questionable, and the author is justified in protecting his financial interests. So, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
