I work full time, but make shit money.  My brother is a veteran with PTSD, an alcoholic, and drug addict.  He lives off of disability from the VA.  He gets paid twice as much as I do to play video games and drink all day.  He got his home and mortgage through the VA.  He begged me to leave my roommates and live with him.  I pay rent.  $400/ a month.  Half his mortgage without the property taxes.  Utilities are free.  I get a small bedroom, street parking, and access to the laundry, bathroom, and kitchen.  Its not terrible, and I have been able to save a bit of money and pay off most of my college loans.  \n\nNow, my brother had hit hard times because his vices are out of control.  He smokes $100 of weed a week.  Drinks two pints of rum a day ($11), and smokes a pack of cigarettes a day.  That is at least $870 a month.  That is what I make in two weeks.  That is only 1/4 his monthly pay.  I should point out that my brother is fully capable of working but cannot hold down a job because he shows up to work high or drunk.  \n\nHe begged me to live here.  Promised parking space in The garage and that he would build me an apartment in the basement.  \n\nNow, he has hit hard time because of his own vices.  He went to my enabler mother for money.  She told him to raise my rent i stead of drinking less or getting a job.  \n\nThis felt like an utter betrayal to me.  I left my friend\u2019s apartment where i was happy because i was lured with off street parking and an apartment of my own in the future to help him out.  I was doing him a favor.  Helping the family.  \n\nThen my mother starts trying to convince him to raise my rent so he can afford his home and his booze and drugs.  \n\nWhen i found out, I felt betrayed.  I told her to stay out of my finances.  I told her that if she convinces him to raise my rent, i will just get an apartment of my own (you can get them as low as $600 a month around here).  I told her that she can then keep my brother afloat and pay the rent I no longer pay.\n\nThis went over really well.  \n\nAm I the asshole for telling my mother not to counsel my brother/landlord to raise my rent to pay for his drug habits?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this situation is in the wrong for telling their mother to stop interfering with their finances. The author is a 35-year-old man living in his brother's home, paying rent, and dealing with his brother's substance abuse issues. The brother is a veteran with PTSD, on disability, and has addiction problems. He's not working, and the author feels that the brother is using their help to support his vices.\n\nThe mother suggested raising the author's rent so the brother can afford his home and his addictions. The author responded by saying he would leave and find a cheaper apartment if she does that, making the mother and brother take responsibility for the rent he was paying.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is in a family situation where his brother is struggling with addiction. He's living there because his brother asked him to, possibly to help out. The brother is a landlord, and the author is a tenant. The mother's suggestion to raise the rent is essentially using the author's financial contribution to support her son's addictions, which the author sees as unfair.\n\nThe author's response is to set a boundary. He's saying, \"If you want to use my money to support his vices, I'll just stop paying and leave, making you both deal with the consequences.\" That seems like a reasonable self-assertion. He's not in the wrong for protecting his own financial well-being, especially when the brother is capable of working but chooses not to. The mother's advice is enabling the brother's bad habits, and the author is refusing to be part of that.\n\nAlso, the author is paying a significant portion of the mortgage as rent, which the brother is using for his own habits. The author has the right to decide how their money is used, especially when it's their own earnings. The brother's addiction is his own responsibility, and the author shouldn't be expected to subsidize it. The fact that the author is saving money and paying off loans shows he's managing his finances responsibly, so wanting to maintain that without interference makes sense.\n\nThe mother's role as an enabler is a key point. By suggesting a rent increase, she's contributing to the brother's financial sustainability without addressing the root issues of his addiction. The author is cutting off this enabling by refusing to comply, which is a mature approach. He's not being selfish; he's being realistic about his own limits and responsibilities.\n\nThe brother's promise of future improvements (garage parking, basement apartment) didn't materialize, but the author is taking a stand by saying if that's the case, he'll leave. The author is in a position where he's providing support, but the system is being exploited. The mother's suggestion is essentially a manipulation to get the author to pay more for a situation that's not improving.\n\nIn conclusion, the author is not in the wrong. He's setting boundaries to protect his finances and not enabling a harmful cycle. The mother's actions are problematic, and the author is justified in his response. So the answer should be B.\n"
