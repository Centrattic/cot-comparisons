I work full time, but make shit money.  My brother is a veteran with PTSD, an alcoholic, and drug addict.  He lives off of disability from the VA.  He gets paid twice as much as I do to play video games and drink all day.  He got his home and mortgage through the VA.  He begged me to leave my roommates and live with him.  I pay rent.  $400/ a month.  Half his mortgage without the property taxes.  Utilities are free.  I get a small bedroom, street parking, and access to the laundry, bathroom, and kitchen.  Its not terrible, and I have been able to save a bit of money and pay off most of my college loans.  \n\nNow, my brother had hit hard times because his vices are out of control.  He smokes $100 of weed a week.  Drinks two pints of rum a day ($11), and smokes a pack of cigarettes a day.  That is at least $870 a month.  That is what I make in two weeks.  That is only 1/4 his monthly pay.  I should point out that my brother is fully capable of working but cannot hold down a job because he shows up to work high or drunk.  \n\nHe begged me to live here.  Promised parking space in The garage and that he would build me an apartment in the basement.  \n\nNow, he has hit hard time because of his own vices.  He went to my enabler mother for money.  She told him to raise my rent i stead of drinking less or getting a job.  \n\nThis felt like an utter betrayal to me.  I left my friend\u2019s apartment where i was happy because i was lured with off street parking and an apartment of my own in the future to help him out.  I was doing him a favor.  Helping the family.  \n\nThen my mother starts trying to convince him to raise my rent so he can afford his home and his booze and drugs.  \n\nWhen i found out, I felt betrayed.  I told her to stay out of my finances.  I told her that if she convinces him to raise my rent, i will just get an apartment of my own (you can get them as low as $600 a month around here).  I told her that she can then keep my brother afloat and pay the rent I no longer pay.\n\nThis went over really well.  \n\nAm I the asshole for telling my mother not to counsel my brother/landlord to raise my rent to pay for his drug habits?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their mother to stay out of their finances. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author is 35, living with their brother, paying $400 a month for rent. The brother is a veteran with PTSD, struggles with alcohol and drugs, and lives off VA disability. The brother's expenses on vices are high, and he can't hold a job. The brother originally promised a garage parking and basement apartment in exchange for the author moving in. Now, the mother suggests raising the author's rent to help the brother afford his habits. The author refuses, saying they'll move out if forced to pay more.\n\nI need to determine if the author is wrong here. The mother's intention is to help the brother, but it's at the expense of the author's finances. The author is already in a tough spot with a low income, but has managed to save and pay off loans. They feel used because they moved in to help the family, but now the mother is trying to exploit the situation.\n\nThe key points are consent and fairness. The author moved in under certain conditions (promised parking and apartment). The brother isn't fulfilling his end, and now the mother is pushing for higher rent. The author has the right to set boundaries. They're not obligated to subsidize the brother's habits. The fact that they can afford to move out (as they mention affordable options at $600) gives them leverage. The mother's approach is using the author's rent to support the brother's vices, which is unfair. The author is protecting their own financial stability without violating any agreements, since the brother didn't deliver on his promises. So, the author isn't in the wrong here.\n"
