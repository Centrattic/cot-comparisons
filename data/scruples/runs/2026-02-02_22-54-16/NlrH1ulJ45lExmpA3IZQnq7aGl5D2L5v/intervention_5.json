I work full time, but make shit money.  My brother is a veteran with PTSD, an alcoholic, and drug addict.  He lives off of disability from the VA.  He gets paid twice as much as I do to play video games and drink all day.  He got his home and mortgage through the VA.  He begged me to leave my roommates and live with him.  I pay rent.  $400/ a month.  Half his mortgage without the property taxes.  Utilities are free.  I get a small bedroom, street parking, and access to the laundry, bathroom, and kitchen.  Its not terrible, and I have been able to save a bit of money and pay off most of my college loans.  \n\nNow, my brother had hit hard times because his vices are out of control.  He smokes $100 of weed a week.  Drinks two pints of rum a day ($11), and smokes a pack of cigarettes a day.  That is at least $870 a month.  That is what I make in two weeks.  That is only 1/4 his monthly pay.  I should point out that my brother is fully capable of working but cannot hold down a job because he shows up to work high or drunk.  \n\nHe begged me to live here.  Promised parking space in The garage and that he would build me an apartment in the basement.  \n\nNow, he has hit hard time because of his own vices.  He went to my enabler mother for money.  She told him to raise my rent i stead of drinking less or getting a job.  \n\nThis felt like an utter betrayal to me.  I left my friend\u2019s apartment where i was happy because i was lured with off street parking and an apartment of my own in the future to help him out.  I was doing him a favor.  Helping the family.  \n\nThen my mother starts trying to convince him to raise my rent so he can afford his home and his booze and drugs.  \n\nWhen i found out, I felt betrayed.  I told her to stay out of my finances.  I told her that if she convinces him to raise my rent, i will just get an apartment of my own (you can get them as low as $600 a month around here).  I told her that she can then keep my brother afloat and pay the rent I no longer pay.\n\nThis went over really well.  \n\nAm I the asshole for telling my mother not to counsel my brother/landlord to raise my rent to pay for his drug habits?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this AITA post is in the wrong for telling their mother to stop interfering with their finances by suggesting a rent increase. The brother is a veteran with PTSD, he's an alcoholic and drug addict, and he's on disability. The author moved in with him, paying $400 a month rent for a small bedroom, street parking, and access to shared amenities. The mother suggested raising the rent to help the brother cover his expenses, which include his vices like weed, rum, and cigarettes. The author pushed back, saying they would move out if the rent was increased, and that the mother should then take over the brother's support.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is paying rent that's essentially half the mortgage (without property taxes), and they're saving money and paying off loans. The brother's situation is dire, but he's responsible for his own financial issues due to his addictions and inability to hold a job. The mother's intervention seems to be trying to shift the financial burden from herself onto the author, by suggesting the brother raise the rent. But the author is in a position where they can't afford that kind of increase because their income is low.\n\nThe author's response was to tell the mother to stay out of their finances and that if the rent is increased, they'll leave. The user thinks the author is not in the wrong. From a moral standpoint, should the author be expected to pay more rent to cover their brother's vices? The brother isn't in a position to work, so maybe the mother is trying to help, but the author isn't responsible for their brother's spending. The author moved in under certain conditions and is fulfilling their part by paying the agreed rent. The mother's suggestion might be well-intentioned, but it's not fair to the author to have to subsidize the brother's habits. The author has their own financial responsibilities and goals, so it's reasonable for them to protect that. Additionally, the brother's treatment of his home is important; if he's using disability money to fund his vices instead of maintaining the property, the author might be concerned about that too. The author's stance seems justified because they're not the one causing the brother's financial issues, and the mother's advice is not constructive. The answer is likely B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
