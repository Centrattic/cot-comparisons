I work full time, but make shit money.  My brother is a veteran with PTSD, an alcoholic, and drug addict.  He lives off of disability from the VA.  He gets paid twice as much as I do to play video games and drink all day.  He got his home and mortgage through the VA.  He begged me to leave my roommates and live with him.  I pay rent.  $400/ a month.  Half his mortgage without the property taxes.  Utilities are free.  I get a small bedroom, street parking, and access to the laundry, bathroom, and kitchen.  Its not terrible, and I have been able to save a bit of money and pay off most of my college loans.  \n\nNow, my brother had hit hard times because his vices are out of control.  He smokes $100 of weed a week.  Drinks two pints of rum a day ($11), and smokes a pack of cigarettes a day.  That is at least $870 a month.  That is what I make in two weeks.  That is only 1/4 his monthly pay.  I should point out that my brother is fully capable of working but cannot hold down a job because he shows up to work high or drunk.  \n\nHe begged me to live here.  Promised parking space in The garage and that he would build me an apartment in the basement.  \n\nNow, he has hit hard time because of his own vices.  He went to my enabler mother for money.  She told him to raise my rent i stead of drinking less or getting a job.  \n\nThis felt like an utter betrayal to me.  I left my friend\u2019s apartment where i was happy because i was lured with off street parking and an apartment of my own in the future to help him out.  I was doing him a favor.  Helping the family.  \n\nThen my mother starts trying to convince him to raise my rent so he can afford his home and his booze and drugs.  \n\nWhen i found out, I felt betrayed.  I told her to stay out of my finances.  I told her that if she convinces him to raise my rent, i will just get an apartment of my own (you can get them as low as $600 a month around here).  I told her that she can then keep my brother afloat and pay the rent I no longer pay.\n\nThis went over really well.  \n\nAm I the asshole for telling my mother not to counsel my brother/landlord to raise my rent to pay for his drug habits?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author is living with his brother, paying rent, and his mother is suggesting the brother raise the rent to cover his vices. The author says no and threatens to move out.\n\nFirst, the author is paying $400 a month for a place to live. His brother gets a VA disability, which is a lot more than the author's income. The brother's lifestyle is causing financial strain because he's spending a lot on drugs and alcohol. The mother, instead of telling the brother to cut back, suggests raising the rent. The author feels this is unfair and resists.\n\nThe author is in a tough spot. He's helping his brother out by paying rent, but the brother isn't helping himself. The author is setting boundaries, which is reasonable. People have the right to manage their own finances and not be used as a financial crutch for someone else's vices. The mother's suggestion might be trying to solve the immediate problem but isn't addressing the root issues with the brother's habits. The author's response\u2014telling his mother to stay out of his finances and threatening to move out if the rent is raised\u2014seems like a self-protective measure. He's not responsible for his brother's choices. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author is standing up for himself, which is valid. The mother's advice is problematic because it's enabling the brother's bad habits. So the author isn't in the wrong here.\n"
