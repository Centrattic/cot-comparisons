I work full time, but make shit money.  My brother is a veteran with PTSD, an alcoholic, and drug addict.  He lives off of disability from the VA.  He gets paid twice as much as I do to play video games and drink all day.  He got his home and mortgage through the VA.  He begged me to leave my roommates and live with him.  I pay rent.  $400/ a month.  Half his mortgage without the property taxes.  Utilities are free.  I get a small bedroom, street parking, and access to the laundry, bathroom, and kitchen.  Its not terrible, and I have been able to save a bit of money and pay off most of my college loans.  \n\nNow, my brother had hit hard times because his vices are out of control.  He smokes $100 of weed a week.  Drinks two pints of rum a day ($11), and smokes a pack of cigarettes a day.  That is at least $870 a month.  That is what I make in two weeks.  That is only 1/4 his monthly pay.  I should point out that my brother is fully capable of working but cannot hold down a job because he shows up to work high or drunk.  \n\nHe begged me to live here.  Promised parking space in The garage and that he would build me an apartment in the basement.  \n\nNow, he has hit hard time because of his own vices.  He went to my enabler mother for money.  She told him to raise my rent i stead of drinking less or getting a job.  \n\nThis felt like an utter betrayal to me.  I left my friend\u2019s apartment where i was happy because i was lured with off street parking and an apartment of my own in the future to help him out.  I was doing him a favor.  Helping the family.  \n\nThen my mother starts trying to convince him to raise my rent so he can afford his home and his booze and drugs.  \n\nWhen i found out, I felt betrayed.  I told her to stay out of my finances.  I told her that if she convinces him to raise my rent, i will just get an apartment of my own (you can get them as low as $600 a month around here).  I told her that she can then keep my brother afloat and pay the rent I no longer pay.\n\nThis went over really well.  \n\nAm I the asshole for telling my mother not to counsel my brother/landlord to raise my rent to pay for his drug habits?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling his mother to stay out of his finances. The situation involves him living with his brother, who's a VA disability recipient with substance abuse issues. The brother gets a lot of money from the VA but spends it on drugs and alcohol instead of living expenses. The author pays rent, which is significant compared to his income. His mother suggested raising his rent to help his brother, which the author refused.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The author is in a financial situation where he's working full-time but making low wages. He's helping out by living with his brother, paying a substantial amount in rent, and using this to save and pay off loans. The brother isn't working due to his addiction, and the mother's advice is to increase the rent, which would take money from the author to support the brother's habits. \n\nThe author's argument is that he's being coerced into helping fund his brother's vices through higher rent. He's setting boundaries, which is something people often do in family situations where they feel their personal financial decisions are being infringed upon. The mother's advice seems to be enabling the brother's behavior, and the author is standing up for himself by refusing to contribute more. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's about personal responsibility and boundaries. The brother is an adult, so the author isn't obligated to support him beyond what he's already doing. The mother's suggestion to raise rent is essentially asking the author to subsidize the brother's lifestyle, which he's not comfortable with. The author is asserting his autonomy over his finances, which is reasonable. There's no indication he's violating any agreements or laws here; he's just making a personal choice. \n\nI should also consider if there's any cultural or family expectations that might influence this. However, the scenario doesn't mention any prior agreements about rent or financial support. The brother's behavior is self-destructive, and the author is prioritizing his own financial stability. The mother's approach seems to enable the brother's habits rather than encourage him to seek help or find employment. \n\nSo, based on this analysis, the author isn't in the wrong. He's protecting his own interests and setting boundaries, which is a mature and responsible action. The answer should be B (No).\n"
