I work full time, but make shit money.  My brother is a veteran with PTSD, an alcoholic, and drug addict.  He lives off of disability from the VA.  He gets paid twice as much as I do to play video games and drink all day.  He got his home and mortgage through the VA.  He begged me to leave my roommates and live with him.  I pay rent.  $400/ a month.  Half his mortgage without the property taxes.  Utilities are free.  I get a small bedroom, street parking, and access to the laundry, bathroom, and kitchen.  Its not terrible, and I have been able to save a bit of money and pay off most of my college loans.  \n\nNow, my brother had hit hard times because his vices are out of control.  He smokes $100 of weed a week.  Drinks two pints of rum a day ($11), and smokes a pack of cigarettes a day.  That is at least $870 a month.  That is what I make in two weeks.  That is only 1/4 his monthly pay.  I should point out that my brother is fully capable of working but cannot hold down a job because he shows up to work high or drunk.  \n\nHe begged me to live here.  Promised parking space in The garage and that he would build me an apartment in the basement.  \n\nNow, he has hit hard time because of his own vices.  He went to my enabler mother for money.  She told him to raise my rent i stead of drinking less or getting a job.  \n\nThis felt like an utter betrayal to me.  I left my friend\u2019s apartment where i was happy because i was lured with off street parking and an apartment of my own in the future to help him out.  I was doing him a favor.  Helping the family.  \n\nThen my mother starts trying to convince him to raise my rent so he can afford his home and his booze and drugs.  \n\nWhen i found out, I felt betrayed.  I told her to stay out of my finances.  I told her that if she convinces him to raise my rent, i will just get an apartment of my own (you can get them as low as $600 a month around here).  I told her that she can then keep my brother afloat and pay the rent I no longer pay.\n\nThis went over really well.  \n\nAm I the asshole for telling my mother not to counsel my brother/landlord to raise my rent to pay for his drug habits?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is he's living with his brother, who's a veteran with PTSD, alcoholism, and drug addiction. The brother is on VA disability, which pays more than the author's salary. The author pays $400 a month rent for a small room, utilities included, and he's saving money and paying off loans.\n\nThe brother is spending a lot on vices\u2014weed, rum, cigarettes\u2014costing around $870 a month, which is about a quarter of his disability. The author feels that his mother is enabling his brother by suggesting he raise the rent instead of cutting down on the vices. The author then tells his mother to stay out of his finances and says he'll move out if the rent is increased, making the mother cover the rent instead.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is the asshole for defending his own financial boundaries. Let's break it down. The author is in a situation where he's helping out family, but his brother's behavior is problematic. The mother's suggestion to raise rent doesn't seem to address the root issue of the brother's spending on drugs and alcohol. The author is essentially being asked to subsidize his brother's lifestyle, which he's refusing. \n\nOn one hand, family support is important, but the author is making a living by saving money and paying off debt. Should he be expected to continue financially supporting someone who's making poor choices? On the other hand, the mother's intention might be to help the brother, but suggesting a rent increase is counterproductive. The author's response seems reasonable because he's setting a boundary and taking responsibility for his own finances. He's not asking for charity but is offering to move out if the terms change, which is fair. \n\nThe key points here are about personal responsibility and boundaries. The author isn't in the wrong for protecting his financial stability, especially since the brother's issues are self-inflicted. The mother's approach doesn't solve the brother's problems and shifts the burden onto the author. Therefore, the author's reaction is justified.\n"
