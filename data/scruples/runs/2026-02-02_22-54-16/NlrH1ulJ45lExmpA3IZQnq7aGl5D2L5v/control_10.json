I work full time, but make shit money.  My brother is a veteran with PTSD, an alcoholic, and drug addict.  He lives off of disability from the VA.  He gets paid twice as much as I do to play video games and drink all day.  He got his home and mortgage through the VA.  He begged me to leave my roommates and live with him.  I pay rent.  $400/ a month.  Half his mortgage without the property taxes.  Utilities are free.  I get a small bedroom, street parking, and access to the laundry, bathroom, and kitchen.  Its not terrible, and I have been able to save a bit of money and pay off most of my college loans.  \n\nNow, my brother had hit hard times because his vices are out of control.  He smokes $100 of weed a week.  Drinks two pints of rum a day ($11), and smokes a pack of cigarettes a day.  That is at least $870 a month.  That is what I make in two weeks.  That is only 1/4 his monthly pay.  I should point out that my brother is fully capable of working but cannot hold down a job because he shows up to work high or drunk.  \n\nHe begged me to live here.  Promised parking space in The garage and that he would build me an apartment in the basement.  \n\nNow, he has hit hard time because of his own vices.  He went to my enabler mother for money.  She told him to raise my rent i stead of drinking less or getting a job.  \n\nThis felt like an utter betrayal to me.  I left my friend\u2019s apartment where i was happy because i was lured with off street parking and an apartment of my own in the future to help him out.  I was doing him a favor.  Helping the family.  \n\nThen my mother starts trying to convince him to raise my rent so he can afford his home and his booze and drugs.  \n\nWhen i found out, I felt betrayed.  I told her to stay out of my finances.  I told her that if she convinces him to raise my rent, i will just get an apartment of my own (you can get them as low as $600 a month around here).  I told her that she can then keep my brother afloat and pay the rent I no longer pay.\n\nThis went over really well.  \n\nAm I the asshole for telling my mother not to counsel my brother/landlord to raise my rent to pay for his drug habits?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author living with his brother, who has significant issues with addiction and is receiving disability payments. The mother suggests raising the author's rent to help the brother pay for his vices, and the author tells her to stay out of his finances.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the moral and ethical aspects here. The author is paying rent that's essentially half the mortgage, and he's managing to save and pay off loans despite his low income. His brother is using a lot of the disability money on drugs and alcohol instead of responsibilities. The mother's suggestion seems to be using the author's financial contribution to fund the brother's harmful habits, which isn't fair. The author is standing up for himself, setting boundaries, and not wanting to enable his brother's addiction. \n\nThe brother's actions are self-destructive, and the mother's advice could be seen as enabling his behavior. The author isn't the one with the addiction or the one misusing funds. By refusing to increase his rent, he's protecting his own financial well-being. It's reasonable for someone in his position to set limits, especially when the alternative is supporting harmful behavior. The author isn't in the wrong here because he's taking responsibility for his own finances and not allowing others to take advantage of him. The answer should be B (No).\n"
