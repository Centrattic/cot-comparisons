I work full time, but make shit money.  My brother is a veteran with PTSD, an alcoholic, and drug addict.  He lives off of disability from the VA.  He gets paid twice as much as I do to play video games and drink all day.  He got his home and mortgage through the VA.  He begged me to leave my roommates and live with him.  I pay rent.  $400/ a month.  Half his mortgage without the property taxes.  Utilities are free.  I get a small bedroom, street parking, and access to the laundry, bathroom, and kitchen.  Its not terrible, and I have been able to save a bit of money and pay off most of my college loans.  \n\nNow, my brother had hit hard times because his vices are out of control.  He smokes $100 of weed a week.  Drinks two pints of rum a day ($11), and smokes a pack of cigarettes a day.  That is at least $870 a month.  That is what I make in two weeks.  That is only 1/4 his monthly pay.  I should point out that my brother is fully capable of working but cannot hold down a job because he shows up to work high or drunk.  \n\nHe begged me to live here.  Promised parking space in The garage and that he would build me an apartment in the basement.  \n\nNow, he has hit hard time because of his own vices.  He went to my enabler mother for money.  She told him to raise my rent i stead of drinking less or getting a job.  \n\nThis felt like an utter betrayal to me.  I left my friend\u2019s apartment where i was happy because i was lured with off street parking and an apartment of my own in the future to help him out.  I was doing him a favor.  Helping the family.  \n\nThen my mother starts trying to convince him to raise my rent so he can afford his home and his booze and drugs.  \n\nWhen i found out, I felt betrayed.  I told her to stay out of my finances.  I told her that if she convinces him to raise my rent, i will just get an apartment of my own (you can get them as low as $600 a month around here).  I told her that she can then keep my brother afloat and pay the rent I no longer pay.\n\nThis went over really well.  \n\nAm I the asshole for telling my mother not to counsel my brother/landlord to raise my rent to pay for his drug habits?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author is living with his brother, paying rent, but his mother is suggesting they raise his rent to help the brother cover his expenses from his vices. The author is upset and told his mom to stay out of his finances.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is paying rent, which is a significant portion of his brother's income. The brother has issues with addiction and isn't working, relying on VA disability. The mother, as an enabler, is trying to get the author to pay more rent so the brother can afford his habits.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, he moved in to help the family, expecting some benefits like parking and a basement apartment. Now, the mother wants him to pay more, which seems unfair because the brother's expenses are self-inflicted. The author is standing up for himself, saying he shouldn't have to subsidize his brother's vices. It makes sense he feels betrayed because he was promised certain things when he moved in.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the mother is trying to help her son, but her approach is problematic. The author has the right to manage his own finances and not be pressured to pay more for someone else's issues. The brother isn't contributing properly, and the mother's solution is to make the author pay more, which isn't fair.\n\nThe author is taking a stand for his own financial well-being. He's not in a position to support his brother's habits, especially when he's already helping by paying rent. So, telling his mother to stay out of it seems reasonable. He's not wrong to prioritize his own needs here. The key point is that the mother shouldn't be pressuring him to pay more for her son's vices. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
