I work full time, but make shit money.  My brother is a veteran with PTSD, an alcoholic, and drug addict.  He lives off of disability from the VA.  He gets paid twice as much as I do to play video games and drink all day.  He got his home and mortgage through the VA.  He begged me to leave my roommates and live with him.  I pay rent.  $400/ a month.  Half his mortgage without the property taxes.  Utilities are free.  I get a small bedroom, street parking, and access to the laundry, bathroom, and kitchen.  Its not terrible, and I have been able to save a bit of money and pay off most of my college loans.  \n\nNow, my brother had hit hard times because his vices are out of control.  He smokes $100 of weed a week.  Drinks two pints of rum a day ($11), and smokes a pack of cigarettes a day.  That is at least $870 a month.  That is what I make in two weeks.  That is only 1/4 his monthly pay.  I should point out that my brother is fully capable of working but cannot hold down a job because he shows up to work high or drunk.  \n\nHe begged me to live here.  Promised parking space in The garage and that he would build me an apartment in the basement.  \n\nNow, he has hit hard time because of his own vices.  He went to my enabler mother for money.  She told him to raise my rent i stead of drinking less or getting a job.  \n\nThis felt like an utter betrayal to me.  I left my friend\u2019s apartment where i was happy because i was lured with off street parking and an apartment of my own in the future to help him out.  I was doing him a favor.  Helping the family.  \n\nThen my mother starts trying to convince him to raise my rent so he can afford his home and his booze and drugs.  \n\nWhen i found out, I felt betrayed.  I told her to stay out of my finances.  I told her that if she convinces him to raise my rent, i will just get an apartment of my own (you can get them as low as $600 a month around here).  I told her that she can then keep my brother afloat and pay the rent I no longer pay.\n\nThis went over really well.  \n\nAm I the asshole for telling my mother not to counsel my brother/landlord to raise my rent to pay for his drug habits?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author is living with his brother, who is a veteran with PTSD and has addiction issues. The brother gets disability from the VA and is getting a house through the VA as well. The author is paying $400 a month in rent, which he says is half of the brother's mortgage (excluding property taxes) and utilities are free. He's in a small bedroom, using street parking, and sharing common areas.\n\nHis brother is struggling with his vices like weed, rum, and cigarettes. The cost of these is about $870 a month, which is roughly what the author makes in two weeks. The brother is capable of working but can't keep a job because of being high or drunk. The brother asked the author to move in, promising a garage parking spot and a future basement apartment. Now, the mother is suggesting the brother raise the rent to help with his expenses, which the author is against. He told his mom to stay out of his finances, saying if she pushes for a rent increase, he'll just move out to a $600 apartment.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is essentially a roommate in his brother's VA-owned home. The brother is on disability, so he has a fixed income. The author's rent is $400, which he feels is generous given the setup. The brother's vices are consuming a significant portion of his VA pay, and the mother is trying to get the author to pay more, which seems like a way to help her son without addressing the root problem of his addiction and poor job performance. The author, on the other hand, is working full-time, saving money, and paying off loans. He's in a position where he can afford to move out if the rent is raised, but he's standing up for himself financially.\n\nThe key points here are the mother's role in advising the brother to increase the rent instead of encouraging healthier habits. The author is frustrated because he feels he's already contributing, and he's being asked to pay more for the brother's vices. The author's response was to tell his mother to stop interfering, possibly to avoid being taken advantage of. \n\nI think the author is justified in protecting his own finances. The mother's suggestion doesn't address the brother's issues and might even enable them further by providing more money for his vices instead of pushing him to seek help or reduce his expenses. The author is in a position to make his own financial decisions, especially since he's a grown adult. The fact that moving out is an option that he can handle financially (since apartments are available for $600) supports his stance. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No), the author is not in the wrong. He's asserting his right to manage his own finances and is not responsible for his brother's addiction-related expenses. The mother should respect his boundaries, and the brother should address his spending habits instead of passing the problem onto his sibling.\n"
