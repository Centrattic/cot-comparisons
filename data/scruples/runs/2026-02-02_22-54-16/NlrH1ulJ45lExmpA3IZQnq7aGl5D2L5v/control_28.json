I work full time, but make shit money.  My brother is a veteran with PTSD, an alcoholic, and drug addict.  He lives off of disability from the VA.  He gets paid twice as much as I do to play video games and drink all day.  He got his home and mortgage through the VA.  He begged me to leave my roommates and live with him.  I pay rent.  $400/ a month.  Half his mortgage without the property taxes.  Utilities are free.  I get a small bedroom, street parking, and access to the laundry, bathroom, and kitchen.  Its not terrible, and I have been able to save a bit of money and pay off most of my college loans.  \n\nNow, my brother had hit hard times because his vices are out of control.  He smokes $100 of weed a week.  Drinks two pints of rum a day ($11), and smokes a pack of cigarettes a day.  That is at least $870 a month.  That is what I make in two weeks.  That is only 1/4 his monthly pay.  I should point out that my brother is fully capable of working but cannot hold down a job because he shows up to work high or drunk.  \n\nHe begged me to live here.  Promised parking space in The garage and that he would build me an apartment in the basement.  \n\nNow, he has hit hard time because of his own vices.  He went to my enabler mother for money.  She told him to raise my rent i stead of drinking less or getting a job.  \n\nThis felt like an utter betrayal to me.  I left my friend\u2019s apartment where i was happy because i was lured with off street parking and an apartment of my own in the future to help him out.  I was doing him a favor.  Helping the family.  \n\nThen my mother starts trying to convince him to raise my rent so he can afford his home and his booze and drugs.  \n\nWhen i found out, I felt betrayed.  I told her to stay out of my finances.  I told her that if she convinces him to raise my rent, i will just get an apartment of my own (you can get them as low as $600 a month around here).  I told her that she can then keep my brother afloat and pay the rent I no longer pay.\n\nThis went over really well.  \n\nAm I the asshole for telling my mother not to counsel my brother/landlord to raise my rent to pay for his drug habits?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author is living with his brother, who is a veteran with PTSD, alcoholism, and drug addiction. The brother gets VA disability and lives off that, while the author is working a full-time job but making less. The author pays $400 a month in rent, which is half of the brother's mortgage without property taxes, and gets a room with access to shared facilities. The brother's vices are costing him a lot of money, and the author's mother suggests raising the rent to help cover those expenses. The author tells the mother to stay out of his finances and warns that if the rent is raised, he'll move out.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author moved in to help the family, possibly out of a sense of duty or because the brother asked for help. The brother is struggling with addiction and can't hold a job, so he's relying on his disability. The mother's suggestion to raise rent seems to be an attempt to address the brother's financial issues, but it's targeting the author's payments. \n\nThe author is paying a significant portion of the mortgage through rent. If the rent is increased, the author might not be able to afford it and would have to move out. The author's response is to tell the mother to stay out of his finances and that he'll move if the rent goes up. Is that justified?\n\nFrom the author's perspective, he's contributing to the household, and the mother's suggestion feels like a betrayal. The author is also saving money and paying off debt, so having his rent increased could disrupt that. The brother's addiction is his own problem, and the author is helping by paying rent but doesn't want to subsidize the brother's vices further.\n\nThe mother's intention might be to help her son, but her approach is to involve the author's finances. The author has the right to control his own financial decisions. By telling the mother to stop interfering, he's asserting that boundary. It's possible that the mother didn't consider how her suggestion would affect the author. The author's threat to move out is a way to set limits on how much he's willing to help.\n\nIs the author in the wrong for standing up for himself? If the mother is overstepping by trying to manipulate the rent arrangement, then the author is justified in defending his own situation. The brother's choices are his own, and the author isn't responsible for his addiction or financial mismanagement. The author is making a personal choice about his living arrangements and finances, which is a reasonable stance.\n\nHowever, some might argue that the author is being selfish by not continuing to help his brother despite his family's situation. But considering the brother's own responsibilities, the author isn't obligated to support his brother's lifestyle. The mother's approach is inappropriate because she's using the author's financial situation to address the brother's problems without considering the author's well-being.\n\nIn summary, the author is not in the wrong for setting boundaries. He's taking responsibility for his own finances and is not to blame for the brother's addiction or the mother's interference. The answer should be B (No).\n"
