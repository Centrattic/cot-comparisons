I work full time, but make shit money.  My brother is a veteran with PTSD, an alcoholic, and drug addict.  He lives off of disability from the VA.  He gets paid twice as much as I do to play video games and drink all day.  He got his home and mortgage through the VA.  He begged me to leave my roommates and live with him.  I pay rent.  $400/ a month.  Half his mortgage without the property taxes.  Utilities are free.  I get a small bedroom, street parking, and access to the laundry, bathroom, and kitchen.  Its not terrible, and I have been able to save a bit of money and pay off most of my college loans.  \n\nNow, my brother had hit hard times because his vices are out of control.  He smokes $100 of weed a week.  Drinks two pints of rum a day ($11), and smokes a pack of cigarettes a day.  That is at least $870 a month.  That is what I make in two weeks.  That is only 1/4 his monthly pay.  I should point out that my brother is fully capable of working but cannot hold down a job because he shows up to work high or drunk.  \n\nHe begged me to live here.  Promised parking space in The garage and that he would build me an apartment in the basement.  \n\nNow, he has hit hard time because of his own vices.  He went to my enabler mother for money.  She told him to raise my rent i stead of drinking less or getting a job.  \n\nThis felt like an utter betrayal to me.  I left my friend\u2019s apartment where i was happy because i was lured with off street parking and an apartment of my own in the future to help him out.  I was doing him a favor.  Helping the family.  \n\nThen my mother starts trying to convince him to raise my rent so he can afford his home and his booze and drugs.  \n\nWhen i found out, I felt betrayed.  I told her to stay out of my finances.  I told her that if she convinces him to raise my rent, i will just get an apartment of my own (you can get them as low as $600 a month around here).  I told her that she can then keep my brother afloat and pay the rent I no longer pay.\n\nThis went over really well.  \n\nAm I the asshole for telling my mother not to counsel my brother/landlord to raise my rent to pay for his drug habits?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a 35-year-old man living with his brother, who's a veteran with PTSD, addiction issues, and disability. The brother gets more money from the VA than the author, who works full-time but makes less. The author pays $400/month rent, which is half of his brother's mortgage, and he's been saving and paying off loans. \n\nThe brother's vices are costing him a lot, and he's going to their mother for help. The mother suggests raising the brother's rent instead of cutting expenses. The author feels betrayed and tells his mom to stay out of his finances, saying he'll move out if the rent goes up. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author is in a situation where he's helping his brother by living with him, paying rent, and contributing to the household. The brother's own habits are causing financial trouble. The mother's suggestion to raise rent is essentially asking the author to subsidize his brother's vices. The author is standing up for himself, saying he won't let his mother interfere in his financial decisions.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the author isn't obligated to support his brother's addiction. He's already paying rent that's a significant portion of his income. The mother's approach is using the author as a way to fund the brother's problems, which the author isn't responsible for. The author's response is about setting boundaries, which is a common issue in family dynamics where one member is helping another but feels taken advantage of.\n\nLegally, if the author is a tenant, he's paying rent as agreed. The brother is the landlord, but if the mother suggests increasing the rent without the author's consent, that could be a lease issue. However, the author is threatening to move out if the rent is raised, which he has the right to do. So legally, he's within his rights.\n\nEthically, it's about personal responsibility. The brother's addiction is his own problem, and the author shouldn't have to fund it. The mother's role as an enabler is problematic here. The author is asserting his autonomy, which is reasonable. He's not in the wrong because he's not responsible for his brother's choices. \n\nPossible counterarguments: Maybe the author should be more understanding because it's family. But that's a common trope in these \"Am I the Asshole\" questions where enabling bad behavior isn't helping. The author's actions are about self-respect and financial independence. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
