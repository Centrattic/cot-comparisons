I work full time, but make shit money.  My brother is a veteran with PTSD, an alcoholic, and drug addict.  He lives off of disability from the VA.  He gets paid twice as much as I do to play video games and drink all day.  He got his home and mortgage through the VA.  He begged me to leave my roommates and live with him.  I pay rent.  $400/ a month.  Half his mortgage without the property taxes.  Utilities are free.  I get a small bedroom, street parking, and access to the laundry, bathroom, and kitchen.  Its not terrible, and I have been able to save a bit of money and pay off most of my college loans.  \n\nNow, my brother had hit hard times because his vices are out of control.  He smokes $100 of weed a week.  Drinks two pints of rum a day ($11), and smokes a pack of cigarettes a day.  That is at least $870 a month.  That is what I make in two weeks.  That is only 1/4 his monthly pay.  I should point out that my brother is fully capable of working but cannot hold down a job because he shows up to work high or drunk.  \n\nHe begged me to live here.  Promised parking space in The garage and that he would build me an apartment in the basement.  \n\nNow, he has hit hard time because of his own vices.  He went to my enabler mother for money.  She told him to raise my rent i stead of drinking less or getting a job.  \n\nThis felt like an utter betrayal to me.  I left my friend\u2019s apartment where i was happy because i was lured with off street parking and an apartment of my own in the future to help him out.  I was doing him a favor.  Helping the family.  \n\nThen my mother starts trying to convince him to raise my rent so he can afford his home and his booze and drugs.  \n\nWhen i found out, I felt betrayed.  I told her to stay out of my finances.  I told her that if she convinces him to raise my rent, i will just get an apartment of my own (you can get them as low as $600 a month around here).  I told her that she can then keep my brother afloat and pay the rent I no longer pay.\n\nThis went over really well.  \n\nAm I the asshole for telling my mother not to counsel my brother/landlord to raise my rent to pay for his drug habits?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person sharing the situation) is in the wrong for telling their mother not to interfere with their finances.\n\nFirst, looking at the setup: the author is 35, lives with their brother, pays $400 a month in rent, and the brother has significant issues with alcohol and drug addiction. The mother is suggesting raising the author's rent to help cover the brother's expenses. The author feels this is a betrayal and refuses, saying they'll move out if they have to.\n\nThe key points here are about personal boundaries and financial autonomy. The author is in a situation where they're helping their brother by paying rent, but the brother's spending is problematic. The mother's suggestion to increase the rent is essentially using the author's money to support the brother's vices. The author is standing up for their own financial independence, which seems reasonable. They're not obligated to help someone else's vices, especially when it's affecting their own financial stability.\n\nAlso, the author is in a landlord-tenant relationship, which adds another layer. Even in a family setting, asking a tenant to pay more without agreement is not right. The author's threat to leave if the rent is raised is a valid response to protect their interests.\n\nThe brother's responsibility for his own actions is another angle. He's an adult with a disability but capable of working, yet his choices led to his current situation. The mother's advice doesn't address his need to change his behavior but instead shifts the burden onto the author.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. They're asserting their right to control their finances and setting boundaries. The answer should be B.\n"
