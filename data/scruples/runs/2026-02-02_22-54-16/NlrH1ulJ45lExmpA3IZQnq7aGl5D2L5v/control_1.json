I work full time, but make shit money.  My brother is a veteran with PTSD, an alcoholic, and drug addict.  He lives off of disability from the VA.  He gets paid twice as much as I do to play video games and drink all day.  He got his home and mortgage through the VA.  He begged me to leave my roommates and live with him.  I pay rent.  $400/ a month.  Half his mortgage without the property taxes.  Utilities are free.  I get a small bedroom, street parking, and access to the laundry, bathroom, and kitchen.  Its not terrible, and I have been able to save a bit of money and pay off most of my college loans.  \n\nNow, my brother had hit hard times because his vices are out of control.  He smokes $100 of weed a week.  Drinks two pints of rum a day ($11), and smokes a pack of cigarettes a day.  That is at least $870 a month.  That is what I make in two weeks.  That is only 1/4 his monthly pay.  I should point out that my brother is fully capable of working but cannot hold down a job because he shows up to work high or drunk.  \n\nHe begged me to live here.  Promised parking space in The garage and that he would build me an apartment in the basement.  \n\nNow, he has hit hard time because of his own vices.  He went to my enabler mother for money.  She told him to raise my rent i stead of drinking less or getting a job.  \n\nThis felt like an utter betrayal to me.  I left my friend\u2019s apartment where i was happy because i was lured with off street parking and an apartment of my own in the future to help him out.  I was doing him a favor.  Helping the family.  \n\nThen my mother starts trying to convince him to raise my rent so he can afford his home and his booze and drugs.  \n\nWhen i found out, I felt betrayed.  I told her to stay out of my finances.  I told her that if she convinces him to raise my rent, i will just get an apartment of my own (you can get them as low as $600 a month around here).  I told her that she can then keep my brother afloat and pay the rent I no longer pay.\n\nThis went over really well.  \n\nAm I the asshole for telling my mother not to counsel my brother/landlord to raise my rent to pay for his drug habits?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a 35-year-old man living with his brother, who has PTSD, is an alcoholic, and a drug addict. The brother has a VA disability and a home through the VA. The man pays $400 a month in rent, which is half the brother's mortgage without property taxes, and utilities are free. He's been saving money and paying off loans.\n\nThe brother, due to his vices, is in financial trouble. He asked his mother (the author's mother) for money, and she suggested raising the brother's rent. The author feels betrayed and told his mother to stay out of his finances, saying he'll move out if she does that. The user wants to know if the author is the asshole for refusing to have his rent increased to help his brother's addiction.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is a tenant in his brother's house. He's paying rent, but the brother isn't just struggling; he's actively spending a significant portion of his income on vices. The mother's suggestion to raise the rent is essentially making the son subsidize his brother's bad habits. That seems unfair. The author isn't obligated to support his brother's addiction through his rent. \n\nThe brother's situation is self-inflicted through his vices, even though he has a disability. The author is in a position where he has to work full-time but makes low money. The brother isn't contributing to the household in a way that's reasonable, considering his earnings. The author is maintaining his own financial stability, which is important. \n\nThe mother's approach is problematic because she's using her son (the author) to help pay for her other son's (the brother) expenses without his consent. The author is within his rights to set boundaries, especially since he was promised certain living conditions (garage parking, basement apartment) which haven't materialized. \n\nThe brother's addiction is a serious issue, but the author isn't responsible for that. The key point is that the author should not be forced to subsidize his brother's vices. The mother's suggestion is a form of exploitation. The author's response, while firm, is a reasonable way to protect his own finances. \n\nSo, the answer is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. He's standing up for himself and his financial autonomy. The brother's problems are his own, and the mother shouldn't be pressuring her son to pay for them. The author's actions are justified as he's not responsible for his brother's addiction and has the right to manage his own money.\n"
