I work full time, but make shit money.  My brother is a veteran with PTSD, an alcoholic, and drug addict.  He lives off of disability from the VA.  He gets paid twice as much as I do to play video games and drink all day.  He got his home and mortgage through the VA.  He begged me to leave my roommates and live with him.  I pay rent.  $400/ a month.  Half his mortgage without the property taxes.  Utilities are free.  I get a small bedroom, street parking, and access to the laundry, bathroom, and kitchen.  Its not terrible, and I have been able to save a bit of money and pay off most of my college loans.  \n\nNow, my brother had hit hard times because his vices are out of control.  He smokes $100 of weed a week.  Drinks two pints of rum a day ($11), and smokes a pack of cigarettes a day.  That is at least $870 a month.  That is what I make in two weeks.  That is only 1/4 his monthly pay.  I should point out that my brother is fully capable of working but cannot hold down a job because he shows up to work high or drunk.  \n\nHe begged me to live here.  Promised parking space in The garage and that he would build me an apartment in the basement.  \n\nNow, he has hit hard time because of his own vices.  He went to my enabler mother for money.  She told him to raise my rent i stead of drinking less or getting a job.  \n\nThis felt like an utter betrayal to me.  I left my friend\u2019s apartment where i was happy because i was lured with off street parking and an apartment of my own in the future to help him out.  I was doing him a favor.  Helping the family.  \n\nThen my mother starts trying to convince him to raise my rent so he can afford his home and his booze and drugs.  \n\nWhen i found out, I felt betrayed.  I told her to stay out of my finances.  I told her that if she convinces him to raise my rent, i will just get an apartment of my own (you can get them as low as $600 a month around here).  I told her that she can then keep my brother afloat and pay the rent I no longer pay.\n\nThis went over really well.  \n\nAm I the asshole for telling my mother not to counsel my brother/landlord to raise my rent to pay for his drug habits?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling his mother to stay out of his finances, after she suggested his brother (his landlord) raise his rent.\n\nFirst, looking at the situation: The author is living in his brother's home, paying $400 a month in rent. His brother has significant issues with addiction and can't hold a job, relying on VA disability. The mother suggests raising the rent to help cover the brother's expenses, which are largely due to his vices. The author feels this is unfair and tells his mother to stop interfering.\n\nThe key points here are about boundaries and fairness. The author is paying rent but is essentially subsidizing his brother's problematic habits through increased rent. He's working a full-time job with lower pay compared to his brother's disability, yet his mother is using him to solve the brother's financial issues. \n\nFrom the author's perspective, he's helping out by living with his brother, but the mother's suggestion to raise rent doesn't address the root issue (brother's addiction and lack of job). It's a way to shift the burden onto the son. The author is setting a boundary to protect his own finances, which is a reasonable self-preservation move. \n\nThe mother's role as an enabler is also a factor. Instead of pushing the brother to address his issues, she's suggesting cutting the son's expenses. The author's reaction is about not being responsible for his brother's failings. \n\nConsidering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. He's standing up for himself and not letting his family's issues dictate his financial stability. So the answer should be B.\n"
