I work full time, but make shit money.  My brother is a veteran with PTSD, an alcoholic, and drug addict.  He lives off of disability from the VA.  He gets paid twice as much as I do to play video games and drink all day.  He got his home and mortgage through the VA.  He begged me to leave my roommates and live with him.  I pay rent.  $400/ a month.  Half his mortgage without the property taxes.  Utilities are free.  I get a small bedroom, street parking, and access to the laundry, bathroom, and kitchen.  Its not terrible, and I have been able to save a bit of money and pay off most of my college loans.  \n\nNow, my brother had hit hard times because his vices are out of control.  He smokes $100 of weed a week.  Drinks two pints of rum a day ($11), and smokes a pack of cigarettes a day.  That is at least $870 a month.  That is what I make in two weeks.  That is only 1/4 his monthly pay.  I should point out that my brother is fully capable of working but cannot hold down a job because he shows up to work high or drunk.  \n\nHe begged me to live here.  Promised parking space in The garage and that he would build me an apartment in the basement.  \n\nNow, he has hit hard time because of his own vices.  He went to my enabler mother for money.  She told him to raise my rent i stead of drinking less or getting a job.  \n\nThis felt like an utter betrayal to me.  I left my friend\u2019s apartment where i was happy because i was lured with off street parking and an apartment of my own in the future to help him out.  I was doing him a favor.  Helping the family.  \n\nThen my mother starts trying to convince him to raise my rent so he can afford his home and his booze and drugs.  \n\nWhen i found out, I felt betrayed.  I told her to stay out of my finances.  I told her that if she convinces him to raise my rent, i will just get an apartment of my own (you can get them as low as $600 a month around here).  I told her that she can then keep my brother afloat and pay the rent I no longer pay.\n\nThis went over really well.  \n\nAm I the asshole for telling my mother not to counsel my brother/landlord to raise my rent to pay for his drug habits?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for telling their mother to stay out of their finances. The situation is that the author lives with their brother who has significant issues with alcohol and drug addiction. The brother is on VA disability and spends a lot of money on vices, despite making twice as much as the author. The mother suggested raising the author's rent to help the brother's financial situation.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author is paying rent, but it's a deal where they get utilities free and a small room. The brother is struggling because of his own habits, and the mother's idea is to increase rent to cover his expenses. The author is upset and tells the mother to stop interfering.\n\nNow, considering the scenario: The author is in a vulnerable position, working hard to save money and pay off loans. Their brother is using the VA benefits, which are meant for his specific needs as a veteran with PTSD, but he's misusing them. The mother's suggestion seems to be shifting the financial burden onto the author, who is already in a low-income situation. The author is essentially being asked to subsidize their brother's addiction, which is unfair.\n\nThe author's response is to set a boundary, saying they won't be used in this way. That seems reasonable. They are protecting their finances and not allowing their family to take advantage. The brother's situation is his responsibility, and the mother overstepped by trying to involve the author in that. The author's threat to move out is a logical consequence if the rent is raised, as they can afford an apartment elsewhere. \n\nThere's no indication the author is being selfish; they made a choice to help their brother out of family obligation, but that doesn't mean they have to sacrifice their own financial stability indefinitely. The mother's role as an enabler by suggesting higher rent to support her son's vices is problematic. The author is standing up for their own interests, which is a healthy boundary. \n\nPossible counterarguments might say the mother is trying to help, but the method is wrong. However, the core issue is the mother's interference without considering the author's financial limits. The author isn't in the wrong for defending their finances and rejecting unfair expectations. So the answer should be B, not in the wrong.\n"
