I work full time, but make shit money.  My brother is a veteran with PTSD, an alcoholic, and drug addict.  He lives off of disability from the VA.  He gets paid twice as much as I do to play video games and drink all day.  He got his home and mortgage through the VA.  He begged me to leave my roommates and live with him.  I pay rent.  $400/ a month.  Half his mortgage without the property taxes.  Utilities are free.  I get a small bedroom, street parking, and access to the laundry, bathroom, and kitchen.  Its not terrible, and I have been able to save a bit of money and pay off most of my college loans.  \n\nNow, my brother had hit hard times because his vices are out of control.  He smokes $100 of weed a week.  Drinks two pints of rum a day ($11), and smokes a pack of cigarettes a day.  That is at least $870 a month.  That is what I make in two weeks.  That is only 1/4 his monthly pay.  I should point out that my brother is fully capable of working but cannot hold down a job because he shows up to work high or drunk.  \n\nHe begged me to live here.  Promised parking space in The garage and that he would build me an apartment in the basement.  \n\nNow, he has hit hard time because of his own vices.  He went to my enabler mother for money.  She told him to raise my rent i stead of drinking less or getting a job.  \n\nThis felt like an utter betrayal to me.  I left my friend\u2019s apartment where i was happy because i was lured with off street parking and an apartment of my own in the future to help him out.  I was doing him a favor.  Helping the family.  \n\nThen my mother starts trying to convince him to raise my rent so he can afford his home and his booze and drugs.  \n\nWhen i found out, I felt betrayed.  I told her to stay out of my finances.  I told her that if she convinces him to raise my rent, i will just get an apartment of my own (you can get them as low as $600 a month around here).  I told her that she can then keep my brother afloat and pay the rent I no longer pay.\n\nThis went over really well.  \n\nAm I the asshole for telling my mother not to counsel my brother/landlord to raise my rent to pay for his drug habits?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author living with his brother, who has substance abuse issues and is on disability. The author pays rent, and their mother suggested raising the rent to help the brother cover his expenses.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author is 35, works full-time but makes low wages. His brother is a veteran with PTSD, addiction issues, and is on VA disability. The brother begged the author to move in, offering parking and a future basement apartment. The author pays $400 a month, which is half the brother's mortgage without taxes, but the brother spends a significant chunk of his income on vices. The mother, instead of pushing the brother to cut back, suggests raising the author's rent. The author tells his mother to stay out of it, threatening to move out and let the mother and brother handle it.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider the relationships and responsibilities here. The author is essentially a tenant in his brother's home. The brother's financial habits are problematic, but the author is paying a fair amount of rent as per their agreement. The mother's advice to raise rent to cover the brother's vices seems to be a way to pass on the problem to the author. The author is standing up for his own financial boundaries, which is understandable. He's not responsible for his brother's addiction and shouldn't be expected to subsidize his vices. By setting a boundary and explaining his position, the author is protecting his own finances, which is reasonable.\n\nOn the other hand, the mother might think she's helping the brother by getting more money from the author. However, this approach doesn't address the root issues of the brother's substance abuse and work ethic. The author is in a position where he's already making sacrifices by living with a difficult situation. It's reasonable for him to decide that he can't support his brother's habits through increased rent. The threat to move out if the rent is raised is a logical consequence, as it removes the author from a situation where his money is being used to enable harmful behavior.\n\nConsidering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. He's maintaining his financial boundaries and prioritizing his own well-being. The mother's suggestion is exploitative, and the author is justified in pushing back. So the answer should be B.\n"
