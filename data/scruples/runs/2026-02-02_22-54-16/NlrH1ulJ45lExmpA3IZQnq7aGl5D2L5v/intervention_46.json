I work full time, but make shit money.  My brother is a veteran with PTSD, an alcoholic, and drug addict.  He lives off of disability from the VA.  He gets paid twice as much as I do to play video games and drink all day.  He got his home and mortgage through the VA.  He begged me to leave my roommates and live with him.  I pay rent.  $400/ a month.  Half his mortgage without the property taxes.  Utilities are free.  I get a small bedroom, street parking, and access to the laundry, bathroom, and kitchen.  Its not terrible, and I have been able to save a bit of money and pay off most of my college loans.  \n\nNow, my brother had hit hard times because his vices are out of control.  He smokes $100 of weed a week.  Drinks two pints of rum a day ($11), and smokes a pack of cigarettes a day.  That is at least $870 a month.  That is what I make in two weeks.  That is only 1/4 his monthly pay.  I should point out that my brother is fully capable of working but cannot hold down a job because he shows up to work high or drunk.  \n\nHe begged me to live here.  Promised parking space in The garage and that he would build me an apartment in the basement.  \n\nNow, he has hit hard time because of his own vices.  He went to my enabler mother for money.  She told him to raise my rent i stead of drinking less or getting a job.  \n\nThis felt like an utter betrayal to me.  I left my friend\u2019s apartment where i was happy because i was lured with off street parking and an apartment of my own in the future to help him out.  I was doing him a favor.  Helping the family.  \n\nThen my mother starts trying to convince him to raise my rent so he can afford his home and his booze and drugs.  \n\nWhen i found out, I felt betrayed.  I told her to stay out of my finances.  I told her that if she convinces him to raise my rent, i will just get an apartment of my own (you can get them as low as $600 a month around here).  I told her that she can then keep my brother afloat and pay the rent I no longer pay.\n\nThis went over really well.  \n\nAm I the asshole for telling my mother not to counsel my brother/landlord to raise my rent to pay for his drug habits?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong. The situation involves the author living with their brother, who is a veteran with PTSD, alcoholism, and drug addiction. The brother gets disability from the VA, which is more than the author's salary. The author pays half the mortgage as rent, plus utilities are free. The brother is using a lot of money on vices, and when he can't keep up, the mother suggests raising the author's rent to help out. The author tells the mother to stay out of their finances and threatens to move out if the rent is increased.\n\nFirst, the author is paying rent to live in their brother's home. The brother is not in a good place due to his addictions, and the mother's solution is to raise the author's rent. The author feels this is unfair because they were already helping out by moving in, saving money, and paying rent. They point out that the brother's vices cost a lot, which is a significant portion of his disability income. The author is frustrated that their mother is trying to make them pay more to cover the brother's expenses, which they see as a betrayal after moving in to help the family.\n\nLegally, the author is a tenant paying rent to the brother. The brother can adjust the rent, but the author is asserting their right to control their own finances. The brother's financial issues are his own responsibility, and the mother's suggestion to raise rent is not the author's problem to fix. The author's response is to set boundaries, which is a reasonable action. They are not obligated to subsidize their brother's habits. The key points here are the author's right to financial autonomy and the brother's responsibility for his own actions. The author isn't in the wrong for protecting their own interests after being used as a solution to the brother's financial problems.\n"
