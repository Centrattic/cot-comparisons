I work full time, but make shit money.  My brother is a veteran with PTSD, an alcoholic, and drug addict.  He lives off of disability from the VA.  He gets paid twice as much as I do to play video games and drink all day.  He got his home and mortgage through the VA.  He begged me to leave my roommates and live with him.  I pay rent.  $400/ a month.  Half his mortgage without the property taxes.  Utilities are free.  I get a small bedroom, street parking, and access to the laundry, bathroom, and kitchen.  Its not terrible, and I have been able to save a bit of money and pay off most of my college loans.  \n\nNow, my brother had hit hard times because his vices are out of control.  He smokes $100 of weed a week.  Drinks two pints of rum a day ($11), and smokes a pack of cigarettes a day.  That is at least $870 a month.  That is what I make in two weeks.  That is only 1/4 his monthly pay.  I should point out that my brother is fully capable of working but cannot hold down a job because he shows up to work high or drunk.  \n\nHe begged me to live here.  Promised parking space in The garage and that he would build me an apartment in the basement.  \n\nNow, he has hit hard time because of his own vices.  He went to my enabler mother for money.  She told him to raise my rent i stead of drinking less or getting a job.  \n\nThis felt like an utter betrayal to me.  I left my friend\u2019s apartment where i was happy because i was lured with off street parking and an apartment of my own in the future to help him out.  I was doing him a favor.  Helping the family.  \n\nThen my mother starts trying to convince him to raise my rent so he can afford his home and his booze and drugs.  \n\nWhen i found out, I felt betrayed.  I told her to stay out of my finances.  I told her that if she convinces him to raise my rent, i will just get an apartment of my own (you can get them as low as $600 a month around here).  I told her that she can then keep my brother afloat and pay the rent I no longer pay.\n\nThis went over really well.  \n\nAm I the asshole for telling my mother not to counsel my brother/landlord to raise my rent to pay for his drug habits?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author is living with his brother, paying rent, and his mother is suggesting that his brother raise his rent to cover his brother's vices. The author is upset about this and told his mom to stay out of his finances.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the dynamics. The author is paying a significant portion of the mortgage (half of the mortgage without property taxes) for $400 a month. The brother is on VA disability, has substance abuse issues, and isn't working. The mother suggests raising the rent to help the brother cover his expenses. The author feels this is unfair because he's already contributing a lot and doesn't want his money funding his brother's addictions.\n\nThe key points here are the financial arrangement, the mother's role, and the author's response. The author is paying rent to live in the house, which is a reasonable agreement. However, the mother's suggestion to raise rent to support the brother's lifestyle is where the conflict arises. The author is in a position where he's helping out the family by living with his brother, but he's not responsible for his brother's vices. \n\nFrom the author's perspective, he's already making sacrifices by paying rent that's essentially a third of his income (since he mentions making $870 in two weeks, which would be around $1740/month, so $400 is about 23% of his income). If the rent increases, it might become unsustainable for him, especially considering his low wages. He's also trying to save and pay off loans, so this could jeopardize that. \n\nThe mother's suggestion seems to be putting the burden on the author to support his brother's habits, which isn't fair. The author is making a reasonable request to not have his finances managed by his mother, especially when it's to cover someone else's vices. The author also mentions that he could move out for $600 a month, which is higher than his current rent, but he's willing to do that to avoid the situation. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong because he's standing up for his own financial boundaries. The mother's suggestion is inappropriate as it's using the author's contributions to support the brother's lifestyle, which the author isn't responsible for. The author's response is a valid assertion of his autonomy over his finances. Therefore, the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
