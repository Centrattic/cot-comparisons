      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a dinner where the author's best friend's new girlfriend criticizes his shirt, leading the author to respond with a harsh comment, causing the girlfriend to leave.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author mentions that the best friend introduced the girlfriend, and she immediately commented on his shirt being \"hideous.\" The shirt was a gift from his wife, which he now wears as his favorite. His wife's shocked reaction suggests that the author's response was unexpected and perhaps harsher than appropriate.\n\nThe key points here are the immediate reaction and the social dynamics. In social settings, especially when meeting someone for the first time, it's important to maintain politeness and respect. The girlfriend's comment was rude and dismissive, which could be seen as inconsiderate. However, the author's response of telling her to \"go fuck herself\" is a strong and offensive reply. While the girlfriend's comment was unkind, the author's reaction escalated the situation dramatically. \n\nEven if the shirt was a gift and the author felt personally slighted, responding with such a harsh insult in front of others, especially in a dinner setting, is socially unacceptable. It's important to consider the impact on the host (the best friend) and the potential damage to the friendship if the girlfriend leaves because of this incident. The author's decision to respond in that manner might have been a split-second reaction, but the consequences could be long-lasting. \n\nAdditionally, the wife's shock indicates that the author's response was not in line with typical social expectations. While the girlfriend was rude, the appropriate response would be to address the comment politely or let it go, rather than retaliate with an insult. The author's actions led to a tense situation, resulting in the girlfriend leaving and possibly straining the friendship with the best friend. \n\nTherefore, even though the girlfriend was rude, the author's response was excessive and inappropriate. The wrong here lies with the author for not handling the situation with more tact and consideration for the broader social context and relationships involved.\n"
