      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author's best friend's new girlfriend criticized the author's shirt as \"hideous\" right after meeting them. The author then told her to \"go fuck herself,\" leading to her storming off and the couple leaving. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the scenario. The key points are: the girlfriend's immediate criticism of the shirt, the author's emotional response, and the consequences. The author mentions that the shirt was a Christmas gift from his wife, making it significant. The friend's girlfriend's comment seems rude and could have been a mistake, perhaps not intentional. The author's response, while harsh, was a direct confrontation. \n\nNow, considering etiquette and social norms, interrupting someone with a derogatory comment is unkind. However, the author's reaction of telling her to \"go fuck herself\" is also inappropriate. Even if the comment was hurtful, responding with such a strong insult is not the socially acceptable way to handle it. The situation escalated quickly, and the author's action likely caused embarrassment for both the friend and his girlfriend. \n\nThe author's wife's shock also indicates that the response was unexpected and possibly over the top. While the girlfriend's comment was rude, the author's response was equally unkind and led to the breakup of the evening. In such scenarios, the expected response would be to address the issue calmly or let it go, rather than using a vulgar reply. \n\nSo, even though the girlfriend made a mistake, the author's response was also inconsiderate and contributed to the conflict. Therefore, the author is partly at fault here. The answer should be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
