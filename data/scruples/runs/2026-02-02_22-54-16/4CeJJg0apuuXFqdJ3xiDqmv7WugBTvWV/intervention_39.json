      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of a \"Am I the Asshole?\" story is in the wrong. The situation is that the author, along with his wife, had dinner with his best friend and his new girlfriend. The girlfriend immediately criticized the author's flannel shirt as \"hideous,\" so he told her to go fuck herself, leading to her storming off and the friend leaving.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The girlfriend's comment was direct and disrespectful, but was it justified? The author mentions he doesn't like flannels but that the shirt was a Christmas gift from his wife. The girlfriend's response was abrupt and possibly rude. The author's reaction was to tell her to go fuck herself, which is a strong and offensive response.\n\nIn social norms, it's generally expected to handle personal criticism with some level of composure, even if the criticism is harsh. The author's immediate and aggressive retort could be seen as the bigger issue. While the girlfriend was rude, the author's response was equally disrespectful and contributed to the conflict escalating. \n\nThere's also the context of the situation. It was a first meeting, so maintaining politeness is important. The author's reaction might have been a defense of his choice to wear the shirt, but the way he responded was inappropriate. The girlfriend's comment was unkind, but the author's reaction was also unkind. \n\nHowever, some might argue that the girlfriend's comment was the initial provocation, and the author was standing up for himself. But even so, telling someone to \"go fuck themselves\" is typically considered the wrong way to handle such a situation. \n\nConsidering social norms and conflict resolution, the author's response is more likely to be seen as the problem here. So, the answer would be that he is the asshole, which is option A.\n"
