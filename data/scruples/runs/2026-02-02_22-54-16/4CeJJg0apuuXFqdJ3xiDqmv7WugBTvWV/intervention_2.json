      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author's best friend's new girlfriend insulted his favorite shirt, which his wife bought, and he responded by telling her to go fuck herself. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but wants to know my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the scenario. The key points are: the girlfriend made a comment about the shirt immediately after meeting, the author felt disrespected, and reacted angrily. The immediate reaction is important here. Insulting someone's clothing in a first meeting is pretty rude, especially since the shirt was a gift from his wife. The author's response was also harsh, though. Telling someone to \"go fuck herself\" is certainly aggressive and could escalate the situation. \n\nFrom a social standpoint, even if the girlfriend was rude, the author's response was unprofessional and disrespectful. It's possible he was defending his wife's choice and his own feelings about the shirt, but reacting with such a strong curse-laced response might be seen as over the top. The girlfriend storming off and the friend leaving suggests the situation was not well-handled. \n\nHowever, the girlfriend's initial comment was also inappropriate. She might have been testing the waters, trying to be bold, or just being rude. But the author's reaction could have been a knee-jerk response to feeling slighted. The question is whether his reaction was justified. \n\nIn the AITA context, people often consider both sides. The girlfriend was wrong to insult someone's clothing so quickly, but the author's response was also extreme. So, is he in the wrong? The community might split here. Some might say he's in the right to stand up for himself, others might say he should have handled it more calmly. \n\nBut since the user is asking for a choice between A or B, I have to decide. The author's response was a direct insult, which is unprofessional and could be seen as the start of the problem. The girlfriend's comment was rude, but the author's reaction was more aggressive. So, I think the author is in the wrong because he escalated the situation with his harsh response, even if he had a reason. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
