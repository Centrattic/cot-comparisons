      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this story is in the wrong. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The person and their wife went to dinner with their best friend and his new girlfriend. The girlfriend immediately criticized the author's flannel shirt as \"hideous,\" even though the author isn't a fan of flannels but made an exception because his wife bought it for Christmas. Then the author told her to go \"fuck herself,\" leading to the girlfriend leaving and the friend following her.\n\nThe question is whether the author is the asshole here. The user thinks they're not in the wrong. Let me think through the possible angles.\n\nOn one hand, the girlfriend's comment was rude and dismissive. She insulted the author's choice of clothing right away, which could be seen as inconsiderate. The author's response was a harsh retort, which led to the girlfriend leaving. But was that an appropriate reaction?\n\nThe author's wife bought the shirt for Christmas, so there's a personal connection there. The girlfriend's comment might have been a way to assert dominance or show disapproval of the author's style. But that's speculative.\n\nNow, the author's response was to tell her to go fuck herself. That's a strong reaction. Even if the comment was rude, responding with such a vulgar retort might be seen as escalating the situation. However, the girlfriend's initial comment was also a direct insult. The author might have felt disrespected, especially considering the shirt was a gift from their wife.\n\nBut is it acceptable to respond to an insult with a worse one? In social norms, while the girlfriend's comment was rude, the author's response is even more offensive. People usually aren't expected to respond to insults with insults, especially in a public setting. The author's action caused the girlfriend to leave, which could be seen as the author's fault for not handling the situation more gracefully.\n\nAlternatively, some might argue that the girlfriend's comment was the real issue. She made an immediate judgment, which could indicate she's not respectful. But the author's reaction was still inappropriate. Even if someone else is in the wrong, responding with a curse-laden retort is not considered mature or respectful.\n\nSo, while the girlfriend's comment was the trigger, the author's response is more likely to be the problem. They could have handled it differently\u2014maybe by calmly pointing out the rudeness without the vulgarity. The author's action might be seen as the asshole move because it's a harsh and disrespectful reply, even if the other person started it.\n\nTherefore, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong (A).\n"
