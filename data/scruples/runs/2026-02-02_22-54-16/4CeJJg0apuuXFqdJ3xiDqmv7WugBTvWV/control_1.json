      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The scenario is that the author's best friend's new girlfriend criticized his flannel shirt right after meeting them. The author then told her to go fuck herself, leading to her leaving and the friend following.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms and expected behavior. Generally, responding to a personal insult with a harsh retort like that is considered rude and inappropriate. Even if the shirt was a gift from his wife, which adds a layer of personal value, the immediate reaction of telling someone to \"go fuck herself\" is aggressive. \n\nBut then, maybe the girlfriend's comment was out of line too. Insulting someone's clothing upon first meeting is pretty rude. However, even if she was rude, the author's response escalated the situation. The appropriate response would be to address the comment calmly, maybe express that the comment was unwelcome, rather than a direct insult. \n\nThe author's wife is present, so his reaction could have been embarrassing for her as well. The friend's reaction is a \"what just happened\" look, indicating surprise at the author's outburst. The consequence is that the girlfriend left, which might strain the friend's relationship. \n\nSo, while the girlfriend's behavior was rude, the author's response was even more so. People are expected to handle insults without reciprocating with aggression. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong here. Answer A.\n"
