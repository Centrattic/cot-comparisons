      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author's best friend introduced his new girlfriend, who immediately criticized the author's shirt as \"hideous.\" The author then told her to go \"fuck herself,\" leading to her leaving and the friend following.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms and appropriateness. When someone meets someone else's partner, especially in a dinner setting, being rude is generally frowned upon. The girlfriend's comment was probably meant to be a negative comment, and the author's response was even more offensive. \n\nThe author's reaction was direct and aggressive. Telling someone to go \"fuck herself\" is a strong insult and not the kind of response one would expect in a social setting. It could be seen as escalating the situation unnecessarily. Even if the shirt was unflattering, responding with such a strong insult is likely to be seen as inconsiderate and disrespectful, especially since the person was the best friend's girlfriend. \n\nAlso, the author mentions that the shirt was a gift from his wife, which he now loves. Maybe that's why he took the comment personally. But that doesn't justify the response. It's reasonable to expect that someone might have an opinion about clothing, but responding with such hostility is beyond what's socially acceptable. \n\nThe immediate consequences were that the girlfriend left, which could have caused tension with the best friend. The author's actions might have jeopardized the friend's new relationship, which is a significant outcome. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's comment was also out of line. Criticizing someone's appearance right after meeting them is impolite. But even so, the author's response was much harsher. Both parties might have acted inappropriately, but the question is whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nSince the author escalated the situation with a vulgar response leading to a negative outcome, it's more likely that the author is at fault. The appropriate response would have been to address the comment calmly or maybe make a lighthearted joke, not a direct insult. Therefore, the answer is probably A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
