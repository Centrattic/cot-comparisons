      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their best friend's new girlfriend to go fuck herself. The situation is that the girlfriend called out the author's shirt as hideous, and the author responded angrily.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms and appropriate behavior. In most social contexts, responding to someone's criticism with a harsh insult like \"go fuck yourself\" is considered rude and unacceptable. Especially in a situation that's supposed to be a positive meeting between friends and their partners. The author's reaction was immediate and aggressive, leading to the girlfriend leaving and the friend following her. \n\nBut there's also the context of the shirt being a gift from the wife. The author might have felt that the girlfriend was disrespecting not just him but his wife's choice. However, the appropriate response would be to address the comment calmly rather than with an insult. \n\nThe key points here are: the public setting, the immediate and harsh response, and the potential damage to the friendship. Even if the author felt disrespected, reacting with an insult is generally seen as wrong. The friend's reaction (a look of shock) and the girlfriend leaving suggest that the response was out of line. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is likely that the author is in the wrong. They could have handled the situation better by not responding with anger. The correct choice would be A.\n"
