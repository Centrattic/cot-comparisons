      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this scenario is in the wrong. The situation is that the author's best friend's new girlfriend criticized his shirt, which he really likes because his wife gave it to him. The author responded by telling her to go fuck herself, leading to a fallout.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the social norms here. Insulting someone's clothing is rude, but reacting with a harsh insult can escalate the situation. The girlfriend's comment was probably unnecessary and inconsiderate, especially in a social setting where people are meeting. However, the author's response of \"go fuck yourself\" is clearly aggressive and inappropriate. \n\nEven though the shirt was a gift from his wife, responding with such a strong insult is unprofessional and disrespectful. The context is a first meeting between his wife, himself, and the new girlfriend. The situation could have been handled better, maybe by addressing the comment in a calmer way or later talking to his friend instead of the girlfriend directly. \n\nThe fact that his wife looked shocked suggests that the response was unexpected and maybe even offensive. The outcome was that the girlfriend left, which could have been avoided with a different reaction. So, while the girlfriend's comment was rude, the author's response was not the right way to handle it. Therefore, he is in the wrong.\n"
