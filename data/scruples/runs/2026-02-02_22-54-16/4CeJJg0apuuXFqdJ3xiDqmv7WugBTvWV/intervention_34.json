      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of a Reddit-style \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author's best friend's new girlfriend immediately criticized his flannel shirt as \"hideous\" after a greeting, even though it was a Christmas gift from his wife. The author responded by telling her to go fuck herself, she left, and the friend followed. The user thinks the author isn't wrong but wants a second opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points here. The immediate reaction is to assess if the author's response was appropriate. The girlfriend's comment was rude and disrespectful, especially in a social setting where meeting new people usually requires some politeness. However, the author's response was also harsh and offensive. Both parties acted in a way that escalated the situation.\n\nNow, considering social norms and conflict resolution. It's common to expect that people, especially in new relationships, might try to be polite or at least neutral. But the girlfriend's comment was a direct personal attack. The author's reaction, while strong, was a direct response to being insulted. The question is whether the author overreacted.\n\nAnother angle: the context of the meeting. The post says it's \"for the first time,\" so maybe the girlfriend was trying to assert herself or test boundaries. But that's not an excuse for being rude. The author, on the other hand, might have felt disrespected and snapped. But public shaming or using a curse-laden phrase could be seen as inappropriate, even if the other person was wrong.\n\nAlso, the relationship dynamics. The author is married, and the shirt was a gift from his wife. The girlfriend's comment might have been perceived as attacking the wife's choice, which could add to the offense. However, the author's response might have been too direct and led to the friend leaving, which could affect their friendship.\n\nIs there a right answer? Well, both actions are problematic. The girlfriend shouldn't have made a harsh comment, but the author's response of telling her to go fuck herself is also unprofessional and disrespectful. The question is about who is more in the wrong. In these situations, even if someone is rude, responding with equal rudeness usually isn't the right approach. The author could have handled it better, maybe by calmly expressing that they found the comment offensive. Instead, he chose an aggressive retort, which likely caused the friend to distance himself.\n\nSo, while the girl's comment was definitely inconsiderate, the author's action was also a direct and harsh response that probably wasn't the best. Therefore, the author might share some fault in escalating the situation. So the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because his response was not appropriate, even if provoked.\n"
