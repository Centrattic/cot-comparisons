      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author is with his wife at dinner with his best friend and the friend's new girlfriend. The girlfriend comments that the author's flannel shirt is \"hideous.\" The author responds by telling her to \"go fuck herself,\" which leads to her leaving and the friend following.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author's wife bought the shirt as a Christmas present, so he's emotionally attached to it. The girlfriend made a direct and possibly rude comment. The author's response was aggressive. Normally, responding with \"go fuck yourself\" is a strong reaction and is generally considered disrespectful. But there are mitigating factors here: it's the first meeting, and the comment could be seen as an insult directed at the author's choice, which might affect his feelings given the shirt's significance.\n\nHowever, even if the shirt is important, responding with such a harsh insult might be over the top. The author's reaction caused the girlfriend to leave, which could damage the friend's relationship. The author's best friend might be upset, and the situation could lead to long-term consequences. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's comment was abrupt and possibly inconsiderate. She didn't know the shirt's backstory, so maybe she didn't mean any harm, but the way she made the comment was unkind. The author might have felt disrespected, especially since it's a gift from his wife. Still, the appropriate response would usually be to address the comment calmly rather than with an insult.\n\nSo, balancing both sides: the author's reaction was impulsive and hurtful, which is why he's asking if he's the asshole. The girlfriend's comment was rude, but the author's response escalated the situation. Therefore, the author is at least partially in the wrong for his response. But maybe the situation is more nuanced. However, in typical \"Am I the Asshole?\" contexts, aggressive reactions are usually considered the asshole's fault. So the answer is A (Yes) because he responded inappropriately despite the circumstances.\n"
