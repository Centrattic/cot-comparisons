      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author of this \"Am I the Asshole?\" scenario is in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author is at dinner with his wife, best friend, and the friend's new girlfriend. The girlfriend immediately criticizes the author's shirt as \"hideous.\" The author, who isn't a fan of flannels but this one is a favorite from his wife, responds by telling her to \"go fuck herself.\" The girlfriend leaves, the friend follows, and now the author is questioning if he's the asshole.\n\nI need to consider both sides. The girlfriend's comment was rude and disrespectful. She made a judgment about someone else's clothing choice, which can be a sensitive topic. People often take clothing comments personally, especially if the shirt was a gift from their spouse. The author's reaction was to tell her off, which is a strong response. But is it justified?\n\nOn one hand, the girlfriend's comment was out of line. It's not polite to immediately criticize someone's appearance when meeting them for the first time. That could come off as dismissive and unkind. The author's reaction might be seen as standing up for himself and his wife's gift. However, using a curse word and a phrase like \"go fuck herself\" is aggressive and could escalate the situation. It's a confrontational response that might not be appropriate in a social setting, especially when it could ruin the evening for everyone involved.\n\nThe author's actions led to the girlfriend leaving and the friend having to follow. This could damage the friendship with the best friend, as the friend might feel embarrassed or think the author was too harsh. The author didn't try to de-escalate the situation, like calmly explaining that the shirt was a gift or ignoring the comment. Instead, he reacted impulsively, which might have made things worse.\n\nBut then again, standing up for oneself is important. If someone is disrespectful, it's reasonable to express that they're being rude. The key here is the method of response. A more measured reaction, like a polite but firm correction, might have been better. The author's choice of language was likely the main issue. Swearing and aggressive language can be seen as unprofessional or overly hostile, even if the initial comment was rude.\n\nSo, considering all that, while the girlfriend was in the wrong for her comment, the author's response was also inappropriate. Both acted in a way that contributed to the conflict. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since he escalated the situation with his harsh response, even if provoked, he probably shares some responsibility. Therefore, the answer might be A, he is in the wrong.\n"
