      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The scenario is that the author, along with his wife, went to dinner with his best friend and met his new girlfriend. The girlfriend immediately called the author's shirt \"hideous,\" which the author didn't like. Then he told her to go fuck herself, she left, and the friend followed. The author is asking if he's the asshole here.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The key points here are the girlfriend's comment and the author's response. The girlfriend made a direct and possibly rude comment about his shirt. The author, who isn't a fan of flannels but the shirt was a gift from his wife, responded with an insult.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author's reaction was appropriate. Generally, responding to an insult with another insult is not considered polite or mature. Even if the shirt was a gift, the girlfriend's comment might have been intended as a joke or a compliment in a different way, but the author took it personally. The immediate and aggressive response could be seen as overreacting. However, some might argue that the girlfriend's comment was also rude without much provocation. \n\nThe author's wife's shocked reaction suggests that his response was unexpected and perhaps out of line. In social situations, especially first meetings, it's important to maintain politeness. The girlfriend's comment could be seen as disrespectful, but the author's response escalated the situation. \n\nConsidering cultural norms, telling someone to \"go fuck herself\" is definitely a strong response. While the girlfriend's comment was impolite, the author's reply is not a solution. There might be a debate on whether both parties are at fault, but the question is specifically about the author. The options are A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no). \n\nIn most cases, responding with such a strong insult would be considered inappropriate, even if provoked. The author could have chosen a calmer approach, perhaps with a witty remark or a change of subject. Therefore, the answer would likely be A, the author is in the wrong for his response.\n"
