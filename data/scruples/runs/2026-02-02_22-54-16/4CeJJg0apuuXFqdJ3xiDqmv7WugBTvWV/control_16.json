      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who told their best friend's new girlfriend to \"go fuck herself\" is in the wrong. The situation is that the girlfriend criticized his flannel shirt right after meeting him. The shirt was a Christmas gift from his wife, which he now likes a lot. He responded with a harsh insult, leading the girlfriend to leave and the friend to follow her out.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms and appropriateness. Insulting someone, even if provoked, is generally considered rude. The context here is a first meeting, which is a delicate situation. The girlfriend's comment about the shirt being hideous was a personal attack, but responding with a swear word and telling her to go \"fuck herself\" is aggressive and unprofessional. It's a clear escalation.\n\nThen, the shirt being a gift from his wife adds another layer. It's possible he felt a personal slight not just to himself but to his wife. However, that doesn't justify a harsh response. The wife's shocked reaction suggests maybe he overreacted. \n\nIn social interactions, especially with new people, maintaining respect is key. Even if someone is rude, the appropriate response is usually to address the comment calmly or not engage. The author's reaction caused the situation to deteriorate immediately, leading to the girlfriend leaving and the friend being upset. \n\nThere's also the aspect of being a guest in someone else's social circle. The author's actions could have embarrassed the friend and disrupted a planned meeting. Friends might expect a certain level of decorum, especially when their relationships are involved. \n\nSo, from a general perspective, the author's response was inappropriate. It's about how you handle offensive comments. While the girlfriend's comment was rude, the author's response was even more so. Therefore, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong.\n"
