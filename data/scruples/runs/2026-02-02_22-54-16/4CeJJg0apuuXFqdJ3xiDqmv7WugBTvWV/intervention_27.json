      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling his best friend's new girlfriend to \"go fuck herself\" after she criticized his shirt. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the context: The author and his wife had dinner with his best friend and his new girlfriend. The girlfriend immediately criticized the shirt the author was wearing, calling it \"hideous.\" The shirt was a gift from his wife, which he now considers his favorite. The author then told the girlfriend to \"go fuck herself,\" leading her to leave, and his friend followed her, ending the dinner. The author is seeking advice on whether he's the asshole (AITA).\n\nThe user's initial thought is that the author isn't in the wrong. Let me consider both sides. \n\nOn one hand, the girlfriend's comment was rude and dismissive. She made a judgment about his clothing in front of his wife and friend. The shirt was a gift, so there might be added emotional value. The author's reaction, while harsh, could be seen as a defense of his choice and a stand against being disrespected.\n\nOn the other hand, responding with a curse-laden remark is definitely aggressive and could be seen as inappropriate. It's a public setting, and such a response could escalate tensions and harm relationships. The girlfriend was new, so maybe her comment was just a personality clash or an attempt to make a bold impression. The author's reaction might have been over the top, even if the comment was rude.\n\nThe key factors here are the nature of the exchange and the social context. The girlfriend's comment was rude, but the author's response was equally, if not more, offensive. In social situations, how we respond to rudeness matters. While the author might feel wronged, using a strong curse word in retaliation could cut off the possibility of a polite resolution. Also, considering that this is the best friend's partner, the author's action might affect his friendship and the dynamic with his friend.\n\nHowever, the shirt being a gift from his wife adds another layer. The comment could have been perceived as an insult to his wife's choice, hence a personal attack. The author might feel that defending the shirt was defending his wife's gift. But the way he did it was confrontational.\n\nIn terms of social norms, while it's okay to stand up for oneself, the method here was extreme. The phrase \"go fuck yourself\" is a strong and often considered disrespectful or aggressive, which can be seen as the author overreacting. The girlfriend's comment, while rude, didn't necessarily warrant such a response. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author might be in the wrong because he escalated the situation with a harsh response. Even if the girlfriend was rude, responding with aggression doesn't resolve the issue and can damage relationships. The appropriate action might have been to address the comment calmly or let it go. Therefore, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
