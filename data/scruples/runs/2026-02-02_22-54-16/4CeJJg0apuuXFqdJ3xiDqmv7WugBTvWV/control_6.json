      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the person who told their best friend's girlfriend to \"go fuck herself\" is wrong. The situation is that the girlfriend insulted the author's shirt, which was a gift from his wife. The author responded angrily, causing the girlfriend to leave and the friend to follow her out.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms and appropriate behavior. Insulting someone's appearance, especially when it's a gift from a spouse, is a big deal. The girlfriend's comment was rude, but yelling at her is a strong reaction. However, the author's response was even more aggressive. \n\nThe key points here are: the girlfriend made a direct insult, the author responded with a harsh retort, and the situation escalated quickly. Even though the girlfriend was rude, the author's response was not measured. In most social situations, responding with a curse and a threat is not acceptable. It's important to consider if the author could have handled it more calmly, maybe by addressing the issue privately or not engaging at all. \n\nAlso, the impact on the relationship with the best friend is a factor. The friend might feel caught between the two, especially since the author's wife was present. The author's action could strain the friendship and create tension. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's initial comment was unkind, so maybe the author felt justified. But even so, the response was extreme. Socially, people are expected to handle insults without responding with aggression. The fact that the shirt was a gift from the wife adds emotional weight, which might explain the anger but doesn't excuse the harsh reply.\n\nIn conclusion, while the girlfriend was in the wrong for the initial insult, the author's response was definitely inappropriate. The correct answer is that the author is in the wrong because they escalated the situation in a socially unacceptable manner.\n"
