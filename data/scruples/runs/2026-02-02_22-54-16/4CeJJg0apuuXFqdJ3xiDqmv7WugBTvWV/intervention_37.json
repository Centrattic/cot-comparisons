      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for telling their best friend's new girlfriend to go fuck herself. The situation is that the girlfriend criticized his shirt, which was a gift from his wife, and he responded angrily, causing her to leave.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author met the girlfriend for the first time, and she was rude about his clothing. That's pretty harsh. He was probably defensive since it was a gift from his wife, adding emotional weight. His reaction was immediate and strong, which might be seen as overreacting. But was he wrong?\n\nOn one hand, responding with a curse like \"go fuck herself\" is definitely rude and could be seen as disrespectful. Even if she was rude first, his response was aggressive and might have escalated the situation unnecessarily. It's possible he could have handled it better, maybe by ignoring the comment or addressing it calmly.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's comment was also out of line. Calling someone's clothes hideous right after meeting them isn't polite. The author might have felt disrespected, especially because the shirt was a meaningful gift. His reaction might be a result of feeling attacked, but the way he responded was inappropriate.\n\nNow, considering social norms and typical expectations. People usually try to remain respectful even in conflicts. The author's response was hostile, which is why the girlfriend left. So, even if the girlfriend was rude first, the author's reaction was not the right approach. He's responsible for his own behavior regardless of the other person's actions.\n\nSo, the answer is likely A (yes, he's in the wrong) because his response was unprofessional and disrespectful, leading to a negative outcome. Even though the girlfriend was rude, his reaction wasn't appropriate. People are expected to maintain composure and not respond with aggression, especially in social settings where others might be present.\n"
