      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong. The situation is that the author's best friend's new girlfriend called his shirt hideous, and he responded by telling her to go fuck herself, leading to her leaving.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation from different angles. The author was in a social setting with his wife and best friend. The girlfriend made a comment about his shirt, which he finds offensive. He reacts angrily, leading to her storming off and the friend leaving.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? Well, responding with a curse like \"go fuck yourself\" is definitely inappropriate and disrespectful, especially in a first meeting. Even if the girlfriend was rude, the author's reaction was extreme. He could have handled it more diplomatically, like changing the subject or not responding at all. His action caused the friend and girlfriend to leave, which might have ruined the dinner and strained his friendship. Also, considering his wife is present and the shirt was a Christmas gift, maybe he overreacted out of defensiveness. On the other hand, the girlfriend's comment was unkind, so maybe there's some provocation. But even so, the author's response was not the right way to handle it. So the answer is A, he is in the wrong.\n"
