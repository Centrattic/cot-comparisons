      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author of the Reddit-style post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author's best friend's new girlfriend insulted his shirt, which his wife bought him, and he responded by telling her to go fuck herself. The friend and girlfriend left after that.\n\nI need to figure out if the author was wrong. So, first, the girlfriend made a comment about his shirt, which he didn't like. He reacted strongly, using a very harsh and offensive phrase. The wife was shocked. The friend left with the girlfriend.\n\nHmm. Insulting someone's choice of clothing can be rude, but the context matters. The shirt was a gift from his wife, which he now likes. The girlfriend's comment might have been a personal attack on his partner's gift. But even so, responding with \"go fuck yourself\" is a strong reaction. It's a public setting, so that kind of language could be seen as inappropriate. The author's action might have caused the friend to lose his girlfriend, which is a big consequence. \n\nBut the girlfriend was the one who made the initial comment. However, the way he responded was extremely confrontational. Even if she was rude, telling her to go fuck herself is not a mature or respectful way to handle it. It could be seen as escalating the situation unnecessarily. The author should have handled it with more composure, maybe by calmly expressing his dislike of the comment or changing the subject. \n\nSo, even though the girlfriend was wrong to insult him, the author's response was also inconsiderate and contributed to the fallout. Therefore, he might be in the wrong because his reaction was disproportionate and hurtful.\n"
