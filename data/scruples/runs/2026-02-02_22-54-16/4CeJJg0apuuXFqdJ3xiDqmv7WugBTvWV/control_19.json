      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their best friend's new girlfriend to \"go fuck herself\" after she called his shirt hideous.\n\nFirst, the situation: They met the new girlfriend for the first time. The author's choice of shirt, bought by his wife, was criticized. He responded with a harsh insult, leading to the girlfriend leaving and the friend following. The question is whether the author was wrong in his reaction.\n\nPossible angles to consider: Social norms suggest that interrupting and insulting someone, even if they were rude, is inappropriate. However, the girl's comment was also disrespectful. The author's reaction might be seen as a defensive overreaction. Also, considering the context\u2014meeting a friend's partner for the first time\u2014it's important to maintain composure to avoid damaging relationships. The wife's shock indicates that the response was unexpected and possibly inappropriate. The key points are the immediate insult in response to a personal slight, and the consequences (girlfriend leaving, friend leaving). Most people would argue that the author's response was too extreme, even if the girlfriend was rude. So, the answer is likely A (author is in the wrong).\n"
