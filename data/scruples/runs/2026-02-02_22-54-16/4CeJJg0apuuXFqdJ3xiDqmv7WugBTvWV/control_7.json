      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their best friend's new girlfriend to go fuck herself after she called his shirt hideous.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author's best friend introduced his new girlfriend. She immediately criticized the author's shirt, which his wife bought him. He responded with a harsh insult, leading her to storm off and them leaving.\n\nSo, the key points here. The author's reaction was immediate and confrontational. The girlfriend's comment was a direct insult, but was it reasonable for him to respond with such a strong reaction in public? Especially considering the context of meeting someone for the first time. \n\nAlso, the shirt was a gift from his wife, which adds emotional value. But does that justify his response? Probably not. Even if someone gives you something you don't like, it's not a valid reason to be rude. \n\nThe author's friend probably felt embarrassed, given that he followed her out. The wife was shocked, which indicates the response was unexpected and perhaps overly aggressive. \n\nThe main issue here is the appropriateness of the response. Insulting someone in public, especially when they're a new partner of a close friend, is likely to escalate tensions. The author didn't de-escalate the situation; instead, he made it worse. \n\nEven if the girlfriend's comment was rude, there are better ways to handle it than to respond with a curse-laden insult. Maintaining composure and addressing the issue respectfully would have been more constructive, even if it's difficult. \n\nSo, while the girlfriend's comment was inappropriate, the author's response was also inexcusable. The key factor is that he chose a hostile reaction in a social setting, which is not acceptable regardless of the provocation. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
