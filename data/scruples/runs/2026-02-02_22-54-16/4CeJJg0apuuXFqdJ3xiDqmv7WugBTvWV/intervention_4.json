      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. So the user is asking if the person who told their best friend's new girlfriend to \"go fuck herself\" is in the wrong. The situation is that the girlfriend insulted the author's shirt, which was a gift from his wife, and he snapped at her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The girlfriend immediately criticized his shirt, which is a personal item given by his wife. That's a sensitive point. The author's reaction was to tell her to go fuck herself, which is definitely harsh. But maybe the context of the shirt being a gift and the girlfriend's immediate judgment could be seen as rude on her part.\n\nHowever, the key issue here is how the author responded. Even if the girlfriend was rude, the author's response was offensive and likely escalated the situation. In social interactions, even if someone is insulting you, responding with a harsh insult is usually not the best approach. It leads to conflict and can ruin relationships. The author's best friend might be upset because his girlfriend's behavior caused this reaction, and the author's response probably made things worse.\n\nAlso, the author's wife's reaction (shock) suggests that the response was unexpected and possibly inappropriate. Even if the girlfriend was at fault, the author's choice of words was unprofessional and disrespectful. People are expected to maintain some level of decorum, especially in a social setting with friends and their partners.\n\nSo, while the girlfriend's comment was rude, the author's response was also inappropriate. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because he didn't handle the situation with the necessary tact. The answer should be A for Yes.\n"
