      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is that he was at dinner with his wife and best friend, meeting the friend's new girlfriend. She immediately criticized his flannel shirt, which his wife bought him. He responded by telling her to go fuck herself, leading to her leaving. The user wants to know if he's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The girlfriend insulted his shirt right after meeting. He was wearing a shirt bought by his wife, which he might feel is personal. He reacted angrily, leading to her storming off and the friend leaving. \n\nNow, considering social norms. Insulting someone's clothing is rude, but reacting by telling someone to go fuck themselves is even more offensive. The situation could have been handled better. Even if the shirt was a gift, a better response would be to explain that it's from his wife or just ignore the comment. Publicly responding with a curse might escalate the situation. \n\nThe main question is whether his reaction was proportional. Insulting someone is bad, but the response of telling her to go fuck herself is aggressive and disrespectful. It's unlikely to resolve the conflict and instead causes immediate damage to the social interaction. \n\nAlso, the fact that his wife was present might have added pressure. He might have been trying to defend his choice in front of her, but the reaction was extreme. The friend's confusion and the girlfriend leaving suggest that the response was not appropriate. \n\nSo, while the girlfriend's comment was rude, the author's reaction went beyond a polite response. He could have addressed it without being offensive. Therefore, he's likely in the wrong here. Answer A.\n"
