      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong after telling his best friend's new girlfriend to go fuck herself. The situation is that the girlfriend criticized his shirt, which he really likes because his wife gave it to him. He responded with a harsh insult, leading to her leaving and the friend following.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms and etiquette. Insulting someone in person, even if they were rude first, is generally considered poor behavior. The author's reaction was immediate and aggressive, which could be seen as overreacting. However, the girlfriend's initial comment was also rude, so there's a mutual respect issue here.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but maybe that's because they see the girlfriend's comment as the trigger. However, the author's response was to tell her to go fuck herself, which is a strong and offensive reply. Even if the girlfriend was rude, using such a harsh retort might escalate the situation unnecessarily. \n\nAlso, considering the context: it's a first meeting, and the author's wife is present. His response might have embarrassed his wife and caused a scene. The friend's reaction was confusion, indicating that the author's response was unexpected and possibly inappropriate. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's comment was about his shirt, which is a personal choice. Dismissing someone's choice of clothing can be hurtful, but responding with an insult isn't the best approach. The author could have handled it more diplomatically, maybe by ignoring the comment or making a light-hearted response instead of an aggressive one.\n\nIn terms of social expectations, people are generally expected to maintain composure and not respond with insults, even when provoked. The author's reaction might be seen as a breach of etiquette. So, even though the girlfriend was rude, the author's response was also inappropriate. Therefore, the answer is likely A, that the author is in the wrong.\n"
