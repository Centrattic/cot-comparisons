      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who told their best friend's new girlfriend to \"go fuck herself\" is in the wrong. The scenario is a dinner where the girlfriend immediately criticized the author's shirt, which he found offensive because his wife bought it for him. He responded with a harsh insult, leading to the girlfriend leaving and the friend following.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms and appropriate behavior in such situations. The girlfriend's comment about the shirt being \"hideous\" might be seen as rude, especially in a first meeting. People often take fashion choices personally, so her comment could have been dismissive or disrespectful. However, the author's response was to tell her to \"go fuck herself,\" which is a strong and vulgar reaction. That's not a typical way to respond to a compliment or criticism, even if the comment was unwelcome.\n\nNext, the impact of the author's actions. By responding with such a strong insult, he likely escalated the situation immediately. The girlfriend left, and the friend left with her. This suggests that the author's reaction had significant consequences, possibly damaging the friendship and the new relationship. While the girlfriend's comment was inappropriate, the author's response was also unprofessional and could be seen as lacking in conflict resolution skills.\n\nThen there's the context of the relationship. The author is friends with the boyfriend, so his reaction might have been more intense because he felt protective of his wife's gift or the friendship. However, using a vulgar response in a public setting, especially in front of his wife, might not be the best way to handle the situation. It's possible that a more measured response could have defused the situation, like a polite disagreement or a light-hearted joke.\n\nAlso, considering that the shirt was a gift from his wife, the author might have felt that the girlfriend was undermining his wife in a subtle way. That could add to the emotional charge, but it still doesn't justify a harsh insult. The key here is whether the author's response was proportionate. A direct insult from the girlfriend might not warrant an equally direct insult from him; maintaining respect, even in conflict, is usually advised.\n\nIn terms of social etiquette, interrupting someone with a vulgar comment is generally frowned upon. It's important to manage one's reactions, especially in situations where maintaining good relations is important. The author's action might have been a moment of anger, but in hindsight, it's clear that such a response is not acceptable in polite company.\n\nSo, while the girlfriend's comment was rude, the author's response was equally unbecoming. Therefore, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong (A) because his reaction was inappropriate and escalated the conflict unnecessarily.\n"
