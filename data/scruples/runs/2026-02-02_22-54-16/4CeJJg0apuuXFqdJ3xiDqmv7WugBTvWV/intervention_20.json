My buddy introduced her and greet each other and then immediately after she looks me up and down and tell me that the shirt I\u2019m wearing is \u201chideous\u201d. \n\nNow I will not lie, I\u2019m not a fan of flannels buuuut my wife bought me this one for Christmas. Which means this is now my favorite shirt. \n\nI notice a look of shock on my wife\u2019s face and then I looked this girl dead in the eye and told her to go fuck herself. \n\nShe storms off and my buddy gives me this what just happened look and then follows her and they eventually leave. \n\nAm I The Asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong after telling their best friend's new girlfriend to go fuck herself. The situation is that the girlfriend criticized the author's shirt right after meeting them.\n\nFirst, the author's shirt was a gift from their wife, so maybe there's some personal attachment. The girlfriend's comment was immediate and negative, which could be seen as rude. The author responded with a harsh reply, leading to her leaving.\n\nNow, I need to consider social norms. Insulting someone's clothing is generally not polite, but the response of telling someone to go fuck themselves is definitely aggressive. Even if the initial comment was rude, the author's response escalated the situation. \n\nThe context includes that this was a first meeting, so tensions might be high. The author's reaction might be impulsive. However, regardless of the trigger, using such a strong insult could be considered the fault of the author. They didn't de-escalate; instead, they made it worse. Also, their best friend and wife were present, so the fallout might affect their relationships.\n\nBut maybe the girlfriend was out of line first. However, responding with a curse and telling someone to leave isn't the right approach. The author's wife was shocked, indicating that the reaction was unexpected and possibly too harsh. \n\nSo, even if the girlfriend was rude, the author's response was inappropriate. Therefore, the answer might lean towards A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
