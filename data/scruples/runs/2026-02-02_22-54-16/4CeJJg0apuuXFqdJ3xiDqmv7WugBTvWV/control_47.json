      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their best friend's new girlfriend to go fuck herself. Let's break down the scenario.\n\nFirst, the author and his wife went to dinner with his best friend to meet the new girlfriend. The girlfriend immediately criticized the author's flannel shirt as \"hideous.\" The author admits he doesn't like flannels much but mentions his wife bought it as a Christmas gift, making it his favorite. Then he told her to go fuck herself, leading to her storming off and the friend leaving. The question is whether the author is an asshole (ITA).\n\nSo, the key points here are the immediate response and the context. The girlfriend made a comment about the shirt, which the author found rude. However, reacting by telling her to go fuck herself is a strong and offensive response. Even if the comment was unkind, the author's reply is clearly inconsiderate and likely escalated the situation. \n\nNow, considering social norms and etiquette, it's generally expected to respond politely, even to rude comments. The author's reaction is not just rude but also dismissive and aggressive. It's important to note that the girlfriend is a guest in this scenario, and the author's response could have been a major turnoff for both her and his friend. The fact that the friend left suggests that the author's behavior crossed a line.\n\nAdditionally, the author mentions his wife's shocked reaction. That indicates that even his spouse was taken aback by his behavior. Even if the girlfriend's comment was out of line, the appropriate response would be to address the comment calmly rather than with a harsh, aggressive reply.\n\nSo, while the girlfriend's comment was rude, the author's response was inappropriate and unprofessional. The situation is a social faux pas, and the author is in the wrong. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
