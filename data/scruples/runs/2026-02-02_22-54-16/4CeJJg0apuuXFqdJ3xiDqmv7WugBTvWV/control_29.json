      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who told their best friend's new girlfriend to go fuck herself is in the wrong. The situation is that the girlfriend criticized the author's shirt, which was a gift from his wife. The author then responds with a harsh insult, leading to the girlfriend leaving and the friend following.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether the author's reaction was appropriate. The girlfriend's comment about the shirt being \"hideous\" might be considered rude, especially in the context of a first meeting. However, the author's response was to tell her to \"go fuck herself,\" which is a strong and offensive retort. \n\nEven if the shirt was an unpopular choice, the author's reaction escalated the situation. Publicly insulting someone, especially a new person in your friend's life, can be seen as disrespectful. The fact that the wife bought the shirt adds a personal layer, but that doesn't justify a hostile response. The author's reaction led to the girlfriend leaving and the friend leaving, which could damage both his friendship and his wife's feelings.\n\nConsidering social norms and conflict resolution, responding with aggression is typically not advised. There are more constructive ways to handle such a situation, like ignoring the comment or addressing it calmly. The author's choice of words was particularly harsh and unprofessional, regardless of the provocation. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong here.\n"
