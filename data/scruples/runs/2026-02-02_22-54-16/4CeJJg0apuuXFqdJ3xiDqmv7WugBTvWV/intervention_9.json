      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author told their best friend's new girlfriend to go fuck herself after she criticized his shirt. The shirt was a Christmas gift from his wife.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The girlfriend insulted him in front of his wife and possibly others. The author reacted strongly by swearing at her, leading to her leaving. The user thinks the author isn't wrong, but wants to know the opinion.\n\nIn terms of social norms, responding to an insult with a harsh retort, especially in a public setting, is usually considered rude. Even if the girlfriend was out of line, the author's response might have been overly aggressive. The shirt being a gift from his wife adds emotional value, so the insult could have been more hurtful. However, the immediate reaction of using a vulgar phrase could escalate the situation unnecessarily. \n\nThe author had other options, like disengaging or addressing it later. By reacting that way, he might have damaged his relationship with his friend and his wife. The wife's shock suggests her discomfort with his response. So, while the girlfriend's comment was inappropriate, the author's reaction might be seen as the asshole move because he didn't handle it calmly. \n\nSo, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because his reaction was too harsh.\n"
