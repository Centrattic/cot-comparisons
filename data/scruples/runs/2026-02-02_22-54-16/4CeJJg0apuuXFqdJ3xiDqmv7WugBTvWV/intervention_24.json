      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who told their best friend's new girlfriend to go fuck herself is in the wrong. The situation is that the girlfriend criticized his shirt right after being introduced. The author's wife bought him the shirt for Christmas, so he really likes it. The question is whether his response was justified.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms. Being rude to someone's partner, especially in a meeting, is generally frowned upon. Even if the girlfriend was rude first, the author's response was pretty harsh. But maybe there's some context here. The shirt was a gift from his wife, which adds emotional value. The girlfriend made a comment immediately after meeting them, which could be seen as inconsiderate.\n\nBut then, responding with a curse and telling someone to \"go fuck herself\" is aggressive and not a typical reaction. It's possible that the author felt disrespected, but the way he reacted could have escalated the situation. Even if the girlfriend was rude, the author's response might have been inappropriate. Also, in public, such a response could be seen as unprofessional or unkind, especially considering the setting was a dinner with his wife involved.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's comment was about his personal choice of clothing, which is a minor issue. The author might have felt his personal space or choice was invaded, leading to a strong reaction. But usually, people are expected to handle such situations with more composure. So while the girlfriend's comment was rude, the author's response was also extreme.\n\nConsidering all that, the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong because his reaction was disproportionate. But maybe some people would argue that the girlfriend's initial rudeness justified it. However, in most social standards, responding with a curse word in such a context is not acceptable. So probably, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
