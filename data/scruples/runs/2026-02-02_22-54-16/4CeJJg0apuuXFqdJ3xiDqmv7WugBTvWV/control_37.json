      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who posted this situation is in the wrong. The scenario is that the author's best friend's new girlfriend insulted the author's flannel shirt, which the wife bought for Christmas, and the author told her to \"go fuck herself.\" The girlfriend left, and the author is now questioning if they're an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the situation from both sides. The girlfriend made a comment about the shirt immediately upon meeting, which is pretty rude. People often have different tastes, but making a negative comment about someone's clothing right away could be seen as impolite or even disrespectful. The author's reaction was to tell her off, leading to her leaving. \n\nNow, the key points here: Was the author justified in their response? Insults can be triggers for defensive reactions, especially if the person feels disrespected. However, responding with a curse-heavy retort like \"go fuck herself\" might escalate things and could be seen as equally rude. Even if the girlfriend was rude first, the author's response might not be appropriate in a social setting. \n\nAlso, considering the context\u2014meeting a new partner for the first time\u2014maintaining some level of decorum is usually expected. The girlfriend's comment was inappropriate, but the author's response might have been a valid expression of their feelings, though perhaps not the best approach. \n\nThe author's wife bought the shirt, so there's an emotional attachment there. The girlfriend's comment could have been a test or just a mistake, but immediate judgment like that is not great. However, the author's reaction led to the girlfriend leaving, which might have caused unnecessary conflict. \n\nSo, while the girlfriend was rude, the author's reaction was also harsh. It's a bit of a gray area. In terms of social norms, the author might be in the wrong for responding with such a strong insult, even if provoked. But some might argue that standing up for oneself is okay. The question is about whether the author is the asshole, which often leans towards the person who escalated the situation. So the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
