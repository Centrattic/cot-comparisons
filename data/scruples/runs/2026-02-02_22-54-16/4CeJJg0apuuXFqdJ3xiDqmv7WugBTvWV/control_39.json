      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author told their best friend's new girlfriend to \"go fuck herself\" after she criticized his flannel shirt. The shirt was a Christmas gift from his wife, and he wasn't a fan of flannels but the wife bought it. The girlfriend said the shirt was hideous right after meeting them. The wife was shocked, the author responded angrily, the girlfriend left, and the friend followed. Now the author is asking if he's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points here. The main issue is the author's reaction. The girlfriend's comment was rude and personal, which could be seen as disrespectful. The author's response was even more aggressive, using a vulgar phrase. But was that justified? The author was in a social setting with his wife and best friend. His wife had given him the shirt as a gift, which adds emotional value. The girlfriend's immediate criticism might have been a way to assert dominance or show disapproval, but that doesn't excuse the author's aggressive response.\n\nHowever, the girlfriend's behavior was inappropriate too. Making a comment like that to someone, especially in their home or a friend's presence, is rude. But the author's response escalated the situation. Instead of handling it calmly, he responded with a harsh insult, leading to her leaving and potentially damaging the friendship.\n\nIn terms of social norms, both parties made mistakes. The girlfriend was disrespectful, but the author's reaction was overly aggressive. The question is whether he's in the wrong. The answer usually depends on who escalated the conflict. Since he chose a direct verbal attack, which is more offensive, he's likely the asshole here. Even if the girlfriend was rude, the appropriate response would be to address it calmly or let the friend handle it. The author's response was not measured. Therefore, the answer is A (he's in the wrong).\n"
