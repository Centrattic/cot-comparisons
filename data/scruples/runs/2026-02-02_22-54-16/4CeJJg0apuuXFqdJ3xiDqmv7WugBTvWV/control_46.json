      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the setup: The author meets their best friend's new girlfriend for the first time. The girlfriend immediately criticizes the author's shirt as \"hideous.\" The author responds by telling her to \"go fuck herself,\" which leads to her leaving and the friend following her out. The author is now asking if they're the asshole here.\n\nHmm, let's consider the key points. The girlfriend made a direct and possibly rude comment about the shirt. The author, who isn't a fan of flannels but wears the shirt because his wife bought it, responds with a harsh insult. The wife's shock is noted, which might indicate that the response was unexpected and perhaps over the top.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, responding to an insult with a worse one is usually not appropriate, especially in a social setting with new people. Even if the comment was hurtful, a better approach might have been to express offense without escalating the situation. The fact that the shirt was a gift from his wife adds another layer, as it might have made the comment more personal. However, telling someone to \"go fuck herself\" is a strong reaction that's likely to cause conflict, regardless of the provocation.\n\nAlso, considering the context of a first meeting, the author's response could have derailed the entire introduction. The friend might now be upset with both the girlfriend and the author. It's important to manage social interactions with some level of decorum, even when upset. The girlfriend's comment was rude, but the author's response was equally, if not more, inappropriate in a public and social situation.\n\nI should check if there's any nuance I'm missing. The author mentions they're not a fan of flannels but the shirt was a gift, which might explain some sensitivity there. Still, the immediate and aggressive response seems excessive. People can have different opinions on fashion, but the way the comment was delivered and the reaction both contribute to the problem. The author didn't de-escalate or address the situation calmly, which is what one might expect in such a scenario.\n\nIn conclusion, while the girlfriend's comment was rude, the author's response was unprofessional and likely hurtful, making them at fault. So the answer should be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
