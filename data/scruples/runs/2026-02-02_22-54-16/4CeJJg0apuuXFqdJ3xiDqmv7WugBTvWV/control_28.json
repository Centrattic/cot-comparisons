      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe person went to dinner with their wife and best friend to meet the friend's new girlfriend. When they were introduced, the girlfriend immediately criticized the author's shirt as \"hideous.\" The author mentions that they aren't a fan of flannels, but the shirt was a Christmas gift from their wife, making it their favorite. Then the author told the girlfriend to \"go fuck herself,\" which caused her to storm off. The friend left with her, and now the author is asking if they're an asshole.\n\nFirst, let's break down the key points. The author's reaction was to insult the girlfriend after being insulted about their clothing. The girlfriend's comment was a direct insult, so the author responded with a strong insult in return. The question is whether that response was appropriate.\n\nIn terms of social norms, when someone insults another person, especially in a public setting, a common reaction is to either respond politely or walk away. However, the author's response was aggressive and disrespectful. Even if the girlfriend was rude, responding with \"go fuck yourself\" is likely to escalate the situation and cause embarrassment, not just to the girlfriend but also to the author's wife and best friend.\n\nThe author's wife probably felt embarrassed because her husband reacted so strongly. The best friend might also be upset that his girlfriend caused a scene and then his friend responded with such aggression. The girlfriend might have felt justified in her comment, but the author's reaction was disproportionate. Even if someone finds a comment offensive, responding with a harsh insult isn't the socially acceptable way to handle it. \n\nHowever, there's a nuance here. The author's shirt was a gift from their wife, which adds a personal element. The girlfriend's comment could be seen as a slight not just to the author but also to the wife. That might have added to the author's frustration. But still, the response was harsh. The question is, is it wrong to respond that way?\n\nIn most social contexts, using a vulgar insult like \"go fuck yourself\" is considered unacceptable, regardless of the provocation. People are generally expected to maintain composure and avoid using such language, especially in a public setting with friends and family present. The fact that the author's response caused the girlfriend to leave suggests that it was a strong reaction. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the girlfriend was the initial aggressor by making a personal comment about the author's appearance. But even if someone is being rude, responding in kind doesn't make it okay. There's a difference between standing up for oneself and lashing out in a way that causes a scene. \n\nAnother angle is the impact on the relationships. The author's actions might have ruined the dinner for everyone involved and could strain their friendship with the best friend. The friend might now feel caught between his girlfriend and his friend. The author's wife might also be hurt or embarrassed by the outburst. \n\nIn terms of the question, the author is asking if they are the asshole. The key here is whether the response was justified. While the girlfriend was rude, the author's response was unprofessional and disrespectful. Therefore, it's more likely that the author is the asshole because they escalated the situation unnecessarily. \n\nSo, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because they responded with an aggressive and inappropriate insult instead of handling the situation more diplomatically.\n"
