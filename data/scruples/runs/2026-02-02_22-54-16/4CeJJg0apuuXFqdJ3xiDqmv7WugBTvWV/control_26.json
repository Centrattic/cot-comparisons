      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong after telling their friend's new girlfriend to go \"fuck herself.\" \n\nFirst, the context: The author and their wife met the best friend's new girlfriend for the first time. The girlfriend criticized the author's shirt as \"hideous,\" which the author's wife had given as a Christmas gift. The author responded by telling her to go to hell, leading to her leaving and the friend following.\n\nNow, considering social norms, it's generally expected to be polite and respectful, even if someone is rude. The girlfriend's comment was a direct insult, but the author's response was a harsh and offensive retort. Even though the shirt was a gift and the author might feel defensive, reacting with such a strong insult is likely to escalate the situation. \n\nHowever, the girlfriend's initial comment was also rude. She looked the author up and down and called the shirt hideous. But that doesn't justify the author's response. People should be able to express their opinions without being met with aggression. \n\nThe author's action caused the girlfriend to leave and the friend to leave as well. This could strain the friendship with the friend, who might feel hurt or betrayed by the author's outburst. The author's wife was shocked too, indicating that the response was unexpected and perhaps excessive.\n\nIn social situations, it's usually better to handle insults with calmness and maturity. The author's reaction, while understandable in the moment, is problematic because it was aggressive and unprofessional. It's important to consider the impact on relationships, especially with a close friend. The author could have chosen a different response, like ignoring the comment or addressing it more politely.\n\nSo, even though the girlfriend was rude first, the author's response was not justified. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
