      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author did the wrong thing by telling their best friend's new girlfriend to go fuck herself. The situation is that the author was wearing a flannel shirt given by his wife, and the girlfriend called it hideous. The author responded with a harsh reply, leading to the girlfriend leaving.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author says they're not a fan of flannels but the shirt was a gift from his wife, making it their favorite. The girlfriend immediately criticized his shirt, which might come off as rude. The author's reaction was telling her to go fuck herself, which is definitely harsh. \n\nNow, the question is whether this response was wrong. On one hand, the girlfriend's comment was rude, but responding with a curse word and causing her to storm off could be seen as overreacting. Even if the shirt is a gift and important to the author, responding in such a direct and offensive way might escalate the situation unnecessarily. \n\nThe author might feel that the comment was a personal attack, especially since it was a gift. But using such a strong response in a social setting, especially with a new acquaintance, is likely to be seen as inappropriate. The fact that the best friend left with the girlfriend suggests that the author's reaction had negative consequences.\n\nSo, while the girlfriend's comment was rude, the author's response was also unkind and possibly led to a breakdown in the meeting. Social norms generally encourage handling such situations with more restraint. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because their reaction was disproportionate and unprofessional, even if the initial comment was unkind. The right approach would have been to address the comment calmly or not at all, rather than using a harsh reply.\n"
