      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the person (the author) is in the wrong for telling their best friend's new girlfriend to go fuck herself. The situation is that the author's wife bought him a flannel shirt for Christmas, which he now likes. At dinner, the girlfriend immediately calls the shirt \"hideous,\" leading the author to respond with a harsh insult.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the social norms. Insulting someone's choice of clothing in front of others is rude, but the girlfriend's comment was direct and maybe disrespectful. However, the author's response was even more aggressive. Telling someone to \"go fuck herself\" is a strong, offensive reply, regardless of the provocation.\n\nThe author's wife's reaction suggests she was surprised, indicating that the author's response was unexpected and possibly excessive. The key here is whether the author's response was a proportionate reaction. While the girlfriend's comment was impolite, the author escalated the situation with a harsh insult, leading to the girlfriend leaving and the friend following her. \n\nEven if the shirt was a gift and the author felt attached to it, responding with such a strong swear word in public is unprofessional and hurtful. It could damage relationships, especially with the friend who introduced the girlfriend. The author might have handled it better by staying calm, explaining the significance of the shirt, or letting the comment slide instead of reacting impulsively.\n\nSo, while the girlfriend's comment was rude, the author's reaction was also inappropriate. The correct response here would be that the author is in the wrong because their reaction was excessive and unkind, regardless of the provocation.\n"
