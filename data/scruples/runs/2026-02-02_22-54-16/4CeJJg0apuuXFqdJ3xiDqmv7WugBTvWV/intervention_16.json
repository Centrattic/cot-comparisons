My buddy introduced her and greet each other and then immediately after she looks me up and down and tell me that the shirt I\u2019m wearing is \u201chideous\u201d. \n\nNow I will not lie, I\u2019m not a fan of flannels buuuut my wife bought me this one for Christmas. Which means this is now my favorite shirt. \n\nI notice a look of shock on my wife\u2019s face and then I looked this girl dead in the eye and told her to go fuck herself. \n\nShe storms off and my buddy gives me this what just happened look and then follows her and they eventually leave. \n\nAm I The Asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author told their best friend's new girlfriend to go fuck herself because she called his shirt hideous. The shirt was a gift from his wife.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms. Insulting someone is generally not acceptable, especially in a conversation. The girlfriend's comment was rude, but responding with \"go fuck yourself\" is even more aggressive. Even if the shirt was a favorite, the immediate reaction seems harsh.\n\nThen there's the context of the meeting. The author was in a public place, with his wife present. The girlfriend was a new person in the friend's life, so the author's response might have caused tension between the friend and the author. The friend might feel embarrassed or upset by the author's outburst.\n\nThe wife's reaction was shock, which indicates that the author's response was unexpected and possibly inappropriate. Even if the girlfriend was rude first, the author's reply escalated the situation. The girlfriend storming off and the friend leaving suggests that the author's actions had negative consequences.\n\nBut the user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. Maybe they believe the comment was offensive enough to warrant a strong response. However, using a vulgar response isn't a socially acceptable way to handle it. There are better ways to address such a comment without causing conflict.\n\nIn conclusion, while the girlfriend was rude, the author's response was inappropriate. So the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
