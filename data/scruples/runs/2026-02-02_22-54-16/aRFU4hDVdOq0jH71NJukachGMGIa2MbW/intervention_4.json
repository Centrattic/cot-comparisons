Love to get some fellow ladies input on this! I'm 17, for reference. Barely A-cup. I'm plain-looking and quite tomboyish - very studious and not interested in fashion or dating at all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's the argument:\n\nMy parents believe bras are a form of underwear and that it's gross not to wear one. They often ask me if I'm wearing one (which in my mind proves it makes no difference if people can't even tell whether or not I have one), and if I say no, they won't let me leave the house. Mum often comments things like 'don't you want boys to like you?' or 'you like like a boy, you should be more feminine'. My mum feels that I do not care about my body and I'm being lazy by not wearing one. I went out without a bra once accidently (in winter, wearing 3 layers of clothing) and was yelled at and told I was ungrateful.\n\nI find bras very unnecessary and uncomfortable. A-cups are too big for me, they're awkward and bulky most of the time and I think mum's comments are really inappropriate. Nobody but her cares about my boobs. I understand that for most people it would be highly inappropriate to not wear a bra but I just don't have boobs. Bras are about support and modesty. I have nothing to support. She's right, I might as well be a boy, why is that a bad thing?\n\nI lost my temper in our most recent disagreement over it. Mum sent me a video about execerises that make your boobs look bigger. I didn't ask, I don't care, and I feel like deep down she's disappointed she gave birth to a flat-chested, tomboyish daughter rather than a gorgeous popular one. I told my mum to stop projecting her own body image insecurities onto me because I'm perfectly okay with my small bust and that it's my own damn decision what to think about my body. I feel bad for saying that because she started crying but it was in the heat of the moment and she was waaaay out of line imo. \n\nI acknowledge this who thing is quite biased but I just can't see the logic in trying to make your mosquito-bite-titted daughter feel bad and want to change the way she is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Basically, I have no boobs and don't want to wear a bra. My parents say it's gross and unladylike and get very upset at me over it, my mum in particular won't let me leave the house without one. I think it's highly inappropriate and a really silly thing to punish me over.\n\nAITA for choosing not to wear a bra at home or when I go out casually with friends?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wearing a bra, based on the situation described.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author is 17, has a very small bust (barely A-cup), and finds bras uncomfortable and unnecessary. Her parents, especially her mom, are pressuring her to wear a bra, using comments about femininity and boys' opinions. The mom even restricts her from leaving the house if she's not wearing one. The author feels that her mom is projecting her own insecurities and that she's being forced into a standard of modesty that doesn't apply to her body.\n\nThe key points here are about autonomy, body image, and parental pressure. The author is asserting her right to make decisions about her own body, especially since she's physically not required to wear a bra for support. The mom's reaction seems to stem from societal expectations rather than the daughter's actual needs. \n\nNow, considering societal norms, while some cultures or families may expect women to wear bras, the author's case is different because of her small size. The discomfort and lack of necessity are valid. Also, the mom's comments about wanting boys to like her daughter touch on external validation, which isn't the daughter's concern. \n\nThe conflict here is between the parent's traditional views and the daughter's personal autonomy. The daughter isn't harming anyone by not wearing a bra, especially when it's not physically necessary. The parent's restriction on leaving the house without one is overstepping, as it's a matter of personal choice and not a health or safety issue. \n\nThe author's outburst, though harsh, seems to be a result of long-standing frustration. While her words hurt her mom, the root cause is the mom's unrealistic expectations. The daughter's stance is about self-acceptance and rejecting imposed beauty standards. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the daughter isn't in the wrong for choosing not to wear a bra. The parent is enforcing a standard that's not appropriate for her body and is using emotional manipulation. The daughter's decision is valid, especially given her age and the lack of physical necessity.\n"
