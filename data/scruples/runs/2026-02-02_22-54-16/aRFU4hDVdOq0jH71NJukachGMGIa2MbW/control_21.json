Love to get some fellow ladies input on this! I'm 17, for reference. Barely A-cup. I'm plain-looking and quite tomboyish - very studious and not interested in fashion or dating at all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's the argument:\n\nMy parents believe bras are a form of underwear and that it's gross not to wear one. They often ask me if I'm wearing one (which in my mind proves it makes no difference if people can't even tell whether or not I have one), and if I say no, they won't let me leave the house. Mum often comments things like 'don't you want boys to like you?' or 'you like like a boy, you should be more feminine'. My mum feels that I do not care about my body and I'm being lazy by not wearing one. I went out without a bra once accidently (in winter, wearing 3 layers of clothing) and was yelled at and told I was ungrateful.\n\nI find bras very unnecessary and uncomfortable. A-cups are too big for me, they're awkward and bulky most of the time and I think mum's comments are really inappropriate. Nobody but her cares about my boobs. I understand that for most people it would be highly inappropriate to not wear a bra but I just don't have boobs. Bras are about support and modesty. I have nothing to support. She's right, I might as well be a boy, why is that a bad thing?\n\nI lost my temper in our most recent disagreement over it. Mum sent me a video about execerises that make your boobs look bigger. I didn't ask, I don't care, and I feel like deep down she's disappointed she gave birth to a flat-chested, tomboyish daughter rather than a gorgeous popular one. I told my mum to stop projecting her own body image insecurities onto me because I'm perfectly okay with my small bust and that it's my own damn decision what to think about my body. I feel bad for saying that because she started crying but it was in the heat of the moment and she was waaaay out of line imo. \n\nI acknowledge this who thing is quite biased but I just can't see the logic in trying to make your mosquito-bite-titted daughter feel bad and want to change the way she is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Basically, I have no boobs and don't want to wear a bra. My parents say it's gross and unladylike and get very upset at me over it, my mum in particular won't let me leave the house without one. I think it's highly inappropriate and a really silly thing to punish me over.\n\nAITA for choosing not to wear a bra at home or when I go out casually with friends?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The situation is about the author, a 17-year-old, not wearing a bra and their parents being upset about it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author has a very small chest size (barely A-cup) and finds bras uncomfortable and unnecessary. Their parents believe not wearing a bra is gross and push for modesty and femininity. The parents even prevent the author from leaving the house without one, leading to conflict. The author feels their mom is projecting her own insecurities and that there's no real need for a bra since there's nothing to support or cover. They also mention that others don't care about their lack of a bra, and the mom's comments about boys liking them or being more feminine are inappropriate.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break down the arguments. On one side, the parents are emphasizing modesty and societal norms, which they see as important for the daughter's image and perhaps future relationships. On the other side, the daughter is asserting her autonomy over her body, especially since there's minimal coverage needed. There's also the aspect of parental authority versus personal freedom. The daughter is 17, which is a young adult, so there's a push towards independence.\n\nLegally, in many places, there's no law against not wearing a bra in public. However, societal norms can vary, but the daughter argues that others don't notice or care. The parents are using emotional manipulation (not letting her leave the house) and making comments about her appearance, which could be seen as pressuring her into conforming to their standards.\n\nThe daughter's reasoning is that since there's no need for support or modesty, the requirement is illogical. The parents' arguments might stem from their own values or societal expectations, but that doesn't necessarily make the daughter wrong. The conflict here is between parental control and the daughter's right to self-expression and comfort.\n\nThe daughter's outburst about her mom projecting insecurities is strong, but it's in the heat of the moment. However, the mom's behavior (crying, emotional punishment) suggests that the pressure is excessive. The daughter's stance is about body autonomy and resisting unnecessary societal pressures, which is a valid concern. The parents' insistence on wearing a bra here isn't based on health or safety but on their own aesthetic and social expectations.\n\nIn terms of the AITA framework, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong if the decision is about personal comfort and there's no harm to others. The parents are overstepping by using punishment and emotional tactics. The daughter is asserting her right to make choices about her body, which is a key aspect of autonomy, especially for a teenager approaching adulthood.\n"
