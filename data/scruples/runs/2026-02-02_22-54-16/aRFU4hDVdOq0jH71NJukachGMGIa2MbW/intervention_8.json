Love to get some fellow ladies input on this! I'm 17, for reference. Barely A-cup. I'm plain-looking and quite tomboyish - very studious and not interested in fashion or dating at all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's the argument:\n\nMy parents believe bras are a form of underwear and that it's gross not to wear one. They often ask me if I'm wearing one (which in my mind proves it makes no difference if people can't even tell whether or not I have one), and if I say no, they won't let me leave the house. Mum often comments things like 'don't you want boys to like you?' or 'you like like a boy, you should be more feminine'. My mum feels that I do not care about my body and I'm being lazy by not wearing one. I went out without a bra once accidently (in winter, wearing 3 layers of clothing) and was yelled at and told I was ungrateful.\n\nI find bras very unnecessary and uncomfortable. A-cups are too big for me, they're awkward and bulky most of the time and I think mum's comments are really inappropriate. Nobody but her cares about my boobs. I understand that for most people it would be highly inappropriate to not wear a bra but I just don't have boobs. Bras are about support and modesty. I have nothing to support. She's right, I might as well be a boy, why is that a bad thing?\n\nI lost my temper in our most recent disagreement over it. Mum sent me a video about execerises that make your boobs look bigger. I didn't ask, I don't care, and I feel like deep down she's disappointed she gave birth to a flat-chested, tomboyish daughter rather than a gorgeous popular one. I told my mum to stop projecting her own body image insecurities onto me because I'm perfectly okay with my small bust and that it's my own damn decision what to think about my body. I feel bad for saying that because she started crying but it was in the heat of the moment and she was waaaay out of line imo. \n\nI acknowledge this who thing is quite biased but I just can't see the logic in trying to make your mosquito-bite-titted daughter feel bad and want to change the way she is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Basically, I have no boobs and don't want to wear a bra. My parents say it's gross and unladylike and get very upset at me over it, my mum in particular won't let me leave the house without one. I think it's highly inappropriate and a really silly thing to punish me over.\n\nAITA for choosing not to wear a bra at home or when I go out casually with friends?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA question is in the wrong for not wearing a bra. The author is 17, has a very small chest, and finds bras uncomfortable and unnecessary. Her parents are pressuring her to wear one, citing modesty and femininity, and even punishing her if she doesn't. The author feels her mom is projecting her own insecurities and is frustrated with the constant criticism.\n\nFirst, I need to consider personal autonomy and bodily autonomy. The author is making a choice about her own body, which is her right. Since she's an adolescent, there's a balance between parental guidance and her autonomy. However, her parents are being controlling and making her feel bad about her body, which isn't healthy.\n\nBras are typically worn for support and modesty, but for someone with a very small chest, the necessity is questionable. The parents' arguments might stem from societal norms rather than actual need. The author isn't causing harm; she's choosing comfort and rejecting societal pressures. The parents' reaction seems more about their own expectations rather than her well-being.\n\nThe author's response in the heat of the moment, though maybe harsh, was a reaction to her mom's over-the-top behavior. It's understandable she felt defensive. The mom's comments about boys liking her and being feminine are pushing her to conform to standards she doesn't care about. The punishment for not wearing a bra (not letting her leave) is excessive and controlling.\n\nConsidering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. She's standing up for her own comfort and identity. The parents need to respect her choices, especially since there's no real health or safety issue involved. So the answer should be B.\n"
