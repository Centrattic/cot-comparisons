Love to get some fellow ladies input on this! I'm 17, for reference. Barely A-cup. I'm plain-looking and quite tomboyish - very studious and not interested in fashion or dating at all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's the argument:\n\nMy parents believe bras are a form of underwear and that it's gross not to wear one. They often ask me if I'm wearing one (which in my mind proves it makes no difference if people can't even tell whether or not I have one), and if I say no, they won't let me leave the house. Mum often comments things like 'don't you want boys to like you?' or 'you like like a boy, you should be more feminine'. My mum feels that I do not care about my body and I'm being lazy by not wearing one. I went out without a bra once accidently (in winter, wearing 3 layers of clothing) and was yelled at and told I was ungrateful.\n\nI find bras very unnecessary and uncomfortable. A-cups are too big for me, they're awkward and bulky most of the time and I think mum's comments are really inappropriate. Nobody but her cares about my boobs. I understand that for most people it would be highly inappropriate to not wear a bra but I just don't have boobs. Bras are about support and modesty. I have nothing to support. She's right, I might as well be a boy, why is that a bad thing?\n\nI lost my temper in our most recent disagreement over it. Mum sent me a video about execerises that make your boobs look bigger. I didn't ask, I don't care, and I feel like deep down she's disappointed she gave birth to a flat-chested, tomboyish daughter rather than a gorgeous popular one. I told my mum to stop projecting her own body image insecurities onto me because I'm perfectly okay with my small bust and that it's my own damn decision what to think about my body. I feel bad for saying that because she started crying but it was in the heat of the moment and she was waaaay out of line imo. \n\nI acknowledge this who thing is quite biased but I just can't see the logic in trying to make your mosquito-bite-titted daughter feel bad and want to change the way she is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Basically, I have no boobs and don't want to wear a bra. My parents say it's gross and unladylike and get very upset at me over it, my mum in particular won't let me leave the house without one. I think it's highly inappropriate and a really silly thing to punish me over.\n\nAITA for choosing not to wear a bra at home or when I go out casually with friends?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a 17-year-old girl who doesn't wear a bra because she says she's an A-cup and finds bras unnecessary and uncomfortable. Her parents are upset about it, saying it's gross and unladylike. The author argues that since she has a very small bust, there's nothing to support, and that her mom's comments are inappropriate. She also mentions that her mom is projecting her own insecurities onto her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider body autonomy. The girl is an adult in some legal contexts (turning 18 soon), so her right to make decisions about her body is a factor. The parents might be coming from a place of traditional views on modesty and femininity. But the girl is asserting her comfort and personal choice.\n\nThe parents' arguments are about modesty and societal norms, but the physical necessity of a bra for support is minimal for an A-cup. The discomfort the girl feels is valid, and the pressure from her mother to conform to certain beauty standards is problematic. The mom's comments about wanting the daughter to be more feminine and attract boys could be seen as pushing her own expectations onto the daughter, which the author correctly points out as projection.\n\nThe incident where the daughter lost her temper and the mom cried suggests underlying issues beyond just the bra. The daughter's frustration is understandable given the mom's behavior. The question is whether the daughter is in the wrong for not wearing a bra. Legally and ethically, body autonomy supports her choice. However, societal norms might differ, but in the context of the situation, the parents are enforcing their views in a way that's controlling and possibly harmful.\n\nSo, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because she's making a personal choice about her body without harming others, and the parents are overstepping by using punishment and invalidating her feelings. The mother's actions are more concerning than the daughter's decision.\n"
