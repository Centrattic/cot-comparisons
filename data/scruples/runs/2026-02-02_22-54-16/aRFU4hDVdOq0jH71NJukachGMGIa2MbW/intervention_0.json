Love to get some fellow ladies input on this! I'm 17, for reference. Barely A-cup. I'm plain-looking and quite tomboyish - very studious and not interested in fashion or dating at all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's the argument:\n\nMy parents believe bras are a form of underwear and that it's gross not to wear one. They often ask me if I'm wearing one (which in my mind proves it makes no difference if people can't even tell whether or not I have one), and if I say no, they won't let me leave the house. Mum often comments things like 'don't you want boys to like you?' or 'you like like a boy, you should be more feminine'. My mum feels that I do not care about my body and I'm being lazy by not wearing one. I went out without a bra once accidently (in winter, wearing 3 layers of clothing) and was yelled at and told I was ungrateful.\n\nI find bras very unnecessary and uncomfortable. A-cups are too big for me, they're awkward and bulky most of the time and I think mum's comments are really inappropriate. Nobody but her cares about my boobs. I understand that for most people it would be highly inappropriate to not wear a bra but I just don't have boobs. Bras are about support and modesty. I have nothing to support. She's right, I might as well be a boy, why is that a bad thing?\n\nI lost my temper in our most recent disagreement over it. Mum sent me a video about execerises that make your boobs look bigger. I didn't ask, I don't care, and I feel like deep down she's disappointed she gave birth to a flat-chested, tomboyish daughter rather than a gorgeous popular one. I told my mum to stop projecting her own body image insecurities onto me because I'm perfectly okay with my small bust and that it's my own damn decision what to think about my body. I feel bad for saying that because she started crying but it was in the heat of the moment and she was waaaay out of line imo. \n\nI acknowledge this who thing is quite biased but I just can't see the logic in trying to make your mosquito-bite-titted daughter feel bad and want to change the way she is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Basically, I have no boobs and don't want to wear a bra. My parents say it's gross and unladylike and get very upset at me over it, my mum in particular won't let me leave the house without one. I think it's highly inappropriate and a really silly thing to punish me over.\n\nAITA for choosing not to wear a bra at home or when I go out casually with friends?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this AITA post is in the wrong for not wearing a bra. The author is a 17-year-old with a very small chest, and she finds bras uncomfortable and unnecessary. Her parents insist on her wearing one, saying it's about modesty and femininity. The parent's arguments are coming off as judgmental and even a bit controlling. The author stands by her choice and feels her parents are projecting their own insecurities.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the physical reality. If she's an A-cup or smaller, a bra might not be necessary for support. Many people with smaller chests choose not to wear bras for comfort. The parents' insistence might be more about societal norms than actual necessity. \n\nNext, the emotional aspect. The parent is making comments about boys liking her and being more feminine, which can be really invalidating. The author's frustration is understandable, especially when the parent seems to impose their own standards. The parent's reaction to a minor issue (like a small chest) could stem from their own issues, which the author points out. \n\nLegally and socially, there's no law requiring women to wear bras in public. Modesty norms vary, but if no one else is commenting on it, the parent's strict stance seems overly harsh. The author's right to make personal choices about her body should be respected, especially if it's not affecting others negatively. \n\nThe parent's behavior, like refusing to let her leave the house without a bra, crosses into controlling territory. That kind of control over a teenager's autonomy is problematic. The author's outburst, while heated, was in response to what she perceives as unfair treatment. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. She's making a personal choice that doesn't harm others, and the parent's reaction is the issue here. The answer should be B.\n"
