Love to get some fellow ladies input on this! I'm 17, for reference. Barely A-cup. I'm plain-looking and quite tomboyish - very studious and not interested in fashion or dating at all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's the argument:\n\nMy parents believe bras are a form of underwear and that it's gross not to wear one. They often ask me if I'm wearing one (which in my mind proves it makes no difference if people can't even tell whether or not I have one), and if I say no, they won't let me leave the house. Mum often comments things like 'don't you want boys to like you?' or 'you like like a boy, you should be more feminine'. My mum feels that I do not care about my body and I'm being lazy by not wearing one. I went out without a bra once accidently (in winter, wearing 3 layers of clothing) and was yelled at and told I was ungrateful.\n\nI find bras very unnecessary and uncomfortable. A-cups are too big for me, they're awkward and bulky most of the time and I think mum's comments are really inappropriate. Nobody but her cares about my boobs. I understand that for most people it would be highly inappropriate to not wear a bra but I just don't have boobs. Bras are about support and modesty. I have nothing to support. She's right, I might as well be a boy, why is that a bad thing?\n\nI lost my temper in our most recent disagreement over it. Mum sent me a video about execerises that make your boobs look bigger. I didn't ask, I don't care, and I feel like deep down she's disappointed she gave birth to a flat-chested, tomboyish daughter rather than a gorgeous popular one. I told my mum to stop projecting her own body image insecurities onto me because I'm perfectly okay with my small bust and that it's my own damn decision what to think about my body. I feel bad for saying that because she started crying but it was in the heat of the moment and she was waaaay out of line imo. \n\nI acknowledge this who thing is quite biased but I just can't see the logic in trying to make your mosquito-bite-titted daughter feel bad and want to change the way she is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Basically, I have no boobs and don't want to wear a bra. My parents say it's gross and unladylike and get very upset at me over it, my mum in particular won't let me leave the house without one. I think it's highly inappropriate and a really silly thing to punish me over.\n\nAITA for choosing not to wear a bra at home or when I go out casually with friends?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for not wearing a bra. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author is a 17-year-old with a very small chest size, barely an A-cup. She identifies as tomboyish, not interested in fashion or dating. Her parents believe bras are necessary undergarments and get upset when she doesn't wear one. The mother makes comments about femininity and boys liking her, which the author finds inappropriate. The author finds bras uncomfortable and unnecessary, as she doesn't have much to support. There was a recent argument where the mother sent a video about exercises to enlarge breasts, which the author took as projecting insecurities onto her. The author snapped, leading to the mom crying.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong for choosing not to wear a bra. The parents argue it's about modesty and femininity, while the author says it's personal choice and her parents are being unreasonable.\n\nI need to consider cultural norms. In many Western societies, wearing a bra is common for modesty and support, especially in certain clothing. But the author's case is unique because of her small chest size. If she's not wearing a bra and it's not visible, maybe it's not a big deal. However, her parents are using it as a control mechanism, which could be an issue. The mom's comments about boys liking her and being disappointed in her body image might be projecting her own issues, as the author points out.\n\nThe author's right to autonomy is a factor here. At 17, she's approaching adulthood, and her parents' strict enforcement on something that doesn't affect others' comfort could be overstepping. The mother's reaction to her daughter's body is about the mother's insecurities rather than the daughter's well-being. The author's discomfort with bras is valid; if they're uncomfortable and not necessary for support, forcing her to wear one is unfair.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that parents have the right to set certain standards for their children's appearance, especially regarding modesty. However, when it's used as a punishment or to enforce a specific image that's not aligned with the child's identity, it crosses a line. The mother's behavior seems controlling and possibly rooted in her own body image issues rather than the daughter's needs.\n\nThe key points here are the author's autonomy, the parents' overstepping, and the mother's projection. The author isn't harming anyone by not wearing a bra, especially with her small size. The parents' reactions are more about their own expectations and insecurities than a legitimate concern for the daughter's modesty or health. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
