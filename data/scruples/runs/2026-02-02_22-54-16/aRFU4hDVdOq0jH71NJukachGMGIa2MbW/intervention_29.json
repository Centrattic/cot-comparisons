Love to get some fellow ladies input on this! I'm 17, for reference. Barely A-cup. I'm plain-looking and quite tomboyish - very studious and not interested in fashion or dating at all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's the argument:\n\nMy parents believe bras are a form of underwear and that it's gross not to wear one. They often ask me if I'm wearing one (which in my mind proves it makes no difference if people can't even tell whether or not I have one), and if I say no, they won't let me leave the house. Mum often comments things like 'don't you want boys to like you?' or 'you like like a boy, you should be more feminine'. My mum feels that I do not care about my body and I'm being lazy by not wearing one. I went out without a bra once accidently (in winter, wearing 3 layers of clothing) and was yelled at and told I was ungrateful.\n\nI find bras very unnecessary and uncomfortable. A-cups are too big for me, they're awkward and bulky most of the time and I think mum's comments are really inappropriate. Nobody but her cares about my boobs. I understand that for most people it would be highly inappropriate to not wear a bra but I just don't have boobs. Bras are about support and modesty. I have nothing to support. She's right, I might as well be a boy, why is that a bad thing?\n\nI lost my temper in our most recent disagreement over it. Mum sent me a video about execerises that make your boobs look bigger. I didn't ask, I don't care, and I feel like deep down she's disappointed she gave birth to a flat-chested, tomboyish daughter rather than a gorgeous popular one. I told my mum to stop projecting her own body image insecurities onto me because I'm perfectly okay with my small bust and that it's my own damn decision what to think about my body. I feel bad for saying that because she started crying but it was in the heat of the moment and she was waaaay out of line imo. \n\nI acknowledge this who thing is quite biased but I just can't see the logic in trying to make your mosquito-bite-titted daughter feel bad and want to change the way she is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Basically, I have no boobs and don't want to wear a bra. My parents say it's gross and unladylike and get very upset at me over it, my mum in particular won't let me leave the house without one. I think it's highly inappropriate and a really silly thing to punish me over.\n\nAITA for choosing not to wear a bra at home or when I go out casually with friends?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for not wearing a bra. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe author is 17, describes herself as plain-looking and tomboyish, not interested in fashion or dating. Her parents think not wearing a bra is gross and not ladylike, especially her mom who comments on her body and wants her to be more feminine. The mom even stops her from leaving the house without a bra. The author feels that bras are unnecessary and uncomfortable, especially since she's an A-cup at most. She mentions a recent argument where her mom sent a video about exercises to increase breast size, which she found inappropriate. She lost her temper and told her mom to stop projecting her own insecurities, which made her mom cry.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are the parents' expectations versus the author's comfort and autonomy. The parents argue that it's about modesty and being ladylike, but the author feels that her body type doesn't require a bra and that the criticism is about her mom's own insecurities or desires for her to be more feminine. The author is also asserting her right to make her own decisions about her body, which is a common theme in autonomy and body image discussions.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, there's a traditional expectation that women wear bras, but there's also a growing movement against such norms, especially in cases where they're seen as restrictive or unnecessary. The author's case is unique because she has a small chest size, which might make the bra's necessity even less clear. The parents are imposing their views, which could be seen as controlling or not respecting the teenager's autonomy.\n\nThe argument here isn't just about clothing but about body image and self-expression. The mother's comments about boys liking her and being more feminine might also touch on the pressure to conform to certain gender roles. The author is resisting that pressure, which is a valid stance. However, the conflict arises from the parents' enforcement through punishment, like not letting her leave the house, which is a form of control.\n\nLegally or ethically, the parents might have a right to set household rules, but when those rules interfere with the teenager's autonomy and body autonomy, it becomes a point of contention. The author's frustration is justified if the parents are using shame or guilt to enforce their views. The author's response in the argument might be harsh, but it's a reaction to what she perceives as invalid criticism and projection.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. She's asserting her right to her body and her comfort, and the parents' approach could be seen as overstepping. The answer would be B (No), as the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
