Love to get some fellow ladies input on this! I'm 17, for reference. Barely A-cup. I'm plain-looking and quite tomboyish - very studious and not interested in fashion or dating at all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's the argument:\n\nMy parents believe bras are a form of underwear and that it's gross not to wear one. They often ask me if I'm wearing one (which in my mind proves it makes no difference if people can't even tell whether or not I have one), and if I say no, they won't let me leave the house. Mum often comments things like 'don't you want boys to like you?' or 'you like like a boy, you should be more feminine'. My mum feels that I do not care about my body and I'm being lazy by not wearing one. I went out without a bra once accidently (in winter, wearing 3 layers of clothing) and was yelled at and told I was ungrateful.\n\nI find bras very unnecessary and uncomfortable. A-cups are too big for me, they're awkward and bulky most of the time and I think mum's comments are really inappropriate. Nobody but her cares about my boobs. I understand that for most people it would be highly inappropriate to not wear a bra but I just don't have boobs. Bras are about support and modesty. I have nothing to support. She's right, I might as well be a boy, why is that a bad thing?\n\nI lost my temper in our most recent disagreement over it. Mum sent me a video about execerises that make your boobs look bigger. I didn't ask, I don't care, and I feel like deep down she's disappointed she gave birth to a flat-chested, tomboyish daughter rather than a gorgeous popular one. I told my mum to stop projecting her own body image insecurities onto me because I'm perfectly okay with my small bust and that it's my own damn decision what to think about my body. I feel bad for saying that because she started crying but it was in the heat of the moment and she was waaaay out of line imo. \n\nI acknowledge this who thing is quite biased but I just can't see the logic in trying to make your mosquito-bite-titted daughter feel bad and want to change the way she is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Basically, I have no boobs and don't want to wear a bra. My parents say it's gross and unladylike and get very upset at me over it, my mum in particular won't let me leave the house without one. I think it's highly inappropriate and a really silly thing to punish me over.\n\nAITA for choosing not to wear a bra at home or when I go out casually with friends?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for not wearing a bra, based on the provided scenario. The options are A or B.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is 17, has a very small bust (barely A-cup), and identifies as tomboyish. She doesn't care about fashion or dating. Her parents, especially her mom, are pressuring her to wear a bra, arguing it's necessary for modesty and femininity. The mom even links not wearing a bra to wanting boys to like her, which the author finds inappropriate. The author finds bras uncomfortable and unnecessary, given her small size. The conflict escalated when the mom sent a video about exercises to enlarge her bust, leading the author to lash out by accusing her mom of projecting her insecurities.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down.\n\nFrom a general societal perspective, there's a common expectation that women should wear bras in public. However, the author's case is unique because of her small bust size. In many cases, especially for those with minimal curves, a bra might not provide support but is worn for societal norms. The author's reasoning is that since she has no need for support and the bras are uncomfortable, she doesn't see the necessity. \n\nCultural and familial expectations play a big role here. The parents might be enforcing traditional gender norms, believing that modesty and femininity require wearing a bra. However, the author is resisting these norms, which are often imposed without considering individual comfort or personal identity. The mom's comments about boys liking her and being more feminine could be pushing the author towards conforming to beauty standards the author isn't interested in.\n\nThe author's response to her mom, while harsh, was in the heat of the moment. She felt her mom was being unfair by projecting her own insecurities. The mom's reaction\u2014crying\u2014indicates the emotional weight of the situation. The author's stance is about autonomy over her own body, which is a valid point. However, her approach in confronting her mom was confrontational, which might have been inappropriate in handling the conflict.\n\nLegally and ethically, the author has the right to make decisions about her body. However, in some cultures, family expectations might be strong. The key issue here is the parents' enforcement of wearing a bra as a condition to leave the house, which could be seen as a control issue. The author is not causing harm to others by not wearing a bra, especially given her small size, and the discomfort she experiences.\n\nIn terms of the author being wrong, it's about whether her actions are objectively wrong or against societal norms. Since societal norms vary, but in many Western contexts, not wearing a bra isn't illegal or inherently wrong. The parents' reactions, especially the mom's, might stem from their own insecurities rather than the author's actions being objectively wrong. The author's choice is a personal one, and unless there's a specific law or religious mandate requiring bras, she's not in the wrong.\n\nThe mom's behavior seems to be more problematic, projecting her desires onto her daughter. The author's frustration is understandable given the pressure. The argument is more about parental control and body image issues rather than the author's choice itself being wrong.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong for choosing to not wear a bra. The issue is more about differing values and the parents' overstepping in enforcing their views, especially in a way that's emotionally harmful.\n"
