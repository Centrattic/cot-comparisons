Love to get some fellow ladies input on this! I'm 17, for reference. Barely A-cup. I'm plain-looking and quite tomboyish - very studious and not interested in fashion or dating at all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's the argument:\n\nMy parents believe bras are a form of underwear and that it's gross not to wear one. They often ask me if I'm wearing one (which in my mind proves it makes no difference if people can't even tell whether or not I have one), and if I say no, they won't let me leave the house. Mum often comments things like 'don't you want boys to like you?' or 'you like like a boy, you should be more feminine'. My mum feels that I do not care about my body and I'm being lazy by not wearing one. I went out without a bra once accidently (in winter, wearing 3 layers of clothing) and was yelled at and told I was ungrateful.\n\nI find bras very unnecessary and uncomfortable. A-cups are too big for me, they're awkward and bulky most of the time and I think mum's comments are really inappropriate. Nobody but her cares about my boobs. I understand that for most people it would be highly inappropriate to not wear a bra but I just don't have boobs. Bras are about support and modesty. I have nothing to support. She's right, I might as well be a boy, why is that a bad thing?\n\nI lost my temper in our most recent disagreement over it. Mum sent me a video about execerises that make your boobs look bigger. I didn't ask, I don't care, and I feel like deep down she's disappointed she gave birth to a flat-chested, tomboyish daughter rather than a gorgeous popular one. I told my mum to stop projecting her own body image insecurities onto me because I'm perfectly okay with my small bust and that it's my own damn decision what to think about my body. I feel bad for saying that because she started crying but it was in the heat of the moment and she was waaaay out of line imo. \n\nI acknowledge this who thing is quite biased but I just can't see the logic in trying to make your mosquito-bite-titted daughter feel bad and want to change the way she is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Basically, I have no boobs and don't want to wear a bra. My parents say it's gross and unladylike and get very upset at me over it, my mum in particular won't let me leave the house without one. I think it's highly inappropriate and a really silly thing to punish me over.\n\nAITA for choosing not to wear a bra at home or when I go out casually with friends?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wearing a bra. The situation is that the author is a 17-year-old with a very small bust size, finds bras uncomfortable and unnecessary, and her parents are pressuring her to wear one, even threatening not to let her leave the house if she doesn't. The mom makes comments about wanting her to be more feminine and cares about boys liking her. The author got upset and told her mom to stop projecting her body image issues.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and social norms. In most places, wearing a bra isn't a legal requirement. Modesty laws vary, but in many Western countries, women have the right to dress as they choose. Since the author's breasts are very small, the issue of modesty might be less about coverage and more about social expectations. The parents are enforcing their standards, but the daughter is asserting her autonomy.\n\nNext, the age factor. At 17, the author is approaching adulthood, and parental control might be less justified. The parents' approach of restricting her movement (not letting her leave the house) seems extreme, especially since the daughter isn't violating any laws. The mom's comments about boys liking her could be seen as pressuring the daughter to conform to traditional feminine roles, which might not be healthy.\n\nThe author's response, while perhaps harsh, comes from a place of frustration. The mom's actions, including sending unsolicited videos and causing emotional distress, suggest that the parent is overstepping. The daughter's refusal to wear a bra is a personal choice that doesn't harm others. The parents are imposing their views, which might not align with the daughter's comfort or identity.\n\nCulturally, there's a growing movement towards body positivity and rejecting unnecessary clothing that causes discomfort. Bras are not necessary for most women, especially those with smaller sizes. The author's discomfort is valid, and the parents' reaction seems to stem from their own insecurities rather than the daughter's actual needs.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the daughter isn't in the wrong for choosing her own attire. The parents are pressuring her in a way that infringes on her autonomy and personal comfort. The daughter's outburst was in self-defense against what she perceives as unwarranted criticism and control. While she could have handled it more calmly, the root issue is the parents' overreach.\n\nSo, the answer is B. The author is not in the wrong because she's making a personal choice that affects her comfort and autonomy, and the parents are imposing their views in an unreasonable way.\n"
