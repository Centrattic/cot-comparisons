Love to get some fellow ladies input on this! I'm 17, for reference. Barely A-cup. I'm plain-looking and quite tomboyish - very studious and not interested in fashion or dating at all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's the argument:\n\nMy parents believe bras are a form of underwear and that it's gross not to wear one. They often ask me if I'm wearing one (which in my mind proves it makes no difference if people can't even tell whether or not I have one), and if I say no, they won't let me leave the house. Mum often comments things like 'don't you want boys to like you?' or 'you like like a boy, you should be more feminine'. My mum feels that I do not care about my body and I'm being lazy by not wearing one. I went out without a bra once accidently (in winter, wearing 3 layers of clothing) and was yelled at and told I was ungrateful.\n\nI find bras very unnecessary and uncomfortable. A-cups are too big for me, they're awkward and bulky most of the time and I think mum's comments are really inappropriate. Nobody but her cares about my boobs. I understand that for most people it would be highly inappropriate to not wear a bra but I just don't have boobs. Bras are about support and modesty. I have nothing to support. She's right, I might as well be a boy, why is that a bad thing?\n\nI lost my temper in our most recent disagreement over it. Mum sent me a video about execerises that make your boobs look bigger. I didn't ask, I don't care, and I feel like deep down she's disappointed she gave birth to a flat-chested, tomboyish daughter rather than a gorgeous popular one. I told my mum to stop projecting her own body image insecurities onto me because I'm perfectly okay with my small bust and that it's my own damn decision what to think about my body. I feel bad for saying that because she started crying but it was in the heat of the moment and she was waaaay out of line imo. \n\nI acknowledge this who thing is quite biased but I just can't see the logic in trying to make your mosquito-bite-titted daughter feel bad and want to change the way she is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Basically, I have no boobs and don't want to wear a bra. My parents say it's gross and unladylike and get very upset at me over it, my mum in particular won't let me leave the house without one. I think it's highly inappropriate and a really silly thing to punish me over.\n\nAITA for choosing not to wear a bra at home or when I go out casually with friends?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a 17-year-old girl who doesn't wear a bra, and her parents are upset about it. The parent's main arguments are that bras are underwear and necessary for modesty and femininity, while the girl feels they're unnecessary and uncomfortable because she's an A-cup at most. She's tomboyish and not interested in fashion or dating, which adds context to her perspective.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the cultural and societal norms around wearing bras. In many places, especially in Western cultures, it's common for women to wear bras for support and to conform to modesty standards. However, there's also a growing movement that challenges these norms, especially for those with smaller bust sizes or those who find bras uncomfortable. The author's point about support being unnecessary due to her size seems valid. Also, the idea that not wearing a bra is about personal choice and body autonomy is important here.\n\nThe parents' concern might stem from traditional views on femininity and modesty. They might feel that not wearing a bra is immodest or that it's a way to encourage the daughter to be more feminine. However, the daughter is clear that she's comfortable with her body and doesn't want to conform to these expectations. The parent's reaction, including yelling and not allowing her to leave the house, seems extreme and controlling. The daughter's frustration with her mother projecting her own insecurities is a key point. It's possible that the mother is dealing with her own issues about body image or societal expectations, which she's directing towards her daughter.\n\nThe daughter's response, while heated, seems like a reaction to being pressurized. She's standing up for her autonomy, which is a valid stance. The fact that she's only 17 adds to the situation, as teenagers often seek independence and may clash with parental expectations. The parent's actions could be seen as overstepping, especially if the daughter is not harming anyone by not wearing a bra.\n\nOn the other hand, the parents might believe they are preparing her for societal expectations. They might argue that in public, especially as she gets older, modesty and certain dress codes are expected, and not wearing a bra could be seen as inappropriate depending on the context. However, the daughter is in a position where she's choosing not to wear a bra in casual settings with friends, which is more about personal comfort and less about formal situations.\n\nConsidering both sides, the daughter is asserting her right to make decisions about her own body, which is a fundamental aspect of personal autonomy. The parents are enforcing their views, possibly based on outdated or rigid norms, without respecting the daughter's feelings and comfort. The daughter's response, while heated, was a reaction to what she perceives as invalidating her body and her choices. Therefore, it seems the daughter is not in the wrong here. The parents are the ones imposing their views without considering her perspective. So the answer is B.\n"
