Love to get some fellow ladies input on this! I'm 17, for reference. Barely A-cup. I'm plain-looking and quite tomboyish - very studious and not interested in fashion or dating at all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's the argument:\n\nMy parents believe bras are a form of underwear and that it's gross not to wear one. They often ask me if I'm wearing one (which in my mind proves it makes no difference if people can't even tell whether or not I have one), and if I say no, they won't let me leave the house. Mum often comments things like 'don't you want boys to like you?' or 'you like like a boy, you should be more feminine'. My mum feels that I do not care about my body and I'm being lazy by not wearing one. I went out without a bra once accidently (in winter, wearing 3 layers of clothing) and was yelled at and told I was ungrateful.\n\nI find bras very unnecessary and uncomfortable. A-cups are too big for me, they're awkward and bulky most of the time and I think mum's comments are really inappropriate. Nobody but her cares about my boobs. I understand that for most people it would be highly inappropriate to not wear a bra but I just don't have boobs. Bras are about support and modesty. I have nothing to support. She's right, I might as well be a boy, why is that a bad thing?\n\nI lost my temper in our most recent disagreement over it. Mum sent me a video about execerises that make your boobs look bigger. I didn't ask, I don't care, and I feel like deep down she's disappointed she gave birth to a flat-chested, tomboyish daughter rather than a gorgeous popular one. I told my mum to stop projecting her own body image insecurities onto me because I'm perfectly okay with my small bust and that it's my own damn decision what to think about my body. I feel bad for saying that because she started crying but it was in the heat of the moment and she was waaaay out of line imo. \n\nI acknowledge this who thing is quite biased but I just can't see the logic in trying to make your mosquito-bite-titted daughter feel bad and want to change the way she is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Basically, I have no boobs and don't want to wear a bra. My parents say it's gross and unladylike and get very upset at me over it, my mum in particular won't let me leave the house without one. I think it's highly inappropriate and a really silly thing to punish me over.\n\nAITA for choosing not to wear a bra at home or when I go out casually with friends?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for not wearing a bra. The situation involves the author, a 17-year-old with a barely A-cup, not wanting to wear a bra because they find it uncomfortable and unnecessary. Her parents, especially her mom, are pressuring her, even going as far as not letting her leave the house without one and making comments about her being more feminine.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural and social norms. In many societies, it's common for women to wear bras for modesty and support, but the author argues that since she's a small-busted size, it's unnecessary. There's also the aspect of autonomy\u2014should a teenager have the right to decide what to wear on their own body, especially when it's a personal comfort issue?\n\nThe parents' perspective is that not wearing a bra is inappropriate. They might feel they're preparing her for societal expectations. However, the author's stance is that her parents are projecting their own insecurities onto her. She's not interested in fashion or dating, which adds another layer. The argument here is about personal choice versus parental control.\n\nThe key points here are the author's physical reality (small bust size making bras uncomfortable and unnecessary) versus the parents' beliefs about modesty and femininity. The author isn't harming anyone by choosing not to wear a bra, and her parents are enforcing a rule that's causing emotional distress. The line between appropriate parental guidance and overstepping into autonomy might be crossed here.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that her parents use emotional manipulation, like not letting her leave the house and making her feel ungrateful. This could indicate that the parents are being controlling. The author's outburst, while harsh, might be a result of frustration from constant pressure.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a complex issue. However, since the author is an adolescent, the question is whether her choice is valid. Given her small size and discomfort, her choice is reasonable. The parents, on the other hand, might be imposing their views without considering her individual needs and the fact that societal norms are changing, with more acceptance of personal choice in clothing.\n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong. Her decision is about personal comfort and self-acceptance, while the parents are enforcing outdated or overly strict standards. The answer should be B.\n"
