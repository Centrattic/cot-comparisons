Love to get some fellow ladies input on this! I'm 17, for reference. Barely A-cup. I'm plain-looking and quite tomboyish - very studious and not interested in fashion or dating at all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's the argument:\n\nMy parents believe bras are a form of underwear and that it's gross not to wear one. They often ask me if I'm wearing one (which in my mind proves it makes no difference if people can't even tell whether or not I have one), and if I say no, they won't let me leave the house. Mum often comments things like 'don't you want boys to like you?' or 'you like like a boy, you should be more feminine'. My mum feels that I do not care about my body and I'm being lazy by not wearing one. I went out without a bra once accidently (in winter, wearing 3 layers of clothing) and was yelled at and told I was ungrateful.\n\nI find bras very unnecessary and uncomfortable. A-cups are too big for me, they're awkward and bulky most of the time and I think mum's comments are really inappropriate. Nobody but her cares about my boobs. I understand that for most people it would be highly inappropriate to not wear a bra but I just don't have boobs. Bras are about support and modesty. I have nothing to support. She's right, I might as well be a boy, why is that a bad thing?\n\nI lost my temper in our most recent disagreement over it. Mum sent me a video about execerises that make your boobs look bigger. I didn't ask, I don't care, and I feel like deep down she's disappointed she gave birth to a flat-chested, tomboyish daughter rather than a gorgeous popular one. I told my mum to stop projecting her own body image insecurities onto me because I'm perfectly okay with my small bust and that it's my own damn decision what to think about my body. I feel bad for saying that because she started crying but it was in the heat of the moment and she was waaaay out of line imo. \n\nI acknowledge this who thing is quite biased but I just can't see the logic in trying to make your mosquito-bite-titted daughter feel bad and want to change the way she is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Basically, I have no boobs and don't want to wear a bra. My parents say it's gross and unladylike and get very upset at me over it, my mum in particular won't let me leave the house without one. I think it's highly inappropriate and a really silly thing to punish me over.\n\nAITA for choosing not to wear a bra at home or when I go out casually with friends?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this AITA post is in the wrong for not wearing a bra. The situation is about the author, a 17-year-old with a very small bust, not wanting to wear a bra, while their parents insist it's necessary and even punish them for not wearing one. The author finds bras uncomfortable and unnecessary, and feels their mom is projecting her own insecurities.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the cultural and societal norms around wearing bras. In many Western societies, wearing a bra is often considered a norm for women, especially in public. But there's a growing movement that challenges this, arguing that it's a personal choice and that not wearing one isn't inherently wrong. However, the key here is the author's physical situation\u2014being an A-cup at most. If they don't have much to support, the necessity for a bra for support is minimal. Modesty-wise, depending on clothing, maybe not necessary either. \n\nThen there's the family conflict. The parents are using punishment (not letting her leave the house) and emotional pressure (comments about boys liking her, being more feminine). The author feels this is inappropriate and that their mom is disappointed. The author's argument is about autonomy over their body and personal choice. The mom's argument is about societal expectations and perhaps her own standards.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, from a personal choice perspective, the author isn't doing anything illegal or necessarily violating a strict social norm if they're appropriately dressed. The parents might be overstepping by using punishment for a personal choice, especially when the author isn't causing harm. The mom's comments about femininity and boys could be seen as pressuring the author into conforming to traditional gender roles, which isn't fair if the author is comfortable with their tomboyish identity.\n\nHowever, the parents might believe they're instilling proper behavior and modesty. But given the author's small size and lack of need for support, the insistence on wearing a bra seems more about the parents' expectations than the author's actual need. The punishment (not letting her leave) is a form of control that might not be justified if the act itself isn't harmful.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author is not in the wrong for making a personal choice about their body, especially when the parents are being overbearing. The parents might be the ones in the wrong for not respecting the author's autonomy and imposing their views. The author's defense of their choice, even if they lost their temper, is about self-acceptance, which is valid.\n"
