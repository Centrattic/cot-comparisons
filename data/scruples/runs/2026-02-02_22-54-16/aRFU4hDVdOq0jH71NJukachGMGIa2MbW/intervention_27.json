Love to get some fellow ladies input on this! I'm 17, for reference. Barely A-cup. I'm plain-looking and quite tomboyish - very studious and not interested in fashion or dating at all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's the argument:\n\nMy parents believe bras are a form of underwear and that it's gross not to wear one. They often ask me if I'm wearing one (which in my mind proves it makes no difference if people can't even tell whether or not I have one), and if I say no, they won't let me leave the house. Mum often comments things like 'don't you want boys to like you?' or 'you like like a boy, you should be more feminine'. My mum feels that I do not care about my body and I'm being lazy by not wearing one. I went out without a bra once accidently (in winter, wearing 3 layers of clothing) and was yelled at and told I was ungrateful.\n\nI find bras very unnecessary and uncomfortable. A-cups are too big for me, they're awkward and bulky most of the time and I think mum's comments are really inappropriate. Nobody but her cares about my boobs. I understand that for most people it would be highly inappropriate to not wear a bra but I just don't have boobs. Bras are about support and modesty. I have nothing to support. She's right, I might as well be a boy, why is that a bad thing?\n\nI lost my temper in our most recent disagreement over it. Mum sent me a video about execerises that make your boobs look bigger. I didn't ask, I don't care, and I feel like deep down she's disappointed she gave birth to a flat-chested, tomboyish daughter rather than a gorgeous popular one. I told my mum to stop projecting her own body image insecurities onto me because I'm perfectly okay with my small bust and that it's my own damn decision what to think about my body. I feel bad for saying that because she started crying but it was in the heat of the moment and she was waaaay out of line imo. \n\nI acknowledge this who thing is quite biased but I just can't see the logic in trying to make your mosquito-bite-titted daughter feel bad and want to change the way she is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Basically, I have no boobs and don't want to wear a bra. My parents say it's gross and unladylike and get very upset at me over it, my mum in particular won't let me leave the house without one. I think it's highly inappropriate and a really silly thing to punish me over.\n\nAITA for choosing not to wear a bra at home or when I go out casually with friends?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wearing a bra, given the context.\n\nFirst, the author is 17, tomboyish, and has a very small bust (barely A-cup). She finds bras uncomfortable and unnecessary. Her parents, especially her mom, are pressuring her to wear one, linking it to femininity and attractiveness. The mom's comments seem to be pushing the idea that not wearing a bra makes her look like a boy and that she should be more feminine. The author feels her mom is projecting her own insecurities and that her body is her own choice.\n\nSo, from a rights perspective, the author has autonomy over her body. There's no legal requirement to wear a bra, and in terms of societal norms, while some cultures or settings might expect it, the author's situation is that she's very small-busted, so a bra isn't necessary for support or modesty. The parents are enforcing their views, which might not be the child's own values. The author's argument is about personal choice and comfort, which seems valid. The mom's behavior could be seen as pressuring the daughter to conform to traditional feminine standards, which the daughter resists. The daughter's outburst was in self-defense against what she perceives as invalid pressure. \n\nConsidering these points, the author isn't in the wrong. She's asserting her right to body autonomy and personal choice. The parents are the ones imposing their views, which might not be healthy for the daughter's self-esteem and independence. So the answer should be B.\n"
