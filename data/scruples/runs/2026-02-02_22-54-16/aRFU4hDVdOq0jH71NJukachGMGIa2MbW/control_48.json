Love to get some fellow ladies input on this! I'm 17, for reference. Barely A-cup. I'm plain-looking and quite tomboyish - very studious and not interested in fashion or dating at all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's the argument:\n\nMy parents believe bras are a form of underwear and that it's gross not to wear one. They often ask me if I'm wearing one (which in my mind proves it makes no difference if people can't even tell whether or not I have one), and if I say no, they won't let me leave the house. Mum often comments things like 'don't you want boys to like you?' or 'you like like a boy, you should be more feminine'. My mum feels that I do not care about my body and I'm being lazy by not wearing one. I went out without a bra once accidently (in winter, wearing 3 layers of clothing) and was yelled at and told I was ungrateful.\n\nI find bras very unnecessary and uncomfortable. A-cups are too big for me, they're awkward and bulky most of the time and I think mum's comments are really inappropriate. Nobody but her cares about my boobs. I understand that for most people it would be highly inappropriate to not wear a bra but I just don't have boobs. Bras are about support and modesty. I have nothing to support. She's right, I might as well be a boy, why is that a bad thing?\n\nI lost my temper in our most recent disagreement over it. Mum sent me a video about execerises that make your boobs look bigger. I didn't ask, I don't care, and I feel like deep down she's disappointed she gave birth to a flat-chested, tomboyish daughter rather than a gorgeous popular one. I told my mum to stop projecting her own body image insecurities onto me because I'm perfectly okay with my small bust and that it's my own damn decision what to think about my body. I feel bad for saying that because she started crying but it was in the heat of the moment and she was waaaay out of line imo. \n\nI acknowledge this who thing is quite biased but I just can't see the logic in trying to make your mosquito-bite-titted daughter feel bad and want to change the way she is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Basically, I have no boobs and don't want to wear a bra. My parents say it's gross and unladylike and get very upset at me over it, my mum in particular won't let me leave the house without one. I think it's highly inappropriate and a really silly thing to punish me over.\n\nAITA for choosing not to wear a bra at home or when I go out casually with friends?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wearing a bra. The author is 17, has a very small chest (A-cup, maybe even smaller), and finds bras uncomfortable and unnecessary. Her parents are upset, saying it's gross and unladylike, and they even prevent her from leaving the house without one. The mom makes comments about wanting boys to like her and being more feminine. The author feels that her mom is projecting her own insecurities, and a conflict escalated when she lost her temper and accused her mom of that.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's perspective. She's a teenager who's comfortable with her body and doesn't see the need for a bra, especially since her size doesn't require support. She's also tomboyish and not interested in fashion or dating, so the pressure to wear a bra doesn't align with her identity. Her parents' reactions are causing her stress and emotional harm, which is significant for a teenager.\n\nOn the other hand, the parents might be coming from a place of traditional values, believing that certain clothing is necessary for modesty or societal expectations. However, their approach seems controlling and dismissive of the author's feelings. They're using punishment (not letting her leave the house) and emotional manipulation (\"don't you want boys to like you?\"), which can be harmful.\n\nLegally and ethically, a parent has some authority in raising their child, but they also need to respect the child's autonomy as they grow into adolescence. The author is expressing her autonomy by making her own choices about her body. The parents' insistence on wearing a bra without considering her comfort or preferences might be overstepping, especially when there's no health or safety issue involved.\n\nThe fact that the author's mom sent a video about exercises to make her look bigger without her consent shows a lack of respect for her decisions. The author's frustration leading to a heated argument is understandable given the pressure from her mom. While losing her temper and saying hurtful things isn't ideal, the root cause is the mom's behavior being out of line.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, there's increasing acceptance of bodily autonomy and the idea that clothing choices should be personal. Not wearing a bra, especially in casual settings, is a personal choice that many people support. The parents' reaction seems to stem from outdated gender norms and expectations about femininity, which the author is resisting.\n\nConsidering all these points, the author isn't in the wrong. The issue lies in her parents' lack of support for her autonomy and their imposition of their own values without considering her well-being. The answer should be B (No).\n"
