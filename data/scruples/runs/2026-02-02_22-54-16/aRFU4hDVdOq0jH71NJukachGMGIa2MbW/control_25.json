Love to get some fellow ladies input on this! I'm 17, for reference. Barely A-cup. I'm plain-looking and quite tomboyish - very studious and not interested in fashion or dating at all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's the argument:\n\nMy parents believe bras are a form of underwear and that it's gross not to wear one. They often ask me if I'm wearing one (which in my mind proves it makes no difference if people can't even tell whether or not I have one), and if I say no, they won't let me leave the house. Mum often comments things like 'don't you want boys to like you?' or 'you like like a boy, you should be more feminine'. My mum feels that I do not care about my body and I'm being lazy by not wearing one. I went out without a bra once accidently (in winter, wearing 3 layers of clothing) and was yelled at and told I was ungrateful.\n\nI find bras very unnecessary and uncomfortable. A-cups are too big for me, they're awkward and bulky most of the time and I think mum's comments are really inappropriate. Nobody but her cares about my boobs. I understand that for most people it would be highly inappropriate to not wear a bra but I just don't have boobs. Bras are about support and modesty. I have nothing to support. She's right, I might as well be a boy, why is that a bad thing?\n\nI lost my temper in our most recent disagreement over it. Mum sent me a video about execerises that make your boobs look bigger. I didn't ask, I don't care, and I feel like deep down she's disappointed she gave birth to a flat-chested, tomboyish daughter rather than a gorgeous popular one. I told my mum to stop projecting her own body image insecurities onto me because I'm perfectly okay with my small bust and that it's my own damn decision what to think about my body. I feel bad for saying that because she started crying but it was in the heat of the moment and she was waaaay out of line imo. \n\nI acknowledge this who thing is quite biased but I just can't see the logic in trying to make your mosquito-bite-titted daughter feel bad and want to change the way she is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Basically, I have no boobs and don't want to wear a bra. My parents say it's gross and unladylike and get very upset at me over it, my mum in particular won't let me leave the house without one. I think it's highly inappropriate and a really silly thing to punish me over.\n\nAITA for choosing not to wear a bra at home or when I go out casually with friends?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a 17-year-old who doesn't wear a bra because she's an A-cup and finds them unnecessary. Her parents are upset, saying it's gross and unladylike, and even go as far as not letting her leave the house without one. The mother makes comments about wanting her to be more feminine and attract boys. The daughter feels her mom is projecting her own insecurities and is being controlling.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural norms. In many Western societies, not wearing a bra is becoming more accepted, especially for smaller bust sizes. However, some people still see it as inappropriate. The daughter's argument is that she doesn't need support and that the societal expectation is illogical for her case. She also mentions the discomfort, which is a valid point.\n\nThe parents are enforcing a rule based on their views of modesty and femininity. But the daughter is asserting her autonomy. The question is whether she's in the wrong. On one hand, if she's not causing harm and the societal expectation isn't universally applied, she's not wrong. On the other hand, if the family's rules are part of their cultural or personal values, but that's where it gets tricky. The mother's behavior seems overbearing, especially punishing her for not meeting certain standards. The daughter's response, while heated, seems like a reaction to being controlled. The key is whether the daughter's choice is her own and if the parents are infringing on her autonomy without valid reason. Since she's 17, she's approaching adulthood and should have more say. The parents' comments about her being ungrateful or projecting insecurities add to the idea that they're being unreasonable. So, the answer is likely B\u2014she's not in the wrong.\n"
