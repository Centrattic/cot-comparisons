Love to get some fellow ladies input on this! I'm 17, for reference. Barely A-cup. I'm plain-looking and quite tomboyish - very studious and not interested in fashion or dating at all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's the argument:\n\nMy parents believe bras are a form of underwear and that it's gross not to wear one. They often ask me if I'm wearing one (which in my mind proves it makes no difference if people can't even tell whether or not I have one), and if I say no, they won't let me leave the house. Mum often comments things like 'don't you want boys to like you?' or 'you like like a boy, you should be more feminine'. My mum feels that I do not care about my body and I'm being lazy by not wearing one. I went out without a bra once accidently (in winter, wearing 3 layers of clothing) and was yelled at and told I was ungrateful.\n\nI find bras very unnecessary and uncomfortable. A-cups are too big for me, they're awkward and bulky most of the time and I think mum's comments are really inappropriate. Nobody but her cares about my boobs. I understand that for most people it would be highly inappropriate to not wear a bra but I just don't have boobs. Bras are about support and modesty. I have nothing to support. She's right, I might as well be a boy, why is that a bad thing?\n\nI lost my temper in our most recent disagreement over it. Mum sent me a video about execerises that make your boobs look bigger. I didn't ask, I don't care, and I feel like deep down she's disappointed she gave birth to a flat-chested, tomboyish daughter rather than a gorgeous popular one. I told my mum to stop projecting her own body image insecurities onto me because I'm perfectly okay with my small bust and that it's my own damn decision what to think about my body. I feel bad for saying that because she started crying but it was in the heat of the moment and she was waaaay out of line imo. \n\nI acknowledge this who thing is quite biased but I just can't see the logic in trying to make your mosquito-bite-titted daughter feel bad and want to change the way she is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Basically, I have no boobs and don't want to wear a bra. My parents say it's gross and unladylike and get very upset at me over it, my mum in particular won't let me leave the house without one. I think it's highly inappropriate and a really silly thing to punish me over.\n\nAITA for choosing not to wear a bra at home or when I go out casually with friends?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this AITA (Am I the Asshole?) post is in the wrong for not wearing a bra. The author is 17, has a very small chest (barely an A-cup), and finds bras uncomfortable and unnecessary. Her parents insist she wear one, considering it part of her underwear, and they get upset when she doesn't. She feels their comments are inappropriate, especially since she's not interested in being more feminine or fitting into societal expectations. She got angry and told her mom to stop projecting her insecurities, which made her mom cry.\n\nFirst, the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The key points here are about personal autonomy, parental expectations, and societal norms. The author is making a choice about her own body, which is a fundamental right. However, the parents are enforcing their own standards, possibly based on cultural or personal beliefs about modesty and femininity.\n\nThe author argues that since she has a very small chest, a bra isn't necessary for support or modesty. She also mentions that her parents are pushing their own insecurities onto her. This seems like a conflict between her autonomy and their expectations. The parents might believe they're preparing her for societal norms, but the author is challenging those norms by asserting her comfort and self-acceptance.\n\nIn terms of whether she's in the wrong, it's important to consider that bodily autonomy is a significant aspect here. Forcing someone to wear something uncomfortable, especially when it's not necessary for health or safety, can be seen as overstepping. The parents might have good intentions, but their methods are causing distress. The author's response, while harsh, came from a place of frustration, which is understandable in a heated argument.\n\nOn the other hand, the parents might argue that they're teaching her about social norms and modesty. However, if those norms are harmful or not based on her actual needs (like support for a small bust), then their approach could be problematic. The author isn't harming anyone by not wearing a bra, especially in casual settings where others aren't commenting on it. The conflict seems more about the parents' dissatisfaction with their daughter not fitting a certain mold rather than a valid concern about her well-being.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. She's asserting her right to make decisions about her own body, even if it goes against her parents' expectations. The parents' reaction is more about their own insecurities and societal pressures rather than the author's actions being objectively wrong. Therefore, the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
