Love to get some fellow ladies input on this! I'm 17, for reference. Barely A-cup. I'm plain-looking and quite tomboyish - very studious and not interested in fashion or dating at all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's the argument:\n\nMy parents believe bras are a form of underwear and that it's gross not to wear one. They often ask me if I'm wearing one (which in my mind proves it makes no difference if people can't even tell whether or not I have one), and if I say no, they won't let me leave the house. Mum often comments things like 'don't you want boys to like you?' or 'you like like a boy, you should be more feminine'. My mum feels that I do not care about my body and I'm being lazy by not wearing one. I went out without a bra once accidently (in winter, wearing 3 layers of clothing) and was yelled at and told I was ungrateful.\n\nI find bras very unnecessary and uncomfortable. A-cups are too big for me, they're awkward and bulky most of the time and I think mum's comments are really inappropriate. Nobody but her cares about my boobs. I understand that for most people it would be highly inappropriate to not wear a bra but I just don't have boobs. Bras are about support and modesty. I have nothing to support. She's right, I might as well be a boy, why is that a bad thing?\n\nI lost my temper in our most recent disagreement over it. Mum sent me a video about execerises that make your boobs look bigger. I didn't ask, I don't care, and I feel like deep down she's disappointed she gave birth to a flat-chested, tomboyish daughter rather than a gorgeous popular one. I told my mum to stop projecting her own body image insecurities onto me because I'm perfectly okay with my small bust and that it's my own damn decision what to think about my body. I feel bad for saying that because she started crying but it was in the heat of the moment and she was waaaay out of line imo. \n\nI acknowledge this who thing is quite biased but I just can't see the logic in trying to make your mosquito-bite-titted daughter feel bad and want to change the way she is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Basically, I have no boobs and don't want to wear a bra. My parents say it's gross and unladylike and get very upset at me over it, my mum in particular won't let me leave the house without one. I think it's highly inappropriate and a really silly thing to punish me over.\n\nAITA for choosing not to wear a bra at home or when I go out casually with friends?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wearing a bra as a 17-year-old with a very small chest. The parents are insisting she wears one, citing modesty and being unladylike. The author finds bras unnecessary and uncomfortable, and feels her mom is projecting insecurities.\n\nHmm, so the question is whether the author is in the wrong. First, I need to consider the context. The author is a minor, so family dynamics and parental authority come into play. But also, there's the aspect of personal autonomy and body autonomy, especially regarding clothing choices. \n\nIn many cultures, there's an expectation for women to wear bras, but that's changing. The author's argument is that since she's a small cup size, bras are uncomfortable and not necessary. The parents might be enforcing traditional norms, but the author is resisting. \n\nFrom a rights perspective, even as a minor, the author has the right to make choices about her own body, especially when the issue isn't about health or safety. However, parents do have some authority over their children's behavior. But forcing a child to wear a bra for modesty reasons when it's not causing any harm could be seen as overstepping, especially if it's leading to emotional distress.\n\nThe author's mom is also making comments about wanting her daughter to be more feminine and appeal to boys, which might be projecting her own desires onto her daughter. The author is clearly stating that she's content with her body and doesn't want to change. So, the conflict is between the parent's expectations and the child's autonomy.\n\nLegally and ethically, the child isn't in the wrong for choosing not to wear a bra. Clothing choices, especially when it comes to personal comfort and body autonomy, are a personal decision. The real issue here is the parent's insistence and the emotional impact on the child. The author isn't harming anyone by not wearing a bra, especially if her small size means it's not noticeable. \n\nTherefore, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong. The parents are enforcing outdated norms and not respecting the daughter's autonomy and comfort.\n"
