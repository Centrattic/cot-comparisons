Love to get some fellow ladies input on this! I'm 17, for reference. Barely A-cup. I'm plain-looking and quite tomboyish - very studious and not interested in fashion or dating at all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's the argument:\n\nMy parents believe bras are a form of underwear and that it's gross not to wear one. They often ask me if I'm wearing one (which in my mind proves it makes no difference if people can't even tell whether or not I have one), and if I say no, they won't let me leave the house. Mum often comments things like 'don't you want boys to like you?' or 'you like like a boy, you should be more feminine'. My mum feels that I do not care about my body and I'm being lazy by not wearing one. I went out without a bra once accidently (in winter, wearing 3 layers of clothing) and was yelled at and told I was ungrateful.\n\nI find bras very unnecessary and uncomfortable. A-cups are too big for me, they're awkward and bulky most of the time and I think mum's comments are really inappropriate. Nobody but her cares about my boobs. I understand that for most people it would be highly inappropriate to not wear a bra but I just don't have boobs. Bras are about support and modesty. I have nothing to support. She's right, I might as well be a boy, why is that a bad thing?\n\nI lost my temper in our most recent disagreement over it. Mum sent me a video about execerises that make your boobs look bigger. I didn't ask, I don't care, and I feel like deep down she's disappointed she gave birth to a flat-chested, tomboyish daughter rather than a gorgeous popular one. I told my mum to stop projecting her own body image insecurities onto me because I'm perfectly okay with my small bust and that it's my own damn decision what to think about my body. I feel bad for saying that because she started crying but it was in the heat of the moment and she was waaaay out of line imo. \n\nI acknowledge this who thing is quite biased but I just can't see the logic in trying to make your mosquito-bite-titted daughter feel bad and want to change the way she is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Basically, I have no boobs and don't want to wear a bra. My parents say it's gross and unladylike and get very upset at me over it, my mum in particular won't let me leave the house without one. I think it's highly inappropriate and a really silly thing to punish me over.\n\nAITA for choosing not to wear a bra at home or when I go out casually with friends?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that she's 17, has a very small chest (A-cup, but maybe even smaller), and doesn't want to wear a bra. Her parents are making a big deal about it, saying it's gross and unladylike, and even not letting her leave the house without one. She finds bras uncomfortable and unnecessary because she doesn't have much to support. The mom is pressuring her, using comments about boys and femininity, and the daughter got upset and lashed out.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the cultural and social norms around wearing bras. In many Western societies, it's common for women to wear bras for support and modesty, but there's also a growing movement challenging these norms, especially regarding body positivity. The author's argument is that since she's nearly flat-chested, a bra isn't necessary. She's also tomboyish and not interested in traditional femininity, which her mom seems to be pushing for.\n\nThe parents' perspective is that a bra is underwear, so not wearing it is unacceptable. But the daughter argues that because she has no need for support or coverage, it's not necessary. The mom's comments about boys liking her and being more feminine might be pushing the daughter to conform to societal expectations that the daughter isn't interested in following.\n\nThe daughter's response, even if harsh, seems to be a reaction to what she perceives as her mom projecting her own insecurities. The mom's behavior, like not letting her leave the house without a bra and making her feel bad about her body, could be seen as controlling and not respecting the daughter's autonomy. The daughter is trying to assert her own body autonomy, which is a valid point.\n\nHowever, there's also a question of respect in their communication. The daughter did say something that made her mom cry, which might be crossing a line, but it was in the heat of the moment. The main issue here is whether the daughter is wrong for not wearing a bra when she doesn't need to, given her physical characteristics and personal preferences.\n\nConsidering body autonomy and the fact that the daughter isn't causing harm to others, it's more about personal choice. The parents are imposing their views, which may not be the right approach. The author isn't in the wrong for not wearing a bra if it's not necessary for her. The real issue is the parents' reaction and lack of respect for her choices.\n"
