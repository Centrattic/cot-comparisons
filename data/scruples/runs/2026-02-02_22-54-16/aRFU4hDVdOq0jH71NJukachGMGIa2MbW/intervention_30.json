Love to get some fellow ladies input on this! I'm 17, for reference. Barely A-cup. I'm plain-looking and quite tomboyish - very studious and not interested in fashion or dating at all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's the argument:\n\nMy parents believe bras are a form of underwear and that it's gross not to wear one. They often ask me if I'm wearing one (which in my mind proves it makes no difference if people can't even tell whether or not I have one), and if I say no, they won't let me leave the house. Mum often comments things like 'don't you want boys to like you?' or 'you like like a boy, you should be more feminine'. My mum feels that I do not care about my body and I'm being lazy by not wearing one. I went out without a bra once accidently (in winter, wearing 3 layers of clothing) and was yelled at and told I was ungrateful.\n\nI find bras very unnecessary and uncomfortable. A-cups are too big for me, they're awkward and bulky most of the time and I think mum's comments are really inappropriate. Nobody but her cares about my boobs. I understand that for most people it would be highly inappropriate to not wear a bra but I just don't have boobs. Bras are about support and modesty. I have nothing to support. She's right, I might as well be a boy, why is that a bad thing?\n\nI lost my temper in our most recent disagreement over it. Mum sent me a video about execerises that make your boobs look bigger. I didn't ask, I don't care, and I feel like deep down she's disappointed she gave birth to a flat-chested, tomboyish daughter rather than a gorgeous popular one. I told my mum to stop projecting her own body image insecurities onto me because I'm perfectly okay with my small bust and that it's my own damn decision what to think about my body. I feel bad for saying that because she started crying but it was in the heat of the moment and she was waaaay out of line imo. \n\nI acknowledge this who thing is quite biased but I just can't see the logic in trying to make your mosquito-bite-titted daughter feel bad and want to change the way she is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Basically, I have no boobs and don't want to wear a bra. My parents say it's gross and unladylike and get very upset at me over it, my mum in particular won't let me leave the house without one. I think it's highly inappropriate and a really silly thing to punish me over.\n\nAITA for choosing not to wear a bra at home or when I go out casually with friends?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wearing a bra. The situation involves the author's parents, particularly the mother, pressuring them to wear one. The author is 17, has a very small chest, finds bras uncomfortable and unnecessary, and feels that their mom is projecting her own insecurities. The parents are strict, taking away the ability to leave the house if they don't wear a bra, and making comments about femininity and boys liking her. The author stood up for themselves and got into an argument.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author's autonomy is a big factor here. At 17, they're a minor, but they have the right to make decisions about their own body, even if their parents disagree. The parents are enforcing a rule based on modesty and societal expectations, but the author feels it's unnecessary and harmful. The mother's comments about boys and femininity might be pushing the author to conform to standards they don't agree with. \n\nThe author's response to the mother sending a video about exercises to make breasts look bigger was confrontational, but they also acknowledge that the mother was out of line. The author's stance is about self-acceptance and rejecting societal pressures. \n\nIn terms of whether the author is in the wrong, it's important to note that body autonomy is a significant factor. The parents' actions could be seen as controlling and not respecting the author's comfort and self-perception. The author isn't causing harm to others by not wearing a bra, especially given their small size, so the argument that it's about support or modesty seems weak in this context. \n\nHowever, the parents might argue that it's a family rule or about maintaining certain standards. But given the age of the author and their right to make personal decisions about their body, the parents' approach could be seen as overstepping. The author's frustration leading to a heated argument is understandable given the pressure and lack of support from the mother. \n\nSo, putting this together, the author isn't in the wrong. They have the right to choose not to wear a bra, especially when it's not necessary for their comfort or health. The parents are the ones enforcing a rule based on their own expectations, not the author's needs. The answer is B.\n"
