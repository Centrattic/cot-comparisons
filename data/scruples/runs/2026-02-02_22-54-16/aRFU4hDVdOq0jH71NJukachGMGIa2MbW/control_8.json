Love to get some fellow ladies input on this! I'm 17, for reference. Barely A-cup. I'm plain-looking and quite tomboyish - very studious and not interested in fashion or dating at all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's the argument:\n\nMy parents believe bras are a form of underwear and that it's gross not to wear one. They often ask me if I'm wearing one (which in my mind proves it makes no difference if people can't even tell whether or not I have one), and if I say no, they won't let me leave the house. Mum often comments things like 'don't you want boys to like you?' or 'you like like a boy, you should be more feminine'. My mum feels that I do not care about my body and I'm being lazy by not wearing one. I went out without a bra once accidently (in winter, wearing 3 layers of clothing) and was yelled at and told I was ungrateful.\n\nI find bras very unnecessary and uncomfortable. A-cups are too big for me, they're awkward and bulky most of the time and I think mum's comments are really inappropriate. Nobody but her cares about my boobs. I understand that for most people it would be highly inappropriate to not wear a bra but I just don't have boobs. Bras are about support and modesty. I have nothing to support. She's right, I might as well be a boy, why is that a bad thing?\n\nI lost my temper in our most recent disagreement over it. Mum sent me a video about execerises that make your boobs look bigger. I didn't ask, I don't care, and I feel like deep down she's disappointed she gave birth to a flat-chested, tomboyish daughter rather than a gorgeous popular one. I told my mum to stop projecting her own body image insecurities onto me because I'm perfectly okay with my small bust and that it's my own damn decision what to think about my body. I feel bad for saying that because she started crying but it was in the heat of the moment and she was waaaay out of line imo. \n\nI acknowledge this who thing is quite biased but I just can't see the logic in trying to make your mosquito-bite-titted daughter feel bad and want to change the way she is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Basically, I have no boobs and don't want to wear a bra. My parents say it's gross and unladylike and get very upset at me over it, my mum in particular won't let me leave the house without one. I think it's highly inappropriate and a really silly thing to punish me over.\n\nAITA for choosing not to wear a bra at home or when I go out casually with friends?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a 17-year-old who doesn't wear a bra, and her parents are upset about it. She's got a small chest size, so she finds bras uncomfortable and unnecessary. Her mom comments on her being tomboyish and not feminine enough, and the conflict escalated when she lost her temper after her mom sent a video about breast exercises.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the cultural norms. In many societies, wearing a bra is seen as part of modesty and appropriate dress, especially in public. However, the user's situation is unique because of her small size. The question is whether her choice is wrong.\n\nThe parents argue from their perspective that it's about modesty and societal expectations. They might be projecting their own insecurities or desires for their daughter to conform. The user, on the other hand, feels that her body doesn't require a bra, and she's asserting her autonomy over her body. She also mentions that her mom's comments are inappropriate and that she's comfortable with her body.\n\nLegally, there's no law against not wearing a bra. It's a personal choice. The user is not harming anyone else by not wearing one. The parents are trying to enforce their views, but the daughter is exercising her right to choose. The user's frustration is understandable, especially given the mom's emotional reactions and criticism.\n\nThe key points here are autonomy, body image, and respect. The user is not in the wrong for choosing not to wear a bra. The conflict arises from differing perspectives on modesty and body image. The parents need to respect her choice, while the user also needs to communicate her stance calmly to avoid escalating conflicts. The user's right to her body and her comfort should be prioritized. So, the answer is B.\n"
