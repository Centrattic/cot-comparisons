Love to get some fellow ladies input on this! I'm 17, for reference. Barely A-cup. I'm plain-looking and quite tomboyish - very studious and not interested in fashion or dating at all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's the argument:\n\nMy parents believe bras are a form of underwear and that it's gross not to wear one. They often ask me if I'm wearing one (which in my mind proves it makes no difference if people can't even tell whether or not I have one), and if I say no, they won't let me leave the house. Mum often comments things like 'don't you want boys to like you?' or 'you like like a boy, you should be more feminine'. My mum feels that I do not care about my body and I'm being lazy by not wearing one. I went out without a bra once accidently (in winter, wearing 3 layers of clothing) and was yelled at and told I was ungrateful.\n\nI find bras very unnecessary and uncomfortable. A-cups are too big for me, they're awkward and bulky most of the time and I think mum's comments are really inappropriate. Nobody but her cares about my boobs. I understand that for most people it would be highly inappropriate to not wear a bra but I just don't have boobs. Bras are about support and modesty. I have nothing to support. She's right, I might as well be a boy, why is that a bad thing?\n\nI lost my temper in our most recent disagreement over it. Mum sent me a video about execerises that make your boobs look bigger. I didn't ask, I don't care, and I feel like deep down she's disappointed she gave birth to a flat-chested, tomboyish daughter rather than a gorgeous popular one. I told my mum to stop projecting her own body image insecurities onto me because I'm perfectly okay with my small bust and that it's my own damn decision what to think about my body. I feel bad for saying that because she started crying but it was in the heat of the moment and she was waaaay out of line imo. \n\nI acknowledge this who thing is quite biased but I just can't see the logic in trying to make your mosquito-bite-titted daughter feel bad and want to change the way she is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Basically, I have no boobs and don't want to wear a bra. My parents say it's gross and unladylike and get very upset at me over it, my mum in particular won't let me leave the house without one. I think it's highly inappropriate and a really silly thing to punish me over.\n\nAITA for choosing not to wear a bra at home or when I go out casually with friends?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wearing a bra. The situation is that the author is 17, has a very small chest (barely A-cup), and finds bras uncomfortable and unnecessary. The parents are pressuring her to wear one, even threatening to not let her leave the house if she doesn't. The mom makes comments about wanting her to be more feminine and be liked by boys, which the author finds inappropriate.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the cultural and societal norms. In many Western societies, especially in the US, it's common for women to wear bras for modesty and support. However, the author's case is unique because she has a very small chest. Bras for A-cups are minimal in support, so the necessity is less about support and more about modesty. \n\nThe parents' argument is that not wearing a bra is \"gross\" and unladylike. But this seems to be projecting their own standards onto the author. The author is asserting her autonomy, which is increasingly recognized as important in adolescence. The mom's comments about the daughter being like a boy and wanting her to be more feminine could be seen as pushing her to conform to traditional gender roles, which the author resists.\n\nThe author's response to her mom by pointing out the mom's own insecurities is a valid defense of her autonomy. While it's true that the mom was upset, the author's frustration stems from being pressured to conform to expectations she doesn't agree with. The mom's approach seems controlling and not respecting the daughter's personal choice, especially given the daughter's physical reality.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author is making a choice that affects her comfort and self-image. The parents are enforcing their views without considering her perspective. There's no legal or societal imperative for her to wear a bra in casual settings. The key issue here is autonomy versus parental control. Since the daughter is an adolescent, there might be some leeway for parental guidance, but the mom's reaction seems excessive and disrespectful.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is not in the wrong. She's making a personal choice based on her comfort and body image, which is her right. The parents, especially the mom, are overstepping by enforcing their standards without considering her autonomy and the actual need for a bra given her small size.\n"
