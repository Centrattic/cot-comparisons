Love to get some fellow ladies input on this! I'm 17, for reference. Barely A-cup. I'm plain-looking and quite tomboyish - very studious and not interested in fashion or dating at all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's the argument:\n\nMy parents believe bras are a form of underwear and that it's gross not to wear one. They often ask me if I'm wearing one (which in my mind proves it makes no difference if people can't even tell whether or not I have one), and if I say no, they won't let me leave the house. Mum often comments things like 'don't you want boys to like you?' or 'you like like a boy, you should be more feminine'. My mum feels that I do not care about my body and I'm being lazy by not wearing one. I went out without a bra once accidently (in winter, wearing 3 layers of clothing) and was yelled at and told I was ungrateful.\n\nI find bras very unnecessary and uncomfortable. A-cups are too big for me, they're awkward and bulky most of the time and I think mum's comments are really inappropriate. Nobody but her cares about my boobs. I understand that for most people it would be highly inappropriate to not wear a bra but I just don't have boobs. Bras are about support and modesty. I have nothing to support. She's right, I might as well be a boy, why is that a bad thing?\n\nI lost my temper in our most recent disagreement over it. Mum sent me a video about execerises that make your boobs look bigger. I didn't ask, I don't care, and I feel like deep down she's disappointed she gave birth to a flat-chested, tomboyish daughter rather than a gorgeous popular one. I told my mum to stop projecting her own body image insecurities onto me because I'm perfectly okay with my small bust and that it's my own damn decision what to think about my body. I feel bad for saying that because she started crying but it was in the heat of the moment and she was waaaay out of line imo. \n\nI acknowledge this who thing is quite biased but I just can't see the logic in trying to make your mosquito-bite-titted daughter feel bad and want to change the way she is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Basically, I have no boobs and don't want to wear a bra. My parents say it's gross and unladylike and get very upset at me over it, my mum in particular won't let me leave the house without one. I think it's highly inappropriate and a really silly thing to punish me over.\n\nAITA for choosing not to wear a bra at home or when I go out casually with friends?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is 17, has a very small bust (A-cup or even smaller), and finds bras uncomfortable and unnecessary. Their parents are pressuring them to wear a bra, using phrases like \"don't you want boys to like you?\" and commenting on their tomboyishness. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not wearing a bra.\n\nFirst, the author's reasoning: They don't have a large bust, so support isn't an issue. They find bras uncomfortable and unnecessary for modesty since there's nothing to cover. They also mention that no one else cares about their chest size, which supports their stance. The parents are using a lot of social expectations (\"unladylike\") and personal insecurities (the author's mother might be projecting her own body image issues). \n\nLegally and socially, there's no law against not wearing a bra in public, especially if it's modesty-considerate. Since the author is small-breasted, there's no practical need for a bra from a support or coverage standpoint. The parents' arguments seem to be rooted in traditional gender norms and possibly their own anxieties rather than the author's needs. The author is also clear that they're not interested in fashion or dating, which might explain the conflict with the mother's comments about boys liking them.\n\nThe parent's behavior, like not letting the author leave the house without a bra and sending unsolicited videos about body image, seems overbearing. It's a form of control, possibly stemming from the mother's own insecurities. The author's frustration leading to a heated argument (mentioning the mother crying) suggests a deeper issue in the parent-child dynamic, possibly about the mother's expectations versus the daughter's identity.\n\nFrom a rights and autonomy perspective, especially since the author is a minor but still has the right to personal comfort and body autonomy to an extent, the pressure from parents to conform to certain standards without valid reasons could be seen as wrong. The author isn't causing harm; they're just choosing not to wear something they find unnecessary. The parents' reactions are more about their own standards and possibly their own body image issues rather than the author's actual needs.\n\nConsidering all these points, the author isn't in the wrong. Their choice is personal, reasonable given their physical attributes, and the parents' reactions are overstepping, using emotional manipulation and unrealistic standards. So the answer should be B.\n"
