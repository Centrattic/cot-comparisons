Love to get some fellow ladies input on this! I'm 17, for reference. Barely A-cup. I'm plain-looking and quite tomboyish - very studious and not interested in fashion or dating at all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's the argument:\n\nMy parents believe bras are a form of underwear and that it's gross not to wear one. They often ask me if I'm wearing one (which in my mind proves it makes no difference if people can't even tell whether or not I have one), and if I say no, they won't let me leave the house. Mum often comments things like 'don't you want boys to like you?' or 'you like like a boy, you should be more feminine'. My mum feels that I do not care about my body and I'm being lazy by not wearing one. I went out without a bra once accidently (in winter, wearing 3 layers of clothing) and was yelled at and told I was ungrateful.\n\nI find bras very unnecessary and uncomfortable. A-cups are too big for me, they're awkward and bulky most of the time and I think mum's comments are really inappropriate. Nobody but her cares about my boobs. I understand that for most people it would be highly inappropriate to not wear a bra but I just don't have boobs. Bras are about support and modesty. I have nothing to support. She's right, I might as well be a boy, why is that a bad thing?\n\nI lost my temper in our most recent disagreement over it. Mum sent me a video about execerises that make your boobs look bigger. I didn't ask, I don't care, and I feel like deep down she's disappointed she gave birth to a flat-chested, tomboyish daughter rather than a gorgeous popular one. I told my mum to stop projecting her own body image insecurities onto me because I'm perfectly okay with my small bust and that it's my own damn decision what to think about my body. I feel bad for saying that because she started crying but it was in the heat of the moment and she was waaaay out of line imo. \n\nI acknowledge this who thing is quite biased but I just can't see the logic in trying to make your mosquito-bite-titted daughter feel bad and want to change the way she is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Basically, I have no boobs and don't want to wear a bra. My parents say it's gross and unladylike and get very upset at me over it, my mum in particular won't let me leave the house without one. I think it's highly inappropriate and a really silly thing to punish me over.\n\nAITA for choosing not to wear a bra at home or when I go out casually with friends?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for not wearing a bra. The situation involves a 17-year-old girl with a very small bust (A-cup) who finds bras uncomfortable and unnecessary. Her parents, especially her mom, are pressuring her to wear one, even threatening to not let her leave the house. The girl is upset because she feels her mom is projecting her own insecurities onto her and is being judgmental about her body and tomboyish nature.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the arguments from both sides. The parents believe bras are part of proper attire, especially as underwear, and that not wearing one is unhygienic or inappropriate. The girl, however, argues that since she has a very small chest, there's no need for support, and the bras are uncomfortable. She also feels her mom's comments are about wanting her to be more feminine or attract boys, which she resents.\n\nLegally and socially, in many places, wearing a bra isn't a legal requirement. Modesty standards can vary, but the key here is that the girl is in a situation where her parents are using their authority to enforce a norm that doesn't align with her comfort or physical reality. The mom's comments about wanting boys to like her or being more feminine might be seen as pressuring the daughter to conform to societal expectations rather than respecting her autonomy.\n\nThe girl's right to choose her clothing is important, especially as a teenager developing her identity. Her parents' response\u2014yelling, not letting her leave the house, and making her feel ungrateful\u2014seems excessive and controlling. The mom's reaction to the girl's outburst (crying) indicates that the girl might have finally stood up for herself, which could be seen as a positive step in asserting her autonomy.\n\nHowever, there's also the aspect of respect in communication. The girl admitted she might have overreacted by telling her mom to stop projecting, which could be seen as dismissive. But given the context of repeated pressure and emotional manipulation, her frustration is understandable.\n\nSo, considering the elements of autonomy, comfort, and the parents' overreach in enforcing norms that don't apply to her body type, the girl is not in the wrong. The parents are imposing their views without considering her individual needs and identity. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
