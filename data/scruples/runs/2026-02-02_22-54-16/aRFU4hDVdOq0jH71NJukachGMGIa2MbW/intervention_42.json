Love to get some fellow ladies input on this! I'm 17, for reference. Barely A-cup. I'm plain-looking and quite tomboyish - very studious and not interested in fashion or dating at all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's the argument:\n\nMy parents believe bras are a form of underwear and that it's gross not to wear one. They often ask me if I'm wearing one (which in my mind proves it makes no difference if people can't even tell whether or not I have one), and if I say no, they won't let me leave the house. Mum often comments things like 'don't you want boys to like you?' or 'you like like a boy, you should be more feminine'. My mum feels that I do not care about my body and I'm being lazy by not wearing one. I went out without a bra once accidently (in winter, wearing 3 layers of clothing) and was yelled at and told I was ungrateful.\n\nI find bras very unnecessary and uncomfortable. A-cups are too big for me, they're awkward and bulky most of the time and I think mum's comments are really inappropriate. Nobody but her cares about my boobs. I understand that for most people it would be highly inappropriate to not wear a bra but I just don't have boobs. Bras are about support and modesty. I have nothing to support. She's right, I might as well be a boy, why is that a bad thing?\n\nI lost my temper in our most recent disagreement over it. Mum sent me a video about execerises that make your boobs look bigger. I didn't ask, I don't care, and I feel like deep down she's disappointed she gave birth to a flat-chested, tomboyish daughter rather than a gorgeous popular one. I told my mum to stop projecting her own body image insecurities onto me because I'm perfectly okay with my small bust and that it's my own damn decision what to think about my body. I feel bad for saying that because she started crying but it was in the heat of the moment and she was waaaay out of line imo. \n\nI acknowledge this who thing is quite biased but I just can't see the logic in trying to make your mosquito-bite-titted daughter feel bad and want to change the way she is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Basically, I have no boobs and don't want to wear a bra. My parents say it's gross and unladylike and get very upset at me over it, my mum in particular won't let me leave the house without one. I think it's highly inappropriate and a really silly thing to punish me over.\n\nAITA for choosing not to wear a bra at home or when I go out casually with friends?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for not wearing a bra. The author is 17, has a very small bust, and finds bras uncomfortable and unnecessary. Her parents insist she wears one, comparing her to a boy and making comments about being feminine. The author feels her mom is projecting her own insecurities and is upset about being punished for not wearing a bra.\n\nFirst, I need to consider body autonomy. The author has the right to make decisions about her own body. Wearing a bra is a personal choice, and if it's not causing harm to others, it's her decision. The parents are enforcing their views, which could be seen as overstepping, especially since the author is an adolescent forming her own identity.\n\nNext, the parents' reasoning. They see bras as necessary for modesty and femininity. However, the author's lack of significant curves means that not wearing a bra isn't affecting modesty. The mom's comments about boys liking her and being more feminine suggest societal pressures about appearance, which the author resists. The mom's frustration might stem from her own unrealistic expectations or societal norms, but that doesn't justify imposing them on her daughter.\n\nLegal and social perspective: There's no law requiring women to wear bras in public. Modesty standards vary, but in many places, going without a bra when appropriate (like in layers) is acceptable. The author mentions wearing layers, so there's no visible issue. The parents' punishment (not letting her leave) is controlling and could be emotional abuse, especially if it's making the author feel pressured to conform to her mom's ideals.\n\nEmotional impact: The author's anger and the mom's tears indicate a strained relationship. The mom's actions might be causing the author to feel unaccepted, which is harmful. The author's response, while heated, is a reaction to being policed about her body, which is a valid concern.\n\nCultural context: In some cultures, there's a strong emphasis on women wearing bras as part of being feminine. But the author is challenging that norm, which can lead to conflict. However, it's important to respect individual choices, especially when they don't harm others.\n\nConclusion: The parents are overstepping by enforcing their views on their daughter's body. The author is not in the wrong for making a choice that affects her comfort and autonomy. The parents' behavior is the issue here, not the author's decision.\n"
