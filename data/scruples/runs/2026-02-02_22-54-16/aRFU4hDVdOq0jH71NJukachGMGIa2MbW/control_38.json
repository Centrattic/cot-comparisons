Love to get some fellow ladies input on this! I'm 17, for reference. Barely A-cup. I'm plain-looking and quite tomboyish - very studious and not interested in fashion or dating at all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's the argument:\n\nMy parents believe bras are a form of underwear and that it's gross not to wear one. They often ask me if I'm wearing one (which in my mind proves it makes no difference if people can't even tell whether or not I have one), and if I say no, they won't let me leave the house. Mum often comments things like 'don't you want boys to like you?' or 'you like like a boy, you should be more feminine'. My mum feels that I do not care about my body and I'm being lazy by not wearing one. I went out without a bra once accidently (in winter, wearing 3 layers of clothing) and was yelled at and told I was ungrateful.\n\nI find bras very unnecessary and uncomfortable. A-cups are too big for me, they're awkward and bulky most of the time and I think mum's comments are really inappropriate. Nobody but her cares about my boobs. I understand that for most people it would be highly inappropriate to not wear a bra but I just don't have boobs. Bras are about support and modesty. I have nothing to support. She's right, I might as well be a boy, why is that a bad thing?\n\nI lost my temper in our most recent disagreement over it. Mum sent me a video about execerises that make your boobs look bigger. I didn't ask, I don't care, and I feel like deep down she's disappointed she gave birth to a flat-chested, tomboyish daughter rather than a gorgeous popular one. I told my mum to stop projecting her own body image insecurities onto me because I'm perfectly okay with my small bust and that it's my own damn decision what to think about my body. I feel bad for saying that because she started crying but it was in the heat of the moment and she was waaaay out of line imo. \n\nI acknowledge this who thing is quite biased but I just can't see the logic in trying to make your mosquito-bite-titted daughter feel bad and want to change the way she is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Basically, I have no boobs and don't want to wear a bra. My parents say it's gross and unladylike and get very upset at me over it, my mum in particular won't let me leave the house without one. I think it's highly inappropriate and a really silly thing to punish me over.\n\nAITA for choosing not to wear a bra at home or when I go out casually with friends?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the scenario is in the wrong for not wearing a bra. The author is 17, a tomboy, and has a very small chest size. The parents insist on wearing a bra for modesty and femininity, but the author finds it uncomfortable and unnecessary.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the cultural context. In many societies, there's an expectation for women to wear bras, especially in public. However, the author's situation is unique because she has a very small bust size, making the necessity of a bra questionable. Bras are meant for support and modesty, but if there's nothing to support, the argument for wearing one might be weak.\n\nThe parents' perspective is that it's about modesty and societal norms. They might be projecting their own standards onto the author. However, the author is an individual with her own comfort and self-expression. The key here is autonomy. At 17, the author is developing her own identity, and being forced to wear a bra against her will could be seen as a violation of her personal choice.\n\nThe mother's reaction includes judgmental comments about femininity and dating, which adds another layer. It's possible she's trying to conform the author into a traditional female mold that the author doesn't want to be part of. The author's frustration is valid because she's not trying to rebel just for the sake of it, but because the requirement is uncomfortable and irrelevant to her body.\n\nLegally and ethically, parents have some authority over their children's appearance, but there's a line where it becomes harmful. The mother's behavior, including not letting the author leave the house and making her feel bad about her body, could be considered overstepping. The author's response, while heated, stems from a place of asserting her autonomy, which is a valid concern.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, there's a growing movement towards body positivity and personal choice in clothing. The author's stance aligns with this by rejecting unnecessary clothing that doesn't serve her physical needs. The fact that her small size makes the bra unnecessary is a valid point against the parents' demands.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is not in the wrong. She's asserting her right to choose what she wears based on her own comfort and body reality. The parents are enforcing outdated or irrelevant standards, which is the root issue here. The answer should be B.\n"
