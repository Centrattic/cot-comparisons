Love to get some fellow ladies input on this! I'm 17, for reference. Barely A-cup. I'm plain-looking and quite tomboyish - very studious and not interested in fashion or dating at all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's the argument:\n\nMy parents believe bras are a form of underwear and that it's gross not to wear one. They often ask me if I'm wearing one (which in my mind proves it makes no difference if people can't even tell whether or not I have one), and if I say no, they won't let me leave the house. Mum often comments things like 'don't you want boys to like you?' or 'you like like a boy, you should be more feminine'. My mum feels that I do not care about my body and I'm being lazy by not wearing one. I went out without a bra once accidently (in winter, wearing 3 layers of clothing) and was yelled at and told I was ungrateful.\n\nI find bras very unnecessary and uncomfortable. A-cups are too big for me, they're awkward and bulky most of the time and I think mum's comments are really inappropriate. Nobody but her cares about my boobs. I understand that for most people it would be highly inappropriate to not wear a bra but I just don't have boobs. Bras are about support and modesty. I have nothing to support. She's right, I might as well be a boy, why is that a bad thing?\n\nI lost my temper in our most recent disagreement over it. Mum sent me a video about execerises that make your boobs look bigger. I didn't ask, I don't care, and I feel like deep down she's disappointed she gave birth to a flat-chested, tomboyish daughter rather than a gorgeous popular one. I told my mum to stop projecting her own body image insecurities onto me because I'm perfectly okay with my small bust and that it's my own damn decision what to think about my body. I feel bad for saying that because she started crying but it was in the heat of the moment and she was waaaay out of line imo. \n\nI acknowledge this who thing is quite biased but I just can't see the logic in trying to make your mosquito-bite-titted daughter feel bad and want to change the way she is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Basically, I have no boobs and don't want to wear a bra. My parents say it's gross and unladylike and get very upset at me over it, my mum in particular won't let me leave the house without one. I think it's highly inappropriate and a really silly thing to punish me over.\n\nAITA for choosing not to wear a bra at home or when I go out casually with friends?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for not wearing a bra. Let me start by reading through the situation again to understand both sides.\n\nThe author is 17, has a very small chest (barely an A-cup), and is tomboyish, not interested in fashion or dating. Their parents believe bras are necessary as underwear and get upset when the author doesn't wear one. The mother comments about wanting boys to like her and says she's being lazy. The author finds bras uncomfortable and unnecessary because they don't have much to support. There was a recent argument where the author snapped at the mother about her projecting insecurities, leading to the mother crying.\n\nThe key points here are the parents' expectations versus the author's personal comfort and autonomy. The parents are enforcing a norm that requires wearing a bra, possibly to conform to traditional feminine standards. The author is resisting this, feeling that it's unnecessary and that their mother is being judgmental. \n\nI should consider cultural and social norms. In many Western societies, it's becoming more accepted for women to not wear bras, especially if it's comfortable and appropriate. However, in some contexts, especially conservative ones, there might still be pressure. The author's parents might be coming from a place where modesty and traditional femininity are valued, hence the emphasis on bras. \n\nBut the author is an adolescent, and their body is still developing. If they're uncomfortable and the bras don't fit well, forcing them to wear one could be causing unnecessary stress. The author's argument is about personal choice and body autonomy. They're not causing harm to others by not wearing a bra in casual settings, especially since their chest size is minimal. \n\nThe mother's statements, like \"don't you want boys to like you?\" suggest she's projecting her own desires onto the author, which the author correctly points out. The author's frustration is valid if they're being made to feel bad about their natural body. \n\nLegally, there's no law against not wearing a bra in most places. It's a personal choice. The parents' punishment (not letting the author leave the house) seems extreme and could be seen as infringing on the child's autonomy. \n\nHowever, the parents might argue that they're trying to prepare the author for societal expectations. But if the author's peers don't care, and the author is comfortable, the parents' stance might be outdated or overly strict. \n\nIn terms of the author's behavior, they did lose their temper, which isn't ideal. But given the context of being pressured and criticized, it's understandable. \n\nOverall, the author isn't in the wrong for choosing not to wear a bra when it's comfortable and appropriate for them. The parents are imposing their views without respecting the child's feelings and body autonomy. The correct answer should be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
