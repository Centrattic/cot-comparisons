Love to get some fellow ladies input on this! I'm 17, for reference. Barely A-cup. I'm plain-looking and quite tomboyish - very studious and not interested in fashion or dating at all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's the argument:\n\nMy parents believe bras are a form of underwear and that it's gross not to wear one. They often ask me if I'm wearing one (which in my mind proves it makes no difference if people can't even tell whether or not I have one), and if I say no, they won't let me leave the house. Mum often comments things like 'don't you want boys to like you?' or 'you like like a boy, you should be more feminine'. My mum feels that I do not care about my body and I'm being lazy by not wearing one. I went out without a bra once accidently (in winter, wearing 3 layers of clothing) and was yelled at and told I was ungrateful.\n\nI find bras very unnecessary and uncomfortable. A-cups are too big for me, they're awkward and bulky most of the time and I think mum's comments are really inappropriate. Nobody but her cares about my boobs. I understand that for most people it would be highly inappropriate to not wear a bra but I just don't have boobs. Bras are about support and modesty. I have nothing to support. She's right, I might as well be a boy, why is that a bad thing?\n\nI lost my temper in our most recent disagreement over it. Mum sent me a video about execerises that make your boobs look bigger. I didn't ask, I don't care, and I feel like deep down she's disappointed she gave birth to a flat-chested, tomboyish daughter rather than a gorgeous popular one. I told my mum to stop projecting her own body image insecurities onto me because I'm perfectly okay with my small bust and that it's my own damn decision what to think about my body. I feel bad for saying that because she started crying but it was in the heat of the moment and she was waaaay out of line imo. \n\nI acknowledge this who thing is quite biased but I just can't see the logic in trying to make your mosquito-bite-titted daughter feel bad and want to change the way she is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Basically, I have no boobs and don't want to wear a bra. My parents say it's gross and unladylike and get very upset at me over it, my mum in particular won't let me leave the house without one. I think it's highly inappropriate and a really silly thing to punish me over.\n\nAITA for choosing not to wear a bra at home or when I go out casually with friends?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for not wearing a bra. The author is 17, has a very small chest size (A-cup), and finds bras uncomfortable and unnecessary. Her parents, especially her mom, are pressuring her to wear a bra, even going as far as not letting her leave the house without one. The mom is making comments about wanting her to be more feminine and attractive to boys, which the author finds inappropriate.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author's physical situation: she's a minor, has a very small chest, so from a practical standpoint, a bra might not be necessary for support. Bras are typically for support and modesty, but if there's nothing to support, the necessity is questionable. Also, her parents are enforcing a rule that seems to be based more on societal expectations rather than the actual need.\n\nThe parents' side is that they view a bra as undergarment and it's \"gross\" not to wear one. But the author argues that her mom is projecting her own insecurities and trying to make her daughter conform to certain beauty standards. The mom's comments about wanting boys to like her and being more feminine might be pushing the author to change her natural self, which the author resists.\n\nLegally, in most places, there's no law requiring women to wear bras in public. It's a personal choice. However, societal norms can vary, but the author's situation is that she's not causing any harm, just choosing not to wear something that's unnecessary for her.\n\nThe parents' behavior is controlling, especially since they're preventing the author from leaving the house without a bra. That's a form of coercion. The author's outburst was in response to her mom sending a video about exercises to enhance her bust, which she felt was unwanted and intrusive. Her reaction, while perhaps harsh, seems to stem from feeling pressured and misunderstood.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong for choosing not to wear a bra. The parents are enforcing a rule that's not based on the author's needs but their own expectations. The author's stance is about bodily autonomy and self-acceptance. Therefore, the answer should be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
