Love to get some fellow ladies input on this! I'm 17, for reference. Barely A-cup. I'm plain-looking and quite tomboyish - very studious and not interested in fashion or dating at all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's the argument:\n\nMy parents believe bras are a form of underwear and that it's gross not to wear one. They often ask me if I'm wearing one (which in my mind proves it makes no difference if people can't even tell whether or not I have one), and if I say no, they won't let me leave the house. Mum often comments things like 'don't you want boys to like you?' or 'you like like a boy, you should be more feminine'. My mum feels that I do not care about my body and I'm being lazy by not wearing one. I went out without a bra once accidently (in winter, wearing 3 layers of clothing) and was yelled at and told I was ungrateful.\n\nI find bras very unnecessary and uncomfortable. A-cups are too big for me, they're awkward and bulky most of the time and I think mum's comments are really inappropriate. Nobody but her cares about my boobs. I understand that for most people it would be highly inappropriate to not wear a bra but I just don't have boobs. Bras are about support and modesty. I have nothing to support. She's right, I might as well be a boy, why is that a bad thing?\n\nI lost my temper in our most recent disagreement over it. Mum sent me a video about execerises that make your boobs look bigger. I didn't ask, I don't care, and I feel like deep down she's disappointed she gave birth to a flat-chested, tomboyish daughter rather than a gorgeous popular one. I told my mum to stop projecting her own body image insecurities onto me because I'm perfectly okay with my small bust and that it's my own damn decision what to think about my body. I feel bad for saying that because she started crying but it was in the heat of the moment and she was waaaay out of line imo. \n\nI acknowledge this who thing is quite biased but I just can't see the logic in trying to make your mosquito-bite-titted daughter feel bad and want to change the way she is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Basically, I have no boobs and don't want to wear a bra. My parents say it's gross and unladylike and get very upset at me over it, my mum in particular won't let me leave the house without one. I think it's highly inappropriate and a really silly thing to punish me over.\n\nAITA for choosing not to wear a bra at home or when I go out casually with friends?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit-style post is in the wrong for not wearing a bra. The author is 17, has a very small chest, and finds bras uncomfortable and unnecessary. Her parents are insistent she wears one for modesty and femininity, but she feels their comments are inappropriate and based on their own insecurities.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the arguments from both sides. The parents argue that a bra is underwear and necessary for modesty, hence not wearing it is considered gross. But the author has a very small chest, so the practical need for support is minimal. The parents also make comments about wanting her to be more feminine and attractive to boys, which the author resents as pressure to conform to their ideals.\n\nIn terms of rights and autonomy, the author is an adolescent making choices about her body. While parents have the responsibility to guide their children, they shouldn't impose their values if it's not harmful. The author isn't harming anyone by not wearing a bra, especially with her small size. The parents' reaction, including yelling and preventing her from leaving the house, seems excessive and controlling. The comment about projecting their insecurities onto her might be valid, as the mother is trying to influence her daughter's self-image in a way that's not supportive.\n\nSocietal norms vary, but in many places, not wearing a bra is a personal choice, especially when it's comfortable and there's no societal expectation enforced. The author's reasons for not wearing a bra are legitimate\u2014comfort and personal preference. The parents' insistence could be seen as enforcing outdated or unnecessary gender norms.\n\nThe key point here is whether the author's choice is harmful. Since she's not causing harm to herself or others, and the parents' reactions are more about their own expectations and control, the author isn't in the wrong. The parents might need to adjust their approach, respecting her autonomy and individuality.\n\nSo, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
