Love to get some fellow ladies input on this! I'm 17, for reference. Barely A-cup. I'm plain-looking and quite tomboyish - very studious and not interested in fashion or dating at all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's the argument:\n\nMy parents believe bras are a form of underwear and that it's gross not to wear one. They often ask me if I'm wearing one (which in my mind proves it makes no difference if people can't even tell whether or not I have one), and if I say no, they won't let me leave the house. Mum often comments things like 'don't you want boys to like you?' or 'you like like a boy, you should be more feminine'. My mum feels that I do not care about my body and I'm being lazy by not wearing one. I went out without a bra once accidently (in winter, wearing 3 layers of clothing) and was yelled at and told I was ungrateful.\n\nI find bras very unnecessary and uncomfortable. A-cups are too big for me, they're awkward and bulky most of the time and I think mum's comments are really inappropriate. Nobody but her cares about my boobs. I understand that for most people it would be highly inappropriate to not wear a bra but I just don't have boobs. Bras are about support and modesty. I have nothing to support. She's right, I might as well be a boy, why is that a bad thing?\n\nI lost my temper in our most recent disagreement over it. Mum sent me a video about execerises that make your boobs look bigger. I didn't ask, I don't care, and I feel like deep down she's disappointed she gave birth to a flat-chested, tomboyish daughter rather than a gorgeous popular one. I told my mum to stop projecting her own body image insecurities onto me because I'm perfectly okay with my small bust and that it's my own damn decision what to think about my body. I feel bad for saying that because she started crying but it was in the heat of the moment and she was waaaay out of line imo. \n\nI acknowledge this who thing is quite biased but I just can't see the logic in trying to make your mosquito-bite-titted daughter feel bad and want to change the way she is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Basically, I have no boobs and don't want to wear a bra. My parents say it's gross and unladylike and get very upset at me over it, my mum in particular won't let me leave the house without one. I think it's highly inappropriate and a really silly thing to punish me over.\n\nAITA for choosing not to wear a bra at home or when I go out casually with friends?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person (a 17-year-old girl) is in the wrong for not wearing a bra, given her parents' reactions.\n\nFirst, I need to look at both sides. The author is a minor, so her parents have some authority over her. However, the parents are enforcing what seems like a strict rule about wearing a bra, which she finds unnecessary because she's a very small chest size. The parents are pressuring her to conform to certain feminine norms, which she resists. \n\nThe parents' argument is about modesty and societal norms, but the author's point is that since she has no breasts, a bra isn't needed for support or coverage. She also mentions that the parents are projecting their insecurities onto her, which is a strong point. The mother's comments about wanting her to be more feminine and the punishment for not wearing a bra could be seen as controlling or enforcing outdated gender standards.\n\nFrom a rights perspective, adolescents do have some autonomy, especially in personal choices. The parents might be overstepping by using emotional manipulation and punishing her for a choice that affects her comfort and self-image. The author's response, while heated, seems to stem from a place of asserting her independence, which is a common issue during adolescence.\n\nHowever, the parents also have concerns about social appropriateness. But given her small size and the fact that in many casual settings, especially with layers, a bra might not be necessary, the parents' insistence could be seen as excessive. The key here is whether the parents' demands are reasonable or if they are enforcing norms that don't apply to her specific situation.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, there's a growing movement towards body positivity and rejecting unnecessary gendered clothing rules. The author's stance aligns with that. The parents might not be aware of or resistant to these changing attitudes.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. The parents are pushing their own standards onto her, and her choice to not wear a bra is a matter of personal autonomy and comfort. The parents' reaction is more problematic, especially the emotional punishment and projecting their insecurities. Therefore, the answer is likely B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
