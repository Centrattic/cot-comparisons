Love to get some fellow ladies input on this! I'm 17, for reference. Barely A-cup. I'm plain-looking and quite tomboyish - very studious and not interested in fashion or dating at all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's the argument:\n\nMy parents believe bras are a form of underwear and that it's gross not to wear one. They often ask me if I'm wearing one (which in my mind proves it makes no difference if people can't even tell whether or not I have one), and if I say no, they won't let me leave the house. Mum often comments things like 'don't you want boys to like you?' or 'you like like a boy, you should be more feminine'. My mum feels that I do not care about my body and I'm being lazy by not wearing one. I went out without a bra once accidently (in winter, wearing 3 layers of clothing) and was yelled at and told I was ungrateful.\n\nI find bras very unnecessary and uncomfortable. A-cups are too big for me, they're awkward and bulky most of the time and I think mum's comments are really inappropriate. Nobody but her cares about my boobs. I understand that for most people it would be highly inappropriate to not wear a bra but I just don't have boobs. Bras are about support and modesty. I have nothing to support. She's right, I might as well be a boy, why is that a bad thing?\n\nI lost my temper in our most recent disagreement over it. Mum sent me a video about execerises that make your boobs look bigger. I didn't ask, I don't care, and I feel like deep down she's disappointed she gave birth to a flat-chested, tomboyish daughter rather than a gorgeous popular one. I told my mum to stop projecting her own body image insecurities onto me because I'm perfectly okay with my small bust and that it's my own damn decision what to think about my body. I feel bad for saying that because she started crying but it was in the heat of the moment and she was waaaay out of line imo. \n\nI acknowledge this who thing is quite biased but I just can't see the logic in trying to make your mosquito-bite-titted daughter feel bad and want to change the way she is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Basically, I have no boobs and don't want to wear a bra. My parents say it's gross and unladylike and get very upset at me over it, my mum in particular won't let me leave the house without one. I think it's highly inappropriate and a really silly thing to punish me over.\n\nAITA for choosing not to wear a bra at home or when I go out casually with friends?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author (a 17-year-old) is in the wrong for not wearing a bra, given the family conflict. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author is a tomboy with a very small chest size, which makes bras uncomfortable and unnecessary for support. Her parents insist she wears a bra for modesty and femininity, but she feels their comments are inappropriate and based on their own insecurities. The parents are punishing her by not letting her leave the house without a bra, which the author finds unfair.\n\nFrom a rights perspective, the author should have autonomy over her body. There's no law requiring women to wear bras, especially when they don't need support. The parents' insistence might stem from societal norms, but those norms are changing. However, parents do have a role in setting boundaries, but this seems more about personal preference than health or safety.\n\nThe author's argument is valid because she's not causing harm to herself or others. The parents' reactions might be projecting their own expectations or societal pressures onto her. The author's frustration is understandable, especially if she's being judged for her body type. The situation also involves the mother making comments about boys liking her, which adds pressure to conform to traditional femininity, something the author resists.\n\nHowever, the parents might feel they're preparing her for societal expectations. But the author is a minor, and while parents have some authority, they shouldn't impose their views in a way that's harmful. The punishment (not letting her leave without a bra) could be seen as overstepping, especially if the author feels it's unnecessary.\n\nIn terms of ethics, the author isn't wrong for asserting her comfort and autonomy. The parents might be in the wrong for enforcing outdated norms and using emotional manipulation. The author's outburst, while harsh, was in self-defense against what she perceives as invalid criticism.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). She has a right to make decisions about her body, especially when the issue is about personal comfort and not health or safety.\n"
