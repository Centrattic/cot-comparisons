Love to get some fellow ladies input on this! I'm 17, for reference. Barely A-cup. I'm plain-looking and quite tomboyish - very studious and not interested in fashion or dating at all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's the argument:\n\nMy parents believe bras are a form of underwear and that it's gross not to wear one. They often ask me if I'm wearing one (which in my mind proves it makes no difference if people can't even tell whether or not I have one), and if I say no, they won't let me leave the house. Mum often comments things like 'don't you want boys to like you?' or 'you like like a boy, you should be more feminine'. My mum feels that I do not care about my body and I'm being lazy by not wearing one. I went out without a bra once accidently (in winter, wearing 3 layers of clothing) and was yelled at and told I was ungrateful.\n\nI find bras very unnecessary and uncomfortable. A-cups are too big for me, they're awkward and bulky most of the time and I think mum's comments are really inappropriate. Nobody but her cares about my boobs. I understand that for most people it would be highly inappropriate to not wear a bra but I just don't have boobs. Bras are about support and modesty. I have nothing to support. She's right, I might as well be a boy, why is that a bad thing?\n\nI lost my temper in our most recent disagreement over it. Mum sent me a video about execerises that make your boobs look bigger. I didn't ask, I don't care, and I feel like deep down she's disappointed she gave birth to a flat-chested, tomboyish daughter rather than a gorgeous popular one. I told my mum to stop projecting her own body image insecurities onto me because I'm perfectly okay with my small bust and that it's my own damn decision what to think about my body. I feel bad for saying that because she started crying but it was in the heat of the moment and she was waaaay out of line imo. \n\nI acknowledge this who thing is quite biased but I just can't see the logic in trying to make your mosquito-bite-titted daughter feel bad and want to change the way she is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Basically, I have no boobs and don't want to wear a bra. My parents say it's gross and unladylike and get very upset at me over it, my mum in particular won't let me leave the house without one. I think it's highly inappropriate and a really silly thing to punish me over.\n\nAITA for choosing not to wear a bra at home or when I go out casually with friends?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of this AITA post is in the wrong for not wearing a bra. The author is 17, has a very small chest size, and doesn't find bras comfortable or necessary. Her parents are pressuring her to wear one, even going as far as not letting her leave the house without it. The mom also makes comments about boys liking her and being more feminine, which the author finds inappropriate.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the cultural and societal norms. In many Western societies, there's a lot of discussion around body autonomy and personal choice when it comes to clothing, including undergarments. Bras are often seen as a personal choice, especially for those with smaller chests where support isn't a big issue. The author's parents might be coming from a more traditional stance where modesty and certain feminine standards are enforced, but that doesn't necessarily make it right.\n\nThe author mentions that she's uncomfortable with the pressure to conform to her mother's expectations, especially when her mother is projecting her own insecurities. The fact that she's being punished (not allowed to leave the house) for not wearing a bra seems excessive. Physical punishment or restriction based on clothing choices can be seen as a violation of personal autonomy.\n\nAlso, the mother's comments about boys liking her and being more feminine might be contributing to body image issues. The author is in a formative age, and such pressure could affect her self-esteem. The author's response, while heated, was in defense of her own body and choices, which is a valid stance.\n\nLooking at the situation from a human rights and personal freedom perspective, the author has the right to make decisions about her own body. The parents have a responsibility to support their child's autonomy, especially as she's approaching adulthood. The key issue here is the enforcement of a specific clothing item without considering the individual's comfort and body type.\n\nHowever, some might argue that in a family setting, especially with parents, there's an expectation to follow certain rules. But when those rules infringe on the child's personal comfort and autonomy, it becomes a problem. The author isn't causing harm to others by not wearing a bra, especially given her small size. The parents' reaction seems more about their own ideals rather than the daughter's well-being.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong. She's making a choice that's right for her body and comfort, and the parents are overstepping by enforcing unnecessary rules and making her feel bad about her natural self. The answer should be B.\n"
