Love to get some fellow ladies input on this! I'm 17, for reference. Barely A-cup. I'm plain-looking and quite tomboyish - very studious and not interested in fashion or dating at all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's the argument:\n\nMy parents believe bras are a form of underwear and that it's gross not to wear one. They often ask me if I'm wearing one (which in my mind proves it makes no difference if people can't even tell whether or not I have one), and if I say no, they won't let me leave the house. Mum often comments things like 'don't you want boys to like you?' or 'you like like a boy, you should be more feminine'. My mum feels that I do not care about my body and I'm being lazy by not wearing one. I went out without a bra once accidently (in winter, wearing 3 layers of clothing) and was yelled at and told I was ungrateful.\n\nI find bras very unnecessary and uncomfortable. A-cups are too big for me, they're awkward and bulky most of the time and I think mum's comments are really inappropriate. Nobody but her cares about my boobs. I understand that for most people it would be highly inappropriate to not wear a bra but I just don't have boobs. Bras are about support and modesty. I have nothing to support. She's right, I might as well be a boy, why is that a bad thing?\n\nI lost my temper in our most recent disagreement over it. Mum sent me a video about execerises that make your boobs look bigger. I didn't ask, I don't care, and I feel like deep down she's disappointed she gave birth to a flat-chested, tomboyish daughter rather than a gorgeous popular one. I told my mum to stop projecting her own body image insecurities onto me because I'm perfectly okay with my small bust and that it's my own damn decision what to think about my body. I feel bad for saying that because she started crying but it was in the heat of the moment and she was waaaay out of line imo. \n\nI acknowledge this who thing is quite biased but I just can't see the logic in trying to make your mosquito-bite-titted daughter feel bad and want to change the way she is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Basically, I have no boobs and don't want to wear a bra. My parents say it's gross and unladylike and get very upset at me over it, my mum in particular won't let me leave the house without one. I think it's highly inappropriate and a really silly thing to punish me over.\n\nAITA for choosing not to wear a bra at home or when I go out casually with friends?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for not wearing a bra based on their situation. Let's break it down.\n\nThe author is 17 years old, has a very small bust (barely A-cup), is tomboyish, not interested in fashion or dating, and finds bras uncomfortable. Their parents consider not wearing a bra to be gross and improper, and they don't let the author leave the house without one. The mom is pushing for more femininity, even suggesting exercises to increase bust size. The author feels that since they don't have much to support, a bra isn't necessary and is being forced upon them. They also mention that their mom is projecting her own insecurities onto them and that they lost their temper, leading the mom to cry. The question is whether the author is at fault for choosing not to wear a bra in casual settings or at home.\n\nFirst, I should consider the parents' perspective. They might be enforcing traditional norms about modesty and feminine appearance. In some cultures or families, not wearing a bra might be seen as immodest or inappropriate, especially in public. However, the author's situation is that their body doesn't require a bra for support, and they find it uncomfortable. They also point out that when they were out in winter with multiple layers, people couldn't tell they weren't wearing a bra, which suggests that the requirement might be more about the parents' expectations than actual visibility or modesty concerns.\n\nNext, the author's right to autonomy. At 17, they're approaching adulthood and have the right to make personal choices about their body. The parents, while having a role in guiding their children, should also respect their daughter's comfort and preferences. The mom's comments about boys liking her and being more feminine might be pressuring the author to conform to societal standards they don't agree with, which can be harmful. The author's response about the mom's body image issues might be a valid point, indicating that the pressure isn't about the author's needs but the mom's own desires or insecurities.\n\nThe issue of health and comfort is important. If the author isn't experiencing any physical discomfort or health issues from not wearing a bra, then the argument for necessity is weak. Bras are meant for support and comfort, especially for those with larger busts, but for someone with a very small bust, they might be more of a choice in terms of personal preference rather than a necessity.\n\nAlso, the parents' reaction of not letting them leave the house is a form of punishment, which raises questions about the appropriateness of that approach. It's controlling and may not be respectful of the author's autonomy. The mom's suggestion of exercises to make her look bigger could be another layer of pressure, implying dissatisfaction with the author's natural body, which can affect self-esteem.\n\nThe author's frustration is understandable given the pressure. They're asserting their identity and rejecting societal expectations that don't align with their personal experience. The mom's disappointment in having a \"flat-chested, tomboyish daughter\" instead of a \"gorgeous popular one\" indicates the mom might be imposing her own values or desires onto the author, which isn't fair.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, there's a growing movement towards body positivity and the idea that women should have the choice to wear or not wear a bra as they prefer. The author's stance aligns with that, especially considering their body type and personal style. The parents' insistence might be based on outdated or strict views about femininity that the author isn't comfortable with.\n\nHowever, some might argue that there are social expectations about modesty in certain settings, and the parents are trying to protect their daughter's reputation. But the author's situation shows that the actual societal reaction is minimal\u2014people don't notice, and the mom's comments are the main issue. So the parents' enforcement might be more about their own concerns than any real societal judgment.\n\nThe author's response, while heated, was a defense of their autonomy and a rejection of the mom's projections. It's a valid expression of their feelings, even if it came out harshly. The mom's crying shows the emotional impact, but the author's frustration is also significant given the pressure.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The author isn't in the wrong for choosing not to wear a bra when it's not necessary for their comfort or support. The parents are enforcing their own standards without considering the author's individual needs and body type. The mom's comments and punishment are inappropriate and reflect her own insecurities rather than the daughter's actions. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
