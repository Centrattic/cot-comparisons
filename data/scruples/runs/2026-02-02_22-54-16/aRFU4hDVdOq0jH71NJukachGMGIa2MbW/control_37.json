Love to get some fellow ladies input on this! I'm 17, for reference. Barely A-cup. I'm plain-looking and quite tomboyish - very studious and not interested in fashion or dating at all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's the argument:\n\nMy parents believe bras are a form of underwear and that it's gross not to wear one. They often ask me if I'm wearing one (which in my mind proves it makes no difference if people can't even tell whether or not I have one), and if I say no, they won't let me leave the house. Mum often comments things like 'don't you want boys to like you?' or 'you like like a boy, you should be more feminine'. My mum feels that I do not care about my body and I'm being lazy by not wearing one. I went out without a bra once accidently (in winter, wearing 3 layers of clothing) and was yelled at and told I was ungrateful.\n\nI find bras very unnecessary and uncomfortable. A-cups are too big for me, they're awkward and bulky most of the time and I think mum's comments are really inappropriate. Nobody but her cares about my boobs. I understand that for most people it would be highly inappropriate to not wear a bra but I just don't have boobs. Bras are about support and modesty. I have nothing to support. She's right, I might as well be a boy, why is that a bad thing?\n\nI lost my temper in our most recent disagreement over it. Mum sent me a video about execerises that make your boobs look bigger. I didn't ask, I don't care, and I feel like deep down she's disappointed she gave birth to a flat-chested, tomboyish daughter rather than a gorgeous popular one. I told my mum to stop projecting her own body image insecurities onto me because I'm perfectly okay with my small bust and that it's my own damn decision what to think about my body. I feel bad for saying that because she started crying but it was in the heat of the moment and she was waaaay out of line imo. \n\nI acknowledge this who thing is quite biased but I just can't see the logic in trying to make your mosquito-bite-titted daughter feel bad and want to change the way she is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Basically, I have no boobs and don't want to wear a bra. My parents say it's gross and unladylike and get very upset at me over it, my mum in particular won't let me leave the house without one. I think it's highly inappropriate and a really silly thing to punish me over.\n\nAITA for choosing not to wear a bra at home or when I go out casually with friends?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wearing a bra. The situation involves a 17-year-old girl with a very small chest size who feels that bras are unnecessary and uncomfortable. Her parents are pressuring her to wear one, making comments about her not being feminine enough, and even punishing her by not letting her leave the house without one. The girl feels that her mother is projecting her own insecurities and that the pressure is unwarranted, especially since she's fine with her body as it is.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the cultural and societal norms around wearing bras. In many Western cultures, it's common for women to wear bras for support and modesty, especially in public. However, the author's case is unique because of her very small chest size. An A-cup, as she mentions, might not require a bra for support, and she finds them bulky and unnecessary. So, the question is whether the societal expectation applies to her situation.\n\nThen there's the aspect of parental authority versus personal autonomy. The parents are enforcing their beliefs on their daughter, but at 17, she's approaching adulthood and likely seeking more independence. The mother's comments about boys liking her and her being more feminine could be seen as pressuring the daughter to conform to traditional gender roles, which the daughter is resisting by expressing her tomboyish and studious nature.\n\nThe daughter's response, while perhaps harsh, might stem from frustration. She mentions that her mother sent her a video about making her breasts look bigger, which she didn't ask for. This could indicate that the mother is imposing her own expectations, leading the daughter to push back. The daughter's statement about her mother projecting insecurities might be valid if the mother is transferring her own body image issues onto her child. However, the daughter's outburst causing her mother to cry is a point of contention. Even if the mother was wrong in her approach, the daughter's response could be seen as crossing a line, but the context of ongoing pressure might mitigate that.\n\nLegally and ethically, the daughter has the right to make decisions about her body, especially as she's a minor but approaching adulthood. The parents' actions might be overstepping by using punishment (not letting her leave the house) for a choice that's primarily personal. However, in many societies, parents do have a role in guiding their children's behavior, especially regarding modesty and social norms.\n\nThe key points to weigh are: the daughter's autonomy, the parents' concern for social norms and modesty, the daughter's physical comfort and body acceptance, and the potential for the parents to enforce norms in a way that's oppressive. The daughter's right to self-determination is a strong argument in her favor, especially if the parents are using emotional manipulation or punishment. However, the daughter's harsh response might be seen as equally problematic, though perhaps understandable given the circumstances.\n\nIn conclusion, the daughter's choice not to wear a bra is a personal one, and given her small chest size, it's reasonable. The parents' insistence on it might be culturally driven but could be overbearing. The daughter isn't in the wrong for making a choice that affects her comfort and identity, even if it goes against traditional expectations. Therefore, the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
