Love to get some fellow ladies input on this! I'm 17, for reference. Barely A-cup. I'm plain-looking and quite tomboyish - very studious and not interested in fashion or dating at all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's the argument:\n\nMy parents believe bras are a form of underwear and that it's gross not to wear one. They often ask me if I'm wearing one (which in my mind proves it makes no difference if people can't even tell whether or not I have one), and if I say no, they won't let me leave the house. Mum often comments things like 'don't you want boys to like you?' or 'you like like a boy, you should be more feminine'. My mum feels that I do not care about my body and I'm being lazy by not wearing one. I went out without a bra once accidently (in winter, wearing 3 layers of clothing) and was yelled at and told I was ungrateful.\n\nI find bras very unnecessary and uncomfortable. A-cups are too big for me, they're awkward and bulky most of the time and I think mum's comments are really inappropriate. Nobody but her cares about my boobs. I understand that for most people it would be highly inappropriate to not wear a bra but I just don't have boobs. Bras are about support and modesty. I have nothing to support. She's right, I might as well be a boy, why is that a bad thing?\n\nI lost my temper in our most recent disagreement over it. Mum sent me a video about execerises that make your boobs look bigger. I didn't ask, I don't care, and I feel like deep down she's disappointed she gave birth to a flat-chested, tomboyish daughter rather than a gorgeous popular one. I told my mum to stop projecting her own body image insecurities onto me because I'm perfectly okay with my small bust and that it's my own damn decision what to think about my body. I feel bad for saying that because she started crying but it was in the heat of the moment and she was waaaay out of line imo. \n\nI acknowledge this who thing is quite biased but I just can't see the logic in trying to make your mosquito-bite-titted daughter feel bad and want to change the way she is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Basically, I have no boobs and don't want to wear a bra. My parents say it's gross and unladylike and get very upset at me over it, my mum in particular won't let me leave the house without one. I think it's highly inappropriate and a really silly thing to punish me over.\n\nAITA for choosing not to wear a bra at home or when I go out casually with friends?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is a 17-year-old girl with a very small chest size, barely an A-cup. She doesn't wear a bra because she finds it unnecessary and uncomfortable, and her parents are pressuring her to do so. They even prevent her from leaving the house without one, which seems extreme. The mother's comments about wanting her to be more feminine and appealing to boys are part of the issue. The daughter feels her body image is being policed, and she's pushing back, which led to a conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if not wearing a bra is inherently wrong. For someone with a small bust, a bra might not be necessary for support or modesty. The parent's argument is based on social norms, but the daughter's comfort and autonomy are key here. The parents are imposing their expectations, which might be rooted in traditional gender roles. The daughter's right to make personal choices about her body, especially at her age, is important. The mother's emotional response and the punishment for not wearing a bra seem over the top. The daughter's outburst was in self-defense against what she perceives as unfair treatment. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the question is whether the daughter is in the wrong for not wearing a bra. Since she's a minor, there might be a cultural expectation for parents to guide their children. However, the parents' methods are questionable. The daughter's reasoning is valid\u2014she doesn't have the physical need for a bra, and her autonomy should be respected. The mother's comments about the daughter being more like a boy and needing to be more feminine are problematic and could be a form of body shaming. The daughter's stance is about self-acceptance and personal comfort, which is a positive thing. \n\nThe parents are projecting their own insecurities, as the daughter suggests. The punishment for not wearing a bra is excessive, especially when the daughter is comfortable and there's no societal issue. The answer would lean towards the daughter not being in the wrong because the situation is about her right to make personal choices and the parent's overreaction. So, the answer should be B.\n"
