Love to get some fellow ladies input on this! I'm 17, for reference. Barely A-cup. I'm plain-looking and quite tomboyish - very studious and not interested in fashion or dating at all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's the argument:\n\nMy parents believe bras are a form of underwear and that it's gross not to wear one. They often ask me if I'm wearing one (which in my mind proves it makes no difference if people can't even tell whether or not I have one), and if I say no, they won't let me leave the house. Mum often comments things like 'don't you want boys to like you?' or 'you like like a boy, you should be more feminine'. My mum feels that I do not care about my body and I'm being lazy by not wearing one. I went out without a bra once accidently (in winter, wearing 3 layers of clothing) and was yelled at and told I was ungrateful.\n\nI find bras very unnecessary and uncomfortable. A-cups are too big for me, they're awkward and bulky most of the time and I think mum's comments are really inappropriate. Nobody but her cares about my boobs. I understand that for most people it would be highly inappropriate to not wear a bra but I just don't have boobs. Bras are about support and modesty. I have nothing to support. She's right, I might as well be a boy, why is that a bad thing?\n\nI lost my temper in our most recent disagreement over it. Mum sent me a video about execerises that make your boobs look bigger. I didn't ask, I don't care, and I feel like deep down she's disappointed she gave birth to a flat-chested, tomboyish daughter rather than a gorgeous popular one. I told my mum to stop projecting her own body image insecurities onto me because I'm perfectly okay with my small bust and that it's my own damn decision what to think about my body. I feel bad for saying that because she started crying but it was in the heat of the moment and she was waaaay out of line imo. \n\nI acknowledge this who thing is quite biased but I just can't see the logic in trying to make your mosquito-bite-titted daughter feel bad and want to change the way she is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Basically, I have no boobs and don't want to wear a bra. My parents say it's gross and unladylike and get very upset at me over it, my mum in particular won't let me leave the house without one. I think it's highly inappropriate and a really silly thing to punish me over.\n\nAITA for choosing not to wear a bra at home or when I go out casually with friends?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong for not wearing a bra. The author is a 17-year-old girl with a very small bust size who finds bras uncomfortable and unnecessary. Her parents, especially her mom, are pressuring her to wear one, saying it's about modesty and femininity, and even threatening not to let her leave the house if she doesn't. The mom also makes comments about boys liking her and being more feminine. The author feels that her mom is projecting her own body image issues onto her and that it's inappropriate for her parents to be so upset over this.\n\nFirst, I need to consider societal norms and expectations. In many cultures, particularly in the West, wearing a bra is seen as a standard part of undergarments for women, especially in public. However, the author points out that she's a tiny A-cup, so a bra isn't necessary for support. This could be a valid point. The discomfort and lack of necessity might support her stance.\n\nThen there's the aspect of parental authority. Parents often set boundaries for their children, especially teenagers, based on their values. However, the question is whether those boundaries are reasonable. The mom is making it a rule to not let her leave the house without a bra, which seems like an overreaction if the girl is comfortable and there's no actual need for support. Also, the mom's comments about boys and femininity might be pushing the daughter to conform to societal standards that the daughter isn't interested in.\n\nAnother angle is the daughter's autonomy. At 17, she's approaching adulthood and might feel her body and choices are her own. The mom's projection of her insecurities, as the daughter claims, could be a factor. The daughter's response, though heated, was a reaction to what she perceives as invalid pressure. The mom crying and feeling hurt shows the emotional toll, but the daughter's stance is about personal choice.\n\nLegally and ethically, clothing choices are a matter of personal freedom, especially when it doesn't harm others. The parents might argue modesty, but if the daughter is clothed appropriately otherwise and the lack of a bra isn't visible, it's more about personal comfort. The parents' enforcement through punishment (not letting her leave) could be seen as controlling and not respecting her autonomy.\n\nIn terms of cultural context, some societies are more strict about such things, but the post is from a place where individual choice is valued. The daughter's argument that it's unnecessary because she has no need for support is logical. The mom's comments about femininity and boys might be imposing societal expectations she thinks her daughter should meet, but the daughter isn't interested in those aspects.\n\nConsidering all this, the daughter isn't in the wrong. The parents are enforcing rules that don't align with the daughter's physical reality or personal preferences, using emotional manipulation and punishment. The daughter's response, while heated, is a stand for her autonomy and comfort. The answer should be B (No).\n"
