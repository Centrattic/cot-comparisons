Love to get some fellow ladies input on this! I'm 17, for reference. Barely A-cup. I'm plain-looking and quite tomboyish - very studious and not interested in fashion or dating at all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's the argument:\n\nMy parents believe bras are a form of underwear and that it's gross not to wear one. They often ask me if I'm wearing one (which in my mind proves it makes no difference if people can't even tell whether or not I have one), and if I say no, they won't let me leave the house. Mum often comments things like 'don't you want boys to like you?' or 'you like like a boy, you should be more feminine'. My mum feels that I do not care about my body and I'm being lazy by not wearing one. I went out without a bra once accidently (in winter, wearing 3 layers of clothing) and was yelled at and told I was ungrateful.\n\nI find bras very unnecessary and uncomfortable. A-cups are too big for me, they're awkward and bulky most of the time and I think mum's comments are really inappropriate. Nobody but her cares about my boobs. I understand that for most people it would be highly inappropriate to not wear a bra but I just don't have boobs. Bras are about support and modesty. I have nothing to support. She's right, I might as well be a boy, why is that a bad thing?\n\nI lost my temper in our most recent disagreement over it. Mum sent me a video about execerises that make your boobs look bigger. I didn't ask, I don't care, and I feel like deep down she's disappointed she gave birth to a flat-chested, tomboyish daughter rather than a gorgeous popular one. I told my mum to stop projecting her own body image insecurities onto me because I'm perfectly okay with my small bust and that it's my own damn decision what to think about my body. I feel bad for saying that because she started crying but it was in the heat of the moment and she was waaaay out of line imo. \n\nI acknowledge this who thing is quite biased but I just can't see the logic in trying to make your mosquito-bite-titted daughter feel bad and want to change the way she is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Basically, I have no boobs and don't want to wear a bra. My parents say it's gross and unladylike and get very upset at me over it, my mum in particular won't let me leave the house without one. I think it's highly inappropriate and a really silly thing to punish me over.\n\nAITA for choosing not to wear a bra at home or when I go out casually with friends?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wearing a bra, based on the scenario provided.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is 17, very small breasted (A-cup, almost nothing), and finds bras uncomfortable and unnecessary. They identify as tomboyish and not interested in fashion or dating. The parents insist that not wearing a bra is improper, especially the mom who says it's about being feminine and making boys like her. The author feels the pressure is misplaced because their body doesn't require a bra for support or modesty. The conflict escalated when the author lashed out, accusing the mom of projecting her own insecurities.\n\nSo, the key points here are bodily autonomy vs. parental expectations. The author is choosing not to wear a bra because they don't feel it's necessary, and the parents are imposing their views, which the author sees as body-shaming. The question is whether the author is wrong for making that choice.\n\nFrom a rights perspective, bodily autonomy is important. People should have the right to decide what they wear on their own bodies, especially as teenagers navigating their own identity. The author isn't causing harm to others by not wearing a bra; it's a personal choice. The parents are enforcing their standards, which might stem from traditional views on femininity. However, forcing someone to wear clothing that's uncomfortable and unnecessary, especially when it's not for health or safety reasons, could be considered overreaching.\n\nThe author's mom is using emotional manipulation, linking not wearing a bra to being ungrateful and projecting her own desires onto her daughter. The author's response, while harsh, comes from feeling that their body is being policed. The mom's crying shows the emotional toll, but the author's stance is about self-acceptance.\n\nLegally and ethically, unless there's a specific rule (like a school dress code) requiring bras, the author isn't violating any laws. Social norms vary, but in many contexts, not wearing a bra isn't a public issue, especially with layering clothes. The author's choice is a personal matter, and the parents should respect that unless there's a valid reason for the rule.\n\nConsidering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. They're asserting their right to body autonomy and rejecting their parents' unrealistic expectations. The parents are the ones applying pressure and body-shaming, which is the problematic behavior here.\n"
