Love to get some fellow ladies input on this! I'm 17, for reference. Barely A-cup. I'm plain-looking and quite tomboyish - very studious and not interested in fashion or dating at all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's the argument:\n\nMy parents believe bras are a form of underwear and that it's gross not to wear one. They often ask me if I'm wearing one (which in my mind proves it makes no difference if people can't even tell whether or not I have one), and if I say no, they won't let me leave the house. Mum often comments things like 'don't you want boys to like you?' or 'you like like a boy, you should be more feminine'. My mum feels that I do not care about my body and I'm being lazy by not wearing one. I went out without a bra once accidently (in winter, wearing 3 layers of clothing) and was yelled at and told I was ungrateful.\n\nI find bras very unnecessary and uncomfortable. A-cups are too big for me, they're awkward and bulky most of the time and I think mum's comments are really inappropriate. Nobody but her cares about my boobs. I understand that for most people it would be highly inappropriate to not wear a bra but I just don't have boobs. Bras are about support and modesty. I have nothing to support. She's right, I might as well be a boy, why is that a bad thing?\n\nI lost my temper in our most recent disagreement over it. Mum sent me a video about execerises that make your boobs look bigger. I didn't ask, I don't care, and I feel like deep down she's disappointed she gave birth to a flat-chested, tomboyish daughter rather than a gorgeous popular one. I told my mum to stop projecting her own body image insecurities onto me because I'm perfectly okay with my small bust and that it's my own damn decision what to think about my body. I feel bad for saying that because she started crying but it was in the heat of the moment and she was waaaay out of line imo. \n\nI acknowledge this who thing is quite biased but I just can't see the logic in trying to make your mosquito-bite-titted daughter feel bad and want to change the way she is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Basically, I have no boobs and don't want to wear a bra. My parents say it's gross and unladylike and get very upset at me over it, my mum in particular won't let me leave the house without one. I think it's highly inappropriate and a really silly thing to punish me over.\n\nAITA for choosing not to wear a bra at home or when I go out casually with friends?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to determine if the author is in the wrong for not wearing a bra. Let me start by reading through the situation carefully. The author is a 17-year-old with a very small bust, an A-cup, and describes herself as plain-looking and tomboyish. She doesn't care about fashion or dating and finds bras uncomfortable and unnecessary. Her parents, especially her mom, make her feel like not wearing a bra is improper or ungrateful, and they won't let her leave the house without one. The mom comments about wanting boys to like her and being more feminine. The author feels the mom is projecting her own insecurities onto her daughter.\n\nFirst, I should consider the societal norms around wearing bras. In many cultures, especially Western ones, it's common for women to wear bras for support and modesty. However, the author's case is different because she has a very small bust. A-cups are still considered small, and in such cases, some people might not find a bra necessary, either for comfort or because they don't need the support. There are also health considerations regarding bras, like some studies suggesting that not wearing them can be beneficial for posture or comfort if the breasts are small.\n\nThe parents are enforcing their views, which the author finds controlling and based on body image issues. The mom's comments about wanting boys to like her daughter and being disappointed in her tomboyish nature might stem from traditional gender expectations. The author's decision not to wear a bra is a personal choice, and her parents are using it as a means to control her behavior. The author's response to her mom's video about exercises to increase breast size shows she's resisting these pressures, which might be justified if the mom is indeed projecting her own insecurities.\n\nLegally and ethically, there's no law that requires wearing a bra in most places. It's a personal choice, especially when it comes to clothing. However, the parents might be using their authority to enforce their views, which could be seen as overstepping, particularly if it's causing emotional distress. The author's mom is using emotional manipulation (e.g., crying) and punishment (not letting her leave the house) to enforce compliance, which is a form of control.\n\nThe key points here are autonomy, body image, and parental control. The author is asserting her autonomy in her body and clothing choices, which is a significant aspect of individual rights. The parents, on the other hand, are trying to enforce societal norms that may not align with the author's personal experience and comfort. Since the author is 17, she's still a minor, but she's developing her own identity and values, which is a normal part of adolescence.\n\nIn terms of whether she's in the wrong, the answer depends on whose perspective you take. From the parents' viewpoint, they might believe they're teaching modesty and proper behavior. From the author's perspective, she's standing up against unnecessary pressure and asserting her right to body autonomy. Since there's no legal requirement and the issue is more about personal choice and comfort, especially given her small bust, the author's stance seems valid. The parents' reactions, however, might be problematic as they could be enabling the author's mom's own insecurities and enforcing gendered expectations that are harmful.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong for choosing not to wear a bra, as it's a personal choice related to her comfort and body type. The real issue might be the parents' overreach and the mom's projection of her own issues onto her daughter.\n"
