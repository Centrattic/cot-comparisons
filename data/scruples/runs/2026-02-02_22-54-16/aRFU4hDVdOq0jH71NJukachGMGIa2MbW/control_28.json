Love to get some fellow ladies input on this! I'm 17, for reference. Barely A-cup. I'm plain-looking and quite tomboyish - very studious and not interested in fashion or dating at all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's the argument:\n\nMy parents believe bras are a form of underwear and that it's gross not to wear one. They often ask me if I'm wearing one (which in my mind proves it makes no difference if people can't even tell whether or not I have one), and if I say no, they won't let me leave the house. Mum often comments things like 'don't you want boys to like you?' or 'you like like a boy, you should be more feminine'. My mum feels that I do not care about my body and I'm being lazy by not wearing one. I went out without a bra once accidently (in winter, wearing 3 layers of clothing) and was yelled at and told I was ungrateful.\n\nI find bras very unnecessary and uncomfortable. A-cups are too big for me, they're awkward and bulky most of the time and I think mum's comments are really inappropriate. Nobody but her cares about my boobs. I understand that for most people it would be highly inappropriate to not wear a bra but I just don't have boobs. Bras are about support and modesty. I have nothing to support. She's right, I might as well be a boy, why is that a bad thing?\n\nI lost my temper in our most recent disagreement over it. Mum sent me a video about execerises that make your boobs look bigger. I didn't ask, I don't care, and I feel like deep down she's disappointed she gave birth to a flat-chested, tomboyish daughter rather than a gorgeous popular one. I told my mum to stop projecting her own body image insecurities onto me because I'm perfectly okay with my small bust and that it's my own damn decision what to think about my body. I feel bad for saying that because she started crying but it was in the heat of the moment and she was waaaay out of line imo. \n\nI acknowledge this who thing is quite biased but I just can't see the logic in trying to make your mosquito-bite-titted daughter feel bad and want to change the way she is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Basically, I have no boobs and don't want to wear a bra. My parents say it's gross and unladylike and get very upset at me over it, my mum in particular won't let me leave the house without one. I think it's highly inappropriate and a really silly thing to punish me over.\n\nAITA for choosing not to wear a bra at home or when I go out casually with friends?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a 17-year-old who's barely an A-cup and finds bras uncomfortable. They don't want to wear one because they feel it's unnecessary since their chest is so small. Their parents, especially the mom, are pushing them to wear a bra for modesty and femininity reasons, even going as far as not letting them leave the house without one. The parent's arguments are about support and modesty, but the user argues that since they have a very small chest, there's nothing to support or cover. They also mention that the mom's comments are about wanting them to be more feminine and attractive to boys, which the user resents.\n\nThe user is asking if they're in the wrong for not wearing a bra. The options are A (yes, they're wrong) or B (no, they're not). \n\nFrom a rights perspective, the user has the right to make personal choices about their body, especially as a teenager. The parents are enforcing their own standards of modesty and femininity, which might not align with the child's comfort or identity. The user's reasoning is logical\u2014they don't feel the need for a bra due to their size and find it uncomfortable. The parents' reactions seem to be projecting their own insecurities or societal expectations onto the child. The user's frustration with the mom's comments about being disappointed in her daughter's body is valid. The mom's approach of not allowing them to leave the house without a bra is controlling and could be seen as invalidating the child's autonomy. \n\nConsidering cultural norms, while some might argue that wearing a bra is standard for modesty, the user's situation is unique because of their small size. There's also the aspect of the parents' behavior being overbearing. The user's right to self-expression and bodily autonomy is important here. The parents' insistence might be causing unnecessary stress and could be impacting the user's self-esteem negatively. \n\nIn terms of whether the user is in the wrong, it's about personal choice versus parental control. Unless there's a specific cultural or religious reason that makes wearing a bra mandatory, the user isn't wrong for choosing not to. The parents are wrong for enforcing their views in a harmful way. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
