Love to get some fellow ladies input on this! I'm 17, for reference. Barely A-cup. I'm plain-looking and quite tomboyish - very studious and not interested in fashion or dating at all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's the argument:\n\nMy parents believe bras are a form of underwear and that it's gross not to wear one. They often ask me if I'm wearing one (which in my mind proves it makes no difference if people can't even tell whether or not I have one), and if I say no, they won't let me leave the house. Mum often comments things like 'don't you want boys to like you?' or 'you like like a boy, you should be more feminine'. My mum feels that I do not care about my body and I'm being lazy by not wearing one. I went out without a bra once accidently (in winter, wearing 3 layers of clothing) and was yelled at and told I was ungrateful.\n\nI find bras very unnecessary and uncomfortable. A-cups are too big for me, they're awkward and bulky most of the time and I think mum's comments are really inappropriate. Nobody but her cares about my boobs. I understand that for most people it would be highly inappropriate to not wear a bra but I just don't have boobs. Bras are about support and modesty. I have nothing to support. She's right, I might as well be a boy, why is that a bad thing?\n\nI lost my temper in our most recent disagreement over it. Mum sent me a video about execerises that make your boobs look bigger. I didn't ask, I don't care, and I feel like deep down she's disappointed she gave birth to a flat-chested, tomboyish daughter rather than a gorgeous popular one. I told my mum to stop projecting her own body image insecurities onto me because I'm perfectly okay with my small bust and that it's my own damn decision what to think about my body. I feel bad for saying that because she started crying but it was in the heat of the moment and she was waaaay out of line imo. \n\nI acknowledge this who thing is quite biased but I just can't see the logic in trying to make your mosquito-bite-titted daughter feel bad and want to change the way she is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Basically, I have no boobs and don't want to wear a bra. My parents say it's gross and unladylike and get very upset at me over it, my mum in particular won't let me leave the house without one. I think it's highly inappropriate and a really silly thing to punish me over.\n\nAITA for choosing not to wear a bra at home or when I go out casually with friends?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wearing a bra. The situation is that the author is 17, has a very small chest (A-cup), and finds bras uncomfortable and unnecessary. Her parents are pushing her to wear one, using comments about femininity and boys liking her. She got into an argument and said some hurtful things, but she stands by her decision.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The parents' perspective is that it's about modesty and being presentable. They might feel that not wearing a bra is against societal norms and could affect her image. But the author argues that she's not the target audience for bras in terms of support or modesty because her chest size doesn't require it. She's also asserting her autonomy in body decisions.\n\nLegally, there's no law against not wearing a bra in most places. The issue here is more about family dynamics and personal choice. The author is in her teens, so she's in a phase where she's developing her identity. Her parents might have traditional views, but the author is clear that she's comfortable with her body and doesn't want to wear a bra. \n\nThe key points are autonomy, body image, and the parents' overstepping. The author isn't harming anyone by not wearing a bra, especially given her small size. The parents are pressuring her with comments about femininity and even projecting their own insecurities, which is problematic. The author's reaction was in self-defense against what she perceives as invalid pressure.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for choosing not to wear a bra. The conflict is more about the parents not respecting her personal choice and body autonomy. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
