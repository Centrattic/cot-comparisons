Love to get some fellow ladies input on this! I'm 17, for reference. Barely A-cup. I'm plain-looking and quite tomboyish - very studious and not interested in fashion or dating at all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's the argument:\n\nMy parents believe bras are a form of underwear and that it's gross not to wear one. They often ask me if I'm wearing one (which in my mind proves it makes no difference if people can't even tell whether or not I have one), and if I say no, they won't let me leave the house. Mum often comments things like 'don't you want boys to like you?' or 'you like like a boy, you should be more feminine'. My mum feels that I do not care about my body and I'm being lazy by not wearing one. I went out without a bra once accidently (in winter, wearing 3 layers of clothing) and was yelled at and told I was ungrateful.\n\nI find bras very unnecessary and uncomfortable. A-cups are too big for me, they're awkward and bulky most of the time and I think mum's comments are really inappropriate. Nobody but her cares about my boobs. I understand that for most people it would be highly inappropriate to not wear a bra but I just don't have boobs. Bras are about support and modesty. I have nothing to support. She's right, I might as well be a boy, why is that a bad thing?\n\nI lost my temper in our most recent disagreement over it. Mum sent me a video about execerises that make your boobs look bigger. I didn't ask, I don't care, and I feel like deep down she's disappointed she gave birth to a flat-chested, tomboyish daughter rather than a gorgeous popular one. I told my mum to stop projecting her own body image insecurities onto me because I'm perfectly okay with my small bust and that it's my own damn decision what to think about my body. I feel bad for saying that because she started crying but it was in the heat of the moment and she was waaaay out of line imo. \n\nI acknowledge this who thing is quite biased but I just can't see the logic in trying to make your mosquito-bite-titted daughter feel bad and want to change the way she is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Basically, I have no boobs and don't want to wear a bra. My parents say it's gross and unladylike and get very upset at me over it, my mum in particular won't let me leave the house without one. I think it's highly inappropriate and a really silly thing to punish me over.\n\nAITA for choosing not to wear a bra at home or when I go out casually with friends?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the 17-year-old girl is in the wrong for not wearing a bra. The parents think it's gross and require her to wear one when going out. She's an A-cup, feels it's unnecessary and uncomfortable, and has a tomboyish personality. She also got upset with her mom for sending videos about breast exercises and told her to stop projecting insecurities.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the situation from both sides. The parents are focused on modesty and societal norms, perhaps thinking that wearing a bra is a standard part of being a girl. They might be influenced by their own beliefs or cultural expectations. However, the girl's perspective is about her own comfort and body image. Since she's a minor, there's the aspect of parental authority, but also her right to self-expression and body autonomy.\n\nThe parents are using punishment, like not letting her leave the house, which could be controlling. The mom's comments about boys liking her and being more feminine might be pressuring the girl to conform to traditional beauty standards, which could be harmful. The girl's outburst, though harsh, seems to be a reaction to this pressure, and she's standing up for her own choices. Her argument that there's nothing to support and that she's not interested in fashion or dating suggests it's not about appearance for others but her own comfort and identity.\n\nFrom a modern standpoint, body autonomy is important. Parents can't force their children to wear clothing that doesn't serve a practical purpose. The girl's refusal to wear a bra in casual settings where it's not necessary (like with layers or friends) is a personal choice. The mom's reaction might be more about her own insecurities or societal expectations rather than the daughter's well-being.\n\nSo, considering that the parents are making her feel bad about her natural body and her small bust size, and using punishment, the girl isn't in the wrong. Her stance on not wearing a bra is valid as a personal choice, especially when the parents' behavior crosses into body-shaming. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
