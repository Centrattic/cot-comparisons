Love to get some fellow ladies input on this! I'm 17, for reference. Barely A-cup. I'm plain-looking and quite tomboyish - very studious and not interested in fashion or dating at all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's the argument:\n\nMy parents believe bras are a form of underwear and that it's gross not to wear one. They often ask me if I'm wearing one (which in my mind proves it makes no difference if people can't even tell whether or not I have one), and if I say no, they won't let me leave the house. Mum often comments things like 'don't you want boys to like you?' or 'you like like a boy, you should be more feminine'. My mum feels that I do not care about my body and I'm being lazy by not wearing one. I went out without a bra once accidently (in winter, wearing 3 layers of clothing) and was yelled at and told I was ungrateful.\n\nI find bras very unnecessary and uncomfortable. A-cups are too big for me, they're awkward and bulky most of the time and I think mum's comments are really inappropriate. Nobody but her cares about my boobs. I understand that for most people it would be highly inappropriate to not wear a bra but I just don't have boobs. Bras are about support and modesty. I have nothing to support. She's right, I might as well be a boy, why is that a bad thing?\n\nI lost my temper in our most recent disagreement over it. Mum sent me a video about execerises that make your boobs look bigger. I didn't ask, I don't care, and I feel like deep down she's disappointed she gave birth to a flat-chested, tomboyish daughter rather than a gorgeous popular one. I told my mum to stop projecting her own body image insecurities onto me because I'm perfectly okay with my small bust and that it's my own damn decision what to think about my body. I feel bad for saying that because she started crying but it was in the heat of the moment and she was waaaay out of line imo. \n\nI acknowledge this who thing is quite biased but I just can't see the logic in trying to make your mosquito-bite-titted daughter feel bad and want to change the way she is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Basically, I have no boobs and don't want to wear a bra. My parents say it's gross and unladylike and get very upset at me over it, my mum in particular won't let me leave the house without one. I think it's highly inappropriate and a really silly thing to punish me over.\n\nAITA for choosing not to wear a bra at home or when I go out casually with friends?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wearing a bra. The situation is that the author is 17, with a barely A-cup, and her parents are insistent she wears a bra. They even prevent her from leaving the house if she doesn't, and the mom makes comments about wanting boys to like her and being more feminine. The author finds bras uncomfortable and unnecessary because she's so flat. She pushed back and said her mom is projecting her own insecurities.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. From the author's perspective, she's a teenager asserting her autonomy over her own body. She's not causing harm to anyone by not wearing a bra, and her parents are enforcing a norm that might not be necessary for her body type. The mom's comments about boys and femininity could be seen as pressuring her to conform to societal standards she doesn't agree with. The fact that she's tomboyish and not interested in fashion suggests that this is a personal choice tied to her identity.\n\nOn the other hand, the parents might believe they're teaching modesty or preparing her for societal expectations. However, if the daughter's comfort and self-expression are being stifled, that's a problem. The mom's reaction of crying and the punishment (not letting her leave) might be overreactions, especially since the daughter's choice isn't affecting others. The author's frustration with her mom's behavior and the comment about projecting insecurities could indicate that the mom is imposing her own beliefs rather than respecting her daughter's autonomy.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's about bodily autonomy. The author isn't harming anyone, so she's not in the wrong. The parents are enforcing a rule that doesn't align with her physical needs and personal identity. The answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. The key points are her right to make decisions about her body and the parents' overreach in controlling her choices without valid reasons. The mom's comments about boys and femininity also suggest a pressure to conform that's not appropriate for a 17-year-old to handle.\n"
