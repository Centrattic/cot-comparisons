Love to get some fellow ladies input on this! I'm 17, for reference. Barely A-cup. I'm plain-looking and quite tomboyish - very studious and not interested in fashion or dating at all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's the argument:\n\nMy parents believe bras are a form of underwear and that it's gross not to wear one. They often ask me if I'm wearing one (which in my mind proves it makes no difference if people can't even tell whether or not I have one), and if I say no, they won't let me leave the house. Mum often comments things like 'don't you want boys to like you?' or 'you like like a boy, you should be more feminine'. My mum feels that I do not care about my body and I'm being lazy by not wearing one. I went out without a bra once accidently (in winter, wearing 3 layers of clothing) and was yelled at and told I was ungrateful.\n\nI find bras very unnecessary and uncomfortable. A-cups are too big for me, they're awkward and bulky most of the time and I think mum's comments are really inappropriate. Nobody but her cares about my boobs. I understand that for most people it would be highly inappropriate to not wear a bra but I just don't have boobs. Bras are about support and modesty. I have nothing to support. She's right, I might as well be a boy, why is that a bad thing?\n\nI lost my temper in our most recent disagreement over it. Mum sent me a video about execerises that make your boobs look bigger. I didn't ask, I don't care, and I feel like deep down she's disappointed she gave birth to a flat-chested, tomboyish daughter rather than a gorgeous popular one. I told my mum to stop projecting her own body image insecurities onto me because I'm perfectly okay with my small bust and that it's my own damn decision what to think about my body. I feel bad for saying that because she started crying but it was in the heat of the moment and she was waaaay out of line imo. \n\nI acknowledge this who thing is quite biased but I just can't see the logic in trying to make your mosquito-bite-titted daughter feel bad and want to change the way she is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Basically, I have no boobs and don't want to wear a bra. My parents say it's gross and unladylike and get very upset at me over it, my mum in particular won't let me leave the house without one. I think it's highly inappropriate and a really silly thing to punish me over.\n\nAITA for choosing not to wear a bra at home or when I go out casually with friends?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wearing a bra. The situation involves a 17-year-old with a small chest size who feels bras are unnecessary and uncomfortable. Her parents are pressuring her to wear them, citing modesty and societal norms. The author is resisting, feeling that her parents are projecting their own insecurities and that their reactions are excessive.\n\nFirst, I need to consider societal norms. In many Western societies, there's a growing movement towards body positivity and the idea that wearing a bra is a personal choice, not a requirement. Especially for someone with a small bust, the necessity of a bra for support is minimal. So the author's stance seems valid from a body autonomy perspective.\n\nThen there's the parents' argument. They see it as a matter of modesty and femininity. However, modesty standards can be subjective and culturally influenced. The mother's comments about boys liking her and wanting her to be more feminine might indicate that the pressure is more about societal expectations than actual modesty needs. The author's response about her mother projecting her insecurities points to possible issues in the parent's own body image or dissatisfaction with the daughter not fitting a certain mold.\n\nThe conflict here is between the author's autonomy and the parents' traditional views. The key points are the author's physical comfort, her right to self-expression, and the parents' overreach in enforcing their views. The author isn't harming anyone by not wearing a bra; it's a personal choice. The parents, on the other hand, are using punishment (not letting her leave the house) which could be seen as controlling and not respecting the daughter's autonomy.\n\nAlso, considering the author's age, 17 is an age where teens are developing their own identities. The parents' insistence might be stifling her individuality. The mother's emotional response and the daughter's frustration suggest deeper issues of control and body image pressures.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author is making a choice that affects her comfort and self-perception. The parents' reaction is based on their beliefs, but that doesn't necessarily make the daughter wrong for not complying. The author's argument that the issue is trivial given her small bust size is a valid point. So, the answer would lean towards B (No), the author is not in the wrong because the choice to not wear a bra is a personal one, especially when the necessity is minimal.\n"
