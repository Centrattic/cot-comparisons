Love to get some fellow ladies input on this! I'm 17, for reference. Barely A-cup. I'm plain-looking and quite tomboyish - very studious and not interested in fashion or dating at all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's the argument:\n\nMy parents believe bras are a form of underwear and that it's gross not to wear one. They often ask me if I'm wearing one (which in my mind proves it makes no difference if people can't even tell whether or not I have one), and if I say no, they won't let me leave the house. Mum often comments things like 'don't you want boys to like you?' or 'you like like a boy, you should be more feminine'. My mum feels that I do not care about my body and I'm being lazy by not wearing one. I went out without a bra once accidently (in winter, wearing 3 layers of clothing) and was yelled at and told I was ungrateful.\n\nI find bras very unnecessary and uncomfortable. A-cups are too big for me, they're awkward and bulky most of the time and I think mum's comments are really inappropriate. Nobody but her cares about my boobs. I understand that for most people it would be highly inappropriate to not wear a bra but I just don't have boobs. Bras are about support and modesty. I have nothing to support. She's right, I might as well be a boy, why is that a bad thing?\n\nI lost my temper in our most recent disagreement over it. Mum sent me a video about execerises that make your boobs look bigger. I didn't ask, I don't care, and I feel like deep down she's disappointed she gave birth to a flat-chested, tomboyish daughter rather than a gorgeous popular one. I told my mum to stop projecting her own body image insecurities onto me because I'm perfectly okay with my small bust and that it's my own damn decision what to think about my body. I feel bad for saying that because she started crying but it was in the heat of the moment and she was waaaay out of line imo. \n\nI acknowledge this who thing is quite biased but I just can't see the logic in trying to make your mosquito-bite-titted daughter feel bad and want to change the way she is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Basically, I have no boobs and don't want to wear a bra. My parents say it's gross and unladylike and get very upset at me over it, my mum in particular won't let me leave the house without one. I think it's highly inappropriate and a really silly thing to punish me over.\n\nAITA for choosing not to wear a bra at home or when I go out casually with friends?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this AITA post is in the wrong for not wearing a bra. The situation involves the author's parents, especially the mother, who are upset about it.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author is 17, has a very small bust (A-cup, but maybe even smaller), and finds bras uncomfortable and unnecessary. The parents believe bras are underwear and necessary for modesty. The mother is pressuring the author, making comments about wanting boys to like her, and even sent a video about exercises to get bigger breasts. The author feels that the mother is projecting her own insecurities and is being judgmental.\n\nThe author's main points are that she's comfortable with her body, doesn't see the need for a bra, and thinks the mother's expectations are unrealistic given her small size. The mother is making it a rule to wear a bra, even when it's not necessary, and punishing her for not complying. The author pushed back, which led to the mother crying, but she feels justified.\n\nNow, considering societal norms, in many cultures, not wearing a bra is a personal choice, especially if it's comfortable and appropriate for the situation. The author's mother seems to be enforcing a cultural or personal standard that doesn't fit the daughter's body or preferences. The mother's comments about wanting boys to like her daughter or being disappointed in her appearance could be seen as imposing her own values. \n\nThe key here is whether the author is violating any norms or if the mother's expectations are unreasonable. Since the author has a small bust, the need for support is minimal, and the mother's insistence on wearing a bra in such cases might be more about modesty or societal expectations rather than necessity. The author is asserting her autonomy over her body, which is a valid stance. The mother's reaction, including punishment and emotional comments, seems to be overstepping.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong here. She's making a personal choice about her body and how she dresses, which should be respected. The mother is the one enforcing standards that don't apply to her daughter's situation. The answer should be B (No).\n"
