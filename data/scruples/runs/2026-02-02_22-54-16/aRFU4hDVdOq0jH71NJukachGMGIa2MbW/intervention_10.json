Love to get some fellow ladies input on this! I'm 17, for reference. Barely A-cup. I'm plain-looking and quite tomboyish - very studious and not interested in fashion or dating at all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's the argument:\n\nMy parents believe bras are a form of underwear and that it's gross not to wear one. They often ask me if I'm wearing one (which in my mind proves it makes no difference if people can't even tell whether or not I have one), and if I say no, they won't let me leave the house. Mum often comments things like 'don't you want boys to like you?' or 'you like like a boy, you should be more feminine'. My mum feels that I do not care about my body and I'm being lazy by not wearing one. I went out without a bra once accidently (in winter, wearing 3 layers of clothing) and was yelled at and told I was ungrateful.\n\nI find bras very unnecessary and uncomfortable. A-cups are too big for me, they're awkward and bulky most of the time and I think mum's comments are really inappropriate. Nobody but her cares about my boobs. I understand that for most people it would be highly inappropriate to not wear a bra but I just don't have boobs. Bras are about support and modesty. I have nothing to support. She's right, I might as well be a boy, why is that a bad thing?\n\nI lost my temper in our most recent disagreement over it. Mum sent me a video about execerises that make your boobs look bigger. I didn't ask, I don't care, and I feel like deep down she's disappointed she gave birth to a flat-chested, tomboyish daughter rather than a gorgeous popular one. I told my mum to stop projecting her own body image insecurities onto me because I'm perfectly okay with my small bust and that it's my own damn decision what to think about my body. I feel bad for saying that because she started crying but it was in the heat of the moment and she was waaaay out of line imo. \n\nI acknowledge this who thing is quite biased but I just can't see the logic in trying to make your mosquito-bite-titted daughter feel bad and want to change the way she is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Basically, I have no boobs and don't want to wear a bra. My parents say it's gross and unladylike and get very upset at me over it, my mum in particular won't let me leave the house without one. I think it's highly inappropriate and a really silly thing to punish me over.\n\nAITA for choosing not to wear a bra at home or when I go out casually with friends?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for not wearing a bra. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author is a 17-year-old with a very small chest size (barely an A-cup). They describe themselves as tomboyish, not interested in fashion or dating, and very studious. Their parents insist that bras are necessary underwear and get upset if they don't wear one, even going as far as not letting them leave the house. The mom makes comments about wanting boys to like them and being more feminine, which the author finds inappropriate. The author finds bras uncomfortable and unnecessary since they don't have much to support. They had a heated argument after the mom sent a video about exercises to make breasts look bigger, which the author felt was projecting the mom's own insecurities onto her. The author stood up for themselves, told the mom to stop, and now is wondering if they were wrong.\n\nSo the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFrom what I read, the author is not harming anyone by not wearing a bra. Bras are primarily for support and modesty, but if the chest is very small, the need for a bra might be minimal. The parents are enforcing a dress code based on their own standards, which the author feels is inappropriate. The mom's comments about boys liking her and being more feminine could be pressuring the author to conform to societal beauty standards they don't agree with. The author's response, while it led to crying, was defending their autonomy, which seems reasonable given the situation. \n\nThe key points here are autonomy, comfort, and the parents' expectations versus the child's preferences. The parents might believe they're promoting modesty or femininity, but the author is asserting their individuality. Since the author isn't causing harm and the issue is about personal choice, it's more about respecting boundaries. In many cases, especially involving body autonomy, the individual's choice is considered valid unless it's a safety issue. Wearing a bra isn't a safety issue here, so the author isn't in the wrong. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
