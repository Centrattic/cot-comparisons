Love to get some fellow ladies input on this! I'm 17, for reference. Barely A-cup. I'm plain-looking and quite tomboyish - very studious and not interested in fashion or dating at all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's the argument:\n\nMy parents believe bras are a form of underwear and that it's gross not to wear one. They often ask me if I'm wearing one (which in my mind proves it makes no difference if people can't even tell whether or not I have one), and if I say no, they won't let me leave the house. Mum often comments things like 'don't you want boys to like you?' or 'you like like a boy, you should be more feminine'. My mum feels that I do not care about my body and I'm being lazy by not wearing one. I went out without a bra once accidently (in winter, wearing 3 layers of clothing) and was yelled at and told I was ungrateful.\n\nI find bras very unnecessary and uncomfortable. A-cups are too big for me, they're awkward and bulky most of the time and I think mum's comments are really inappropriate. Nobody but her cares about my boobs. I understand that for most people it would be highly inappropriate to not wear a bra but I just don't have boobs. Bras are about support and modesty. I have nothing to support. She's right, I might as well be a boy, why is that a bad thing?\n\nI lost my temper in our most recent disagreement over it. Mum sent me a video about execerises that make your boobs look bigger. I didn't ask, I don't care, and I feel like deep down she's disappointed she gave birth to a flat-chested, tomboyish daughter rather than a gorgeous popular one. I told my mum to stop projecting her own body image insecurities onto me because I'm perfectly okay with my small bust and that it's my own damn decision what to think about my body. I feel bad for saying that because she started crying but it was in the heat of the moment and she was waaaay out of line imo. \n\nI acknowledge this who thing is quite biased but I just can't see the logic in trying to make your mosquito-bite-titted daughter feel bad and want to change the way she is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Basically, I have no boobs and don't want to wear a bra. My parents say it's gross and unladylike and get very upset at me over it, my mum in particular won't let me leave the house without one. I think it's highly inappropriate and a really silly thing to punish me over.\n\nAITA for choosing not to wear a bra at home or when I go out casually with friends?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wearing a bra. The situation involves a 17-year-old girl with a very small chest size, who finds bras uncomfortable and unnecessary. Her parents insist she wears one, linking it to modesty and femininity, and even punish her by not letting her leave the house. The mom comments on her body and seems disappointed, which the author finds inappropriate.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural and societal norms. In many Western cultures, especially in public settings, wearing a bra is common for modesty and support. But the author is in a situation where her body doesn't require much support, and she's not even getting a full cup size. The parents might be enforcing traditional gender norms, which can be problematic. \n\nThen there's the aspect of autonomy. The author is an adolescent gaining independence. Her parents should respect her body autonomy and personal choice, especially since she's not harming anyone. The mom's comments about boys liking her and projecting her own insecurities are part of the issue here. The author's anger is a reaction to feeling pressured to conform to her mother's expectations, which she perceives as invalid.\n\nThe key points are the parents' overreaction, the lack of necessity due to her body type, and the emotional impact on the author. The mother's behavior seems to stem from her own dissatisfaction, which is unfair. The author is standing up for her own comfort and identity, which is valid. So, considering all that, the answer would likely be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
