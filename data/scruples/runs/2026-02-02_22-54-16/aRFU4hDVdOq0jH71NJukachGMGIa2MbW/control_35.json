Love to get some fellow ladies input on this! I'm 17, for reference. Barely A-cup. I'm plain-looking and quite tomboyish - very studious and not interested in fashion or dating at all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's the argument:\n\nMy parents believe bras are a form of underwear and that it's gross not to wear one. They often ask me if I'm wearing one (which in my mind proves it makes no difference if people can't even tell whether or not I have one), and if I say no, they won't let me leave the house. Mum often comments things like 'don't you want boys to like you?' or 'you like like a boy, you should be more feminine'. My mum feels that I do not care about my body and I'm being lazy by not wearing one. I went out without a bra once accidently (in winter, wearing 3 layers of clothing) and was yelled at and told I was ungrateful.\n\nI find bras very unnecessary and uncomfortable. A-cups are too big for me, they're awkward and bulky most of the time and I think mum's comments are really inappropriate. Nobody but her cares about my boobs. I understand that for most people it would be highly inappropriate to not wear a bra but I just don't have boobs. Bras are about support and modesty. I have nothing to support. She's right, I might as well be a boy, why is that a bad thing?\n\nI lost my temper in our most recent disagreement over it. Mum sent me a video about execerises that make your boobs look bigger. I didn't ask, I don't care, and I feel like deep down she's disappointed she gave birth to a flat-chested, tomboyish daughter rather than a gorgeous popular one. I told my mum to stop projecting her own body image insecurities onto me because I'm perfectly okay with my small bust and that it's my own damn decision what to think about my body. I feel bad for saying that because she started crying but it was in the heat of the moment and she was waaaay out of line imo. \n\nI acknowledge this who thing is quite biased but I just can't see the logic in trying to make your mosquito-bite-titted daughter feel bad and want to change the way she is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Basically, I have no boobs and don't want to wear a bra. My parents say it's gross and unladylike and get very upset at me over it, my mum in particular won't let me leave the house without one. I think it's highly inappropriate and a really silly thing to punish me over.\n\nAITA for choosing not to wear a bra at home or when I go out casually with friends?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wearing a bra. The situation is that the author is 17, has a very small chest size (A-cup, but barely that), and finds bras uncomfortable and unnecessary. Her parents insist she wears one, comparing her to being a boy and making her feel like she's not feminine enough. She got into an argument where she lashed out, saying her mom is projecting insecurities, which made the mom cry.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural norms and personal autonomy. In many cultures, wearing a bra is seen as necessary for modesty and support, but the author's physical situation is such that a bra isn't needed for support. Since she's barely an A-cup, the argument for support is weak. Also, the parents are using emotional manipulation, like saying she needs to wear a bra to attract boys or be more feminine. That pressure could be harmful, especially since she's a teenager forming her identity.\n\nThen there's the issue of bodily autonomy. The author is asserting her right to make decisions about her own body. Parents typically have authority over their children, but when it comes to personal choices, especially regarding clothing that doesn't harm others, the child's autonomy is important. The parent's insistence might be overstepping here, especially if the child is uncomfortable and the requirement is more about the parent's insecurities than the child's well-being.\n\nThe author's outburst, while leading to her mom crying, was in response to what she perceives as the mom's projecting. It's a heated moment, but she's trying to stand up for herself against pressure to conform to certain beauty standards. The question is whether her actions were justified. Since the parent is using emotional manipulation and the situation is about personal choice, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for defending her autonomy.\n\nAlso, the parent's behavior of not letting her leave the house without a bra is a form of control. While parents can set boundaries, this seems to be about the parent's dissatisfaction rather than the child's safety or health. The author is in a position where she's trying to assert her identity against parental expectations that don't align with her self-perception.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author isn't in the wrong. Her parents are pressuring her to conform to standards that don't apply to her and are causing emotional distress. Her right to choose what she wears on her body, especially when it's not harmful, is valid. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
