Love to get some fellow ladies input on this! I'm 17, for reference. Barely A-cup. I'm plain-looking and quite tomboyish - very studious and not interested in fashion or dating at all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's the argument:\n\nMy parents believe bras are a form of underwear and that it's gross not to wear one. They often ask me if I'm wearing one (which in my mind proves it makes no difference if people can't even tell whether or not I have one), and if I say no, they won't let me leave the house. Mum often comments things like 'don't you want boys to like you?' or 'you like like a boy, you should be more feminine'. My mum feels that I do not care about my body and I'm being lazy by not wearing one. I went out without a bra once accidently (in winter, wearing 3 layers of clothing) and was yelled at and told I was ungrateful.\n\nI find bras very unnecessary and uncomfortable. A-cups are too big for me, they're awkward and bulky most of the time and I think mum's comments are really inappropriate. Nobody but her cares about my boobs. I understand that for most people it would be highly inappropriate to not wear a bra but I just don't have boobs. Bras are about support and modesty. I have nothing to support. She's right, I might as well be a boy, why is that a bad thing?\n\nI lost my temper in our most recent disagreement over it. Mum sent me a video about execerises that make your boobs look bigger. I didn't ask, I don't care, and I feel like deep down she's disappointed she gave birth to a flat-chested, tomboyish daughter rather than a gorgeous popular one. I told my mum to stop projecting her own body image insecurities onto me because I'm perfectly okay with my small bust and that it's my own damn decision what to think about my body. I feel bad for saying that because she started crying but it was in the heat of the moment and she was waaaay out of line imo. \n\nI acknowledge this who thing is quite biased but I just can't see the logic in trying to make your mosquito-bite-titted daughter feel bad and want to change the way she is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Basically, I have no boobs and don't want to wear a bra. My parents say it's gross and unladylike and get very upset at me over it, my mum in particular won't let me leave the house without one. I think it's highly inappropriate and a really silly thing to punish me over.\n\nAITA for choosing not to wear a bra at home or when I go out casually with friends?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wearing a bra. The situation involves a 17-year-old girl with a very small bust size, who is tomboyish and not interested in fashion or dating. Her parents are upset and make her wear a bra, even going as far as not letting her leave the house without one. The girl feels that bras are unnecessary and uncomfortable, and she's frustrated with her mom's comments about being more feminine. She even snapped back at her mom, which led to some emotional conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural and social norms. In many societies, especially in Western cultures, wearing a bra is often seen as part of modesty, particularly in certain settings. However, in places where it's more casual or for people with very small chests, it might not be as necessary. The girl is 17, so she's in a formative age where she's developing her own identity. Her parents might be trying to instill traditional values about femininity and appearance, which can be conflicting if the child doesn't share those views.\n\nThe parents' perspective is that not wearing a bra is indecent or unladylike. They might be concerned about how others perceive their daughter and want to make her present herself in a way that aligns with their expectations. However, the girl argues that she has no need for support and that the parents are projecting their own insecurities onto her. She also mentions that her mom's comments are inappropriate, suggesting that the pressure is coming from a place of wanting to conform to a more \"feminine\" image that the daughter doesn't care about.\n\nFrom a personal freedom standpoint, the girl has the right to make her own clothing choices, especially if she's within a legal age to make such decisions. However, she's still a minor, so her parents might feel they have authority over her. But the question is whether she's in the wrong. The parents are using punishment (not letting her leave the house) for a choice that's largely about personal comfort and identity.\n\nThe key points here are the parents' overstepping by using emotional blackmail or punishment for a non-injurious, personal choice. The girl's discomfort and her desire to express her identity through not wearing a bra, especially when there's no need for it, could be seen as valid. The mother's comments about boys liking her and being more feminine might be contributing to body image issues, which could be harmful.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the parents are trying to prepare her for societal norms and that in professional or formal settings, wearing a bra is expected. But the user is specifically asking about casual outings with friends and being at home. In those contexts, the necessity of a bra is less clear. Also, the mother's reaction seems extreme and potentially based on her own insecurities rather than the daughter's actual conduct.\n\nThe girl's outburst, while harsh, might be a result of feeling pressured and misunderstood. She's not just choosing not to wear a bra; she's resisting her parents' attempts to impose their beauty standards on her. Her stance is about self-acceptance and autonomy. \n\nIn summary, the parents could be in the wrong for pressuring their daughter and not respecting her choice, especially when there's no medical need for a bra and the girl's decision is about comfort and self-expression. The daughter's actions don't harm others and are part of her personal autonomy. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
