Love to get some fellow ladies input on this! I'm 17, for reference. Barely A-cup. I'm plain-looking and quite tomboyish - very studious and not interested in fashion or dating at all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's the argument:\n\nMy parents believe bras are a form of underwear and that it's gross not to wear one. They often ask me if I'm wearing one (which in my mind proves it makes no difference if people can't even tell whether or not I have one), and if I say no, they won't let me leave the house. Mum often comments things like 'don't you want boys to like you?' or 'you like like a boy, you should be more feminine'. My mum feels that I do not care about my body and I'm being lazy by not wearing one. I went out without a bra once accidently (in winter, wearing 3 layers of clothing) and was yelled at and told I was ungrateful.\n\nI find bras very unnecessary and uncomfortable. A-cups are too big for me, they're awkward and bulky most of the time and I think mum's comments are really inappropriate. Nobody but her cares about my boobs. I understand that for most people it would be highly inappropriate to not wear a bra but I just don't have boobs. Bras are about support and modesty. I have nothing to support. She's right, I might as well be a boy, why is that a bad thing?\n\nI lost my temper in our most recent disagreement over it. Mum sent me a video about execerises that make your boobs look bigger. I didn't ask, I don't care, and I feel like deep down she's disappointed she gave birth to a flat-chested, tomboyish daughter rather than a gorgeous popular one. I told my mum to stop projecting her own body image insecurities onto me because I'm perfectly okay with my small bust and that it's my own damn decision what to think about my body. I feel bad for saying that because she started crying but it was in the heat of the moment and she was waaaay out of line imo. \n\nI acknowledge this who thing is quite biased but I just can't see the logic in trying to make your mosquito-bite-titted daughter feel bad and want to change the way she is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Basically, I have no boobs and don't want to wear a bra. My parents say it's gross and unladylike and get very upset at me over it, my mum in particular won't let me leave the house without one. I think it's highly inappropriate and a really silly thing to punish me over.\n\nAITA for choosing not to wear a bra at home or when I go out casually with friends?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wearing a bra. The situation is that the author is a 17-year-old with a very small chest size (A-cup, even smaller). She finds bras uncomfortable and unnecessary because she doesn't have much to support. Her parents, especially her mom, are pushing her to wear a bra, saying it's about modesty and feminine presentation. They get upset and restrict her from going out if she doesn't. The author is upset because she feels her mom is projecting her own insecurities onto her.\n\nSo, first, I need to consider cultural and societal norms. In many Western cultures, it's common for women to wear bras, especially in public settings, for support and modesty. However, the author's case is unique because she has a very small bust, so the necessity of a bra for support is minimal. Also, there's a growing movement towards body positivity and personal choice in fashion, which supports the idea that individuals should decide what makes them comfortable.\n\nThe parents' argument is based on traditional expectations of femininity. They might feel that not wearing a bra is against societal norms and could affect how others perceive her, possibly influencing her future in terms of dating or social interactions. But the author is asserting her autonomy over her body and rejecting what she sees as unnecessary pressure to conform to certain beauty standards.\n\nAnother angle is the aspect of control and respect. The parents are enforcing their will by restricting her movement if she doesn't comply. This could be seen as an overreach, especially if the daughter is old enough to make her own decisions. The mom's comments about boys liking her and comparing her to a \"boy\" might be contributing to the daughter's feeling of not being accepted for who she is.\n\nThe author's outburst about her mom projecting insecurities is a strong point. It shows that there's underlying pressure from the mother to meet certain expectations, which the daughter is resisting. The daughter's decision not to wear a bra is about her comfort and self-acceptance, which are valid personal choices.\n\nHowever, the parents might argue that modesty is a family value and that wearing a bra is a part of that. But given the daughter's small size, the practical need for a bra is low, and the issue becomes more about societal expectations rather than necessity. The daughter's maturity in expressing her needs and standing up for herself suggests she's capable of making this decision.\n\nIn terms of laws or formal rules, there's no legal requirement to wear a bra in public in most places. The conflict is more about family dynamics and personal choice. So the question is whether the daughter's choice is a personal right versus her parents' enforcement of their values.\n\nTaking all this into account, the author isn't in the wrong. She's making a choice that aligns with her comfort and self-image, and the pressure from her parents seems to stem from their own standards rather than her actual needs. The answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
