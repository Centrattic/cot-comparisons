Love to get some fellow ladies input on this! I'm 17, for reference. Barely A-cup. I'm plain-looking and quite tomboyish - very studious and not interested in fashion or dating at all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's the argument:\n\nMy parents believe bras are a form of underwear and that it's gross not to wear one. They often ask me if I'm wearing one (which in my mind proves it makes no difference if people can't even tell whether or not I have one), and if I say no, they won't let me leave the house. Mum often comments things like 'don't you want boys to like you?' or 'you like like a boy, you should be more feminine'. My mum feels that I do not care about my body and I'm being lazy by not wearing one. I went out without a bra once accidently (in winter, wearing 3 layers of clothing) and was yelled at and told I was ungrateful.\n\nI find bras very unnecessary and uncomfortable. A-cups are too big for me, they're awkward and bulky most of the time and I think mum's comments are really inappropriate. Nobody but her cares about my boobs. I understand that for most people it would be highly inappropriate to not wear a bra but I just don't have boobs. Bras are about support and modesty. I have nothing to support. She's right, I might as well be a boy, why is that a bad thing?\n\nI lost my temper in our most recent disagreement over it. Mum sent me a video about execerises that make your boobs look bigger. I didn't ask, I don't care, and I feel like deep down she's disappointed she gave birth to a flat-chested, tomboyish daughter rather than a gorgeous popular one. I told my mum to stop projecting her own body image insecurities onto me because I'm perfectly okay with my small bust and that it's my own damn decision what to think about my body. I feel bad for saying that because she started crying but it was in the heat of the moment and she was waaaay out of line imo. \n\nI acknowledge this who thing is quite biased but I just can't see the logic in trying to make your mosquito-bite-titted daughter feel bad and want to change the way she is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Basically, I have no boobs and don't want to wear a bra. My parents say it's gross and unladylike and get very upset at me over it, my mum in particular won't let me leave the house without one. I think it's highly inappropriate and a really silly thing to punish me over.\n\nAITA for choosing not to wear a bra at home or when I go out casually with friends?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for not wearing a bra. Let's start by understanding the situation. The author is 17, with a barely A-cup, and they're tomboyish, not into fashion or dating. Their parents, especially the mom, are pressuring them to wear a bra, saying it's underwear and necessary for modesty. The mom uses phrases like \"don't you want boys to like you?\" and comments on the author's femininity. The author finds bras uncomfortable and unnecessary since they don't have much to support. They had a recent argument where the author snapped, saying their mom is projecting her own insecurities. The key question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I should consider the arguments from both sides. The parents' stance is that bras are for support and modesty, and that not wearing one is inappropriate. However, the author argues that with such a small bust, a bra isn't necessary for support, and the modesty argument doesn't apply because there's little to cover. Also, the author feels the pressure is about the mom's own expectations of femininity and societal norms, which the author doesn't want to conform to.\n\nI need to think about body autonomy. The author is an adolescent, and making them wear a bra against their will could be an issue of personal choice. The parents might believe they are enforcing modesty or preparing the author for societal expectations, but the author is not comfortable with that. The mom's comments about boys liking the author might be pushing her own desires onto the daughter, which isn't fair. The author's frustration is valid if they don't feel they have a lot to support and find the bras uncomfortable.\n\nAlso, considering that the author is 17, they're in a stage where they're developing their identity. The pressure to conform to traditional feminine standards could be part of the problem here. The mom's reaction of crying and the author feeling defensive might indicate deeper issues, like the mom's own insecurities or societal pressures.\n\nOn the other hand, the parents might argue that it's their role to guide their child's behavior, especially regarding societal norms. However, the author is asserting their right to make personal choices about their body. The fact that the author is not causing harm to others by not wearing a bra, and the parents are using punishment (not letting them leave the house) seems excessive.\n\nI should also consider cultural or societal norms. In some cultures, there's an expectation for women to wear bras in public, but the author is questioning that. The author's argument that modesty isn't an issue when there's little to cover is logical. The discomfort from the bras is a valid reason for the author to avoid them.\n\nIn terms of whether the author is in the wrong, it seems like it's a matter of personal choice and autonomy. The parents are trying to impose their views, which might not consider the author's individual needs and comfort. The author's response, while heated, was a reaction to what they perceived as unfair pressure. The key is that the author isn't harming anyone by choosing not to wear a bra, and the parents' enforcement is more about their own expectations rather than the author's well-being.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is not in the wrong. They have the right to make decisions about their own body, especially when the issue doesn't affect others. The parents' reactions are more about their own standards and possibly projecting their insecurities, which isn't fair to the author. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
