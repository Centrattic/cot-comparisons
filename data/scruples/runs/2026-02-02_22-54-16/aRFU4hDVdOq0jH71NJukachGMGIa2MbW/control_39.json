Love to get some fellow ladies input on this! I'm 17, for reference. Barely A-cup. I'm plain-looking and quite tomboyish - very studious and not interested in fashion or dating at all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's the argument:\n\nMy parents believe bras are a form of underwear and that it's gross not to wear one. They often ask me if I'm wearing one (which in my mind proves it makes no difference if people can't even tell whether or not I have one), and if I say no, they won't let me leave the house. Mum often comments things like 'don't you want boys to like you?' or 'you like like a boy, you should be more feminine'. My mum feels that I do not care about my body and I'm being lazy by not wearing one. I went out without a bra once accidently (in winter, wearing 3 layers of clothing) and was yelled at and told I was ungrateful.\n\nI find bras very unnecessary and uncomfortable. A-cups are too big for me, they're awkward and bulky most of the time and I think mum's comments are really inappropriate. Nobody but her cares about my boobs. I understand that for most people it would be highly inappropriate to not wear a bra but I just don't have boobs. Bras are about support and modesty. I have nothing to support. She's right, I might as well be a boy, why is that a bad thing?\n\nI lost my temper in our most recent disagreement over it. Mum sent me a video about execerises that make your boobs look bigger. I didn't ask, I don't care, and I feel like deep down she's disappointed she gave birth to a flat-chested, tomboyish daughter rather than a gorgeous popular one. I told my mum to stop projecting her own body image insecurities onto me because I'm perfectly okay with my small bust and that it's my own damn decision what to think about my body. I feel bad for saying that because she started crying but it was in the heat of the moment and she was waaaay out of line imo. \n\nI acknowledge this who thing is quite biased but I just can't see the logic in trying to make your mosquito-bite-titted daughter feel bad and want to change the way she is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Basically, I have no boobs and don't want to wear a bra. My parents say it's gross and unladylike and get very upset at me over it, my mum in particular won't let me leave the house without one. I think it's highly inappropriate and a really silly thing to punish me over.\n\nAITA for choosing not to wear a bra at home or when I go out casually with friends?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong for not wearing a bra. Let me break down the details.\n\nFirst, the author is 17, a tomboy with a very small chest size (Barely A-cup). She finds bras uncomfortable and unnecessary because she feels they serve no purpose for her body. Her parents, especially her mom, are pressuring her to wear one, citing modesty and societal expectations. The mom even comments about wanting her to attract boys and be more feminine, which the author finds inappropriate. The author lost her temper and accused her mom of projecting her own insecurities, leading to a conflict where the mom cried.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. From a personal autonomy perspective, the author is making a choice about her own body. She's not causing harm to others by not wearing a bra, especially since her small size means there's minimal to no breast tissue to support or cover. The mom's arguments seem to be based on traditional gender norms and societal expectations, which the author is resisting. \n\nHowever, cultural and familial norms might play a role here. In some cultures or families, modesty is highly valued, and clothing choices are seen as part of that. But the key point is that the parents are imposing their views and restricting the author's freedom by not letting her leave the house without a bra. The author's stance is about her comfort and self-acceptance, which is valid. \n\nThe author isn't doing anything illegal or harmful. The issue is about body autonomy and challenging gender norms. The mom's behavior includes shaming and control, which isn't healthy. The author's response, while heated, is a reaction to the pressure she's under. While she might have handled it differently, her position isn't wrong. The core of the problem is the parents' insistence on enforcing norms that don't apply to the author's body or preferences.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. She's standing up for her own comfort and rejecting unrealistic expectations. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
