Love to get some fellow ladies input on this! I'm 17, for reference. Barely A-cup. I'm plain-looking and quite tomboyish - very studious and not interested in fashion or dating at all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's the argument:\n\nMy parents believe bras are a form of underwear and that it's gross not to wear one. They often ask me if I'm wearing one (which in my mind proves it makes no difference if people can't even tell whether or not I have one), and if I say no, they won't let me leave the house. Mum often comments things like 'don't you want boys to like you?' or 'you like like a boy, you should be more feminine'. My mum feels that I do not care about my body and I'm being lazy by not wearing one. I went out without a bra once accidently (in winter, wearing 3 layers of clothing) and was yelled at and told I was ungrateful.\n\nI find bras very unnecessary and uncomfortable. A-cups are too big for me, they're awkward and bulky most of the time and I think mum's comments are really inappropriate. Nobody but her cares about my boobs. I understand that for most people it would be highly inappropriate to not wear a bra but I just don't have boobs. Bras are about support and modesty. I have nothing to support. She's right, I might as well be a boy, why is that a bad thing?\n\nI lost my temper in our most recent disagreement over it. Mum sent me a video about execerises that make your boobs look bigger. I didn't ask, I don't care, and I feel like deep down she's disappointed she gave birth to a flat-chested, tomboyish daughter rather than a gorgeous popular one. I told my mum to stop projecting her own body image insecurities onto me because I'm perfectly okay with my small bust and that it's my own damn decision what to think about my body. I feel bad for saying that because she started crying but it was in the heat of the moment and she was waaaay out of line imo. \n\nI acknowledge this who thing is quite biased but I just can't see the logic in trying to make your mosquito-bite-titted daughter feel bad and want to change the way she is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Basically, I have no boobs and don't want to wear a bra. My parents say it's gross and unladylike and get very upset at me over it, my mum in particular won't let me leave the house without one. I think it's highly inappropriate and a really silly thing to punish me over.\n\nAITA for choosing not to wear a bra at home or when I go out casually with friends?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wearing a bra. The situation is that the author is 17, has a very small bust, and finds bras uncomfortable and unnecessary. The parents think it's gross not to wear one and use comments about being feminine and boys liking her. The author is upset with the mom projecting her own insecurities and got angry when the mom sent a video about exercises to get bigger breasts. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the norms around wearing bras. In many cultures, it's common for women to wear bras for support and modesty, but that's not a universal rule. The author is very small-busted, so maybe the physical need for support isn't there. The parents might be enforcing traditional gender norms about femininity, which the author is resisting. The author's argument is about personal autonomy and not being pressured to conform to beauty standards. \n\nThe parents are using punishment (not letting her leave the house) and emotional pressure (\"don't you want boys to like you?\"), which could be seen as controlling. The author's response, while harsh, might be a reaction to feeling misunderstood or pressured. The key points are the author's right to make personal decisions about her body, the parents' overstepping by using emotional manipulation, and the lack of necessity of a bra given her physical attributes.\n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because she's asserting her autonomy and the parents' demands are based on outdated or unrealistic expectations. The parents are projecting their own insecurities onto her, and the author has valid reasons for her choice. So the answer should be B.\n"
