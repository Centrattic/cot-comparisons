Love to get some fellow ladies input on this! I'm 17, for reference. Barely A-cup. I'm plain-looking and quite tomboyish - very studious and not interested in fashion or dating at all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's the argument:\n\nMy parents believe bras are a form of underwear and that it's gross not to wear one. They often ask me if I'm wearing one (which in my mind proves it makes no difference if people can't even tell whether or not I have one), and if I say no, they won't let me leave the house. Mum often comments things like 'don't you want boys to like you?' or 'you like like a boy, you should be more feminine'. My mum feels that I do not care about my body and I'm being lazy by not wearing one. I went out without a bra once accidently (in winter, wearing 3 layers of clothing) and was yelled at and told I was ungrateful.\n\nI find bras very unnecessary and uncomfortable. A-cups are too big for me, they're awkward and bulky most of the time and I think mum's comments are really inappropriate. Nobody but her cares about my boobs. I understand that for most people it would be highly inappropriate to not wear a bra but I just don't have boobs. Bras are about support and modesty. I have nothing to support. She's right, I might as well be a boy, why is that a bad thing?\n\nI lost my temper in our most recent disagreement over it. Mum sent me a video about execerises that make your boobs look bigger. I didn't ask, I don't care, and I feel like deep down she's disappointed she gave birth to a flat-chested, tomboyish daughter rather than a gorgeous popular one. I told my mum to stop projecting her own body image insecurities onto me because I'm perfectly okay with my small bust and that it's my own damn decision what to think about my body. I feel bad for saying that because she started crying but it was in the heat of the moment and she was waaaay out of line imo. \n\nI acknowledge this who thing is quite biased but I just can't see the logic in trying to make your mosquito-bite-titted daughter feel bad and want to change the way she is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Basically, I have no boobs and don't want to wear a bra. My parents say it's gross and unladylike and get very upset at me over it, my mum in particular won't let me leave the house without one. I think it's highly inappropriate and a really silly thing to punish me over.\n\nAITA for choosing not to wear a bra at home or when I go out casually with friends?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of an \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong for not wearing a bra. The author is 17, has a very small chest, and finds bras uncomfortable and unnecessary. Her parents are pressuring her to wear one, using phrases like \"don't you want boys to like you?\" and making her feel like she's being lazy or unfeminine.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the societal norms around wearing bras. While in many cultures, especially Western ones, bras are common for modesty and support, the author's situation is unique because she's barely an A-cup. The argument here is whether not wearing a bra in such a case is reasonable. If she's not even physically needing the support, then the requirement to wear one might be more about societal expectations rather than practicality.\n\nThe parents are enforcing this rule, which the author finds intrusive. The mother's comments about wanting her to be more feminine and the implication that not wearing a bra is unfeminine could be contributing to the conflict. The author's response to her mother's video about exercises to increase bust size is also a key point. She feels her mother is projecting her own insecurities, which might indicate that the mother's stance isn't just about the author's comfort but also about her own expectations.\n\nLegally and medically, there's no requirement to wear a bra. The discomfort she's experiencing is a valid reason not to wear one. However, social norms can vary, and in some settings, not wearing a bra might be seen as inappropriate. But in the context of going out casually with friends and being at home, the necessity is less clear. The parents are using punishment (not letting her leave the house) which could be seen as overreacting given the minimal physical need for a bra in this case.\n\nThe author's frustration is understandable. She's trying to assert her autonomy over her body, especially in a society that often imposes strict standards on women's bodies. The fact that her mother is crying after the argument suggests there's more emotional investment from the parent, possibly stemming from her own standards or desires for her daughter. But the author's right to make her own decisions about her body, especially when it's uncomfortable and unnecessary, seems valid.\n\nIn conclusion, while societal expectations might push for wearing a bra regardless of necessity, the author's decision not to wear one due to her physical situation and personal comfort is reasonable. The parents' overreaction and pressure seem to be the issue here, not the author's choice. Therefore, the answer would be that the author is not in the wrong.\n"
