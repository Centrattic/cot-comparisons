Love to get some fellow ladies input on this! I'm 17, for reference. Barely A-cup. I'm plain-looking and quite tomboyish - very studious and not interested in fashion or dating at all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's the argument:\n\nMy parents believe bras are a form of underwear and that it's gross not to wear one. They often ask me if I'm wearing one (which in my mind proves it makes no difference if people can't even tell whether or not I have one), and if I say no, they won't let me leave the house. Mum often comments things like 'don't you want boys to like you?' or 'you like like a boy, you should be more feminine'. My mum feels that I do not care about my body and I'm being lazy by not wearing one. I went out without a bra once accidently (in winter, wearing 3 layers of clothing) and was yelled at and told I was ungrateful.\n\nI find bras very unnecessary and uncomfortable. A-cups are too big for me, they're awkward and bulky most of the time and I think mum's comments are really inappropriate. Nobody but her cares about my boobs. I understand that for most people it would be highly inappropriate to not wear a bra but I just don't have boobs. Bras are about support and modesty. I have nothing to support. She's right, I might as well be a boy, why is that a bad thing?\n\nI lost my temper in our most recent disagreement over it. Mum sent me a video about execerises that make your boobs look bigger. I didn't ask, I don't care, and I feel like deep down she's disappointed she gave birth to a flat-chested, tomboyish daughter rather than a gorgeous popular one. I told my mum to stop projecting her own body image insecurities onto me because I'm perfectly okay with my small bust and that it's my own damn decision what to think about my body. I feel bad for saying that because she started crying but it was in the heat of the moment and she was waaaay out of line imo. \n\nI acknowledge this who thing is quite biased but I just can't see the logic in trying to make your mosquito-bite-titted daughter feel bad and want to change the way she is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Basically, I have no boobs and don't want to wear a bra. My parents say it's gross and unladylike and get very upset at me over it, my mum in particular won't let me leave the house without one. I think it's highly inappropriate and a really silly thing to punish me over.\n\nAITA for choosing not to wear a bra at home or when I go out casually with friends?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the situation is in the wrong for not wearing a bra. The scenario involves a 17-year-old girl with a very small bust size who finds bras uncomfortable and unnecessary. Her parents insist she wears one, and they get upset if she doesn't. She feels pressured to be more feminine, which she resists.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The girl is very young, around 17, and her physical development is minimal. She doesn't wear a bra because she doesn't need it for support, and she's uncomfortable with the idea of modesty when it's not necessary. Her parents are making her wear one, which causes conflict. The parents' reasoning is based on societal norms about modesty and femininity, while the girl is asserting her autonomy and comfort.\n\nFrom a rights perspective, especially in a modern context, personal autonomy and body autonomy are important. The girl is making a choice about her own body, which is a fundamental right. The parents are trying to enforce a norm that may not be necessary for her physical needs. However, parents do have some authority over their teenage children, but there's a balance between parental guidance and respecting the child's growing autonomy.\n\nThe parents' comments about wanting her to be more feminine and be liked by boys could be seen as pressuring her to conform to traditional gender roles, which might not align with her identity as a tomboy. Their reaction to her not wearing a bra, especially in public, could be a matter of modesty, but if she's not causing harm and is comfortable, it's more about personal choice.\n\nLegally, in most places, wearing a bra is not a legal requirement, so the parents can't legally stop her from going out without one. However, societal norms vary, and in some contexts, not wearing a bra might be seen as inappropriate. But in this case, the girl's small size might mean that it's not noticeable, so the modesty aspect is less about actual coverage and more about adhering to societal expectations.\n\nThe emotional impact is significant here. The girl is standing up for her own beliefs, and while the argument escalated, it's about her self-expression versus her parents' expectations. The mother's disappointment and projecting her insecurities onto her daughter add another layer, suggesting that the pressure isn't just about the bra but about the daughter's identity.\n\nConsidering all this, the girl isn't in the wrong. She's asserting her right to make decisions about her own body, especially when the need for a bra isn't medically necessary. The parents' insistence might stem from their own views on femininity, but they should respect her autonomy as she grows into adulthood. The answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
