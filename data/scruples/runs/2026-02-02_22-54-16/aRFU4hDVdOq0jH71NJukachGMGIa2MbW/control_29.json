Love to get some fellow ladies input on this! I'm 17, for reference. Barely A-cup. I'm plain-looking and quite tomboyish - very studious and not interested in fashion or dating at all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's the argument:\n\nMy parents believe bras are a form of underwear and that it's gross not to wear one. They often ask me if I'm wearing one (which in my mind proves it makes no difference if people can't even tell whether or not I have one), and if I say no, they won't let me leave the house. Mum often comments things like 'don't you want boys to like you?' or 'you like like a boy, you should be more feminine'. My mum feels that I do not care about my body and I'm being lazy by not wearing one. I went out without a bra once accidently (in winter, wearing 3 layers of clothing) and was yelled at and told I was ungrateful.\n\nI find bras very unnecessary and uncomfortable. A-cups are too big for me, they're awkward and bulky most of the time and I think mum's comments are really inappropriate. Nobody but her cares about my boobs. I understand that for most people it would be highly inappropriate to not wear a bra but I just don't have boobs. Bras are about support and modesty. I have nothing to support. She's right, I might as well be a boy, why is that a bad thing?\n\nI lost my temper in our most recent disagreement over it. Mum sent me a video about execerises that make your boobs look bigger. I didn't ask, I don't care, and I feel like deep down she's disappointed she gave birth to a flat-chested, tomboyish daughter rather than a gorgeous popular one. I told my mum to stop projecting her own body image insecurities onto me because I'm perfectly okay with my small bust and that it's my own damn decision what to think about my body. I feel bad for saying that because she started crying but it was in the heat of the moment and she was waaaay out of line imo. \n\nI acknowledge this who thing is quite biased but I just can't see the logic in trying to make your mosquito-bite-titted daughter feel bad and want to change the way she is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Basically, I have no boobs and don't want to wear a bra. My parents say it's gross and unladylike and get very upset at me over it, my mum in particular won't let me leave the house without one. I think it's highly inappropriate and a really silly thing to punish me over.\n\nAITA for choosing not to wear a bra at home or when I go out casually with friends?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for not wearing a bra based on the situation they described. Let me start by breaking down the details.\n\nThe author is 17, has a very small bust (barely A-cup), identifies as tomboyish, and isn't interested in fashion or dating. They find bras uncomfortable and unnecessary because they don't have much to support. Their parents, especially the mom, insist on wearing a bra, calling it underwear and something gross if not worn. The parents use comments about wanting boys to like her and being more feminine. The author feels the mom is projecting her own insecurities and is upset about being forced to conform to certain beauty standards. The author got angry, told the mom to stop projecting, and now feels bad because the mom cried. The main question is whether the author is at fault for not wearing a bra.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the cultural and societal norms around wearing bras. In many Western societies, it's common for women to wear bras for support and modesty, but there's a growing movement advocating for body positivity and the choice not to wear one, especially for those with small chests. The author's reasoning is that since they have a small bust, a bra isn't necessary, and they find it uncomfortable. That makes sense because a bra's primary purpose is support for those who need it. For someone with a very small bust, it's often a matter of preference rather than necessity.\n\nThe parents' perspective is that it's a form of underwear and thus necessary. However, the author points out that when they went out in multiple layers without a bra and were not noticed by others, which suggests that the bra isn't actually necessary for modesty in their case. The parents also make comments about wanting boys to like her, which seems more about societal expectations and the mom's own insecurities rather than a valid reason. The author is being pressured to conform to a standard that doesn't apply to them physically.\n\nThe author's response, while perhaps harsh (\"stop projecting your own body image insecurities onto me\"), is a reaction to what they perceive as unjust pressure. They are asserting their right to make decisions about their own body. The mom's tears might indicate she felt hurt, but the author believes the mom was out of line. The key issue here is the enforcement of a norm that doesn't align with the author's physical reality and personal preferences.\n\nFrom a rights perspective, the author is within their right to choose not to wear a bra, especially since it's not a health or safety issue. The parents are infringing on the author's autonomy by not allowing them to leave the house without a bra. The author's age is 17, so they're approaching adulthood and may need to develop their own standards. The mom's comments about boys liking her and being more feminine are classic examples of societal pressure, which the author is rejecting, which is a valid stance in the context of body positivity.\n\nHowever, there's also the aspect of family dynamics. The author's outburst might have been inappropriate, but the underlying issue is the parents' unreasonable demands. The question is whether the author is \"in the wrong.\" Since the author isn't violating any laws or social norms that apply to them, and they're making a personal choice based on their body type and comfort, the answer would likely be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The parents are enforcing a standard that doesn't fit the author's circumstances and are projecting their own expectations, which is not the author's fault.\n"
