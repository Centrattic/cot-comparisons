Love to get some fellow ladies input on this! I'm 17, for reference. Barely A-cup. I'm plain-looking and quite tomboyish - very studious and not interested in fashion or dating at all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's the argument:\n\nMy parents believe bras are a form of underwear and that it's gross not to wear one. They often ask me if I'm wearing one (which in my mind proves it makes no difference if people can't even tell whether or not I have one), and if I say no, they won't let me leave the house. Mum often comments things like 'don't you want boys to like you?' or 'you like like a boy, you should be more feminine'. My mum feels that I do not care about my body and I'm being lazy by not wearing one. I went out without a bra once accidently (in winter, wearing 3 layers of clothing) and was yelled at and told I was ungrateful.\n\nI find bras very unnecessary and uncomfortable. A-cups are too big for me, they're awkward and bulky most of the time and I think mum's comments are really inappropriate. Nobody but her cares about my boobs. I understand that for most people it would be highly inappropriate to not wear a bra but I just don't have boobs. Bras are about support and modesty. I have nothing to support. She's right, I might as well be a boy, why is that a bad thing?\n\nI lost my temper in our most recent disagreement over it. Mum sent me a video about execerises that make your boobs look bigger. I didn't ask, I don't care, and I feel like deep down she's disappointed she gave birth to a flat-chested, tomboyish daughter rather than a gorgeous popular one. I told my mum to stop projecting her own body image insecurities onto me because I'm perfectly okay with my small bust and that it's my own damn decision what to think about my body. I feel bad for saying that because she started crying but it was in the heat of the moment and she was waaaay out of line imo. \n\nI acknowledge this who thing is quite biased but I just can't see the logic in trying to make your mosquito-bite-titted daughter feel bad and want to change the way she is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Basically, I have no boobs and don't want to wear a bra. My parents say it's gross and unladylike and get very upset at me over it, my mum in particular won't let me leave the house without one. I think it's highly inappropriate and a really silly thing to punish me over.\n\nAITA for choosing not to wear a bra at home or when I go out casually with friends?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a 17-year-old girl who's not wearing a bra because she has a very small chest size. She finds bras uncomfortable and unnecessary, and her parents are pressuring her to wear one, even threatening to not let her leave the house if she doesn't. The mother is making comments about boys liking her and being more feminine, which the daughter finds inappropriate.\n\nFirst, I need to consider body autonomy. The daughter has the right to make decisions about her own body. Bras are personal choices, and while some people might wear them for support or modesty, others don't feel the need, especially if they have a small chest. The parents' reactions seem to be more about their own expectations of femininity rather than the daughter's comfort or health.\n\nThe mother's comments about boys liking her and projecting her insecurities onto the daughter are problematic. It's not right for parents to make their children feel bad about their body for their own satisfaction. The daughter's frustration is valid because she's being forced to conform to a standard she doesn't agree with. \n\nThere's also the aspect of parental control. While parents have a responsibility to guide their children, they shouldn't impose strict rules on matters that don't affect others. The daughter isn't harming anyone by not wearing a bra, especially since she's small-chested. The parents' threat of not letting her leave the house is overstepping and could be considered an infringement on her autonomy.\n\nThe daughter's outburst, while leading to her mother crying, was a reaction to what she perceives as inappropriate pressure. Even though it caused hurt feelings, her stance on her body image is her right. The mother's actions in sending unsolicited videos about body image issues indicate her own struggles, which shouldn't be imposed on her daughter.\n\nIn conclusion, the daughter isn't in the wrong. She's asserting her right to her own body choices, and her parents' reactions are based on societal expectations rather than her actual needs. The answer should be B.\n"
