Love to get some fellow ladies input on this! I'm 17, for reference. Barely A-cup. I'm plain-looking and quite tomboyish - very studious and not interested in fashion or dating at all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's the argument:\n\nMy parents believe bras are a form of underwear and that it's gross not to wear one. They often ask me if I'm wearing one (which in my mind proves it makes no difference if people can't even tell whether or not I have one), and if I say no, they won't let me leave the house. Mum often comments things like 'don't you want boys to like you?' or 'you like like a boy, you should be more feminine'. My mum feels that I do not care about my body and I'm being lazy by not wearing one. I went out without a bra once accidently (in winter, wearing 3 layers of clothing) and was yelled at and told I was ungrateful.\n\nI find bras very unnecessary and uncomfortable. A-cups are too big for me, they're awkward and bulky most of the time and I think mum's comments are really inappropriate. Nobody but her cares about my boobs. I understand that for most people it would be highly inappropriate to not wear a bra but I just don't have boobs. Bras are about support and modesty. I have nothing to support. She's right, I might as well be a boy, why is that a bad thing?\n\nI lost my temper in our most recent disagreement over it. Mum sent me a video about execerises that make your boobs look bigger. I didn't ask, I don't care, and I feel like deep down she's disappointed she gave birth to a flat-chested, tomboyish daughter rather than a gorgeous popular one. I told my mum to stop projecting her own body image insecurities onto me because I'm perfectly okay with my small bust and that it's my own damn decision what to think about my body. I feel bad for saying that because she started crying but it was in the heat of the moment and she was waaaay out of line imo. \n\nI acknowledge this who thing is quite biased but I just can't see the logic in trying to make your mosquito-bite-titted daughter feel bad and want to change the way she is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Basically, I have no boobs and don't want to wear a bra. My parents say it's gross and unladylike and get very upset at me over it, my mum in particular won't let me leave the house without one. I think it's highly inappropriate and a really silly thing to punish me over.\n\nAITA for choosing not to wear a bra at home or when I go out casually with friends?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong for not wearing a bra. \n\nFirst, let me recap the situation. The author is a 17-year-old girl with a very small chest size (barely an A-cup). She's described as tomboyish, not interested in fashion, and doesn't want to wear a bra because she finds it unnecessary and uncomfortable. Her parents, especially her mom, are pressuring her to wear one, saying it's about modesty and being feminine. The mom gets upset, comments on her body, and even yells when she doesn't comply. The author feels that her mom is projecting her own insecurities, and she's standing up for her choice, even if it caused some tension.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong here. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nI need to consider a few angles. Legally, is there any law that requires women to wear bras in public? From what I know, most places don't have such laws. Modesty is often a cultural or family norm rather than a legal requirement. The author's parents are enforcing their own values, which might be based on their cultural background or personal beliefs. However, the daughter is also asserting her autonomy and comfort.\n\nThe author mentions that she's physically uncomfortable with bras, which is a valid reason. Also, since her chest is very small, the necessity of a bra for support might be minimal. The mom's comments about wanting boys to like her or being disappointed could be seen as pressuring the daughter to conform to certain body standards, which the author resists. \n\nIn terms of societal norms, there's been a growing movement towards body positivity and the idea that clothing choices should be personal. Not wearing a bra is a personal choice, and many people support the right to choose. However, the parents are trying to enforce their views, which might be a generational difference. \n\nThe key points here are the author's right to make her own clothing choices versus the parents' right to set household rules. The author is a minor, so there's a balance between parental authority and the child's autonomy. However, the parents' approach seems to be causing emotional distress, which is a red flag. The mom's comments about body image and the daughter's worth based on her appearance could be harmful.\n\nConsidering all that, it seems that the author isn't in the wrong. She's making a personal choice based on her comfort and body reality. The parents' overreaction and the mom's projecting her insecurities onto the daughter are problematic. The author standing up for herself is a form of asserting her autonomy, which is reasonable. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
