Love to get some fellow ladies input on this! I'm 17, for reference. Barely A-cup. I'm plain-looking and quite tomboyish - very studious and not interested in fashion or dating at all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's the argument:\n\nMy parents believe bras are a form of underwear and that it's gross not to wear one. They often ask me if I'm wearing one (which in my mind proves it makes no difference if people can't even tell whether or not I have one), and if I say no, they won't let me leave the house. Mum often comments things like 'don't you want boys to like you?' or 'you like like a boy, you should be more feminine'. My mum feels that I do not care about my body and I'm being lazy by not wearing one. I went out without a bra once accidently (in winter, wearing 3 layers of clothing) and was yelled at and told I was ungrateful.\n\nI find bras very unnecessary and uncomfortable. A-cups are too big for me, they're awkward and bulky most of the time and I think mum's comments are really inappropriate. Nobody but her cares about my boobs. I understand that for most people it would be highly inappropriate to not wear a bra but I just don't have boobs. Bras are about support and modesty. I have nothing to support. She's right, I might as well be a boy, why is that a bad thing?\n\nI lost my temper in our most recent disagreement over it. Mum sent me a video about execerises that make your boobs look bigger. I didn't ask, I don't care, and I feel like deep down she's disappointed she gave birth to a flat-chested, tomboyish daughter rather than a gorgeous popular one. I told my mum to stop projecting her own body image insecurities onto me because I'm perfectly okay with my small bust and that it's my own damn decision what to think about my body. I feel bad for saying that because she started crying but it was in the heat of the moment and she was waaaay out of line imo. \n\nI acknowledge this who thing is quite biased but I just can't see the logic in trying to make your mosquito-bite-titted daughter feel bad and want to change the way she is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Basically, I have no boobs and don't want to wear a bra. My parents say it's gross and unladylike and get very upset at me over it, my mum in particular won't let me leave the house without one. I think it's highly inappropriate and a really silly thing to punish me over.\n\nAITA for choosing not to wear a bra at home or when I go out casually with friends?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The question is whether not wearing a bra is justified, especially considering the context provided.\n\nFirst, the user is 17, has a very small chest (barely an A-cup), and identifies as tomboyish. She doesn't care about fashion or dating. Her parents insist on wearing a bra, citing it as underwear and necessary for modesty. They even go as far as not letting her leave the house without one. The mother's comments are about wanting her to be more feminine and appealing to boys. The daughter finds bras uncomfortable and unnecessary because she doesn't have much to support. She also feels her mom is projecting her own insecurities onto her.\n\nThe key points here are the parents' control over her personal choices and the daughter's autonomy. The parents are enforcing a norm that might not apply to her situation. Since she has a very small bust, the practicality of wearing a bra is questionable. The mother's reaction seems to imply that there's a certain standard of femininity she wants her daughter to meet, which the daughter isn't interested in. The daughter's argument is about self-acceptance and not conforming to societal expectations that don't fit her body or personal style.\n\nIn terms of rights, as a minor, she's under her parents' authority, but there's also the aspect of personal autonomy. The parents might be overstepping if their demands are causing emotional distress. The daughter's health and comfort are also factors\u2014bras that don't fit well can be uncomfortable. The mother's comments about boys liking her suggest societal pressures, which the daughter rightly rejects by asserting her own identity.\n\nSo, considering all that, the daughter's choice not to wear a bra seems reasonable given her body type and personal preferences. The parents are enforcing a rule that doesn't serve the daughter's needs and might be based on their own dissatisfaction with her not fitting their expectations. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong here.\n"
