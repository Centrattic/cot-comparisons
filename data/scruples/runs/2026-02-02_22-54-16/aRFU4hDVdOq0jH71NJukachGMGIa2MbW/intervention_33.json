Love to get some fellow ladies input on this! I'm 17, for reference. Barely A-cup. I'm plain-looking and quite tomboyish - very studious and not interested in fashion or dating at all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's the argument:\n\nMy parents believe bras are a form of underwear and that it's gross not to wear one. They often ask me if I'm wearing one (which in my mind proves it makes no difference if people can't even tell whether or not I have one), and if I say no, they won't let me leave the house. Mum often comments things like 'don't you want boys to like you?' or 'you like like a boy, you should be more feminine'. My mum feels that I do not care about my body and I'm being lazy by not wearing one. I went out without a bra once accidently (in winter, wearing 3 layers of clothing) and was yelled at and told I was ungrateful.\n\nI find bras very unnecessary and uncomfortable. A-cups are too big for me, they're awkward and bulky most of the time and I think mum's comments are really inappropriate. Nobody but her cares about my boobs. I understand that for most people it would be highly inappropriate to not wear a bra but I just don't have boobs. Bras are about support and modesty. I have nothing to support. She's right, I might as well be a boy, why is that a bad thing?\n\nI lost my temper in our most recent disagreement over it. Mum sent me a video about execerises that make your boobs look bigger. I didn't ask, I don't care, and I feel like deep down she's disappointed she gave birth to a flat-chested, tomboyish daughter rather than a gorgeous popular one. I told my mum to stop projecting her own body image insecurities onto me because I'm perfectly okay with my small bust and that it's my own damn decision what to think about my body. I feel bad for saying that because she started crying but it was in the heat of the moment and she was waaaay out of line imo. \n\nI acknowledge this who thing is quite biased but I just can't see the logic in trying to make your mosquito-bite-titted daughter feel bad and want to change the way she is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Basically, I have no boobs and don't want to wear a bra. My parents say it's gross and unladylike and get very upset at me over it, my mum in particular won't let me leave the house without one. I think it's highly inappropriate and a really silly thing to punish me over.\n\nAITA for choosing not to wear a bra at home or when I go out casually with friends?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a 17-year-old girl who's barely an A-cup and doesn't wear a bra. She finds bras uncomfortable and unnecessary because she doesn't have much to support. Her parents, especially her mom, believe not wearing a bra is improper and even gross. They use phrases like \"don't you want boys to like you?\" and pressure her to be more feminine. The girl feels her mom is projecting her own insecurities and that she's being judged for being tomboyish and flat-chested.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the cultural norms around wearing bras. In many societies, especially in Western cultures, it's common for women to wear bras for support and modesty. However, the author argues that since she has a very small bust, a bra isn't necessary. There's also the aspect of personal choice here. At 17, she's an adolescent, and her parents might still feel responsible for enforcing certain norms.\n\nBut then, the parents are using punishment (not letting her leave the house) and emotional pressure (\"you look like a boy\") to enforce this. That could be seen as controlling or projecting their own views onto her. The mother's comments about boys liking her and her body image suggest that the mother's motivations might be more about societal expectations than the daughter's comfort or health.\n\nThe daughter's response in the argument was heated, but she's standing up for her own body and rejecting her mother's insecurities. The question is whether she's in the wrong. The key factors here are autonomy, comfort, and the parents' approach. If the parents are forcing her to wear a bra when it's unnecessary and uncomfortable for her, that could be overstepping. On the other hand, if the parents are concerned about societal norms and modesty, there's some cultural basis for their stance.\n\nHowever, the mother's comments about boys liking her and implying that her daughter is lazy or ungrateful might be more about the mother's desires for her daughter to conform to certain beauty standards. The daughter is asserting her right to be comfortable and to not be pressured into changing her body image. Since the author is not in a position where her choice to not wear a bra affects others negatively and the parents are being overly controlling, it seems the author is justified in her stance. Therefore, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
