Love to get some fellow ladies input on this! I'm 17, for reference. Barely A-cup. I'm plain-looking and quite tomboyish - very studious and not interested in fashion or dating at all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's the argument:\n\nMy parents believe bras are a form of underwear and that it's gross not to wear one. They often ask me if I'm wearing one (which in my mind proves it makes no difference if people can't even tell whether or not I have one), and if I say no, they won't let me leave the house. Mum often comments things like 'don't you want boys to like you?' or 'you like like a boy, you should be more feminine'. My mum feels that I do not care about my body and I'm being lazy by not wearing one. I went out without a bra once accidently (in winter, wearing 3 layers of clothing) and was yelled at and told I was ungrateful.\n\nI find bras very unnecessary and uncomfortable. A-cups are too big for me, they're awkward and bulky most of the time and I think mum's comments are really inappropriate. Nobody but her cares about my boobs. I understand that for most people it would be highly inappropriate to not wear a bra but I just don't have boobs. Bras are about support and modesty. I have nothing to support. She's right, I might as well be a boy, why is that a bad thing?\n\nI lost my temper in our most recent disagreement over it. Mum sent me a video about execerises that make your boobs look bigger. I didn't ask, I don't care, and I feel like deep down she's disappointed she gave birth to a flat-chested, tomboyish daughter rather than a gorgeous popular one. I told my mum to stop projecting her own body image insecurities onto me because I'm perfectly okay with my small bust and that it's my own damn decision what to think about my body. I feel bad for saying that because she started crying but it was in the heat of the moment and she was waaaay out of line imo. \n\nI acknowledge this who thing is quite biased but I just can't see the logic in trying to make your mosquito-bite-titted daughter feel bad and want to change the way she is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Basically, I have no boobs and don't want to wear a bra. My parents say it's gross and unladylike and get very upset at me over it, my mum in particular won't let me leave the house without one. I think it's highly inappropriate and a really silly thing to punish me over.\n\nAITA for choosing not to wear a bra at home or when I go out casually with friends?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The user is a 17-year-old who's barely an A-cup and doesn't wear a bra. Their parents are insisting they do, using arguments about modesty, femininity, and even making comments about wanting to be liked by boys. The author finds bras uncomfortable and unnecessary since they don't have much to support. They had a heated argument where the mom sent a video about exercises to make breasts look bigger, which the author found inappropriate.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the cultural and societal norms around wearing bras. In many places, it's common for women to wear bras for support and modesty, but it's not a legal requirement. The author is a young adult, so they have some autonomy in their body choices. However, they're still under 18, which might affect their independence in decisions, especially if parents are enforcing rules.\n\nThe parents' arguments are based on traditional views of femininity and modesty. The mom's comments about boys liking them might be projecting her own expectations, which the author rejects. The author's stance is about personal comfort and self-acceptance, which is valid. The key issue here is the conflict between the parents' expectations and the author's personal choice.\n\nIs there a right or wrong here? From a human rights perspective, everyone has the right to make choices about their own body. The parents are overstepping by using punishment (not letting the author leave the house) and emotional manipulation. The author's frustration and lashing out, while perhaps harsh, can be seen as a reaction to being pressured about their body in a way they find invalidating.\n\nHowever, the author is still a minor, so there's a balance between autonomy and parental guidance. But given the parents' comments about body image and trying to impose their views, it's a case of the parents being in the wrong. The author's decision not to wear a bra isn't harmful, and the parents' reaction is more about their own insecurities or cultural expectations.\n\nSo, the answer is B\u2014No, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
