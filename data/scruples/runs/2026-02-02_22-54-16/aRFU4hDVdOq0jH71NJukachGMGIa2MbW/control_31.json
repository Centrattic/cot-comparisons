Love to get some fellow ladies input on this! I'm 17, for reference. Barely A-cup. I'm plain-looking and quite tomboyish - very studious and not interested in fashion or dating at all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's the argument:\n\nMy parents believe bras are a form of underwear and that it's gross not to wear one. They often ask me if I'm wearing one (which in my mind proves it makes no difference if people can't even tell whether or not I have one), and if I say no, they won't let me leave the house. Mum often comments things like 'don't you want boys to like you?' or 'you like like a boy, you should be more feminine'. My mum feels that I do not care about my body and I'm being lazy by not wearing one. I went out without a bra once accidently (in winter, wearing 3 layers of clothing) and was yelled at and told I was ungrateful.\n\nI find bras very unnecessary and uncomfortable. A-cups are too big for me, they're awkward and bulky most of the time and I think mum's comments are really inappropriate. Nobody but her cares about my boobs. I understand that for most people it would be highly inappropriate to not wear a bra but I just don't have boobs. Bras are about support and modesty. I have nothing to support. She's right, I might as well be a boy, why is that a bad thing?\n\nI lost my temper in our most recent disagreement over it. Mum sent me a video about execerises that make your boobs look bigger. I didn't ask, I don't care, and I feel like deep down she's disappointed she gave birth to a flat-chested, tomboyish daughter rather than a gorgeous popular one. I told my mum to stop projecting her own body image insecurities onto me because I'm perfectly okay with my small bust and that it's my own damn decision what to think about my body. I feel bad for saying that because she started crying but it was in the heat of the moment and she was waaaay out of line imo. \n\nI acknowledge this who thing is quite biased but I just can't see the logic in trying to make your mosquito-bite-titted daughter feel bad and want to change the way she is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Basically, I have no boobs and don't want to wear a bra. My parents say it's gross and unladylike and get very upset at me over it, my mum in particular won't let me leave the house without one. I think it's highly inappropriate and a really silly thing to punish me over.\n\nAITA for choosing not to wear a bra at home or when I go out casually with friends?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the given scenario is in the wrong for not wearing a bra. The situation is that the author is 17, a tomboy with a very small bust size (barely A-cup). She finds bras uncomfortable and unnecessary because she doesn't have much to support. Her parents are pressuring her to wear one, saying it's gross not to, and they make comments about her being unfeminine. She had a recent argument where she lashed out, accusing her mom of projecting her own insecurities.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is at fault for not wearing a bra. Let me break this down. First, the author's perspective: she's comfortable with her body, doesn't feel she needs a bra for support or modesty, and feels her parents are being unreasonable. She also mentions that her mom's comments are inappropriate and that she's being pressured to conform to certain feminine standards. The parents, on the other hand, believe that not wearing a bra is improper and that it's their role to enforce modesty standards.\n\nFrom a societal standpoint, there's been a growing movement towards body positivity and the idea that individuals should have the autonomy to make choices about their bodies. However, cultural norms can vary, and some families might have traditional views on modesty. The key points here are the author's autonomy, her parents' cultural expectations, and the potential overstepping by the parents.\n\nThe author is not causing harm to others by not wearing a bra; it's a personal choice related to her comfort and body image. The parents are, however, exerting control over her decisions, which could be seen as a violation of her autonomy, especially since she's a teenager navigating her identity. The mother's comments about boys liking her and being feminine imply that the author's value is tied to her appearance, which is a problematic message.\n\nLegally and ethically, unless there's a specific reason (like a cultural practice or a law requiring modesty in certain contexts), the choice to wear or not wear a bra is personal. The parents' reaction seems to stem from their own expectations and possibly their insecurities, as the author points out. The fact that the author is being punished (not allowed to leave the house) for a choice that's not harmful to others is a sign of overreach.\n\nIn terms of the author's actions, even though she lost her temper and made a harsh comment, the underlying issue is the parents' insistence on an unnecessary and uncomfortable practice. The author isn't in the wrong for asserting her right to make her own decisions about her body. The parents might need to reconsider their approach and respect her autonomy, especially as she's approaching adulthood.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong). Her decision to not wear a bra is a personal choice, and the parents are overstepping by making it a point of conflict and punishment.\n"
