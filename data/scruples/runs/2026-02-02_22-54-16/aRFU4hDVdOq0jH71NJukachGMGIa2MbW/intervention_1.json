Love to get some fellow ladies input on this! I'm 17, for reference. Barely A-cup. I'm plain-looking and quite tomboyish - very studious and not interested in fashion or dating at all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's the argument:\n\nMy parents believe bras are a form of underwear and that it's gross not to wear one. They often ask me if I'm wearing one (which in my mind proves it makes no difference if people can't even tell whether or not I have one), and if I say no, they won't let me leave the house. Mum often comments things like 'don't you want boys to like you?' or 'you like like a boy, you should be more feminine'. My mum feels that I do not care about my body and I'm being lazy by not wearing one. I went out without a bra once accidently (in winter, wearing 3 layers of clothing) and was yelled at and told I was ungrateful.\n\nI find bras very unnecessary and uncomfortable. A-cups are too big for me, they're awkward and bulky most of the time and I think mum's comments are really inappropriate. Nobody but her cares about my boobs. I understand that for most people it would be highly inappropriate to not wear a bra but I just don't have boobs. Bras are about support and modesty. I have nothing to support. She's right, I might as well be a boy, why is that a bad thing?\n\nI lost my temper in our most recent disagreement over it. Mum sent me a video about execerises that make your boobs look bigger. I didn't ask, I don't care, and I feel like deep down she's disappointed she gave birth to a flat-chested, tomboyish daughter rather than a gorgeous popular one. I told my mum to stop projecting her own body image insecurities onto me because I'm perfectly okay with my small bust and that it's my own damn decision what to think about my body. I feel bad for saying that because she started crying but it was in the heat of the moment and she was waaaay out of line imo. \n\nI acknowledge this who thing is quite biased but I just can't see the logic in trying to make your mosquito-bite-titted daughter feel bad and want to change the way she is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Basically, I have no boobs and don't want to wear a bra. My parents say it's gross and unladylike and get very upset at me over it, my mum in particular won't let me leave the house without one. I think it's highly inappropriate and a really silly thing to punish me over.\n\nAITA for choosing not to wear a bra at home or when I go out casually with friends?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wearing a bra. The situation is that the author is 17, with a very small bust (A-cup), and finds bras uncomfortable and unnecessary. The parents insist that not wearing a bra is gross and unladylike, making comments about being more feminine and even projecting their own insecurities. The author feels that the parents are being unreasonable and that it's their own choice to wear or not wear a bra.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the core issue here. The author's physical condition is a very small bust, which means that a bra isn't needed for support. The parents are enforcing a societal standard that might not apply to the author's specific situation. The argument is about body autonomy versus parental expectations.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, there's been a growing movement towards body positivity and the idea that people should have the freedom to dress in a way that makes them comfortable, regardless of others' opinions. For someone with a small chest, not wearing a bra is a personal choice and shouldn't be policed, especially if it's not causing any harm. The parents are trying to impose their values, possibly influenced by their own insecurities or societal pressures, onto their daughter.\n\nThe author's response, while maybe harsh, was in the heat of the moment and was a reaction to the mother's inappropriate comments. It's understandable that the author would feel defensive and frustrated. The parents' approach of using punishment (not letting her leave the house) seems excessive and authoritarian, not considering the daughter's comfort and individuality.\n\nHowever, I should also consider cultural or family norms. In some cultures or families, there might be specific expectations about modesty and clothing. But in this case, the author is pointing out that the issue is based on her physical attributes (no actual need for a bra) and that the parents are projecting their own desires onto her. The author's stance is about self-acceptance and autonomy, which are valid points.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the parents are trying to prepare her for societal expectations where wearing a bra is standard, especially in certain contexts. But given that the author is still in her teens and the bust size is minimal, the necessity of a bra is questionable. Plus, the parents are using emotional manipulation and punishment, which isn't healthy.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. The parents are imposing their views without considering her comfort and individuality. The author's decision to not wear a bra is a personal choice and not something that warrants criticism or punishment. The answer should be B.\n"
