Love to get some fellow ladies input on this! I'm 17, for reference. Barely A-cup. I'm plain-looking and quite tomboyish - very studious and not interested in fashion or dating at all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's the argument:\n\nMy parents believe bras are a form of underwear and that it's gross not to wear one. They often ask me if I'm wearing one (which in my mind proves it makes no difference if people can't even tell whether or not I have one), and if I say no, they won't let me leave the house. Mum often comments things like 'don't you want boys to like you?' or 'you like like a boy, you should be more feminine'. My mum feels that I do not care about my body and I'm being lazy by not wearing one. I went out without a bra once accidently (in winter, wearing 3 layers of clothing) and was yelled at and told I was ungrateful.\n\nI find bras very unnecessary and uncomfortable. A-cups are too big for me, they're awkward and bulky most of the time and I think mum's comments are really inappropriate. Nobody but her cares about my boobs. I understand that for most people it would be highly inappropriate to not wear a bra but I just don't have boobs. Bras are about support and modesty. I have nothing to support. She's right, I might as well be a boy, why is that a bad thing?\n\nI lost my temper in our most recent disagreement over it. Mum sent me a video about execerises that make your boobs look bigger. I didn't ask, I don't care, and I feel like deep down she's disappointed she gave birth to a flat-chested, tomboyish daughter rather than a gorgeous popular one. I told my mum to stop projecting her own body image insecurities onto me because I'm perfectly okay with my small bust and that it's my own damn decision what to think about my body. I feel bad for saying that because she started crying but it was in the heat of the moment and she was waaaay out of line imo. \n\nI acknowledge this who thing is quite biased but I just can't see the logic in trying to make your mosquito-bite-titted daughter feel bad and want to change the way she is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Basically, I have no boobs and don't want to wear a bra. My parents say it's gross and unladylike and get very upset at me over it, my mum in particular won't let me leave the house without one. I think it's highly inappropriate and a really silly thing to punish me over.\n\nAITA for choosing not to wear a bra at home or when I go out casually with friends?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the story is in the wrong for not wearing a bra. The person is 17, has a very small chest (A-cup), and finds bras uncomfortable and unnecessary. The parents insist on wearing a bra, using comments about modesty and feminine appearance. The daughter gets upset because her mom seems to project her own insecurities and wants the daughter to conform to certain standards.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural norms. In many Western societies, wearing a bra is common for women, but it's not a legal requirement. However, it's more of a social expectation. But the daughter's situation is that she doesn't have much to support, so the necessity for a bra is minimal. The parents' insistence might be based on their own beliefs about modesty and femininity, which might not align with the daughter's personal comfort and identity.\n\nThe daughter's argument is about personal autonomy. She's a teenager trying to form her own identity, and her parents are imposing their views. The mother's comments about boys liking her and being more feminine could be pressuring the daughter to conform to traditional gender roles. The daughter's outburst about her mom projecting insecurities might be a valid point if the mom is trying to change her daughter's natural attributes, which could be harmful.\n\nAlso, the daughter's choice not to wear a bra when she feels it's unnecessary, especially with layers or in casual settings, is a personal choice. The parents are restricting her freedom, which could be seen as overstepping, especially if the daughter is comfortable and there's no actual health or safety issue.\n\nHowever, the parents' perspective is that they're teaching modesty and preparing her for societal expectations. But if the daughter is in a culture that increasingly allows for personal choice in such matters, the parents might be enforcing outdated norms. The key here is whether the parents are infringing on the daughter's autonomy without a valid reason.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the daughter isn't doing anything illegal or harmful. The parents, on the other hand, are using emotional pressure and punishment to enforce their views, which could be detrimental to the daughter's self-esteem and autonomy. The daughter's stance seems reasonable given her physical attributes and personal comfort. Therefore, the answer would be that she's not in the wrong.\n"
