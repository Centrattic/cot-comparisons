Love to get some fellow ladies input on this! I'm 17, for reference. Barely A-cup. I'm plain-looking and quite tomboyish - very studious and not interested in fashion or dating at all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's the argument:\n\nMy parents believe bras are a form of underwear and that it's gross not to wear one. They often ask me if I'm wearing one (which in my mind proves it makes no difference if people can't even tell whether or not I have one), and if I say no, they won't let me leave the house. Mum often comments things like 'don't you want boys to like you?' or 'you like like a boy, you should be more feminine'. My mum feels that I do not care about my body and I'm being lazy by not wearing one. I went out without a bra once accidently (in winter, wearing 3 layers of clothing) and was yelled at and told I was ungrateful.\n\nI find bras very unnecessary and uncomfortable. A-cups are too big for me, they're awkward and bulky most of the time and I think mum's comments are really inappropriate. Nobody but her cares about my boobs. I understand that for most people it would be highly inappropriate to not wear a bra but I just don't have boobs. Bras are about support and modesty. I have nothing to support. She's right, I might as well be a boy, why is that a bad thing?\n\nI lost my temper in our most recent disagreement over it. Mum sent me a video about execerises that make your boobs look bigger. I didn't ask, I don't care, and I feel like deep down she's disappointed she gave birth to a flat-chested, tomboyish daughter rather than a gorgeous popular one. I told my mum to stop projecting her own body image insecurities onto me because I'm perfectly okay with my small bust and that it's my own damn decision what to think about my body. I feel bad for saying that because she started crying but it was in the heat of the moment and she was waaaay out of line imo. \n\nI acknowledge this who thing is quite biased but I just can't see the logic in trying to make your mosquito-bite-titted daughter feel bad and want to change the way she is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Basically, I have no boobs and don't want to wear a bra. My parents say it's gross and unladylike and get very upset at me over it, my mum in particular won't let me leave the house without one. I think it's highly inappropriate and a really silly thing to punish me over.\n\nAITA for choosing not to wear a bra at home or when I go out casually with friends?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is at fault for not wearing a bra as advised by their parents. The author is 17, has a very small chest (barely A-cup), and finds bras uncomfortable and unnecessary. The parents believe it's a form of underwear and necessary for modesty, even going as far as to prevent the author from leaving the house without one. The author feels that their mother is projecting her own insecurities and that the issue is trivial.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author's physical development is minimal, so bras might not serve a functional purpose. The parents are enforcing a norm based on their beliefs about femininity and modesty, but the author is asserting their autonomy in body choices. \n\nIn many societies, wearing a bra is a social norm, but it's also a personal choice. The key here is that the author isn't causing harm to others; they're making a personal decision about their body. The parents are imposing their views, which the author finds invalid and even harmful to their self-image. The author's frustration is about autonomy and not conforming to expectations they feel are unnecessary.\n\nThe parents' actions\u2014denying the author freedom to go out without a bra\u2014could be seen as overstepping, especially if the author is an adolescent seeking independence. The mother's comments about boys liking the author and pressuring them to be more feminine might be contributing to body image issues. The author's outburst, while harsh, seems to stem from a place of feeling misunderstood and pressured.\n\nLegally, there's no requirement to wear a bra, so the author isn't breaking any laws. Ethically, the question is about personal choice versus parental authority. At 17, the author is likely in a stage where they're developing their own identity, and the parents' rigid stance could be conflicting with that development.\n\nThe mother's emotional reaction and the author's response indicate a deeper issue of control and self-esteem. The author's stance is about self-acceptance and autonomy, which are valid concerns. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for asserting their personal choice, especially when the parents are using emotional pressure and punishment.\n"
