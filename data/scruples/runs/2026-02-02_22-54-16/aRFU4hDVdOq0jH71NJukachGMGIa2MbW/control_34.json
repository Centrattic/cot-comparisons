Love to get some fellow ladies input on this! I'm 17, for reference. Barely A-cup. I'm plain-looking and quite tomboyish - very studious and not interested in fashion or dating at all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's the argument:\n\nMy parents believe bras are a form of underwear and that it's gross not to wear one. They often ask me if I'm wearing one (which in my mind proves it makes no difference if people can't even tell whether or not I have one), and if I say no, they won't let me leave the house. Mum often comments things like 'don't you want boys to like you?' or 'you like like a boy, you should be more feminine'. My mum feels that I do not care about my body and I'm being lazy by not wearing one. I went out without a bra once accidently (in winter, wearing 3 layers of clothing) and was yelled at and told I was ungrateful.\n\nI find bras very unnecessary and uncomfortable. A-cups are too big for me, they're awkward and bulky most of the time and I think mum's comments are really inappropriate. Nobody but her cares about my boobs. I understand that for most people it would be highly inappropriate to not wear a bra but I just don't have boobs. Bras are about support and modesty. I have nothing to support. She's right, I might as well be a boy, why is that a bad thing?\n\nI lost my temper in our most recent disagreement over it. Mum sent me a video about execerises that make your boobs look bigger. I didn't ask, I don't care, and I feel like deep down she's disappointed she gave birth to a flat-chested, tomboyish daughter rather than a gorgeous popular one. I told my mum to stop projecting her own body image insecurities onto me because I'm perfectly okay with my small bust and that it's my own damn decision what to think about my body. I feel bad for saying that because she started crying but it was in the heat of the moment and she was waaaay out of line imo. \n\nI acknowledge this who thing is quite biased but I just can't see the logic in trying to make your mosquito-bite-titted daughter feel bad and want to change the way she is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Basically, I have no boobs and don't want to wear a bra. My parents say it's gross and unladylike and get very upset at me over it, my mum in particular won't let me leave the house without one. I think it's highly inappropriate and a really silly thing to punish me over.\n\nAITA for choosing not to wear a bra at home or when I go out casually with friends?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The question is whether the author is AITA (Am I the Asshole) for not wearing a bra. \n\nFirst, the author is 17, has a very small chest (A-cup), and is described as tomboyish and not interested in fashion or dating. Her parents are making her wear a bra under the premise that it's necessary for modesty and that not wearing one is gross. They go as far as to prevent her from leaving the house if she's not in a bra. The mom makes comments about wanting her to be more feminine and have boys like her. The author finds bras uncomfortable and unnecessary, given her small size, and feels her mom is projecting insecurities onto her.\n\nThe key points here: the parents' actions are based on their own expectations of femininity, which the author doesn't identify with. The author isn't harming anyone by not wearing a bra, especially when she's not causing discomfort or violating any laws. The parents are enforcing their beliefs onto their child, which could be seen as controlling.\n\nThe author's argument is that she has no need for a bra for support or modesty, given her small chest, and that the pressure to wear one is unwarranted. Her outburst about her mom's insecurities might have been harsh, but the core issue is about bodily autonomy and parental overreach.\n\nIn terms of social norms, while some cultures or family traditions might expect girls to wear bras, the author's case is different because she physically doesn't need them and the parents are using punishment (not letting her leave) to enforce their views. This could be seen as authoritarian parenting. The author is asserting her right to make her own decisions about her body without parental interference once she's an adult enough to handle it.\n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong for not complying with her parents' wishes. Legally, there's no law against not wearing a bra unless specified in a workplace or school policy, which isn't mentioned here. Socially, it's a personal choice, and the parents' reaction seems extreme given the context. The author's stance is about self-acceptance and rejecting societal pressures, which is a valid position.\n\nConsidering all that, the parents are likely the ones in the wrong for pressuring their daughter in an unhealthy way. The author is standing up for her autonomy, which is a positive thing. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
