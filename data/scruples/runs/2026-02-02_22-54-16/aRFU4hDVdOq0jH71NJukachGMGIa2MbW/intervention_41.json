Love to get some fellow ladies input on this! I'm 17, for reference. Barely A-cup. I'm plain-looking and quite tomboyish - very studious and not interested in fashion or dating at all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's the argument:\n\nMy parents believe bras are a form of underwear and that it's gross not to wear one. They often ask me if I'm wearing one (which in my mind proves it makes no difference if people can't even tell whether or not I have one), and if I say no, they won't let me leave the house. Mum often comments things like 'don't you want boys to like you?' or 'you like like a boy, you should be more feminine'. My mum feels that I do not care about my body and I'm being lazy by not wearing one. I went out without a bra once accidently (in winter, wearing 3 layers of clothing) and was yelled at and told I was ungrateful.\n\nI find bras very unnecessary and uncomfortable. A-cups are too big for me, they're awkward and bulky most of the time and I think mum's comments are really inappropriate. Nobody but her cares about my boobs. I understand that for most people it would be highly inappropriate to not wear a bra but I just don't have boobs. Bras are about support and modesty. I have nothing to support. She's right, I might as well be a boy, why is that a bad thing?\n\nI lost my temper in our most recent disagreement over it. Mum sent me a video about execerises that make your boobs look bigger. I didn't ask, I don't care, and I feel like deep down she's disappointed she gave birth to a flat-chested, tomboyish daughter rather than a gorgeous popular one. I told my mum to stop projecting her own body image insecurities onto me because I'm perfectly okay with my small bust and that it's my own damn decision what to think about my body. I feel bad for saying that because she started crying but it was in the heat of the moment and she was waaaay out of line imo. \n\nI acknowledge this who thing is quite biased but I just can't see the logic in trying to make your mosquito-bite-titted daughter feel bad and want to change the way she is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Basically, I have no boobs and don't want to wear a bra. My parents say it's gross and unladylike and get very upset at me over it, my mum in particular won't let me leave the house without one. I think it's highly inappropriate and a really silly thing to punish me over.\n\nAITA for choosing not to wear a bra at home or when I go out casually with friends?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wearing a bra. The situation is between the author, their parents, and the cultural expectations around undergarments.\n\nFirst, the author is 17, has a very small chest (A-cup, almost nothing), and considers themselves tomboyish. They don't care about fashion or dating. Their parents believe bras are necessary underwear, so they get upset when the author doesn't wear one, even going as far as to not let them leave the house. The mom makes comments about femininity and boys liking her, which the author finds inappropriate. The author finds bras uncomfortable and unnecessary for their body type and feels that the mom is projecting her own insecurities.\n\nSo, the main points here are: the author's right to bodily autonomy, the parents' cultural or traditional beliefs, and the pressure to conform to certain gender norms. The author is choosing not to wear a bra because it's not needed for support or modesty, given their small size. The parents are enforcing a rule that might not be necessary for the child's well-being, but rather based on their own expectations.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, bodily autonomy is a key factor. The author has the right to make decisions about their own body, especially as a teenager. The parents' insistence might stem from their own values, but forcing the child to wear a bra when it's not necessary for health or safety could be seen as overreaching. The mom's comments about femininity and boys are also problematic, as they pressure the child to conform to societal standards that the child doesn't care about. The author's response, while heated, was a reaction to what they perceive as the mom's projection of insecurities, which the mom's behavior might support.\n\nConsidering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. They're asserting their autonomy and making a choice that's appropriate for their body. The parents are imposing their views, which might not be valid in this specific case. So the answer should be B.\n"
