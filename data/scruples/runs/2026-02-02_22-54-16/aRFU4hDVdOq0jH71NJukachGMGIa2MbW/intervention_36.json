Love to get some fellow ladies input on this! I'm 17, for reference. Barely A-cup. I'm plain-looking and quite tomboyish - very studious and not interested in fashion or dating at all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's the argument:\n\nMy parents believe bras are a form of underwear and that it's gross not to wear one. They often ask me if I'm wearing one (which in my mind proves it makes no difference if people can't even tell whether or not I have one), and if I say no, they won't let me leave the house. Mum often comments things like 'don't you want boys to like you?' or 'you like like a boy, you should be more feminine'. My mum feels that I do not care about my body and I'm being lazy by not wearing one. I went out without a bra once accidently (in winter, wearing 3 layers of clothing) and was yelled at and told I was ungrateful.\n\nI find bras very unnecessary and uncomfortable. A-cups are too big for me, they're awkward and bulky most of the time and I think mum's comments are really inappropriate. Nobody but her cares about my boobs. I understand that for most people it would be highly inappropriate to not wear a bra but I just don't have boobs. Bras are about support and modesty. I have nothing to support. She's right, I might as well be a boy, why is that a bad thing?\n\nI lost my temper in our most recent disagreement over it. Mum sent me a video about execerises that make your boobs look bigger. I didn't ask, I don't care, and I feel like deep down she's disappointed she gave birth to a flat-chested, tomboyish daughter rather than a gorgeous popular one. I told my mum to stop projecting her own body image insecurities onto me because I'm perfectly okay with my small bust and that it's my own damn decision what to think about my body. I feel bad for saying that because she started crying but it was in the heat of the moment and she was waaaay out of line imo. \n\nI acknowledge this who thing is quite biased but I just can't see the logic in trying to make your mosquito-bite-titted daughter feel bad and want to change the way she is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Basically, I have no boobs and don't want to wear a bra. My parents say it's gross and unladylike and get very upset at me over it, my mum in particular won't let me leave the house without one. I think it's highly inappropriate and a really silly thing to punish me over.\n\nAITA for choosing not to wear a bra at home or when I go out casually with friends?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wearing a bra. The situation involves the author's parents being upset about it, saying it's gross and unladylike, and even punishing her by not letting her leave the house without one. The author is 17, A-cup, and finds bras unnecessary and uncomfortable. She also mentions her mother projecting her insecurities onto her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural and personal boundaries. Wearing a bra is often a matter of personal choice and can depend on comfort and societal norms. However, the parents are enforcing their beliefs and making it a condition for her leaving the house, which can be controlling. The mother's comments about boys and femininity may be pressuring the daughter to conform to certain beauty standards, which is problematic. The daughter's argument is that she doesn't need a bra because of her small size and feels her body is fine as it is. \n\nThe key points here are autonomy and respect. The parents are imposing their views, which might not respect the daughter's autonomy over her own body. The daughter is asserting her right to make her own choices, which is a valid stance. However, the parents' concern about modesty and societal norms could be seen as their own values, but forcing their child to comply might be overstepping. The daughter's emotional response, while impulsive, seems to be a reaction to what she perceives as unfair treatment. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the parents are in the wrong for controlling her attire and projecting their insecurities. The daughter is within her rights to choose not to wear a bra, especially if it's not uncomfortable or necessary for her. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
