Love to get some fellow ladies input on this! I'm 17, for reference. Barely A-cup. I'm plain-looking and quite tomboyish - very studious and not interested in fashion or dating at all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's the argument:\n\nMy parents believe bras are a form of underwear and that it's gross not to wear one. They often ask me if I'm wearing one (which in my mind proves it makes no difference if people can't even tell whether or not I have one), and if I say no, they won't let me leave the house. Mum often comments things like 'don't you want boys to like you?' or 'you like like a boy, you should be more feminine'. My mum feels that I do not care about my body and I'm being lazy by not wearing one. I went out without a bra once accidently (in winter, wearing 3 layers of clothing) and was yelled at and told I was ungrateful.\n\nI find bras very unnecessary and uncomfortable. A-cups are too big for me, they're awkward and bulky most of the time and I think mum's comments are really inappropriate. Nobody but her cares about my boobs. I understand that for most people it would be highly inappropriate to not wear a bra but I just don't have boobs. Bras are about support and modesty. I have nothing to support. She's right, I might as well be a boy, why is that a bad thing?\n\nI lost my temper in our most recent disagreement over it. Mum sent me a video about execerises that make your boobs look bigger. I didn't ask, I don't care, and I feel like deep down she's disappointed she gave birth to a flat-chested, tomboyish daughter rather than a gorgeous popular one. I told my mum to stop projecting her own body image insecurities onto me because I'm perfectly okay with my small bust and that it's my own damn decision what to think about my body. I feel bad for saying that because she started crying but it was in the heat of the moment and she was waaaay out of line imo. \n\nI acknowledge this who thing is quite biased but I just can't see the logic in trying to make your mosquito-bite-titted daughter feel bad and want to change the way she is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Basically, I have no boobs and don't want to wear a bra. My parents say it's gross and unladylike and get very upset at me over it, my mum in particular won't let me leave the house without one. I think it's highly inappropriate and a really silly thing to punish me over.\n\nAITA for choosing not to wear a bra at home or when I go out casually with friends?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a 17-year-old girl who doesn't wear a bra because she's an A-cup and finds bras uncomfortable and unnecessary. Her parents are upset about it, even going as far as not letting her leave the house if she's not wearing one. The mother makes comments about being feminine and wanting boys to like her, which the author finds inappropriate.\n\nFirst, I need to consider societal norms. In many cultures, there's an expectation for women to wear bras in public. But the author is very small-breasted, so a bra might not be necessary for support. The question is about right and wrong, so maybe more about the parents' overreaction versus the daughter's choice.\n\nThe parents are enforcing their views, which might be based on modesty or traditional gender roles. However, the daughter is making a personal choice about her body. The mother's comments, like implying the daughter should be more feminine or that not wearing a bra makes her look like a boy, could be seen as pressuring her to conform to certain beauty standards. The author feels her mother is projecting her own insecurities, which might indicate that the mother's motivations are not entirely about the daughter's well-being but her own expectations.\n\nThe author's argument is that since she has no significant breasts, a bra isn't necessary for support or modesty. If the mother is enforcing this rule regardless, it's possibly overstepping. Also, the fact that the mother yells and withholds permission to leave the house seems like a strong reaction. The daughter's outburst about her mother's body image issues might be a result of the tension, but it's in the heat of the moment.\n\nIs the daughter wrong for not wearing a bra? If it's a matter of personal choice and her body, then maybe not. But if there are cultural or family expectations, it's a conflict between individual autonomy and parental authority. Legally, until she's 18, parents have some authority, but the question is about moral right or wrong.\n\nThe mother's actions seem controlling and possibly harmful, promoting the idea that the daughter's natural body is wrong. The daughter's stance is about self-acceptance and rejecting unnecessary societal norms. In that context, the author might not be in the wrong for asserting her choice, especially if the parents are being overly critical and making her feel bad about herself.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is likely B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
