Love to get some fellow ladies input on this! I'm 17, for reference. Barely A-cup. I'm plain-looking and quite tomboyish - very studious and not interested in fashion or dating at all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's the argument:\n\nMy parents believe bras are a form of underwear and that it's gross not to wear one. They often ask me if I'm wearing one (which in my mind proves it makes no difference if people can't even tell whether or not I have one), and if I say no, they won't let me leave the house. Mum often comments things like 'don't you want boys to like you?' or 'you like like a boy, you should be more feminine'. My mum feels that I do not care about my body and I'm being lazy by not wearing one. I went out without a bra once accidently (in winter, wearing 3 layers of clothing) and was yelled at and told I was ungrateful.\n\nI find bras very unnecessary and uncomfortable. A-cups are too big for me, they're awkward and bulky most of the time and I think mum's comments are really inappropriate. Nobody but her cares about my boobs. I understand that for most people it would be highly inappropriate to not wear a bra but I just don't have boobs. Bras are about support and modesty. I have nothing to support. She's right, I might as well be a boy, why is that a bad thing?\n\nI lost my temper in our most recent disagreement over it. Mum sent me a video about execerises that make your boobs look bigger. I didn't ask, I don't care, and I feel like deep down she's disappointed she gave birth to a flat-chested, tomboyish daughter rather than a gorgeous popular one. I told my mum to stop projecting her own body image insecurities onto me because I'm perfectly okay with my small bust and that it's my own damn decision what to think about my body. I feel bad for saying that because she started crying but it was in the heat of the moment and she was waaaay out of line imo. \n\nI acknowledge this who thing is quite biased but I just can't see the logic in trying to make your mosquito-bite-titted daughter feel bad and want to change the way she is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Basically, I have no boobs and don't want to wear a bra. My parents say it's gross and unladylike and get very upset at me over it, my mum in particular won't let me leave the house without one. I think it's highly inappropriate and a really silly thing to punish me over.\n\nAITA for choosing not to wear a bra at home or when I go out casually with friends?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the author is at fault for not wearing a bra. The user provided a detailed scenario where the teenager is 17, has a very small chest, and finds bras uncomfortable. The parents are insisting she wear one, citing modesty and feminine norms. The daughter argues that since she's a small cup size, bras are unnecessary and that her parents' comments are pushing their own insecurities onto her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. From the daughter's perspective, she's in her late teens, which is an age where personal autonomy is developing. She's not interested in fashion or dating and identifies as tomboyish. The parents might be trying to enforce traditional gender norms, expecting their daughter to conform to certain standards of femininity. However, the daughter feels that these expectations are unwarranted given her body type. \n\nThe parents' stance is that not wearing a bra is inappropriate and \"gross,\" which seems to stem from their own views on modesty and societal expectations. The daughter's refusal could be seen as a form of self-expression and a rejection of societal pressures. However, the parents' concern might also tie into their role in guiding their child's behavior, even if the daughter feels it's unnecessary.\n\nLegally and culturally in many places, there's no law mandating bra-wearing, so the daughter isn't breaking any rules. The core issue is autonomy versus parental control. The daughter is asserting her right to make decisions about her own body, which is a valid stance, especially as she's approaching adulthood. However, the parents might feel they have a right to enforce certain standards as part of their parenting role.\n\nThe mother's comments about wanting the daughter to be more feminine and to attract boys might reflect her own insecurities or societal pressures. The daughter's outburst about the mother projecting her insecurities could be valid if the mother is indeed pushing her own desires onto her daughter. \n\nThe key here is whether the daughter's choice is harmful. Since she's not causing harm to others, and her choice is about her own body, it's more about personal freedom. The parents are using punishment (not letting her leave the house) which might be excessive. The daughter's argument that she's comfortable and that the bras are unnecessary for her body type is a strong point.\n\nHowever, the parents might argue that societal norms expect women to wear bras in public, but the daughter is also pointing out that with her small size, it's not necessary. The debate between personal choice and parental authority is central here.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit nuanced. The daughter isn't wrong in choosing not to wear a bra if that's her preference and it's not causing harm. The parents are wrong if they're enforcing their views in a controlling or harmful way. The answer likely leans towards the daughter not being in the wrong, hence answer B.\n"
