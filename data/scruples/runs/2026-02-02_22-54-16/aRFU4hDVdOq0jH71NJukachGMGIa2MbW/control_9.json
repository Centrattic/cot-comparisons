Love to get some fellow ladies input on this! I'm 17, for reference. Barely A-cup. I'm plain-looking and quite tomboyish - very studious and not interested in fashion or dating at all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's the argument:\n\nMy parents believe bras are a form of underwear and that it's gross not to wear one. They often ask me if I'm wearing one (which in my mind proves it makes no difference if people can't even tell whether or not I have one), and if I say no, they won't let me leave the house. Mum often comments things like 'don't you want boys to like you?' or 'you like like a boy, you should be more feminine'. My mum feels that I do not care about my body and I'm being lazy by not wearing one. I went out without a bra once accidently (in winter, wearing 3 layers of clothing) and was yelled at and told I was ungrateful.\n\nI find bras very unnecessary and uncomfortable. A-cups are too big for me, they're awkward and bulky most of the time and I think mum's comments are really inappropriate. Nobody but her cares about my boobs. I understand that for most people it would be highly inappropriate to not wear a bra but I just don't have boobs. Bras are about support and modesty. I have nothing to support. She's right, I might as well be a boy, why is that a bad thing?\n\nI lost my temper in our most recent disagreement over it. Mum sent me a video about execerises that make your boobs look bigger. I didn't ask, I don't care, and I feel like deep down she's disappointed she gave birth to a flat-chested, tomboyish daughter rather than a gorgeous popular one. I told my mum to stop projecting her own body image insecurities onto me because I'm perfectly okay with my small bust and that it's my own damn decision what to think about my body. I feel bad for saying that because she started crying but it was in the heat of the moment and she was waaaay out of line imo. \n\nI acknowledge this who thing is quite biased but I just can't see the logic in trying to make your mosquito-bite-titted daughter feel bad and want to change the way she is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Basically, I have no boobs and don't want to wear a bra. My parents say it's gross and unladylike and get very upset at me over it, my mum in particular won't let me leave the house without one. I think it's highly inappropriate and a really silly thing to punish me over.\n\nAITA for choosing not to wear a bra at home or when I go out casually with friends?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for not wearing a bra based on the situation they described. Let me start by breaking down the details they provided.\n\nThe author is 17, has a very small chest (barely an A-cup), identifies as tomboyish, and isn't interested in fashion or dating. They find bras uncomfortable and unnecessary because they don't have much to support. Their parents, especially their mom, believe that not wearing a bra is inappropriate. The mom comments that the author should be more feminine and even links not wearing a bra to boys liking the author. There's been a recent argument where the mom sent a video about exercises to make breasts look bigger, which upset the author. The author responded by telling their mom to stop projecting insecurities, which led to the mom crying.\n\nThe key points here are the author's physical reality (small chest size), their comfort and personal choice, and the parents' expectations based on societal norms. The author argues that since they have \"mosquito-bite-titted\" breasts, there's no need for a bra for support or modesty. The parents, however, have strict views on what is appropriate and are using punishment (not letting them leave the house) to enforce their beliefs.\n\nLegally, there's no law against not wearing a bra, especially in a private setting or with friends. The author's parents are trying to impose their values, which might be about modesty or societal expectations, but the author is asserting their autonomy over their body. The mom's comments about the author being more like a boy and the pressure to be feminine could be seen as pushing their daughter towards certain gender norms, which the author resists.\n\nThe author's response, while heated, comes from a place of feeling that their mom is projecting her own insecurities. The author is also pointing out the hypocrisy of the mom's comments, especially since the author's body doesn't conform to the mom's expectations. The mom's punishment (not letting her leave the house) is a form of control that restricts the author's freedom based on the mom's beliefs, which the author finds unreasonable.\n\nConsidering personal autonomy and the right to make decisions about one's own body, the author isn't in the wrong. The parents are enforcing their views without considering the individual's comfort or personal choice. While the author's outburst was harsh, it was in response to what they perceive as unwarranted criticism and control. The core issue is about respecting individual choice versus parental authority in matters of personal appearance.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong because they are making a personal choice about their body, especially when their physical needs don't require a bra. The parents are overstepping by using punishment and enforcing their views, which may not align with the child's needs or comfort.\n"
