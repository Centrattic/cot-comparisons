Love to get some fellow ladies input on this! I'm 17, for reference. Barely A-cup. I'm plain-looking and quite tomboyish - very studious and not interested in fashion or dating at all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's the argument:\n\nMy parents believe bras are a form of underwear and that it's gross not to wear one. They often ask me if I'm wearing one (which in my mind proves it makes no difference if people can't even tell whether or not I have one), and if I say no, they won't let me leave the house. Mum often comments things like 'don't you want boys to like you?' or 'you like like a boy, you should be more feminine'. My mum feels that I do not care about my body and I'm being lazy by not wearing one. I went out without a bra once accidently (in winter, wearing 3 layers of clothing) and was yelled at and told I was ungrateful.\n\nI find bras very unnecessary and uncomfortable. A-cups are too big for me, they're awkward and bulky most of the time and I think mum's comments are really inappropriate. Nobody but her cares about my boobs. I understand that for most people it would be highly inappropriate to not wear a bra but I just don't have boobs. Bras are about support and modesty. I have nothing to support. She's right, I might as well be a boy, why is that a bad thing?\n\nI lost my temper in our most recent disagreement over it. Mum sent me a video about execerises that make your boobs look bigger. I didn't ask, I don't care, and I feel like deep down she's disappointed she gave birth to a flat-chested, tomboyish daughter rather than a gorgeous popular one. I told my mum to stop projecting her own body image insecurities onto me because I'm perfectly okay with my small bust and that it's my own damn decision what to think about my body. I feel bad for saying that because she started crying but it was in the heat of the moment and she was waaaay out of line imo. \n\nI acknowledge this who thing is quite biased but I just can't see the logic in trying to make your mosquito-bite-titted daughter feel bad and want to change the way she is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Basically, I have no boobs and don't want to wear a bra. My parents say it's gross and unladylike and get very upset at me over it, my mum in particular won't let me leave the house without one. I think it's highly inappropriate and a really silly thing to punish me over.\n\nAITA for choosing not to wear a bra at home or when I go out casually with friends?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The author is 17, has a very small bust size (barely A-cup), and identifies as tomboyish, not caring about fashion or dating. They don't wear a bra because they find it unnecessary and uncomfortable, especially since their parents can't even tell if they're wearing one. The parents argue that not wearing a bra is gross and unladylike, and they won't let the author leave the house without one. The mother's comments are pushing for more femininity, which the author resists.\n\nThe key points here are the author's comfort and autonomy. The parents are imposing their standards of modesty and femininity, but the author doesn't feel the need to conform. The mother's behavior seems to be projecting her insecurities, and the author is standing up for their self-image. \n\nNow, considering societal norms: typically, undergarments are considered intimate clothing, and not wearing them in public might be seen as immodest. However, the author's situation is specific\u2014being a minor with a very small bust, so the issue of support is less about physical necessity and more about cultural expectations. The author is also emphasizing that they can't be seen as having a bra on anyway, which challenges the parents' logic. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. From a personal autonomy perspective, the author has the right to decide what they wear, especially since they aren't causing harm. The parents' actions involve punishment and emotional pressure, which can be problematic. The author's statement that the mother is projecting her insecurities adds another layer, suggesting the issue is more about the parents' expectations than the author's actions. \n\nSo, the answer likely hinges on the parents' overreach versus the author's right to self-expression. The author isn't violating any laws or widely accepted norms, and their reasoning is based on comfort and personal identity. The parents' insistence without considering the child's feelings and body image might be the real issue here. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
