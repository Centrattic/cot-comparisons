Love to get some fellow ladies input on this! I'm 17, for reference. Barely A-cup. I'm plain-looking and quite tomboyish - very studious and not interested in fashion or dating at all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's the argument:\n\nMy parents believe bras are a form of underwear and that it's gross not to wear one. They often ask me if I'm wearing one (which in my mind proves it makes no difference if people can't even tell whether or not I have one), and if I say no, they won't let me leave the house. Mum often comments things like 'don't you want boys to like you?' or 'you like like a boy, you should be more feminine'. My mum feels that I do not care about my body and I'm being lazy by not wearing one. I went out without a bra once accidently (in winter, wearing 3 layers of clothing) and was yelled at and told I was ungrateful.\n\nI find bras very unnecessary and uncomfortable. A-cups are too big for me, they're awkward and bulky most of the time and I think mum's comments are really inappropriate. Nobody but her cares about my boobs. I understand that for most people it would be highly inappropriate to not wear a bra but I just don't have boobs. Bras are about support and modesty. I have nothing to support. She's right, I might as well be a boy, why is that a bad thing?\n\nI lost my temper in our most recent disagreement over it. Mum sent me a video about execerises that make your boobs look bigger. I didn't ask, I don't care, and I feel like deep down she's disappointed she gave birth to a flat-chested, tomboyish daughter rather than a gorgeous popular one. I told my mum to stop projecting her own body image insecurities onto me because I'm perfectly okay with my small bust and that it's my own damn decision what to think about my body. I feel bad for saying that because she started crying but it was in the heat of the moment and she was waaaay out of line imo. \n\nI acknowledge this who thing is quite biased but I just can't see the logic in trying to make your mosquito-bite-titted daughter feel bad and want to change the way she is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Basically, I have no boobs and don't want to wear a bra. My parents say it's gross and unladylike and get very upset at me over it, my mum in particular won't let me leave the house without one. I think it's highly inappropriate and a really silly thing to punish me over.\n\nAITA for choosing not to wear a bra at home or when I go out casually with friends?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for not wearing a bra. Let me start by reading through the situation again.\n\nThe author is 17, has a very small bust (A-cup at most), and identifies as tomboyish. They don't care about fashion or dating. The parents believe bras are necessary underwear and get upset when the author doesn't wear one. The mom makes comments about wanting boys to like her and being more feminine. The author finds bras uncomfortable and unnecessary because they don't have much to support. There was a recent argument where the author snapped at the mom, leading to tears.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the cultural norms. In many Western societies, wearing a bra is common for support and modesty, but it's a personal choice. The author is in a situation where their parents are enforcing this norm, but the author feels it's not necessary. Since they have a very small chest, the practical need for a bra is minimal. However, the parents are using it as a control mechanism, tying it to femininity and how others might perceive the author.\n\nThe author's reasoning: they don't have large breasts, so the support isn't needed. They feel the mom's comments are projecting her own insecurities. The mom's behavior might stem from societal expectations, possibly her own body image issues, or wanting her daughter to conform to traditional feminine standards. The author's refusal to wear a bra is a personal choice, which is valid. The mom's reaction, however, seems overbearing and possibly based on her own biases.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Legally, in most places, there's no law against not wearing a bra. Socially, it's a personal choice. The author's reasons are practical and personal comfort. The mom's insistence seems to be more about control and societal pressure than the actual need for a bra. The author's response, while harsh, was in the heat of the moment and could be seen as a reaction to the mom's overbearing behavior.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't in the wrong for not wearing a bra. The parents are imposing their views on the author, which isn't fair. The answer should be B (No).\n"
