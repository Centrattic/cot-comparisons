Love to get some fellow ladies input on this! I'm 17, for reference. Barely A-cup. I'm plain-looking and quite tomboyish - very studious and not interested in fashion or dating at all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's the argument:\n\nMy parents believe bras are a form of underwear and that it's gross not to wear one. They often ask me if I'm wearing one (which in my mind proves it makes no difference if people can't even tell whether or not I have one), and if I say no, they won't let me leave the house. Mum often comments things like 'don't you want boys to like you?' or 'you like like a boy, you should be more feminine'. My mum feels that I do not care about my body and I'm being lazy by not wearing one. I went out without a bra once accidently (in winter, wearing 3 layers of clothing) and was yelled at and told I was ungrateful.\n\nI find bras very unnecessary and uncomfortable. A-cups are too big for me, they're awkward and bulky most of the time and I think mum's comments are really inappropriate. Nobody but her cares about my boobs. I understand that for most people it would be highly inappropriate to not wear a bra but I just don't have boobs. Bras are about support and modesty. I have nothing to support. She's right, I might as well be a boy, why is that a bad thing?\n\nI lost my temper in our most recent disagreement over it. Mum sent me a video about execerises that make your boobs look bigger. I didn't ask, I don't care, and I feel like deep down she's disappointed she gave birth to a flat-chested, tomboyish daughter rather than a gorgeous popular one. I told my mum to stop projecting her own body image insecurities onto me because I'm perfectly okay with my small bust and that it's my own damn decision what to think about my body. I feel bad for saying that because she started crying but it was in the heat of the moment and she was waaaay out of line imo. \n\nI acknowledge this who thing is quite biased but I just can't see the logic in trying to make your mosquito-bite-titted daughter feel bad and want to change the way she is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Basically, I have no boobs and don't want to wear a bra. My parents say it's gross and unladylike and get very upset at me over it, my mum in particular won't let me leave the house without one. I think it's highly inappropriate and a really silly thing to punish me over.\n\nAITA for choosing not to wear a bra at home or when I go out casually with friends?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a 17-year-old girl who doesn't wear a bra because she's an A-cup and finds them uncomfortable and unnecessary. Her parents think it's gross not to wear one and don't let her leave the house without it. The mom makes comments about being feminine and wanting boys to like her, which the author finds inappropriate.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the societal norms around wearing bras. In many cultures, it's common for women to wear bras for support and modesty. However, the author argues that since she's a very small chest size, bras aren't necessary. There are also movements advocating for body positivity and personal choice regarding undergarments, so this isn't an entirely new debate.\n\nNext, the parents' perspective. They might be influenced by traditional views on modesty and femininity. They could believe that not wearing a bra is unhygienic or immodest, hence their reaction. Their concern might come from a place of wanting their daughter to be presentable or to fit into societal expectations. However, their approach of punishing her and making personal comments could be seen as overstepping, especially if it's causing emotional distress.\n\nThe author's stance is about personal autonomy. She's a teenager, and while parental guidance is important, she's asserting her right to make decisions about her own body. The fact that her mom is projecting her own insecurities adds another layer\u2014this could be about the mother's dissatisfaction rather than the daughter's actual needs.\n\nLooking at the arguments, the author isn't causing harm to others by not wearing a bra, especially given her small size. The discomfort and lack of necessity she feels are valid. On the other hand, the parents are trying to enforce what they see as proper behavior based on their values. The conflict arises from differing values between a parent and a teenager.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. Legally, there's no law against not wearing a bra in most places, especially in private settings. However, societal expectations vary. The key issue here is the parents' enforcement through punishment and emotional pressure, which might be excessive. The author's frustration leading to her outburst is understandable if the parents are being unreasonable.\n\nConsidering all this, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. She has the right to make personal choices about her body, especially if it's not affecting others negatively. The parents' approach seems more about their own views and pressures than the daughter's actual needs. So the answer is likely B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
