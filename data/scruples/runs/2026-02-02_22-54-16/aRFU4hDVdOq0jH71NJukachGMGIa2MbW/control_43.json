Love to get some fellow ladies input on this! I'm 17, for reference. Barely A-cup. I'm plain-looking and quite tomboyish - very studious and not interested in fashion or dating at all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's the argument:\n\nMy parents believe bras are a form of underwear and that it's gross not to wear one. They often ask me if I'm wearing one (which in my mind proves it makes no difference if people can't even tell whether or not I have one), and if I say no, they won't let me leave the house. Mum often comments things like 'don't you want boys to like you?' or 'you like like a boy, you should be more feminine'. My mum feels that I do not care about my body and I'm being lazy by not wearing one. I went out without a bra once accidently (in winter, wearing 3 layers of clothing) and was yelled at and told I was ungrateful.\n\nI find bras very unnecessary and uncomfortable. A-cups are too big for me, they're awkward and bulky most of the time and I think mum's comments are really inappropriate. Nobody but her cares about my boobs. I understand that for most people it would be highly inappropriate to not wear a bra but I just don't have boobs. Bras are about support and modesty. I have nothing to support. She's right, I might as well be a boy, why is that a bad thing?\n\nI lost my temper in our most recent disagreement over it. Mum sent me a video about execerises that make your boobs look bigger. I didn't ask, I don't care, and I feel like deep down she's disappointed she gave birth to a flat-chested, tomboyish daughter rather than a gorgeous popular one. I told my mum to stop projecting her own body image insecurities onto me because I'm perfectly okay with my small bust and that it's my own damn decision what to think about my body. I feel bad for saying that because she started crying but it was in the heat of the moment and she was waaaay out of line imo. \n\nI acknowledge this who thing is quite biased but I just can't see the logic in trying to make your mosquito-bite-titted daughter feel bad and want to change the way she is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Basically, I have no boobs and don't want to wear a bra. My parents say it's gross and unladylike and get very upset at me over it, my mum in particular won't let me leave the house without one. I think it's highly inappropriate and a really silly thing to punish me over.\n\nAITA for choosing not to wear a bra at home or when I go out casually with friends?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wearing a bra. The author is 17, has a small chest, and finds bras uncomfortable. Her parents are strict about it, saying it's gross not to wear one, especially her mom. She's a tomboy, not into fashion or dating, and feels her mom is projecting her own insecurities.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the cultural and societal norms around bras. In many places, especially in Western cultures, it's common for women to wear bras for support and modesty. But the author argues that since she's an A-cup, she doesn't need the support, and the modesty angle might not apply because her chest is so small that others can't tell if she's wearing one. \n\nThe parents' perspective is that it's about hygiene and being feminine. But the author is against that, feeling it's unnecessary and that her mom is trying to make her more feminine in a way that doesn't align with her identity. She also mentions that her mom's comments about boys liking her are inappropriate.\n\nThe key points here are autonomy and body image. The author should have the right to make her own decisions about her body, especially as a minor but with growing autonomy. However, parents do have a role in guiding their children, but there's a line where it becomes overbearing. The mom's reaction, including not letting her leave the house and making hurtful comments, seems excessive. The author's outburst was in the heat of the moment but might have been a result of built-up frustration.\n\nLegally, there's no law against not wearing a bra, so the author isn't in the wrong in that sense. Ethically, it's about personal choice and respecting that choice. The parents are trying to enforce a norm that the daughter doesn't agree with, which could be seen as projecting their own standards onto her. The author's stance is about self-acceptance and not conforming to societal expectations that she finds irrelevant to her identity.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. She has the right to decide what she wears, especially when her body doesn't require the support that bras provide. The parents are overstepping by making it a big issue and not respecting her autonomy. Answer B makes sense here.\n"
