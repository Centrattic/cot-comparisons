Love to get some fellow ladies input on this! I'm 17, for reference. Barely A-cup. I'm plain-looking and quite tomboyish - very studious and not interested in fashion or dating at all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's the argument:\n\nMy parents believe bras are a form of underwear and that it's gross not to wear one. They often ask me if I'm wearing one (which in my mind proves it makes no difference if people can't even tell whether or not I have one), and if I say no, they won't let me leave the house. Mum often comments things like 'don't you want boys to like you?' or 'you like like a boy, you should be more feminine'. My mum feels that I do not care about my body and I'm being lazy by not wearing one. I went out without a bra once accidently (in winter, wearing 3 layers of clothing) and was yelled at and told I was ungrateful.\n\nI find bras very unnecessary and uncomfortable. A-cups are too big for me, they're awkward and bulky most of the time and I think mum's comments are really inappropriate. Nobody but her cares about my boobs. I understand that for most people it would be highly inappropriate to not wear a bra but I just don't have boobs. Bras are about support and modesty. I have nothing to support. She's right, I might as well be a boy, why is that a bad thing?\n\nI lost my temper in our most recent disagreement over it. Mum sent me a video about execerises that make your boobs look bigger. I didn't ask, I don't care, and I feel like deep down she's disappointed she gave birth to a flat-chested, tomboyish daughter rather than a gorgeous popular one. I told my mum to stop projecting her own body image insecurities onto me because I'm perfectly okay with my small bust and that it's my own damn decision what to think about my body. I feel bad for saying that because she started crying but it was in the heat of the moment and she was waaaay out of line imo. \n\nI acknowledge this who thing is quite biased but I just can't see the logic in trying to make your mosquito-bite-titted daughter feel bad and want to change the way she is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Basically, I have no boobs and don't want to wear a bra. My parents say it's gross and unladylike and get very upset at me over it, my mum in particular won't let me leave the house without one. I think it's highly inappropriate and a really silly thing to punish me over.\n\nAITA for choosing not to wear a bra at home or when I go out casually with friends?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong for not wearing a bra. The author is 17, has a very small chest, and finds bras uncomfortable and unnecessary. Her parents insist she wear one, saying it's about modesty and femininity, and even punish her if she doesn't. The author is frustrated because she doesn't see the point of wearing a bra when she has no need for support. She also feels her mom is projecting her own insecurities onto her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the cultural and personal aspects here. In many societies, there are norms around modesty and clothing, including bras for women. But those norms can vary, and there's a growing movement towards body positivity and rejecting outdated standards. The author is in her teens, a time when personal identity is forming, and she's asserting her autonomy. \n\nThe parents' perspective is based on their beliefs about what's appropriate and modest. They might be influenced by traditional views that a bra is necessary for all women, regardless of size. However, the author's argument is valid in that for someone with a very small bust, a bra might not be needed for support or modesty, especially when wearing layered clothing. The parents are pressuring her to conform to a standard that doesn't apply to her, which can be seen as invalidating her body and choices.\n\nThe author's outburst was in the heat of the moment, but she's standing by her decision, feeling that her parents are forcing her to change for their sake. The key issues here are body autonomy, the right to make personal clothing choices, and challenging unrealistic beauty standards. The mother's comments about boys liking her or being more feminine seem to impose external validation and traditional gender roles, which the author resists.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author isn't doing anything harmful. She's making a personal choice that's not affecting others. The parents, while coming from a place of their own beliefs, are exerting control over her body and self-expression. The author's stance is about self-acceptance and rejecting unnecessary societal pressures. So, the answer leans towards B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
