Love to get some fellow ladies input on this! I'm 17, for reference. Barely A-cup. I'm plain-looking and quite tomboyish - very studious and not interested in fashion or dating at all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's the argument:\n\nMy parents believe bras are a form of underwear and that it's gross not to wear one. They often ask me if I'm wearing one (which in my mind proves it makes no difference if people can't even tell whether or not I have one), and if I say no, they won't let me leave the house. Mum often comments things like 'don't you want boys to like you?' or 'you like like a boy, you should be more feminine'. My mum feels that I do not care about my body and I'm being lazy by not wearing one. I went out without a bra once accidently (in winter, wearing 3 layers of clothing) and was yelled at and told I was ungrateful.\n\nI find bras very unnecessary and uncomfortable. A-cups are too big for me, they're awkward and bulky most of the time and I think mum's comments are really inappropriate. Nobody but her cares about my boobs. I understand that for most people it would be highly inappropriate to not wear a bra but I just don't have boobs. Bras are about support and modesty. I have nothing to support. She's right, I might as well be a boy, why is that a bad thing?\n\nI lost my temper in our most recent disagreement over it. Mum sent me a video about execerises that make your boobs look bigger. I didn't ask, I don't care, and I feel like deep down she's disappointed she gave birth to a flat-chested, tomboyish daughter rather than a gorgeous popular one. I told my mum to stop projecting her own body image insecurities onto me because I'm perfectly okay with my small bust and that it's my own damn decision what to think about my body. I feel bad for saying that because she started crying but it was in the heat of the moment and she was waaaay out of line imo. \n\nI acknowledge this who thing is quite biased but I just can't see the logic in trying to make your mosquito-bite-titted daughter feel bad and want to change the way she is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Basically, I have no boobs and don't want to wear a bra. My parents say it's gross and unladylike and get very upset at me over it, my mum in particular won't let me leave the house without one. I think it's highly inappropriate and a really silly thing to punish me over.\n\nAITA for choosing not to wear a bra at home or when I go out casually with friends?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a 17-year-old girl who doesn't wear a bra because she says she doesn't have a chest, being an A-cup. Her parents are making a big deal about it, saying it's gross and unladylike. The mom is even upset, commenting about boys liking her and being more feminine. The girl feels it's unnecessary and uncomfortable, especially since her size doesn't require support. She also mentions that her mom is projecting her own insecurities onto her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the cultural and societal norms around this. In many Western societies, it's common for women to wear bras for support and modesty. However, the author is very small-busted, so the necessity of a bra is questionable. There's also the aspect of personal choice and autonomy. Since she's 17, she's approaching adulthood, and her parents might be trying to enforce their standards, but is it right to restrict her from leaving the house based on this?\n\nThe parents argue it's about modesty and being ladylike. But if the daughter is barely A-cup, maybe the modesty argument isn't as strong. Also, the mother's comments about boys liking her and her disappointment about having a tomboy daughter might be pushing the author's buttons. The author is asserting her right to her body and her identity, which is a valid point, especially considering body positivity movements today.\n\nThe conflict seems to stem from differing values. The author isn't hurting anyone by not wearing a bra, especially if she's comfortable and it's not noticeable. The parents might be trying to enforce what they see as appropriate behavior, but if the daughter isn't in a situation where it's causing issues, maybe the parents are overstepping. The author's response in the heat of the moment was harsh, but given the context, it's understandable given the pressure she's under.\n\nConsidering all this, I think the author isn't in the wrong. She's standing up for her personal choice and her body, which is a valid stance. The parents are imposing their expectations without considering her comfort and individuality. So the answer is B.\n"
