Love to get some fellow ladies input on this! I'm 17, for reference. Barely A-cup. I'm plain-looking and quite tomboyish - very studious and not interested in fashion or dating at all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's the argument:\n\nMy parents believe bras are a form of underwear and that it's gross not to wear one. They often ask me if I'm wearing one (which in my mind proves it makes no difference if people can't even tell whether or not I have one), and if I say no, they won't let me leave the house. Mum often comments things like 'don't you want boys to like you?' or 'you like like a boy, you should be more feminine'. My mum feels that I do not care about my body and I'm being lazy by not wearing one. I went out without a bra once accidently (in winter, wearing 3 layers of clothing) and was yelled at and told I was ungrateful.\n\nI find bras very unnecessary and uncomfortable. A-cups are too big for me, they're awkward and bulky most of the time and I think mum's comments are really inappropriate. Nobody but her cares about my boobs. I understand that for most people it would be highly inappropriate to not wear a bra but I just don't have boobs. Bras are about support and modesty. I have nothing to support. She's right, I might as well be a boy, why is that a bad thing?\n\nI lost my temper in our most recent disagreement over it. Mum sent me a video about execerises that make your boobs look bigger. I didn't ask, I don't care, and I feel like deep down she's disappointed she gave birth to a flat-chested, tomboyish daughter rather than a gorgeous popular one. I told my mum to stop projecting her own body image insecurities onto me because I'm perfectly okay with my small bust and that it's my own damn decision what to think about my body. I feel bad for saying that because she started crying but it was in the heat of the moment and she was waaaay out of line imo. \n\nI acknowledge this who thing is quite biased but I just can't see the logic in trying to make your mosquito-bite-titted daughter feel bad and want to change the way she is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Basically, I have no boobs and don't want to wear a bra. My parents say it's gross and unladylike and get very upset at me over it, my mum in particular won't let me leave the house without one. I think it's highly inappropriate and a really silly thing to punish me over.\n\nAITA for choosing not to wear a bra at home or when I go out casually with friends?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wearing a bra. The situation involves a 17-year-old girl with a very small chest size who finds bras uncomfortable and unnecessary. Her parents insist she wears one, citing modesty and femininity, and even punish her for not doing so.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural and social norms. In many societies, there's an expectation for women to wear bras for modesty, especially in public. However, the author argues that she has a very small bust (A-cup or less), so the need for support or coverage is minimal. This makes the situation a bit different from someone with a larger bust where support is more critical.\n\nThe parents' perspective is that not wearing a bra is improper and they express disappointment, linking it to femininity and societal expectations. They even send her videos about exercises to enlarge her breasts, which the author sees as projecting their own insecurities. The mother's behavior seems to be driven by her own body image issues rather than the daughter's comfort or autonomy.\n\nThe author's stance is about bodily autonomy and personal choice. She doesn't feel the need to conform to societal standards that she finds irrelevant. She's also defensive about her tomboyish nature and not wanting to be seen as more feminine. The conflict here is between the parents' traditional views and the daughter's desire for self-expression and comfort.\n\nLegally, there's no law requiring women to wear bras. The issue is more about personal freedom versus parental authority. Since the author is a minor, her parents have some say in her upbringing. However, the way they enforce this rule\u2014by not letting her leave the house and making hurtful comments\u2014could be seen as overstepping, especially if it's causing emotional distress.\n\nThe key points are the author's age, the size of her bust, the parents' overreaction, and the daughter's right to make choices about her body. While respecting parental guidance, the daughter's comfort and autonomy are also valid. The parents' actions might be harmful, pushing their own insecurities onto their child and creating a hostile environment.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong for choosing not to wear a bra, especially given her small bust and the parents' unreasonable behavior. The answer should be B.\n"
