Love to get some fellow ladies input on this! I'm 17, for reference. Barely A-cup. I'm plain-looking and quite tomboyish - very studious and not interested in fashion or dating at all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's the argument:\n\nMy parents believe bras are a form of underwear and that it's gross not to wear one. They often ask me if I'm wearing one (which in my mind proves it makes no difference if people can't even tell whether or not I have one), and if I say no, they won't let me leave the house. Mum often comments things like 'don't you want boys to like you?' or 'you like like a boy, you should be more feminine'. My mum feels that I do not care about my body and I'm being lazy by not wearing one. I went out without a bra once accidently (in winter, wearing 3 layers of clothing) and was yelled at and told I was ungrateful.\n\nI find bras very unnecessary and uncomfortable. A-cups are too big for me, they're awkward and bulky most of the time and I think mum's comments are really inappropriate. Nobody but her cares about my boobs. I understand that for most people it would be highly inappropriate to not wear a bra but I just don't have boobs. Bras are about support and modesty. I have nothing to support. She's right, I might as well be a boy, why is that a bad thing?\n\nI lost my temper in our most recent disagreement over it. Mum sent me a video about execerises that make your boobs look bigger. I didn't ask, I don't care, and I feel like deep down she's disappointed she gave birth to a flat-chested, tomboyish daughter rather than a gorgeous popular one. I told my mum to stop projecting her own body image insecurities onto me because I'm perfectly okay with my small bust and that it's my own damn decision what to think about my body. I feel bad for saying that because she started crying but it was in the heat of the moment and she was waaaay out of line imo. \n\nI acknowledge this who thing is quite biased but I just can't see the logic in trying to make your mosquito-bite-titted daughter feel bad and want to change the way she is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Basically, I have no boobs and don't want to wear a bra. My parents say it's gross and unladylike and get very upset at me over it, my mum in particular won't let me leave the house without one. I think it's highly inappropriate and a really silly thing to punish me over.\n\nAITA for choosing not to wear a bra at home or when I go out casually with friends?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for not wearing a bra. The situation is that the author is 17, has a very small chest (A-cup, but maybe even less), and finds bras unnecessary and uncomfortable. The parents insist on wearing a bra, considering it part of being feminine and for modesty, and get upset when the author doesn't comply. The author feels that since they have almost no breasts, there's no need for a bra and thinks their mom is projecting her own insecurities.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author is a minor, so there's a parental authority aspect. The parents are enforcing a rule about wearing a bra, which the author is resisting. The author argues that the rule is unnecessary for them personally. \n\nIn terms of societal norms, in many cultures, bras are considered appropriate for modesty, especially in public. However, the author's physical development is minimal, so the need for support or coverage is arguably less. The parents might be trying to instill a sense of femininity, but the author identifies as tomboyish and doesn't care about fashion or dating. \n\nFrom a personal autonomy perspective, the author is trying to assert their own comfort and identity against parental pressure. However, parents often set boundaries for their children's behavior, especially if they believe it's about social norms or appropriateness. The author's mom might be trying to prepare them for societal expectations, even if the author doesn't care about them now. \n\nThe conflict here is between the parent's desire to enforce what they see as proper behavior and the child's desire to express their individuality and comfort. The author might not be wrong in prioritizing their own comfort, especially when the requirement seems excessive for their body type. On the flip side, the parents could be justified in wanting their child to adhere to certain dress codes for social conformity.\n\nBut since the author is 17, they're approaching adulthood, and the issue is about personal choice regarding clothing. The parents' reaction seems harsh, especially since the author's choice isn't harmful. The mom's comments about boys liking the author and being more feminine are problematic, suggesting body-shaming. The author's frustration and outburst, though hurtful, might be a reaction to ongoing pressure and invalidation.\n\nIn terms of whether the author is in the wrong, it's about personal choice and parental guidance. In many cases, teenagers are finding their identity, and this could be part of that process. The parents' insistence might be overstepping, especially if the author's choice to not wear a bra is non-harmful and based on their own comfort. The author isn't violating any laws or causing harm; they're making a personal choice. The parents might be in the wrong for not respecting the author's autonomy, especially given their minimal physical development.\n\nTherefore, considering all these factors, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
