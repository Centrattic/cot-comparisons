Love to get some fellow ladies input on this! I'm 17, for reference. Barely A-cup. I'm plain-looking and quite tomboyish - very studious and not interested in fashion or dating at all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's the argument:\n\nMy parents believe bras are a form of underwear and that it's gross not to wear one. They often ask me if I'm wearing one (which in my mind proves it makes no difference if people can't even tell whether or not I have one), and if I say no, they won't let me leave the house. Mum often comments things like 'don't you want boys to like you?' or 'you like like a boy, you should be more feminine'. My mum feels that I do not care about my body and I'm being lazy by not wearing one. I went out without a bra once accidently (in winter, wearing 3 layers of clothing) and was yelled at and told I was ungrateful.\n\nI find bras very unnecessary and uncomfortable. A-cups are too big for me, they're awkward and bulky most of the time and I think mum's comments are really inappropriate. Nobody but her cares about my boobs. I understand that for most people it would be highly inappropriate to not wear a bra but I just don't have boobs. Bras are about support and modesty. I have nothing to support. She's right, I might as well be a boy, why is that a bad thing?\n\nI lost my temper in our most recent disagreement over it. Mum sent me a video about execerises that make your boobs look bigger. I didn't ask, I don't care, and I feel like deep down she's disappointed she gave birth to a flat-chested, tomboyish daughter rather than a gorgeous popular one. I told my mum to stop projecting her own body image insecurities onto me because I'm perfectly okay with my small bust and that it's my own damn decision what to think about my body. I feel bad for saying that because she started crying but it was in the heat of the moment and she was waaaay out of line imo. \n\nI acknowledge this who thing is quite biased but I just can't see the logic in trying to make your mosquito-bite-titted daughter feel bad and want to change the way she is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Basically, I have no boobs and don't want to wear a bra. My parents say it's gross and unladylike and get very upset at me over it, my mum in particular won't let me leave the house without one. I think it's highly inappropriate and a really silly thing to punish me over.\n\nAITA for choosing not to wear a bra at home or when I go out casually with friends?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for not wearing a bra. Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author is 17, has a barely A-cup, is tomboyish, and doesn't care about fashion or dating. Her parents, especially her mom, are pressuring her to wear a bra. They say it's gross to not wear one and that it's about modesty. The mom comments on wanting boys to like her and being more feminine. The author finds bras uncomfortable and unnecessary since she's flat-chested. She had a recent argument and snapped at her mom, saying she's projecting her own insecurities. Now she's asking if she's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I should consider the key points. The author's choice to not wear a bra is personal, and she's small-chested. Bras are for support and modesty, but if there's no need for support or coverage, maybe it's a personal choice. The parents are enforcing this as a rule, making it a condition for leaving the house. The mom is pushing femininity and body image expectations on the daughter, which the daughter resists.\n\nLegally and socially, there's no law against not wearing a bra in most places. It's a personal choice. The parents' rules might be their household's policies, but if they're being overly controlling or causing emotional harm, that's a different issue. The daughter feels her autonomy is being violated. She's not harming anyone by not wearing a bra, especially with her body type. The mom's comments about being disappointed and projecting her own insecurities are problematic. The daughter's reaction in the heat of the argument was harsh but maybe justified given the pressure.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer hinges on personal autonomy versus parental rules. Since the author's choice doesn't affect others and the parents are enforcing their views without valid health or safety reasons, it seems the author isn't in the wrong. The parents might be overstepping by using punishment (not letting her leave) over a personal choice, especially when the daughter has valid reasons for comfort and personal expression.\n"
