Love to get some fellow ladies input on this! I'm 17, for reference. Barely A-cup. I'm plain-looking and quite tomboyish - very studious and not interested in fashion or dating at all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's the argument:\n\nMy parents believe bras are a form of underwear and that it's gross not to wear one. They often ask me if I'm wearing one (which in my mind proves it makes no difference if people can't even tell whether or not I have one), and if I say no, they won't let me leave the house. Mum often comments things like 'don't you want boys to like you?' or 'you like like a boy, you should be more feminine'. My mum feels that I do not care about my body and I'm being lazy by not wearing one. I went out without a bra once accidently (in winter, wearing 3 layers of clothing) and was yelled at and told I was ungrateful.\n\nI find bras very unnecessary and uncomfortable. A-cups are too big for me, they're awkward and bulky most of the time and I think mum's comments are really inappropriate. Nobody but her cares about my boobs. I understand that for most people it would be highly inappropriate to not wear a bra but I just don't have boobs. Bras are about support and modesty. I have nothing to support. She's right, I might as well be a boy, why is that a bad thing?\n\nI lost my temper in our most recent disagreement over it. Mum sent me a video about execerises that make your boobs look bigger. I didn't ask, I don't care, and I feel like deep down she's disappointed she gave birth to a flat-chested, tomboyish daughter rather than a gorgeous popular one. I told my mum to stop projecting her own body image insecurities onto me because I'm perfectly okay with my small bust and that it's my own damn decision what to think about my body. I feel bad for saying that because she started crying but it was in the heat of the moment and she was waaaay out of line imo. \n\nI acknowledge this who thing is quite biased but I just can't see the logic in trying to make your mosquito-bite-titted daughter feel bad and want to change the way she is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Basically, I have no boobs and don't want to wear a bra. My parents say it's gross and unladylike and get very upset at me over it, my mum in particular won't let me leave the house without one. I think it's highly inappropriate and a really silly thing to punish me over.\n\nAITA for choosing not to wear a bra at home or when I go out casually with friends?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a 17-year-old who's barely an A-cup and doesn't want to wear a bra. Their parents are making it a big deal, saying it's gross and unladylike. The author finds bras uncomfortable and unnecessary because they don't have much to support. They had an argument where the mom sent a video about making boobs look bigger, which the author felt was projecting insecurities.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the societal norms around wearing bras. In many cultures, bras are considered standard for modesty and support, but body autonomy is a strong argument here. The author is asserting their right to make decisions about their own body, which is a key point. The parents are enforcing their views, possibly based on their own expectations or societal pressures, which might not align with the daughter's comfort or identity.\n\nThe author mentions they're tomboyish and not interested in fashion or dating. This could be part of their identity, and the pressure from the mom to be more feminine might be conflicting with that. The mom's comments about boys liking her might be pushing the daughter towards traditional gender roles, which the daughter resists.\n\nIn terms of wrongdoings, the author is not harming anyone by not wearing a bra, especially since they're small-chested and it's not affecting others. The parents are overstepping by controlling their daughter's choices and making her feel bad about her body. The author's outburst was in a heated moment, but it's a response to the mom's behavior, which seems more problematic. The key issue here is body autonomy versus parental control. The author isn't in the wrong for choosing their comfort and rejecting societal expectations that don't fit their experience.\n"
