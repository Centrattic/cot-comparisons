Love to get some fellow ladies input on this! I'm 17, for reference. Barely A-cup. I'm plain-looking and quite tomboyish - very studious and not interested in fashion or dating at all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's the argument:\n\nMy parents believe bras are a form of underwear and that it's gross not to wear one. They often ask me if I'm wearing one (which in my mind proves it makes no difference if people can't even tell whether or not I have one), and if I say no, they won't let me leave the house. Mum often comments things like 'don't you want boys to like you?' or 'you like like a boy, you should be more feminine'. My mum feels that I do not care about my body and I'm being lazy by not wearing one. I went out without a bra once accidently (in winter, wearing 3 layers of clothing) and was yelled at and told I was ungrateful.\n\nI find bras very unnecessary and uncomfortable. A-cups are too big for me, they're awkward and bulky most of the time and I think mum's comments are really inappropriate. Nobody but her cares about my boobs. I understand that for most people it would be highly inappropriate to not wear a bra but I just don't have boobs. Bras are about support and modesty. I have nothing to support. She's right, I might as well be a boy, why is that a bad thing?\n\nI lost my temper in our most recent disagreement over it. Mum sent me a video about execerises that make your boobs look bigger. I didn't ask, I don't care, and I feel like deep down she's disappointed she gave birth to a flat-chested, tomboyish daughter rather than a gorgeous popular one. I told my mum to stop projecting her own body image insecurities onto me because I'm perfectly okay with my small bust and that it's my own damn decision what to think about my body. I feel bad for saying that because she started crying but it was in the heat of the moment and she was waaaay out of line imo. \n\nI acknowledge this who thing is quite biased but I just can't see the logic in trying to make your mosquito-bite-titted daughter feel bad and want to change the way she is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Basically, I have no boobs and don't want to wear a bra. My parents say it's gross and unladylike and get very upset at me over it, my mum in particular won't let me leave the house without one. I think it's highly inappropriate and a really silly thing to punish me over.\n\nAITA for choosing not to wear a bra at home or when I go out casually with friends?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for not wearing a bra. The scenario is the author is a 17-year-old with a very small bust, leading them to find bras uncomfortable and unnecessary. Their parents are pressuring them to wear one, citing modesty and femininity. The author is upset about their mother's comments and even lost their temper.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural and societal norms. In many societies, especially in Western contexts, wearing a bra is often seen as a matter of modesty and appropriateness. However, there's a growing movement advocating for body positivity and personal choice. The author's situation is unique because they have a very small bust, so the need for support might be minimal. \n\nThe mother's perspective is about modesty and possibly projecting her own insecurities. But is that a valid reason to enforce wearing a bra? The author feels it's unnecessary and that the mother is overstepping. The parent's insistence might be based on outdated gender norms, especially considering the author's tomboyish and studious nature. \n\nThe key points here are autonomy and respect. The author is an adolescent making their own choices about their body. Parents have a role in guiding, but not enforcing strict rules that the child finds harmful or unnecessary. The mother's reaction\u2014yelling, not letting the author leave the house, and making comments about boys liking the author\u2014might be overbearing and not respecting the child's body autonomy.\n\nAlso, the author's response was defensive, which is understandable given the pressure. The mother's crying suggests that the situation is emotionally charged. The author's argument is about personal choice and not wanting to conform to societal expectations they don't agree with. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author is expressing their right to choose. While there may be a cultural expectation to wear a bra, the author's choice is valid, especially considering their physical attributes. The parents are imposing their views, which could be seen as not respecting the child's autonomy. \n\nTherefore, the author is not in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
