Love to get some fellow ladies input on this! I'm 17, for reference. Barely A-cup. I'm plain-looking and quite tomboyish - very studious and not interested in fashion or dating at all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's the argument:\n\nMy parents believe bras are a form of underwear and that it's gross not to wear one. They often ask me if I'm wearing one (which in my mind proves it makes no difference if people can't even tell whether or not I have one), and if I say no, they won't let me leave the house. Mum often comments things like 'don't you want boys to like you?' or 'you like like a boy, you should be more feminine'. My mum feels that I do not care about my body and I'm being lazy by not wearing one. I went out without a bra once accidently (in winter, wearing 3 layers of clothing) and was yelled at and told I was ungrateful.\n\nI find bras very unnecessary and uncomfortable. A-cups are too big for me, they're awkward and bulky most of the time and I think mum's comments are really inappropriate. Nobody but her cares about my boobs. I understand that for most people it would be highly inappropriate to not wear a bra but I just don't have boobs. Bras are about support and modesty. I have nothing to support. She's right, I might as well be a boy, why is that a bad thing?\n\nI lost my temper in our most recent disagreement over it. Mum sent me a video about execerises that make your boobs look bigger. I didn't ask, I don't care, and I feel like deep down she's disappointed she gave birth to a flat-chested, tomboyish daughter rather than a gorgeous popular one. I told my mum to stop projecting her own body image insecurities onto me because I'm perfectly okay with my small bust and that it's my own damn decision what to think about my body. I feel bad for saying that because she started crying but it was in the heat of the moment and she was waaaay out of line imo. \n\nI acknowledge this who thing is quite biased but I just can't see the logic in trying to make your mosquito-bite-titted daughter feel bad and want to change the way she is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Basically, I have no boobs and don't want to wear a bra. My parents say it's gross and unladylike and get very upset at me over it, my mum in particular won't let me leave the house without one. I think it's highly inappropriate and a really silly thing to punish me over.\n\nAITA for choosing not to wear a bra at home or when I go out casually with friends?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wearing a bra, based on the provided situation. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author is 17, with a barely A-cup, and describes herself as tomboyish and not interested in fashion or dating. Her parents insist she wears a bra, even going as far as not letting her leave the house without one. They make comments about boys liking her and being more feminine. The author finds bras unnecessary and uncomfortable, especially since she has a small bust. She had a recent argument where her mom sent a video about exercises to increase breast size, and she lashed out, telling her mom to stop projecting her insecurities.\n\nNow, considering the question: Is the author in the wrong? The options are A for yes, B for no. \n\nFrom a personal autonomy perspective, especially for someone 17 years old, the right to make decisions about her own body is important. The parents' insistence might be based on cultural or personal beliefs about modesty or femininity. However, the author is physically uncomfortable and the parents are using punishment (not letting her leave the house) over something that may not be necessary for her body type. \n\nThe mom's comments about boys liking her or being more feminine could be seen as pressuring the daughter into a societal mold she doesn't feel comfortable with. The daughter's response, while heated, seems to be a reaction to what she perceives as invalidation of her body image and personal choice. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the parents are enforcing their views, but the daughter's choice not to wear a bra when it's not needed for support or modesty (since she's a small chested) might be her right. The fact that the parents are using emotional manipulation and punishment raises concerns. The daughter's argument is about her autonomy and not conforming to their expectations. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author is not in the wrong. The answer would be B.\n"
