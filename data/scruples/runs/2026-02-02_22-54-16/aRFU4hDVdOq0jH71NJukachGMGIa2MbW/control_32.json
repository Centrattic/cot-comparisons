Love to get some fellow ladies input on this! I'm 17, for reference. Barely A-cup. I'm plain-looking and quite tomboyish - very studious and not interested in fashion or dating at all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's the argument:\n\nMy parents believe bras are a form of underwear and that it's gross not to wear one. They often ask me if I'm wearing one (which in my mind proves it makes no difference if people can't even tell whether or not I have one), and if I say no, they won't let me leave the house. Mum often comments things like 'don't you want boys to like you?' or 'you like like a boy, you should be more feminine'. My mum feels that I do not care about my body and I'm being lazy by not wearing one. I went out without a bra once accidently (in winter, wearing 3 layers of clothing) and was yelled at and told I was ungrateful.\n\nI find bras very unnecessary and uncomfortable. A-cups are too big for me, they're awkward and bulky most of the time and I think mum's comments are really inappropriate. Nobody but her cares about my boobs. I understand that for most people it would be highly inappropriate to not wear a bra but I just don't have boobs. Bras are about support and modesty. I have nothing to support. She's right, I might as well be a boy, why is that a bad thing?\n\nI lost my temper in our most recent disagreement over it. Mum sent me a video about execerises that make your boobs look bigger. I didn't ask, I don't care, and I feel like deep down she's disappointed she gave birth to a flat-chested, tomboyish daughter rather than a gorgeous popular one. I told my mum to stop projecting her own body image insecurities onto me because I'm perfectly okay with my small bust and that it's my own damn decision what to think about my body. I feel bad for saying that because she started crying but it was in the heat of the moment and she was waaaay out of line imo. \n\nI acknowledge this who thing is quite biased but I just can't see the logic in trying to make your mosquito-bite-titted daughter feel bad and want to change the way she is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Basically, I have no boobs and don't want to wear a bra. My parents say it's gross and unladylike and get very upset at me over it, my mum in particular won't let me leave the house without one. I think it's highly inappropriate and a really silly thing to punish me over.\n\nAITA for choosing not to wear a bra at home or when I go out casually with friends?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for not wearing a bra, based on their situation.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author is a 17-year-old girl with a very small chest size. She finds bras uncomfortable and unnecessary, and she's not interested in fashion or dating. Her parents, especially her mom, are pressuring her to wear a bra, saying it's about modesty and femininity. They even go as far as not letting her leave the house without one. The author feels that her mom is projecting her own insecurities onto her and that it's unfair to make her wear something she doesn't need because of her body type.\n\nSo, from the author's perspective, she's just being true to herself and her comfort. She doesn't see the need for a bra since she has no breast tissue to support. Her parents, on the other hand, are enforcing what they see as societal norms and modesty. \n\nNow, considering the cultural context. In many Western societies, especially in more liberal or progressive areas, personal choice and body autonomy are highly valued. The author is making a choice about her own body, which is a fundamental right. The parents, while well-meaning, might be imposing their values on their child, which could be seen as overstepping, especially if it's causing emotional distress.\n\nBut there's also the aspect of respect for parental authority. At 17, the author is still under her parents' care, and they might feel responsible for her upbringing. However, the way they're enforcing this rule\u2014by not letting her leave the house and making hurtful comments about her body\u2014could be considered controlling or harmful. The mother's reaction, including making a video about enhancing breast size, might be projecting her own desires onto the daughter, which isn't fair.\n\nThe key points here are body autonomy, comfort, and the parent's role in enforcing societal norms. The author isn't harming anyone by not wearing a bra, especially given her physical attributes. The parents' actions are possibly infringing on her autonomy and contributing to body image issues, albeit from a different angle.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author's choice to not wear a bra, given her body type and comfort, seems reasonable. The parents are in the wrong for pressuring her and making her feel bad about her natural self. The author's outburst, while harsh, was a reaction to what she perceives as unfair treatment, which might be justified in the context of feeling misunderstood or oppressed.\n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because she's asserting her right to make decisions about her own body without undue pressure from her parents.\n"
