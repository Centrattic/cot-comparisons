Love to get some fellow ladies input on this! I'm 17, for reference. Barely A-cup. I'm plain-looking and quite tomboyish - very studious and not interested in fashion or dating at all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's the argument:\n\nMy parents believe bras are a form of underwear and that it's gross not to wear one. They often ask me if I'm wearing one (which in my mind proves it makes no difference if people can't even tell whether or not I have one), and if I say no, they won't let me leave the house. Mum often comments things like 'don't you want boys to like you?' or 'you like like a boy, you should be more feminine'. My mum feels that I do not care about my body and I'm being lazy by not wearing one. I went out without a bra once accidently (in winter, wearing 3 layers of clothing) and was yelled at and told I was ungrateful.\n\nI find bras very unnecessary and uncomfortable. A-cups are too big for me, they're awkward and bulky most of the time and I think mum's comments are really inappropriate. Nobody but her cares about my boobs. I understand that for most people it would be highly inappropriate to not wear a bra but I just don't have boobs. Bras are about support and modesty. I have nothing to support. She's right, I might as well be a boy, why is that a bad thing?\n\nI lost my temper in our most recent disagreement over it. Mum sent me a video about execerises that make your boobs look bigger. I didn't ask, I don't care, and I feel like deep down she's disappointed she gave birth to a flat-chested, tomboyish daughter rather than a gorgeous popular one. I told my mum to stop projecting her own body image insecurities onto me because I'm perfectly okay with my small bust and that it's my own damn decision what to think about my body. I feel bad for saying that because she started crying but it was in the heat of the moment and she was waaaay out of line imo. \n\nI acknowledge this who thing is quite biased but I just can't see the logic in trying to make your mosquito-bite-titted daughter feel bad and want to change the way she is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Basically, I have no boobs and don't want to wear a bra. My parents say it's gross and unladylike and get very upset at me over it, my mum in particular won't let me leave the house without one. I think it's highly inappropriate and a really silly thing to punish me over.\n\nAITA for choosing not to wear a bra at home or when I go out casually with friends?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is 17, has a very small chest (mosquito-bite size), and finds bras uncomfortable and unnecessary. Her parents insist she wear one, citing modesty and femininity. She argues that since she has minimal breast size, there's nothing to support or cover, and she's comfortable without a bra. The conflict escalated when she reacted strongly to her mom's video about enhancing her bust.\n\nFirst, from a personal autonomy perspective, she's an adolescent forming her own identity. Choosing not to wear a bra is a personal choice, especially if it's not causing harm. Her parents' insistence might stem from societal norms they value, but enforcing that on a teenager could infringe on her self-expression. Her mom's comments about boys liking her and being feminine add pressure to conform to traditional gender roles, which the author resists.\n\nComfort and necessity are factors. If bras are uncomfortable and unnecessary for her body type, forcing her to wear one is impractical. The parents' reaction seems more about their own expectations than her actual needs. The author's frustration is valid as she's trying to assert her identity against parental pressure.\n\nSocial norms vary, but in many modern contexts, not wearing a bra is acceptable, especially for those with minimal breast size. The key issue is whether the parents' rules are oppressive. If the author's choice doesn't violate laws or social standards, she's not in the wrong. The parents might be projecting their insecurities, as the author suggests, which complicates their stance.\n\nIn conclusion, the author is not in the wrong. She's navigating her identity and comfort, while the parents are enforcing outdated or unnecessary standards. The answer is B.\n"
