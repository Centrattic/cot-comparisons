Love to get some fellow ladies input on this! I'm 17, for reference. Barely A-cup. I'm plain-looking and quite tomboyish - very studious and not interested in fashion or dating at all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's the argument:\n\nMy parents believe bras are a form of underwear and that it's gross not to wear one. They often ask me if I'm wearing one (which in my mind proves it makes no difference if people can't even tell whether or not I have one), and if I say no, they won't let me leave the house. Mum often comments things like 'don't you want boys to like you?' or 'you like like a boy, you should be more feminine'. My mum feels that I do not care about my body and I'm being lazy by not wearing one. I went out without a bra once accidently (in winter, wearing 3 layers of clothing) and was yelled at and told I was ungrateful.\n\nI find bras very unnecessary and uncomfortable. A-cups are too big for me, they're awkward and bulky most of the time and I think mum's comments are really inappropriate. Nobody but her cares about my boobs. I understand that for most people it would be highly inappropriate to not wear a bra but I just don't have boobs. Bras are about support and modesty. I have nothing to support. She's right, I might as well be a boy, why is that a bad thing?\n\nI lost my temper in our most recent disagreement over it. Mum sent me a video about execerises that make your boobs look bigger. I didn't ask, I don't care, and I feel like deep down she's disappointed she gave birth to a flat-chested, tomboyish daughter rather than a gorgeous popular one. I told my mum to stop projecting her own body image insecurities onto me because I'm perfectly okay with my small bust and that it's my own damn decision what to think about my body. I feel bad for saying that because she started crying but it was in the heat of the moment and she was waaaay out of line imo. \n\nI acknowledge this who thing is quite biased but I just can't see the logic in trying to make your mosquito-bite-titted daughter feel bad and want to change the way she is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Basically, I have no boobs and don't want to wear a bra. My parents say it's gross and unladylike and get very upset at me over it, my mum in particular won't let me leave the house without one. I think it's highly inappropriate and a really silly thing to punish me over.\n\nAITA for choosing not to wear a bra at home or when I go out casually with friends?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong for not wearing a bra, according to the situation they described.\n\nFirst, the author is 17, has a very small chest (A-cup), and identifies as tomboyish and not interested in fashion or dating. Their parents are making a big deal about not wearing a bra, calling it gross and unladylike, and even preventing them from leaving the house without one. The mom seems to use comments about wanting boys to like her, which the author finds inappropriate. The author feels that bras are unnecessary and uncomfortable, and they don't see the point since they have minimal chest size. They also mention that their mom sent them a video about exercises to make their chest look bigger, which the author finds intrusive and like the mom is projecting her own insecurities.\n\nNow, considering societal norms, in many cultures, not wearing a bra in public might be seen as immodest, but the author argues that with their small chest size, it's not an issue of support or modesty. They also mention that they can't see the logic in being punished for this. The parents' reactions seem to be based on their own expectations of femininity, which the author is rejecting. The author is asserting their autonomy over their body and their own identity, which is a key point here.\n\nThe author's parents might believe they are instilling proper behavior, but their methods are causing conflict and emotional distress. The author's response, while maybe harsh, is a reaction to what they perceive as invalid pressure. The core issue is the parents' right to enforce such norms versus the child's right to autonomy. Since the author is a minor, there's a balance between parental guidance and the child's developing identity. However, the parents' approach seems controlling and disrespectful of the child's preferences and body image.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the author is standing up for their own comfort and identity, which is valid. The parents' insistence could be seen as pushing their own standards onto the child. So the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for choosing not to wear a bra, especially given their reasoning and the lack of actual need for support or modesty in their case.\n"
