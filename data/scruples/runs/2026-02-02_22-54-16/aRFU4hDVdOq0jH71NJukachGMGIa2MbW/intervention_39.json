Love to get some fellow ladies input on this! I'm 17, for reference. Barely A-cup. I'm plain-looking and quite tomboyish - very studious and not interested in fashion or dating at all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's the argument:\n\nMy parents believe bras are a form of underwear and that it's gross not to wear one. They often ask me if I'm wearing one (which in my mind proves it makes no difference if people can't even tell whether or not I have one), and if I say no, they won't let me leave the house. Mum often comments things like 'don't you want boys to like you?' or 'you like like a boy, you should be more feminine'. My mum feels that I do not care about my body and I'm being lazy by not wearing one. I went out without a bra once accidently (in winter, wearing 3 layers of clothing) and was yelled at and told I was ungrateful.\n\nI find bras very unnecessary and uncomfortable. A-cups are too big for me, they're awkward and bulky most of the time and I think mum's comments are really inappropriate. Nobody but her cares about my boobs. I understand that for most people it would be highly inappropriate to not wear a bra but I just don't have boobs. Bras are about support and modesty. I have nothing to support. She's right, I might as well be a boy, why is that a bad thing?\n\nI lost my temper in our most recent disagreement over it. Mum sent me a video about execerises that make your boobs look bigger. I didn't ask, I don't care, and I feel like deep down she's disappointed she gave birth to a flat-chested, tomboyish daughter rather than a gorgeous popular one. I told my mum to stop projecting her own body image insecurities onto me because I'm perfectly okay with my small bust and that it's my own damn decision what to think about my body. I feel bad for saying that because she started crying but it was in the heat of the moment and she was waaaay out of line imo. \n\nI acknowledge this who thing is quite biased but I just can't see the logic in trying to make your mosquito-bite-titted daughter feel bad and want to change the way she is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Basically, I have no boobs and don't want to wear a bra. My parents say it's gross and unladylike and get very upset at me over it, my mum in particular won't let me leave the house without one. I think it's highly inappropriate and a really silly thing to punish me over.\n\nAITA for choosing not to wear a bra at home or when I go out casually with friends?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wearing a bra, given the context they provided.\n\nFirst, the author is 17, very small in chest size, and identifies as tomboyish. They don't wear bras because they find them uncomfortable and unnecessary for their body. The parents are pressuring them to wear one, using phrases like \"gross\" and \"unladylike,\" and even linking it to boys liking them. The mom seems to be projecting her own insecurities or societal expectations onto the daughter.\n\nThe author argues that since they're an A-cup, there's nothing to support, so a bra isn't necessary. They also mention that the mom's comments are inappropriate and that the author is being punished for not conforming. The key points here are bodily autonomy, the parent's overstepping, and the lack of necessity for a bra in this case.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, while many cultures expect women to wear bras, the necessity varies. For someone with a very small chest, it's reasonable to choose not to wear one. The parent's reaction seems more about enforcing traditional gender roles and their own expectations rather than health or safety. The author isn't causing harm by not wearing a bra; the issue is the parent's insistence on controlling the child's body.\n\nThe author's response, while perhaps harsh, was in the heat of the moment and a reaction to the mom's inappropriate comments. The mom's actions\u2014punishing the child for not wearing a bra that's not needed\u2014could be seen as authoritarian and not respecting the child's autonomy. \n\nSo, considering the facts, the author isn't in the wrong. They have the right to make choices about their own body, especially when the parents' expectations are based on societal pressures rather than the child's comfort or health.\n"
