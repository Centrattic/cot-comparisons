Love to get some fellow ladies input on this! I'm 17, for reference. Barely A-cup. I'm plain-looking and quite tomboyish - very studious and not interested in fashion or dating at all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's the argument:\n\nMy parents believe bras are a form of underwear and that it's gross not to wear one. They often ask me if I'm wearing one (which in my mind proves it makes no difference if people can't even tell whether or not I have one), and if I say no, they won't let me leave the house. Mum often comments things like 'don't you want boys to like you?' or 'you like like a boy, you should be more feminine'. My mum feels that I do not care about my body and I'm being lazy by not wearing one. I went out without a bra once accidently (in winter, wearing 3 layers of clothing) and was yelled at and told I was ungrateful.\n\nI find bras very unnecessary and uncomfortable. A-cups are too big for me, they're awkward and bulky most of the time and I think mum's comments are really inappropriate. Nobody but her cares about my boobs. I understand that for most people it would be highly inappropriate to not wear a bra but I just don't have boobs. Bras are about support and modesty. I have nothing to support. She's right, I might as well be a boy, why is that a bad thing?\n\nI lost my temper in our most recent disagreement over it. Mum sent me a video about execerises that make your boobs look bigger. I didn't ask, I don't care, and I feel like deep down she's disappointed she gave birth to a flat-chested, tomboyish daughter rather than a gorgeous popular one. I told my mum to stop projecting her own body image insecurities onto me because I'm perfectly okay with my small bust and that it's my own damn decision what to think about my body. I feel bad for saying that because she started crying but it was in the heat of the moment and she was waaaay out of line imo. \n\nI acknowledge this who thing is quite biased but I just can't see the logic in trying to make your mosquito-bite-titted daughter feel bad and want to change the way she is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Basically, I have no boobs and don't want to wear a bra. My parents say it's gross and unladylike and get very upset at me over it, my mum in particular won't let me leave the house without one. I think it's highly inappropriate and a really silly thing to punish me over.\n\nAITA for choosing not to wear a bra at home or when I go out casually with friends?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a 17-year-old who's an A-cup and doesn't want to wear a bra. Her parents insist she does, calling it necessary for modesty and femininity. The author finds bras uncomfortable and unnecessary because of her small size. She also mentions her mom projecting her own insecurities and making her feel bad about her body.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural and societal norms. In many cultures, wearing a bra is considered standard for women, but that's changing, especially with movements advocating body positivity. The author's reasoning is body autonomy\u2014she doesn't feel she needs support or coverage because of her size. Her argument that her mom is disappointed she's not more conventionally feminine adds another layer, possibly indicating the mom's own biases.\n\nThe key points here are the author's right to her body choices versus her parents' expectations. The parents might be enforcing traditional gender norms, which the author is resisting. Since the author is a minor, there's a balance between parental guidance and personal freedom. However, the parents' approach seems overbearing, using punishment (not letting her leave) and emotional pressure. The author's frustration leading to her outburst is understandable given the pressure. The situation involves body image issues and autonomy, which are significant for teenagers. The author isn't harming others by not wearing a bra, especially given her small size. The parents' reactions are more about their own expectations than actual health or safety. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong; she's asserting her right to her body and rejecting unnecessary societal standards.\n"
