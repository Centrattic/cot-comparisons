Love to get some fellow ladies input on this! I'm 17, for reference. Barely A-cup. I'm plain-looking and quite tomboyish - very studious and not interested in fashion or dating at all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's the argument:\n\nMy parents believe bras are a form of underwear and that it's gross not to wear one. They often ask me if I'm wearing one (which in my mind proves it makes no difference if people can't even tell whether or not I have one), and if I say no, they won't let me leave the house. Mum often comments things like 'don't you want boys to like you?' or 'you like like a boy, you should be more feminine'. My mum feels that I do not care about my body and I'm being lazy by not wearing one. I went out without a bra once accidently (in winter, wearing 3 layers of clothing) and was yelled at and told I was ungrateful.\n\nI find bras very unnecessary and uncomfortable. A-cups are too big for me, they're awkward and bulky most of the time and I think mum's comments are really inappropriate. Nobody but her cares about my boobs. I understand that for most people it would be highly inappropriate to not wear a bra but I just don't have boobs. Bras are about support and modesty. I have nothing to support. She's right, I might as well be a boy, why is that a bad thing?\n\nI lost my temper in our most recent disagreement over it. Mum sent me a video about execerises that make your boobs look bigger. I didn't ask, I don't care, and I feel like deep down she's disappointed she gave birth to a flat-chested, tomboyish daughter rather than a gorgeous popular one. I told my mum to stop projecting her own body image insecurities onto me because I'm perfectly okay with my small bust and that it's my own damn decision what to think about my body. I feel bad for saying that because she started crying but it was in the heat of the moment and she was waaaay out of line imo. \n\nI acknowledge this who thing is quite biased but I just can't see the logic in trying to make your mosquito-bite-titted daughter feel bad and want to change the way she is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Basically, I have no boobs and don't want to wear a bra. My parents say it's gross and unladylike and get very upset at me over it, my mum in particular won't let me leave the house without one. I think it's highly inappropriate and a really silly thing to punish me over.\n\nAITA for choosing not to wear a bra at home or when I go out casually with friends?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this. The user is a 17-year-old who's barely an A-cup and finds bras unnecessary and uncomfortable. Her parents are pushing her to wear one, citing modesty and femininity. The mother is making comments about wanting her son to like her and that she's being lazy. The daughter snapped and told her mom to stop projecting her insecurities.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the cultural and social norms around wearing bras. In many societies, bras are considered part of appropriate attire, especially in public. However, the daughter argues her small size makes it unnecessary. Some people do go without bras, especially with smaller bust sizes, and in certain contexts like at home or casual outings, it might be more accepted.\n\nThe parents' argument is about modesty and social expectations. But the daughter is in her teens, an age where autonomy is developing. The mother's comments about femininity and boys liking her might be projecting her own expectations onto the daughter. The daughter's response, while heated, seems like a reaction to feeling pressured about her body, which is a valid concern.\n\nThe key points here are the daughter's comfort, her autonomy in making decisions about her body, and the parents' overreach in enforcing their views. The daughter isn't causing harm, just making a personal choice. The parents are imposing their standards without considering her perspective. So, the daughter isn't in the wrong here.\n"
