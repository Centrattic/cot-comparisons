Love to get some fellow ladies input on this! I'm 17, for reference. Barely A-cup. I'm plain-looking and quite tomboyish - very studious and not interested in fashion or dating at all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's the argument:\n\nMy parents believe bras are a form of underwear and that it's gross not to wear one. They often ask me if I'm wearing one (which in my mind proves it makes no difference if people can't even tell whether or not I have one), and if I say no, they won't let me leave the house. Mum often comments things like 'don't you want boys to like you?' or 'you like like a boy, you should be more feminine'. My mum feels that I do not care about my body and I'm being lazy by not wearing one. I went out without a bra once accidently (in winter, wearing 3 layers of clothing) and was yelled at and told I was ungrateful.\n\nI find bras very unnecessary and uncomfortable. A-cups are too big for me, they're awkward and bulky most of the time and I think mum's comments are really inappropriate. Nobody but her cares about my boobs. I understand that for most people it would be highly inappropriate to not wear a bra but I just don't have boobs. Bras are about support and modesty. I have nothing to support. She's right, I might as well be a boy, why is that a bad thing?\n\nI lost my temper in our most recent disagreement over it. Mum sent me a video about execerises that make your boobs look bigger. I didn't ask, I don't care, and I feel like deep down she's disappointed she gave birth to a flat-chested, tomboyish daughter rather than a gorgeous popular one. I told my mum to stop projecting her own body image insecurities onto me because I'm perfectly okay with my small bust and that it's my own damn decision what to think about my body. I feel bad for saying that because she started crying but it was in the heat of the moment and she was waaaay out of line imo. \n\nI acknowledge this who thing is quite biased but I just can't see the logic in trying to make your mosquito-bite-titted daughter feel bad and want to change the way she is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Basically, I have no boobs and don't want to wear a bra. My parents say it's gross and unladylike and get very upset at me over it, my mum in particular won't let me leave the house without one. I think it's highly inappropriate and a really silly thing to punish me over.\n\nAITA for choosing not to wear a bra at home or when I go out casually with friends?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this AITA question about not wearing a bra. The user is 17, has a very small bust (A-cup or less), and finds bras uncomfortable and unnecessary. Her parents, especially her mom, are upset, saying it's gross and unladylike. The mom even comments about boys liking her and being more feminine. The author thinks her mom is projecting her own insecurities and is upset about being punished for not wearing a bra.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural and societal norms. In many societies, there's an expectation for women to wear bras, especially in public. But the author is very small, so a bra might not provide any support or be necessary for modesty. The mom's comments about boys liking her and being feminine could be pushing her own ideals onto her daughter, which is a form of body shaming. \n\nThe author's discomfort with bras is valid. If the clothing she's wearing covers her adequately, maybe a bra isn't needed. However, depending on the culture or family values, the parents might see it as a necessary part of dressing modestly. But the mom is taking it to an extreme by not letting her leave the house without one and making emotional comments. \n\nThe author's response to her mom, though heated, seems to stem from feeling judged and pressured. She's defending her right to be comfortable and not conform to her mom's expectations. The mom's reaction (crying) might indicate hurt feelings, but the root issue is her imposing her views on her daughter's body.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The author is within her rights to choose what to wear on her body, especially if it's not affecting others. The parents, however, might believe they're teaching modesty or proper behavior. But the mom's approach is overbearing and could be harmful, making the author's stance more justified. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for choosing not to wear a bra when it's not necessary. The issue lies more with the parents' overreaction and pressure.\n"
