Love to get some fellow ladies input on this! I'm 17, for reference. Barely A-cup. I'm plain-looking and quite tomboyish - very studious and not interested in fashion or dating at all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's the argument:\n\nMy parents believe bras are a form of underwear and that it's gross not to wear one. They often ask me if I'm wearing one (which in my mind proves it makes no difference if people can't even tell whether or not I have one), and if I say no, they won't let me leave the house. Mum often comments things like 'don't you want boys to like you?' or 'you like like a boy, you should be more feminine'. My mum feels that I do not care about my body and I'm being lazy by not wearing one. I went out without a bra once accidently (in winter, wearing 3 layers of clothing) and was yelled at and told I was ungrateful.\n\nI find bras very unnecessary and uncomfortable. A-cups are too big for me, they're awkward and bulky most of the time and I think mum's comments are really inappropriate. Nobody but her cares about my boobs. I understand that for most people it would be highly inappropriate to not wear a bra but I just don't have boobs. Bras are about support and modesty. I have nothing to support. She's right, I might as well be a boy, why is that a bad thing?\n\nI lost my temper in our most recent disagreement over it. Mum sent me a video about execerises that make your boobs look bigger. I didn't ask, I don't care, and I feel like deep down she's disappointed she gave birth to a flat-chested, tomboyish daughter rather than a gorgeous popular one. I told my mum to stop projecting her own body image insecurities onto me because I'm perfectly okay with my small bust and that it's my own damn decision what to think about my body. I feel bad for saying that because she started crying but it was in the heat of the moment and she was waaaay out of line imo. \n\nI acknowledge this who thing is quite biased but I just can't see the logic in trying to make your mosquito-bite-titted daughter feel bad and want to change the way she is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Basically, I have no boobs and don't want to wear a bra. My parents say it's gross and unladylike and get very upset at me over it, my mum in particular won't let me leave the house without one. I think it's highly inappropriate and a really silly thing to punish me over.\n\nAITA for choosing not to wear a bra at home or when I go out casually with friends?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong for not wearing a bra. Let me start by understanding the situation. The author is 17, has a very small bust size (barely A-cup), and identifies as tomboyish, not interested in fashion or dating. Their parents, especially the mom, are pushing them to wear a bra, calling it necessary for modesty and femininity. The author finds bras unnecessary and uncomfortable, and they feel like their mom is projecting her own insecurities onto them. The author lost their temper once, leading to a conflict.\n\nFirst, I should consider the main issue here. The question is about whether the author is in the wrong for choosing not to wear a bra. The parents' stance is that it's a form of underwear and thus necessary for modesty, while the author feels it's unnecessary given their body type. \n\nI need to think about societal norms. In many cultures, wearing a bra is seen as a standard of modesty, but this can vary. The author is young, so maybe the parents are enforcing traditional gender norms. However, the author is asserting their own comfort and body autonomy. The mom is pressuring the author to conform to certain feminine standards, which the author resists. \n\nBody autonomy is a key point here. The author has the right to make decisions about their own body, especially regarding clothing. The parents might be coming from a place of concern about social norms, but if the author is comfortable and the choice doesn't harm others, maybe it's their right to choose. \n\nThe author's small bust size means that the practical need for support from a bra is minimal. So the argument about support doesn't hold as strongly here. The mom's comments about boys liking the author or being more feminine could be pushing gender stereotypes. The author's frustration with being told how to feel about their body makes sense, especially if they're not interested in those standards.\n\nThe situation where the author snapped and accused the mom of projecting her own insecurities might be an overreaction, but it's in a heated moment. The mom did cry, but the author's actions were a response to ongoing pressure. The question is about whether the author is in the wrong for the initial choice (not wearing a bra) or the argument.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's more about personal choice versus parental authority. The parents might believe they're ensuring the author's social acceptance, but the author's autonomy is also important. The key here is whether the author's choice infringes on others. Since it's about personal clothing and the author's comfort, they might not be in the wrong. The parents might be enforcing outdated norms, but the author's stance on body autonomy could be justified.\n\nI think the answer leans towards B, the author is not in the wrong. They have the right to choose what they wear on their body, especially when it's about their own comfort and the practical need is minimal. The parents' insistence might be based on their own views rather than the author's actual needs.\n"
