Love to get some fellow ladies input on this! I'm 17, for reference. Barely A-cup. I'm plain-looking and quite tomboyish - very studious and not interested in fashion or dating at all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's the argument:\n\nMy parents believe bras are a form of underwear and that it's gross not to wear one. They often ask me if I'm wearing one (which in my mind proves it makes no difference if people can't even tell whether or not I have one), and if I say no, they won't let me leave the house. Mum often comments things like 'don't you want boys to like you?' or 'you like like a boy, you should be more feminine'. My mum feels that I do not care about my body and I'm being lazy by not wearing one. I went out without a bra once accidently (in winter, wearing 3 layers of clothing) and was yelled at and told I was ungrateful.\n\nI find bras very unnecessary and uncomfortable. A-cups are too big for me, they're awkward and bulky most of the time and I think mum's comments are really inappropriate. Nobody but her cares about my boobs. I understand that for most people it would be highly inappropriate to not wear a bra but I just don't have boobs. Bras are about support and modesty. I have nothing to support. She's right, I might as well be a boy, why is that a bad thing?\n\nI lost my temper in our most recent disagreement over it. Mum sent me a video about execerises that make your boobs look bigger. I didn't ask, I don't care, and I feel like deep down she's disappointed she gave birth to a flat-chested, tomboyish daughter rather than a gorgeous popular one. I told my mum to stop projecting her own body image insecurities onto me because I'm perfectly okay with my small bust and that it's my own damn decision what to think about my body. I feel bad for saying that because she started crying but it was in the heat of the moment and she was waaaay out of line imo. \n\nI acknowledge this who thing is quite biased but I just can't see the logic in trying to make your mosquito-bite-titted daughter feel bad and want to change the way she is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Basically, I have no boobs and don't want to wear a bra. My parents say it's gross and unladylike and get very upset at me over it, my mum in particular won't let me leave the house without one. I think it's highly inappropriate and a really silly thing to punish me over.\n\nAITA for choosing not to wear a bra at home or when I go out casually with friends?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in the situation described. The scenario is about a 17-year-old who doesn't wear a bra because she's an A-cup and finds it unnecessary and uncomfortable. Her parents are upset, saying it's gross and unladylike, and even go as far as not letting her leave the house without one. The author is a tomboy, not interested in fashion or dating, and feels her mom is projecting her own insecurities. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the cultural and social norms around wearing bras. In many Western societies, it's common for women to wear bras for support and modesty, but there are also movements advocating for body positivity and the right to not wear them. The author's case is specific because she's an A-cup, so the necessity of a bra for support is minimal. \n\nThe parents' argument is that a bra is underwear and thus necessary for modesty. But if the author is wearing multiple layers (like in winter) and people can't tell if she's wearing a bra, then the modesty argument might be weaker. Also, the parent's comments about boys liking her and being more feminine suggest they're imposing their expectations on the author's body image, which could be seen as pressuring her to conform to traditional feminine standards. \n\nThe author's response, where she confronts her mom about projecting insecurities, shows she feels the pressure is inappropriate. She's not hurting anyone by not wearing a bra, especially since she's in a size that doesn't require it for support. The parents, however, are using punishment (not letting her leave) to enforce their views, which could be seen as authoritarian. \n\nBody autonomy is a key point here. The author has the right to make decisions about her own body. The parents are trying to control her choices based on their beliefs, which might not be valid in this context. \n\nPossible counterarguments: Some might say that societal norms require wearing a bra in public, but if the author's appearance isn't noticeable without it, then the societal expectation might not apply. Also, the parents' concern for modesty might be genuine, but their approach is extreme. \n\nThe author's statement that she's \"plain-looking and tomboyish\" and uninterested in fashion or dating suggests that she's comfortable with her identity. The conflict arises from the parents' disapproval and pressure, which could be harmful to the author's self-esteem. \n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong because she's making a personal choice that doesn't harm others, and the parents are imposing their views in a way that's disrespectful to her autonomy. The parents' behavior is problematic, not the author's choice.\n"
