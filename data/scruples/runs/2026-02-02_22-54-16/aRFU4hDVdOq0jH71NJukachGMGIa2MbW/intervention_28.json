Love to get some fellow ladies input on this! I'm 17, for reference. Barely A-cup. I'm plain-looking and quite tomboyish - very studious and not interested in fashion or dating at all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's the argument:\n\nMy parents believe bras are a form of underwear and that it's gross not to wear one. They often ask me if I'm wearing one (which in my mind proves it makes no difference if people can't even tell whether or not I have one), and if I say no, they won't let me leave the house. Mum often comments things like 'don't you want boys to like you?' or 'you like like a boy, you should be more feminine'. My mum feels that I do not care about my body and I'm being lazy by not wearing one. I went out without a bra once accidently (in winter, wearing 3 layers of clothing) and was yelled at and told I was ungrateful.\n\nI find bras very unnecessary and uncomfortable. A-cups are too big for me, they're awkward and bulky most of the time and I think mum's comments are really inappropriate. Nobody but her cares about my boobs. I understand that for most people it would be highly inappropriate to not wear a bra but I just don't have boobs. Bras are about support and modesty. I have nothing to support. She's right, I might as well be a boy, why is that a bad thing?\n\nI lost my temper in our most recent disagreement over it. Mum sent me a video about execerises that make your boobs look bigger. I didn't ask, I don't care, and I feel like deep down she's disappointed she gave birth to a flat-chested, tomboyish daughter rather than a gorgeous popular one. I told my mum to stop projecting her own body image insecurities onto me because I'm perfectly okay with my small bust and that it's my own damn decision what to think about my body. I feel bad for saying that because she started crying but it was in the heat of the moment and she was waaaay out of line imo. \n\nI acknowledge this who thing is quite biased but I just can't see the logic in trying to make your mosquito-bite-titted daughter feel bad and want to change the way she is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Basically, I have no boobs and don't want to wear a bra. My parents say it's gross and unladylike and get very upset at me over it, my mum in particular won't let me leave the house without one. I think it's highly inappropriate and a really silly thing to punish me over.\n\nAITA for choosing not to wear a bra at home or when I go out casually with friends?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wearing a bra. The author is 17, has a very small chest (A-cup or even smaller), and finds bras uncomfortable and unnecessary. The parents are pressuring her to wear one, using comments about boys, femininity, and even punishing her by not letting her leave the house if she doesn't comply.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rights and autonomy of the individual, especially a teenager. The author is making a personal choice about her body. Wearing a bra is a personal decision, and for someone with a very small bust, it might not be necessary for support or modesty. The parents are enforcing their own standards of femininity, which can be seen as imposing their values on the child.\n\nThe author's argument is that bras are uncomfortable and unnecessary for her. She also mentions that her mom is projecting insecurities, which adds a layer of emotional pressure. The key here is that the parents are using punishment (not letting her leave the house) over a personal choice that doesn't harm others. That seems like an overreaction.\n\nSocietal norms often dictate that women should wear bras, but personal comfort and autonomy are important. The author isn't causing harm by not wearing a bra, especially when others can't even tell. The parents' comments about boys liking her or being more feminine are also problematic, as they link self-worth to others' approval and traditional gender roles.\n\nThe author's outburst was emotional but understandable given the pressure. She's standing up for her own body image, which is a valid right. The parents might not see it that way, but their approach is controlling and could be damaging to the teen's self-esteem.\n\nSo, putting it all together: the author is making a personal choice based on her comfort and body type. The parents are overstepping by enforcing their views through punishment and emotional manipulation. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
