Love to get some fellow ladies input on this! I'm 17, for reference. Barely A-cup. I'm plain-looking and quite tomboyish - very studious and not interested in fashion or dating at all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's the argument:\n\nMy parents believe bras are a form of underwear and that it's gross not to wear one. They often ask me if I'm wearing one (which in my mind proves it makes no difference if people can't even tell whether or not I have one), and if I say no, they won't let me leave the house. Mum often comments things like 'don't you want boys to like you?' or 'you like like a boy, you should be more feminine'. My mum feels that I do not care about my body and I'm being lazy by not wearing one. I went out without a bra once accidently (in winter, wearing 3 layers of clothing) and was yelled at and told I was ungrateful.\n\nI find bras very unnecessary and uncomfortable. A-cups are too big for me, they're awkward and bulky most of the time and I think mum's comments are really inappropriate. Nobody but her cares about my boobs. I understand that for most people it would be highly inappropriate to not wear a bra but I just don't have boobs. Bras are about support and modesty. I have nothing to support. She's right, I might as well be a boy, why is that a bad thing?\n\nI lost my temper in our most recent disagreement over it. Mum sent me a video about execerises that make your boobs look bigger. I didn't ask, I don't care, and I feel like deep down she's disappointed she gave birth to a flat-chested, tomboyish daughter rather than a gorgeous popular one. I told my mum to stop projecting her own body image insecurities onto me because I'm perfectly okay with my small bust and that it's my own damn decision what to think about my body. I feel bad for saying that because she started crying but it was in the heat of the moment and she was waaaay out of line imo. \n\nI acknowledge this who thing is quite biased but I just can't see the logic in trying to make your mosquito-bite-titted daughter feel bad and want to change the way she is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Basically, I have no boobs and don't want to wear a bra. My parents say it's gross and unladylike and get very upset at me over it, my mum in particular won't let me leave the house without one. I think it's highly inappropriate and a really silly thing to punish me over.\n\nAITA for choosing not to wear a bra at home or when I go out casually with friends?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wearing a bra. The situation is that the author is 17, has a very small chest, and finds bras uncomfortable and unnecessary. The parents believe it's gross not to wear a bra and use phrases like \"don't you want boys to like you?\" and \"you should be more feminine.\" They also prevent her from leaving the house if she's not wearing one. The author got angry because her mom sent a video about exercises to make her bust look bigger, which she felt was projecting her own insecurities onto the daughter. The author is considering if she's in the wrong for not wearing a bra when going out casually with friends.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author's physical development is minimal, so the necessity of a bra for support might be questionable. Wearing a bra is often a social norm for modesty and comfort, but if the person isn't comfortable and their body doesn't require it, maybe it's a personal choice. The parents are enforcing this as a rule, even punishing her for not wearing one, which seems excessive. Their comments imply that she should be more feminine or care about boys liking her, which might be pressuring her into conforming to societal standards she doesn't agree with. \n\nThe author's response was to confront her mom about her projecting insecurities, which led to her mom crying. The user is asking if the author is at fault. In terms of right or wrong, it's a matter of personal autonomy versus parental authority. The author is making a choice based on her comfort and body, while the parents are pushing their own views. Since the author's choice doesn't harm others and is about her own body, I think she's justified. However, the way she responded (shouting during an argument) might be seen as wrong in terms of her behavior, but the underlying issue of wearing a bra is more about personal choice. The parents are being unreasonable by equating not wearing a bra with being ungrateful or not feminine, especially when the daughter's reasoning is valid. So the answer would likely be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
