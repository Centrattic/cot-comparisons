Love to get some fellow ladies input on this! I'm 17, for reference. Barely A-cup. I'm plain-looking and quite tomboyish - very studious and not interested in fashion or dating at all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's the argument:\n\nMy parents believe bras are a form of underwear and that it's gross not to wear one. They often ask me if I'm wearing one (which in my mind proves it makes no difference if people can't even tell whether or not I have one), and if I say no, they won't let me leave the house. Mum often comments things like 'don't you want boys to like you?' or 'you like like a boy, you should be more feminine'. My mum feels that I do not care about my body and I'm being lazy by not wearing one. I went out without a bra once accidently (in winter, wearing 3 layers of clothing) and was yelled at and told I was ungrateful.\n\nI find bras very unnecessary and uncomfortable. A-cups are too big for me, they're awkward and bulky most of the time and I think mum's comments are really inappropriate. Nobody but her cares about my boobs. I understand that for most people it would be highly inappropriate to not wear a bra but I just don't have boobs. Bras are about support and modesty. I have nothing to support. She's right, I might as well be a boy, why is that a bad thing?\n\nI lost my temper in our most recent disagreement over it. Mum sent me a video about execerises that make your boobs look bigger. I didn't ask, I don't care, and I feel like deep down she's disappointed she gave birth to a flat-chested, tomboyish daughter rather than a gorgeous popular one. I told my mum to stop projecting her own body image insecurities onto me because I'm perfectly okay with my small bust and that it's my own damn decision what to think about my body. I feel bad for saying that because she started crying but it was in the heat of the moment and she was waaaay out of line imo. \n\nI acknowledge this who thing is quite biased but I just can't see the logic in trying to make your mosquito-bite-titted daughter feel bad and want to change the way she is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Basically, I have no boobs and don't want to wear a bra. My parents say it's gross and unladylike and get very upset at me over it, my mum in particular won't let me leave the house without one. I think it's highly inappropriate and a really silly thing to punish me over.\n\nAITA for choosing not to wear a bra at home or when I go out casually with friends?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person in the situation is in the wrong for not wearing a bra. The scenario is about a 17-year-old girl who's an A-cup, tomboyish, and her parents are pressuring her to wear a bra. The parents think it's gross and unladylike, and they even punish her when she doesn't. The girl finds bras uncomfortable and unnecessary, and she's pushing back against her mom's comments about wanting her to be more feminine or like a boy. She also accused her mom of projecting her own insecurities.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is in the wrong. The question is whether her choice not to wear a bra is the issue here. From what I read, the parents are enforcing a rule that seems based on their own ideas about modesty and femininity. The girl argues that since she's an A-cup, there's no need for support, and she's comfortable not wearing one. \n\nIn terms of societal norms, there's been a shift in recent years where not wearing a bra is becoming more accepted, especially in casual settings. However, there's also the aspect of personal autonomy and individual choice. The parents are trying to control her clothing choices, which might be overstepping, especially if there's no health or safety concern. The girl's discomfort with bras is valid, and if her parents are using punishment (not letting her leave the house) to enforce this, that's a red flag. \n\nThe mom's comments about boys liking her and being more feminine might be trying to impose her own expectations. The daughter's response about her mom's insecurities is a strong reaction, but it's in the heat of the moment. The key points here are the parents' enforcement of a rule without valid reason and the daughter's right to make her own decisions about her body. \n\nConsidering all that, I think the author isn't in the wrong. The parents are imposing their views without considering her comfort or autonomy. So the answer should be B.\n"
