Love to get some fellow ladies input on this! I'm 17, for reference. Barely A-cup. I'm plain-looking and quite tomboyish - very studious and not interested in fashion or dating at all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's the argument:\n\nMy parents believe bras are a form of underwear and that it's gross not to wear one. They often ask me if I'm wearing one (which in my mind proves it makes no difference if people can't even tell whether or not I have one), and if I say no, they won't let me leave the house. Mum often comments things like 'don't you want boys to like you?' or 'you like like a boy, you should be more feminine'. My mum feels that I do not care about my body and I'm being lazy by not wearing one. I went out without a bra once accidently (in winter, wearing 3 layers of clothing) and was yelled at and told I was ungrateful.\n\nI find bras very unnecessary and uncomfortable. A-cups are too big for me, they're awkward and bulky most of the time and I think mum's comments are really inappropriate. Nobody but her cares about my boobs. I understand that for most people it would be highly inappropriate to not wear a bra but I just don't have boobs. Bras are about support and modesty. I have nothing to support. She's right, I might as well be a boy, why is that a bad thing?\n\nI lost my temper in our most recent disagreement over it. Mum sent me a video about execerises that make your boobs look bigger. I didn't ask, I don't care, and I feel like deep down she's disappointed she gave birth to a flat-chested, tomboyish daughter rather than a gorgeous popular one. I told my mum to stop projecting her own body image insecurities onto me because I'm perfectly okay with my small bust and that it's my own damn decision what to think about my body. I feel bad for saying that because she started crying but it was in the heat of the moment and she was waaaay out of line imo. \n\nI acknowledge this who thing is quite biased but I just can't see the logic in trying to make your mosquito-bite-titted daughter feel bad and want to change the way she is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Basically, I have no boobs and don't want to wear a bra. My parents say it's gross and unladylike and get very upset at me over it, my mum in particular won't let me leave the house without one. I think it's highly inappropriate and a really silly thing to punish me over.\n\nAITA for choosing not to wear a bra at home or when I go out casually with friends?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a 17-year-old girl who's barely an A-cup and doesn't want to wear a bra. Her parents think it's necessary for modesty and femininity, while she finds bras uncomfortable and unnecessary. \n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural norms. In many Western societies, wearing a bra is considered standard for women, especially in public. But the author is very small-busted, so maybe the bra isn't necessary for support. The parent's argument is about modesty and societal expectations, but if there's almost nothing there, is it really a modesty issue? The author argues that no one else cares, which makes sense.\n\nThe parents are being strict, not letting her leave the house without a bra, and making comments about wanting boys to like her. That seems like they're projecting their own ideals onto her. The mother's comment about her being disappointed she doesn't have a more feminine daughter is problematic. The author's response was defensive, which is understandable given the pressure.\n\nThe key points are bodily autonomy and parental control. At 17, she's almost an adult, but parents do have a role in guiding their children. However, forcing her to wear a bra for no practical reason (since she's an A-cup) might be infringing on her choices. The author isn't harming anyone by not wearing a bra, and the parents' reactions are causing emotional distress.\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong because she's making a personal choice about her body. The parents, on the other hand, are using emotional manipulation and setting unreasonable boundaries. The author's response, while harsh, was a result of being pushed to her limit. So the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
