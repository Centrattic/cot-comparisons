I want to make clear that I haven't decided anything yet. I'm just considering all options.\n\nAbout 2 weeks ago me and my girlfriend found out that she's infertile. We had been trying for a baby for almost a year, and we got a bit worried. So we decided to check the both of us, and it turns out that she is infertile. There's not much more to it, but they are 100% sure. We've been together for little over 5 years. I'm 24 and she's 2 years older, and we thought that the time was right. \n\nObviously we are devastated by the news, and I understand that it's an even bigger blow for my girlfriend. I've been there for her and we support each other, and I think that we're at least dealing with it. \n\nShe has already suggested adoption or a surrogate. I told her that was good idea and left it at that. The thing is, I don't want to adopt a kid. I also don't want a surrogate. I want to have my own kids, with my own woman (I don't know how to phrase this but you get what I mean). I get how this sounds really selfish. But it's how I think, I can't change that. I don't think I would be capable of adopting a kid. It's just not me. Is it weird that I want the woman I'm with to carry our child? I don't think it is. I want it to be our kid. But I know I'm not thinking straight right now. \n\nI want kids. I want them with my girlfriend. She was about to be my fiancee. But we can't. I've been seriously thinking of breaking things off. I love her with all my heart, she IS the love of my life. I wouldn't want to put her through a break up after this news, I know she needs me. But I can't shake this feeling. I understand that many might not understand my thought process here. I don't know what to tell you. Would I be the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong if they break up with their girlfriend after finding out she's infertile. The author is 24, in a 5-year relationship, and they wanted to have children. They found out she's infertile, and he doesn't want adoption or surrogacy. He's considering breaking up because he can't imagine having kids any other way.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The key points are: they were trying for a baby, the discovery of infertility, and the author's stance against adoption or surrogacy. He loves her but feels he can't go through life without his own biological kids. The question is whether this makes him an asshole.\n\nOn one hand, he's being honest about his values and what he wants. It's important for people to be truthful about their desires in a relationship. If having biological children is a non-negotiable for him, then he's not wrong for realizing that the relationship might not work. He's supporting her emotionally, so that's a positive aspect.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that his priority is self-centered. Infertility is a significant issue, and his reaction could be seen as not fully considering her feelings. However, he's also in a tough spot because he values having children and feels that adoption isn't for him. There's also the timing\u2014breaking up right after such news could be seen as insensitive, but if he's giving her space and time, maybe it's not.\n\nAnother angle is that the decision to break up is his right, as long as it's communicated respectfully. People have different values, and if his values conflict with the relationship's future, it's not necessarily wrong to part ways. However, there's a risk of appearing selfish if he doesn't explore alternatives or if he isn't fully committed to supporting her through other options.\n\nI should also consider cultural or societal norms. Some might view his stance as outdated, but others might see it as a personal choice. The key is whether he's acting with empathy and respect. The author mentions he's been there for her, which shows he's trying to be supportive.\n\nUltimately, the answer hinges on whether it's reasonable for someone to end a long-term relationship based on their inability to accept alternative paths to parenthood. Since everyone's values differ, and as long as he's acting with the intention to be honest and not manipulative, he might not be in the wrong. But some might argue that his desire for biological children is overshadowing his commitment to her. However, given the information, the author is in a difficult position and making a decision based on his own values, which isn't inherently wrong.\n"
