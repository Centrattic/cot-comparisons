I want to make clear that I haven't decided anything yet. I'm just considering all options.\n\nAbout 2 weeks ago me and my girlfriend found out that she's infertile. We had been trying for a baby for almost a year, and we got a bit worried. So we decided to check the both of us, and it turns out that she is infertile. There's not much more to it, but they are 100% sure. We've been together for little over 5 years. I'm 24 and she's 2 years older, and we thought that the time was right. \n\nObviously we are devastated by the news, and I understand that it's an even bigger blow for my girlfriend. I've been there for her and we support each other, and I think that we're at least dealing with it. \n\nShe has already suggested adoption or a surrogate. I told her that was good idea and left it at that. The thing is, I don't want to adopt a kid. I also don't want a surrogate. I want to have my own kids, with my own woman (I don't know how to phrase this but you get what I mean). I get how this sounds really selfish. But it's how I think, I can't change that. I don't think I would be capable of adopting a kid. It's just not me. Is it weird that I want the woman I'm with to carry our child? I don't think it is. I want it to be our kid. But I know I'm not thinking straight right now. \n\nI want kids. I want them with my girlfriend. She was about to be my fiancee. But we can't. I've been seriously thinking of breaking things off. I love her with all my heart, she IS the love of my life. I wouldn't want to put her through a break up after this news, I know she needs me. But I can't shake this feeling. I understand that many might not understand my thought process here. I don't know what to tell you. Would I be the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is that they found out their girlfriend is infertile and are considering breaking up because they don't want adoption or surrogacy.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The couple has been together for over five years, and they were planning to get married. They wanted to have kids, but it's not possible through natural means. The author is struggling with the idea of adoption or surrogacy, which the girlfriend suggested. He feels it's not right for him and is considering breaking up because he wants to have a biological child with his partner.\n\nNow, the key points here are about expectations and communication. The author states that he doesn't want adoption or surrogacy because he wants a child that's biologically his and his partner's. But the partner is infertile, so that's not possible. The question is whether he's in the wrong for considering ending the relationship over this.\n\nI should think about whether it's reasonable for him to have this expectation. Some people place a high value on biological children, so it's not unheard of. However, the girlfriend is already offering alternatives, which he dismisses without much discussion. Maybe he hasn't fully explored these options with her, or maybe they didn't align on their priorities beforehand.\n\nAlso, the emotional aspect is important. The girlfriend is going through a tough time, and breaking up might add more emotional pain. The author mentions he loves her but feels conflicted. It's possible that this decision is influenced by his own insecurities or unspoken expectations that weren't discussed before the infertility was discovered.\n\nAnother angle: Did they discuss their views on having children and alternative methods before this test? If they had already talked about wanting biological kids and didn't consider adoption or surrogacy, then this might be a valid reason. But if they hadn't, and the author is now realizing he doesn't want alternatives after the fact, it might be seen as selfish or not having done enough to work through the problem.\n\nAlso, is wanting a biological child a deal-breaker? That's subjective. Some might argue that love and commitment can overcome such issues, while others might see it as a fundamental part of their life goals.\n\nIn terms of wrongness, the author isn't doing something illegal or harmful beyond the emotional impact. But ending a long-term relationship over this could be seen as not being fully committed to working through challenges. However, if his values are non-negotiable, then it's not his fault for not wanting to compromise.\n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the author considered all options and communicated effectively. Since he hasn't decided yet and is seeking advice, maybe he's not in the wrong if his feelings are genuine. But some might say that not being open to alternatives (even if they're not his first choice) makes him the asshole because he's prioritizing his own desires over the relationship.\n"
