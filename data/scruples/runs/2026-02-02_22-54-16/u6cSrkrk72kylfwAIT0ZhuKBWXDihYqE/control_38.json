I want to make clear that I haven't decided anything yet. I'm just considering all options.\n\nAbout 2 weeks ago me and my girlfriend found out that she's infertile. We had been trying for a baby for almost a year, and we got a bit worried. So we decided to check the both of us, and it turns out that she is infertile. There's not much more to it, but they are 100% sure. We've been together for little over 5 years. I'm 24 and she's 2 years older, and we thought that the time was right. \n\nObviously we are devastated by the news, and I understand that it's an even bigger blow for my girlfriend. I've been there for her and we support each other, and I think that we're at least dealing with it. \n\nShe has already suggested adoption or a surrogate. I told her that was good idea and left it at that. The thing is, I don't want to adopt a kid. I also don't want a surrogate. I want to have my own kids, with my own woman (I don't know how to phrase this but you get what I mean). I get how this sounds really selfish. But it's how I think, I can't change that. I don't think I would be capable of adopting a kid. It's just not me. Is it weird that I want the woman I'm with to carry our child? I don't think it is. I want it to be our kid. But I know I'm not thinking straight right now. \n\nI want kids. I want them with my girlfriend. She was about to be my fiancee. But we can't. I've been seriously thinking of breaking things off. I love her with all my heart, she IS the love of my life. I wouldn't want to put her through a break up after this news, I know she needs me. But I can't shake this feeling. I understand that many might not understand my thought process here. I don't know what to tell you. Would I be the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking whether the author of the WIBTA (Would I Be The Asshole?) post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author is considering breaking up with his girlfriend after finding out she's infertile. He wants biological kids and isn't open to adoption or surrogacy. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points here. The couple has been together for over five years, and they were planning to start a family. The girlfriend is infertile, and the author is struggling with not being able to have biological children with her. He's contemplating a breakup because he can't accept alternatives like adoption or surrogacy, even though he acknowledges this might seem selfish.\n\nNow, I should consider the ethical and emotional angles. The author loves his girlfriend deeply but feels that having a biological child is essential for him. The girlfriend, on the other hand, has already suggested adoption or a surrogate, which shows she's trying to find solutions. The author is conflicted because he doesn't want to break her heart but also can't compromise on his own needs.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, is it wrong to prioritize one's own desire for biological children over the relationship? Relationships require mutual compromise. If the author is unwilling to consider the options she's presented, that could be seen as not being supportive of her, especially during a difficult time. However, his feelings about wanting a biological child are valid, and he's not making a decision yet. \n\nAlso, the emotional impact on the girlfriend is significant. She's already dealing with the fertility issue and now faces the possibility of her partner leaving. That's a heavy burden. The author is trying to be supportive, but his inability to consider alternatives might be hurtful. \n\nAnother angle: does the author have a right to expect a biological child from his partner? In many relationships, having children is a shared goal, but when circumstances change, flexibility is needed. The author's stance could be seen as inflexible, but it's also about his personal values. \n\nHowever, the key here is whether he's in the wrong. Breaking up because of infertility might be seen as prioritizing his own desires over the relationship. The girlfriend might feel that after five years and facing fertility issues together, he's not willing to adjust his expectations. That could be a point against him. \n\nBut he's also being honest about his feelings. If he were to stay, he might resent her later for not being able to have a biological child. It's a tough situation where both parties have valid feelings. \n\nIn the end, whether he's in the wrong depends on societal or moral standards. Some might argue that he's being selfish and not considering her feelings, while others might see it as a personal choice. However, given that relationships require compromise and he's not willing to consider the options she's already suggested, many might side with him being in the wrong because he's not meeting her halfway. \n\nSo, the answer is likely A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
