I want to make clear that I haven't decided anything yet. I'm just considering all options.\n\nAbout 2 weeks ago me and my girlfriend found out that she's infertile. We had been trying for a baby for almost a year, and we got a bit worried. So we decided to check the both of us, and it turns out that she is infertile. There's not much more to it, but they are 100% sure. We've been together for little over 5 years. I'm 24 and she's 2 years older, and we thought that the time was right. \n\nObviously we are devastated by the news, and I understand that it's an even bigger blow for my girlfriend. I've been there for her and we support each other, and I think that we're at least dealing with it. \n\nShe has already suggested adoption or a surrogate. I told her that was good idea and left it at that. The thing is, I don't want to adopt a kid. I also don't want a surrogate. I want to have my own kids, with my own woman (I don't know how to phrase this but you get what I mean). I get how this sounds really selfish. But it's how I think, I can't change that. I don't think I would be capable of adopting a kid. It's just not me. Is it weird that I want the woman I'm with to carry our child? I don't think it is. I want it to be our kid. But I know I'm not thinking straight right now. \n\nI want kids. I want them with my girlfriend. She was about to be my fiancee. But we can't. I've been seriously thinking of breaking things off. I love her with all my heart, she IS the love of my life. I wouldn't want to put her through a break up after this news, I know she needs me. But I can't shake this feeling. I understand that many might not understand my thought process here. I don't know what to tell you. Would I be the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the WIBTA (Would I Be Terrible for...) post is in the wrong. The situation is that the couple found out the girlfriend is infertile, and the author is considering breaking up because he doesn't want to consider adoption or surrogacy. He wants to have biological children with her, but she can't, so he's conflicted.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The key points here are the author's feelings about not wanting to adopt or use a surrogate, and his desire to have biological children. The girlfriend suggested alternatives, but he's not open to them. The question is whether his decision to break up is justified or if he's in the wrong.\n\nI should consider the ethical implications. Infertility can be a huge emotional challenge for both partners. The author admits he feels selfish for not considering adoption or surrogacy, which shows he's aware of the ethical dilemma. The girlfriend is already suggesting alternatives, so she's trying to find solutions. If the author is breaking up because of his inability to accept alternatives, does that make him the asshole?\n\nOn one hand, he loves her and supports her emotionally. He's not immediately breaking up but is considering it, acknowledging that she needs him right now. On the other hand, his refusal to consider adoption or surrogacy might be seen as prioritizing his own desires over her feelings and the relationship. However, he's also honest about his limitations and preferences.\n\nIn relationships, dealing with infertility can test a couple's commitment. If both partners can't find a solution that works for them, it's a valid reason to consider parting ways. But the author is in a tough spot because he's not being completely honest about his stance yet. He hasn't communicated his unwillingness to adopt or use a surrogate clearly to his girlfriend. The post is about considering options, but the actual decision might depend on how they communicate.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? If he's breaking up due to a personal preference that he hasn't fully discussed with her, maybe he's being selfish. However, if they've already had discussions and he's clear about his stance, then it's a mutual decision. Since the post says he hasn't decided yet and is still considering, it's possible that he's trying to process his feelings. The question is whether his reasoning is valid. Some people might argue that not wanting to adopt or use a surrogate is personal but not inherently wrong, while others might see it as inconsiderate.\n\nThe key here is the lack of communication mentioned. He hasn't told her his true feelings yet. If he breaks up without having that conversation, it might be seen as inconsiderate. But if he's processing it and planning to be honest, then it's part of his decision-making. The answer might depend on cultural or personal values. In some views, having biological children is a priority, and the author isn't wrong for that. Others might argue that adoption is a valid path and his refusal is self-centered.\n\nOverall, the author is in a tough situation. His feelings are genuine, but breaking up over this without fully discussing it with his girlfriend could be seen as harsh. However, if he's being honest about his limitations and they can't find a middle ground, it's a valid reason to part ways. The answer isn't straightforward, but given the scenario, he might not be in the wrong, but it's a close call.\n"
