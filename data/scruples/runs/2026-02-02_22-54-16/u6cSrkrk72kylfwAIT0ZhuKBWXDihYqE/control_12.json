I want to make clear that I haven't decided anything yet. I'm just considering all options.\n\nAbout 2 weeks ago me and my girlfriend found out that she's infertile. We had been trying for a baby for almost a year, and we got a bit worried. So we decided to check the both of us, and it turns out that she is infertile. There's not much more to it, but they are 100% sure. We've been together for little over 5 years. I'm 24 and she's 2 years older, and we thought that the time was right. \n\nObviously we are devastated by the news, and I understand that it's an even bigger blow for my girlfriend. I've been there for her and we support each other, and I think that we're at least dealing with it. \n\nShe has already suggested adoption or a surrogate. I told her that was good idea and left it at that. The thing is, I don't want to adopt a kid. I also don't want a surrogate. I want to have my own kids, with my own woman (I don't know how to phrase this but you get what I mean). I get how this sounds really selfish. But it's how I think, I can't change that. I don't think I would be capable of adopting a kid. It's just not me. Is it weird that I want the woman I'm with to carry our child? I don't think it is. I want it to be our kid. But I know I'm not thinking straight right now. \n\nI want kids. I want them with my girlfriend. She was about to be my fiancee. But we can't. I've been seriously thinking of breaking things off. I love her with all my heart, she IS the love of my life. I wouldn't want to put her through a break up after this news, I know she needs me. But I can't shake this feeling. I understand that many might not understand my thought process here. I don't know what to tell you. Would I be the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who posted this situation is in the wrong. The scenario is that they found out their girlfriend is infertile, and they're considering breaking up because they don't want adoption or a surrogate. They love her but can't get past the desire for biological children. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The couple has been together for five years and had been planning to get married. They tried for a baby for a year and decided to check, leading to the infertility diagnosis. The question is about whether breaking up over this is wrong.\n\nThe author mentions that their girlfriend suggested adoption or surrogacy, but the author doesn't want that. They feel it's selfish but can't help their feelings. They love her but can't imagine having non-biological kids. The dilemma is between staying in a relationship without children or breaking up.\n\nI should think about the ethics here. Is it wrong to prioritize biological children over the relationship? Every person's values are different. Some people might prioritize having biological kids, others might not. But the key point is whether the author is being inconsiderate or breaking a commitment. \n\nThe author hasn't made a decision yet, just considering. They also acknowledge it's a tough situation. The girlfriend is clearly affected, and breaking up might hurt her more. However, the author is also feeling conflicted. \n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, if the relationship's foundation was built on having children together, and one partner can't adjust, maybe that's a valid reason. But others might argue that it's unfair to end the relationship because of something beyond their control. The author might be seen as prioritizing their own desires over the relationship, which could be seen as selfish. \n\nHowever, people do have the right to their own values. If the author can't reconcile their desire for biological children, it's a legitimate reason to consider a breakup. It's a matter of personal choice and values. \n\nBut the question is whether they are in the wrong. If the relationship was about being together regardless of having kids, then maybe the author is wrong. But if having kids was a shared goal, then maybe they're justified. The post doesn't say if the author discussed their feelings about adoption and surrogacy with their girlfriend. If they didn't communicate their stance, that could be an issue. The author says they told her it was a good idea but left it at that. Maybe they didn't fully discuss their feelings, leading to the conflict. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be that the author is in the wrong because they're ending the relationship based on a personal preference without considering the emotional impact and alternatives. But others might see it as a valid decision based on their own values. It's a tough call. The key is whether it's selfish or a personal choice. The answer depends on societal norms and whether prioritizing biological children is seen as acceptable or not.\n"
