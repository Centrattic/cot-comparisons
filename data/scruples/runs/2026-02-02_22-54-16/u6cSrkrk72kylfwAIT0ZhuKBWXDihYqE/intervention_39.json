I want to make clear that I haven't decided anything yet. I'm just considering all options.\n\nAbout 2 weeks ago me and my girlfriend found out that she's infertile. We had been trying for a baby for almost a year, and we got a bit worried. So we decided to check the both of us, and it turns out that she is infertile. There's not much more to it, but they are 100% sure. We've been together for little over 5 years. I'm 24 and she's 2 years older, and we thought that the time was right. \n\nObviously we are devastated by the news, and I understand that it's an even bigger blow for my girlfriend. I've been there for her and we support each other, and I think that we're at least dealing with it. \n\nShe has already suggested adoption or a surrogate. I told her that was good idea and left it at that. The thing is, I don't want to adopt a kid. I also don't want a surrogate. I want to have my own kids, with my own woman (I don't know how to phrase this but you get what I mean). I get how this sounds really selfish. But it's how I think, I can't change that. I don't think I would be capable of adopting a kid. It's just not me. Is it weird that I want the woman I'm with to carry our child? I don't think it is. I want it to be our kid. But I know I'm not thinking straight right now. \n\nI want kids. I want them with my girlfriend. She was about to be my fiancee. But we can't. I've been seriously thinking of breaking things off. I love her with all my heart, she IS the love of my life. I wouldn't want to put her through a break up after this news, I know she needs me. But I can't shake this feeling. I understand that many might not understand my thought process here. I don't know what to tell you. Would I be the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for considering breaking up with his girlfriend after learning she's infertile. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The couple has been together five years, trying to have a child. They found out she's infertile, and while he supports her, he's considering breaking up because he doesn't want to adopt or use a surrogate. He loves her but feels he wants his own biological child. The question is whether he's the asshole here.\n\nHmm, the key points here are about personal values and expectations in a relationship. He's honest about his feelings and thoughts, which is important. He's not making her feel guilty, just considering his options. But is it selfish to want a biological child with his partner? Some might say it's valid for him to want that, especially if he's clear from the start. Others might argue that his decision is based on a personal preference that's not the girlfriend's fault.\n\nInfertility can be a significant issue for some people. The man's reaction is a natural consequence of not being able to have biological kids. However, the girlfriend is taking it harder, and breaking up might add to her emotional burden. But if he truly can't consider alternatives like adoption, maybe it's better to part ways than be in a relationship that's not fulfilling for both.\n\nThe question is whether his stance is wrong. The author of the scenario is introspective, acknowledging his possible selfishness but sticking to his feelings. In terms of ethics, relationships require mutual understanding. If both partners have clear expectations and they don't align, it's not necessarily wrong to end the relationship. However, the timing and sensitivity matter here. The girlfriend is already dealing with a major life change, so breaking up soon after could be seen as insensitive.\n\nBut if he's honest and they've discussed it, maybe it's better for both in the long run. The answer might depend on cultural norms too. In some views, wanting biological children is a deal-breaker, while others prioritize the relationship over that. The author isn't forcing her into adoption; he's just stating his personal limits. So, is he wrong? It's a tough call. He's not lying or manipulating, just being true to his desires. But the emotional impact on her is significant. The answer could be either way, but I need to consider if his actions are ethically wrong or if it's a personal choice he's entitled to make.\n"
