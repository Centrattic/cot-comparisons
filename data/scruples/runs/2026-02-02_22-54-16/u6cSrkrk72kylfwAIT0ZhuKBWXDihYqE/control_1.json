I want to make clear that I haven't decided anything yet. I'm just considering all options.\n\nAbout 2 weeks ago me and my girlfriend found out that she's infertile. We had been trying for a baby for almost a year, and we got a bit worried. So we decided to check the both of us, and it turns out that she is infertile. There's not much more to it, but they are 100% sure. We've been together for little over 5 years. I'm 24 and she's 2 years older, and we thought that the time was right. \n\nObviously we are devastated by the news, and I understand that it's an even bigger blow for my girlfriend. I've been there for her and we support each other, and I think that we're at least dealing with it. \n\nShe has already suggested adoption or a surrogate. I told her that was good idea and left it at that. The thing is, I don't want to adopt a kid. I also don't want a surrogate. I want to have my own kids, with my own woman (I don't know how to phrase this but you get what I mean). I get how this sounds really selfish. But it's how I think, I can't change that. I don't think I would be capable of adopting a kid. It's just not me. Is it weird that I want the woman I'm with to carry our child? I don't think it is. I want it to be our kid. But I know I'm not thinking straight right now. \n\nI want kids. I want them with my girlfriend. She was about to be my fiancee. But we can't. I've been seriously thinking of breaking things off. I love her with all my heart, she IS the love of my life. I wouldn't want to put her through a break up after this news, I know she needs me. But I can't shake this feeling. I understand that many might not understand my thought process here. I don't know what to tell you. Would I be the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by understanding the situation. The person is considering breaking up with their girlfriend after finding out she's infertile. They mention that they want to have their own biological kids and don't want adoption or surrogacy. They love her but feel conflicted about moving forward.\n\nFirst, I should consider the context. The couple has been together for over five years, and they were planning to get married. They tried for a baby for a year before seeking medical advice. The girlfriend suggested alternatives like adoption or surrogacy, but the author isn't open to those options. The key issue here is the author's stance on biological children versus the girlfriend's willingness to consider other options.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let me think about the ethical aspects. Relationships require mutual understanding and compromise. If one partner values biological children to the point of leaving the relationship, while the other is willing to adapt, there's a significant conflict. The author is prioritizing their desire for biological children over the existing relationship, which has been a major part of their life.\n\nBut wait, the author also mentions feeling selfish and not sure if they're thinking straight. They love their girlfriend deeply but can't see past the infertility. Is it fair to end the relationship solely because of something beyond their control? The girlfriend is already dealing with the emotional impact of the diagnosis. Ending things might be seen as adding to her stress, especially when she had already offered solutions like adoption or surrogacy.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might feel that their own needs are also important. If they truly cannot accept adoption or surrogacy, then maybe they believe they can't fulfill their life goals with this partner. However, relationships often require compromise. If the author's stance is non-negotiable, maybe they are in the wrong for not considering the alternatives the girlfriend suggested. But they also have their own values and desires.\n\nAnother angle: the author hasn't made a decision yet and is seeking advice. They are struggling with the decision, which shows they are aware of the seriousness of the situation. However, the fact that they are considering breaking up over something that wasn't their fault (since infertility can be a medical condition) might make some people view them as the one at fault, especially if they don't consider the emotional impact on their girlfriend.\n\nBut it's also important to remember that both partners have their own valid feelings. The author might feel that their dream of having a biological child is a core part of their identity. However, ending the relationship because of infertility could be seen as using a medical condition as a reason to leave, which might be considered selfish, especially if the other partner is willing to adapt.\n\nIn many cases, people have different values, and it's possible that this is a deal-breaker for the author. But the way they approach the situation matters. If they are being honest and considering their feelings, but not making a rushed decision, maybe it's not entirely their fault. However, the act of breaking up over this could be seen as wrong because it's not the girlfriend's fault, and she's already under stress.\n\nI think the key here is whether the author is being reasonable in their stance. If they can't consider adoption or surrogacy, which are viable alternatives for many couples, they might be prioritizing their own biological needs over the relationship. That could be seen as the wrong approach, especially if the girlfriend is open to other options. The author's refusal to consider those alternatives might make them the one in the wrong, as they're not meeting the other person halfway.\n"
