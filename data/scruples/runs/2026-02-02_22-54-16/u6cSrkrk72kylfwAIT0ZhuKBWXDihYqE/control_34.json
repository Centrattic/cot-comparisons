I want to make clear that I haven't decided anything yet. I'm just considering all options.\n\nAbout 2 weeks ago me and my girlfriend found out that she's infertile. We had been trying for a baby for almost a year, and we got a bit worried. So we decided to check the both of us, and it turns out that she is infertile. There's not much more to it, but they are 100% sure. We've been together for little over 5 years. I'm 24 and she's 2 years older, and we thought that the time was right. \n\nObviously we are devastated by the news, and I understand that it's an even bigger blow for my girlfriend. I've been there for her and we support each other, and I think that we're at least dealing with it. \n\nShe has already suggested adoption or a surrogate. I told her that was good idea and left it at that. The thing is, I don't want to adopt a kid. I also don't want a surrogate. I want to have my own kids, with my own woman (I don't know how to phrase this but you get what I mean). I get how this sounds really selfish. But it's how I think, I can't change that. I don't think I would be capable of adopting a kid. It's just not me. Is it weird that I want the woman I'm with to carry our child? I don't think it is. I want it to be our kid. But I know I'm not thinking straight right now. \n\nI want kids. I want them with my girlfriend. She was about to be my fiancee. But we can't. I've been seriously thinking of breaking things off. I love her with all my heart, she IS the love of my life. I wouldn't want to put her through a break up after this news, I know she needs me. But I can't shake this feeling. I understand that many might not understand my thought process here. I don't know what to tell you. Would I be the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Would I Be The Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author is considering breaking up with his girlfriend after finding out she's infertile. He wants biological children, and he doesn't want to adopt or use a surrogate. The question is whether he's the asshole for considering breaking up over this.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the context. The couple has been together for over five years, and they were planning to get married. They tried for a baby for a year, leading to fertility tests. The girlfriend suggested adoption or surrogacy, but the author isn't open to those options. He's conflicted because he loves her but wants biological children. He's considering breaking up to avoid making her go through the process without that possibility.\n\nNow, to determine if he's in the wrong. The key points here are the importance of communication and mutual understanding in a relationship. The author states that he hasn't made a decision yet but is considering it. The girlfriend is clearly hurt, and the author is aware that his stance might seem selfish. However, personal values and desires regarding having biological children are valid for some people.\n\nBut there's a potential issue here. By not being open to alternatives she's suggesting, he's prioritizing his own desires over her willingness to find other solutions. Relationships require compromise. If the girlfriend is open to adoption or surrogacy, and the author isn't, that's a significant difference. The author might be dismissing her feelings and the effort she's making to adapt. Breaking up over this could be seen as prioritizing his need for biological children over their long-term relationship and her feelings.\n\nAlso, the emotional impact is a factor. The girlfriend is already devastated, and breaking up on top of that could be seen as cruel, even if he's not the one at fault for the infertility. The author is struggling with whether he's selfish, which is a valid self-reflection.\n\nIn conclusion, while wanting biological children isn't inherently wrong, the way the author is approaching the situation\u2014without considering the alternatives his partner is willing to explore\u2014could be seen as inconsiderate. Relationships require both parties to meet in the middle. Since the girlfriend is open to other options and he isn't, he might be the one not compromising, which places the blame on him. Therefore, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
