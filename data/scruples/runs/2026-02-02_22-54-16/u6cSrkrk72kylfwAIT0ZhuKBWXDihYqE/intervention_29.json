I want to make clear that I haven't decided anything yet. I'm just considering all options.\n\nAbout 2 weeks ago me and my girlfriend found out that she's infertile. We had been trying for a baby for almost a year, and we got a bit worried. So we decided to check the both of us, and it turns out that she is infertile. There's not much more to it, but they are 100% sure. We've been together for little over 5 years. I'm 24 and she's 2 years older, and we thought that the time was right. \n\nObviously we are devastated by the news, and I understand that it's an even bigger blow for my girlfriend. I've been there for her and we support each other, and I think that we're at least dealing with it. \n\nShe has already suggested adoption or a surrogate. I told her that was good idea and left it at that. The thing is, I don't want to adopt a kid. I also don't want a surrogate. I want to have my own kids, with my own woman (I don't know how to phrase this but you get what I mean). I get how this sounds really selfish. But it's how I think, I can't change that. I don't think I would be capable of adopting a kid. It's just not me. Is it weird that I want the woman I'm with to carry our child? I don't think it is. I want it to be our kid. But I know I'm not thinking straight right now. \n\nI want kids. I want them with my girlfriend. She was about to be my fiancee. But we can't. I've been seriously thinking of breaking things off. I love her with all my heart, she IS the love of my life. I wouldn't want to put her through a break up after this news, I know she needs me. But I can't shake this feeling. I understand that many might not understand my thought process here. I don't know what to tell you. Would I be the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the WIBTA (Would I Be Terrible for...) post is in the wrong after considering breaking up with his girlfriend due to her infertility. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The couple has been together for over five years, they wanted kids, found out she's infertile. The author loves her deeply but can't imagine having a child through adoption or surrogacy. He's considering breaking up because he wants biological kids with her, but she can't carry them. He's torn between staying and supporting her or breaking up because he can't compromise on his desire for a biological child.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. But I need to evaluate both sides. On one hand, the author's feelings about wanting biological children are personal and valid. On the other, ending the relationship after five years, especially when she's going through a tough time, could be seen as selfish or heartless. \n\nConsider cultural and societal norms. Some might argue that love and commitment are more important than biological ties, and the author is prioritizing his own desires over the relationship. Others might see it as a personal choice, and since both partners have their own values, it's understandable he can't compromise.\n\nAlso, the emotional impact: breaking up after such news could be devastating for his girlfriend, especially if she's already processing the infertility. The author mentions she suggested alternatives, but he's not open to them. Is it fair to end things because of his own limitations? \n\nBut then, if he truly can't consider adoption or surrogacy, staying together might lead to resentment later. However, the decision to break up during her vulnerable time might be seen as insensitive. \n\nI need to weigh whether his reasons are justified. The key point is whether his desire for biological children makes him \"wrong\" for breaking up. There's no moral high ground here, but the question is about being in the wrong. If he's honest and handles it with compassion, some might see it as a difficult but necessary decision. Others would argue that he's letting his personal preferences override the relationship. \n\nI think the answer hinges on intent. If he's being selfish and not considering her feelings, then A. If he's trying to be honest and it's a mutual decision, maybe B. But in this case, he's considering breaking up because he can't compromise, not because of her behavior. So perhaps B is the answer. But I'm a bit conflicted. The final answer might be B, but it's close.\n"
