I want to make clear that I haven't decided anything yet. I'm just considering all options.\n\nAbout 2 weeks ago me and my girlfriend found out that she's infertile. We had been trying for a baby for almost a year, and we got a bit worried. So we decided to check the both of us, and it turns out that she is infertile. There's not much more to it, but they are 100% sure. We've been together for little over 5 years. I'm 24 and she's 2 years older, and we thought that the time was right. \n\nObviously we are devastated by the news, and I understand that it's an even bigger blow for my girlfriend. I've been there for her and we support each other, and I think that we're at least dealing with it. \n\nShe has already suggested adoption or a surrogate. I told her that was good idea and left it at that. The thing is, I don't want to adopt a kid. I also don't want a surrogate. I want to have my own kids, with my own woman (I don't know how to phrase this but you get what I mean). I get how this sounds really selfish. But it's how I think, I can't change that. I don't think I would be capable of adopting a kid. It's just not me. Is it weird that I want the woman I'm with to carry our child? I don't think it is. I want it to be our kid. But I know I'm not thinking straight right now. \n\nI want kids. I want them with my girlfriend. She was about to be my fiancee. But we can't. I've been seriously thinking of breaking things off. I love her with all my heart, she IS the love of my life. I wouldn't want to put her through a break up after this news, I know she needs me. But I can't shake this feeling. I understand that many might not understand my thought process here. I don't know what to tell you. Would I be the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that he and his girlfriend found out she's infertile. They wanted to have kids, tried for a year, checked both of them, and she's infertile. He's considering breaking up because he doesn't want adoption or surrogacy. He loves her but can't imagine having kids any other way.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if his reasoning is valid. He says he wants his own kids with his own woman, implying that he wants a biological child. But if she can't have kids, he can't see past that. Is it selfish? Some might say yes because he's choosing his desire for biological children over the relationship. Others might say it's not his fault for having certain desires.\n\nHe mentions that she suggested adoption or surrogacy, and he didn't push back but doesn't want those options either. He's in a dilemma between his love for her and his desire for biological kids. He's feeling conflicted and not thinking straight.\n\nBut here's the thing: relationships require compromise. If he's not willing to consider alternatives she's open to, maybe it's his issue. The fact that he's considering breaking up after a five-year relationship because of infertility is a big deal. Infertility is a medical condition, not a choice. Blaming her for it, even indirectly, could be harmful. However, he's not at fault for having his own preferences, but maybe he's not taking into account her feelings and the emotional toll of his decision.\n\nHe also says he's not decided yet, but he's thinking about it because he doesn't want to force her to go through a breakup when she's already hurting. That shows he's trying to be considerate, but the root problem is his unwillingness to accept any option other than biological children. That's a personal choice, but in a long-term relationship, such a stance could be seen as not valuing her enough.\n\nSo, is he the asshole? Well, he's not wrong in terms of having his own preferences, but the way he's approaching the situation might be. Relationships are about mutual respect and compromise. If he can't accept her options and is prioritizing his own desires over the relationship, that's where the problem lies. Also, the fact that he's considering breaking up right after the news might be seen as not supporting her during a tough time, which could make him look like the asshole.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because he's prioritizing his own inflexible desires over the relationship and his partner's feelings, without making a genuine effort to find a compromise.\n"
