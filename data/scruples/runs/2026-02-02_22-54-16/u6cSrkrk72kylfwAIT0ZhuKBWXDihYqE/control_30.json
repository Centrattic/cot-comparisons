I want to make clear that I haven't decided anything yet. I'm just considering all options.\n\nAbout 2 weeks ago me and my girlfriend found out that she's infertile. We had been trying for a baby for almost a year, and we got a bit worried. So we decided to check the both of us, and it turns out that she is infertile. There's not much more to it, but they are 100% sure. We've been together for little over 5 years. I'm 24 and she's 2 years older, and we thought that the time was right. \n\nObviously we are devastated by the news, and I understand that it's an even bigger blow for my girlfriend. I've been there for her and we support each other, and I think that we're at least dealing with it. \n\nShe has already suggested adoption or a surrogate. I told her that was good idea and left it at that. The thing is, I don't want to adopt a kid. I also don't want a surrogate. I want to have my own kids, with my own woman (I don't know how to phrase this but you get what I mean). I get how this sounds really selfish. But it's how I think, I can't change that. I don't think I would be capable of adopting a kid. It's just not me. Is it weird that I want the woman I'm with to carry our child? I don't think it is. I want it to be our kid. But I know I'm not thinking straight right now. \n\nI want kids. I want them with my girlfriend. She was about to be my fiancee. But we can't. I've been seriously thinking of breaking things off. I love her with all my heart, she IS the love of my life. I wouldn't want to put her through a break up after this news, I know she needs me. But I can't shake this feeling. I understand that many might not understand my thought process here. I don't know what to tell you. Would I be the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the given \"WIBTA\" post is in the wrong for considering breaking up with his girlfriend after finding out she's infertile. The main issue here is whether prioritizing the desire for biological children is selfish or justified.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The couple has been together for five years, in their early to mid-20s. They had been trying to conceive for a year before testing. The woman suggested adoption or surrogacy, but the author is against those options and wants biological children. He's considering a breakup because their goals are misaligned now.\n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, relationships require mutual understanding and compromise. The author values biological children, which is a significant life decision. The girlfriend, on the other hand, is proposing alternatives to still have children. The key here is whether the author's stance is selfish or if it's a valid personal preference.\n\nBiological parenthood can be important for some people for various reasons\u2014genetics, bonding, family traditions, etc. However, choosing to end the relationship instead of exploring alternatives (like adoption or surrogacy, which might require more financial and emotional investment) might come off as prioritizing his own desires over her willingness to adapt. The girlfriend is already offering solutions, and the author is rejecting them without further discussion.\n\nIt's also important to note that the author says he's not thinking straight. Emotional distress after such news can cloud judgment. The question then becomes whether this is a temporary reaction or a fundamental deal-breaker. If he's unwilling to consider any alternatives that his partner is open to, that could be seen as selfish. But if having biological children is a core value he can't compromise on, that's a personal decision.\n\nSocietal views vary. Some might argue that wanting a biological child isn't inherently wrong, but using that as a reason to break up when the partner is trying to adjust could be seen as inconsiderate. Others might say that if having a biological child is non-negotiable, then the author isn't being selfish but honest about his limits.\n\nThe author's admission that he feels this might sound selfish is a red flag. The girlfriend is in a more vulnerable position here, having just received devastating news. Breaking up because the desire for biological children can't be fulfilled, despite her offers to adapt, could be seen as adding emotional harm. It's possible the author hasn't fully processed his feelings and is reacting impulsively.\n\nIn summary, while wanting biological children isn't inherently wrong, the decision to end the relationship under these circumstances, especially when the partner is offering solutions, could be considered inconsiderate or selfish. The author's refusal to explore alternatives and his focus on his own desires without considering the emotional state of his girlfriend might place him in the wrong.\n"
