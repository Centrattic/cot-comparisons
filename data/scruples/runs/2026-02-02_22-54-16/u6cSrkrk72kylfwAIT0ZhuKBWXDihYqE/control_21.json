I want to make clear that I haven't decided anything yet. I'm just considering all options.\n\nAbout 2 weeks ago me and my girlfriend found out that she's infertile. We had been trying for a baby for almost a year, and we got a bit worried. So we decided to check the both of us, and it turns out that she is infertile. There's not much more to it, but they are 100% sure. We've been together for little over 5 years. I'm 24 and she's 2 years older, and we thought that the time was right. \n\nObviously we are devastated by the news, and I understand that it's an even bigger blow for my girlfriend. I've been there for her and we support each other, and I think that we're at least dealing with it. \n\nShe has already suggested adoption or a surrogate. I told her that was good idea and left it at that. The thing is, I don't want to adopt a kid. I also don't want a surrogate. I want to have my own kids, with my own woman (I don't know how to phrase this but you get what I mean). I get how this sounds really selfish. But it's how I think, I can't change that. I don't think I would be capable of adopting a kid. It's just not me. Is it weird that I want the woman I'm with to carry our child? I don't think it is. I want it to be our kid. But I know I'm not thinking straight right now. \n\nI want kids. I want them with my girlfriend. She was about to be my fiancee. But we can't. I've been seriously thinking of breaking things off. I love her with all my heart, she IS the love of my life. I wouldn't want to put her through a break up after this news, I know she needs me. But I can't shake this feeling. I understand that many might not understand my thought process here. I don't know what to tell you. Would I be the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person in the WIBTA scenario is in the wrong after considering breaking up with his girlfriend because she's infertile. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. They've been together for over five years, both wanted kids, but she can't have them. He's considering breaking up because he doesn't want adoption or surrogacy. He says he wants his own kids with his own woman, implying that he wants a biological child from his partner. He's conflicted because he loves her but can't get past this issue.\n\nSo, the question is whether he's in the wrong. The options are A (yes, wrong) or B (no, not wrong). \n\nI should consider different perspectives. On one hand, the woman is infertile, which is beyond her control. The man is using this as a reason to break up, which might seem selfish or callous. But on the other hand, he's honest about his feelings and his desire for biological children. He's also considering adoption and surrogacy, but he's not comfortable with those options. \n\nIs it fair to end a long-term relationship over something that wasn't either of their faults? The woman might feel hurt and abandoned, especially since they were close to getting married. The man is struggling with his own feelings and might not be ready to move forward without the possibility of biological kids. \n\nBut he does acknowledge that his reasons might sound selfish. He's trying to be supportive, but his need for a biological child is conflicting with their relationship. \n\nIn terms of societal views, some might say wanting a biological child is natural, while others might think it's unreasonable to end a relationship over that, especially when alternatives exist. However, if the man genuinely can't consider adoption or surrogacy, maybe it's his own values that are causing the problem. \n\nAlso, the woman's feelings are important here. She might have already invested in the idea of having a family together. Finding out she can't have biological kids is a blow, and then the man considering leaving could be even more devastating. \n\nBut the man is in a tough spot too. If he can't accept the alternatives and his desire for biological kids is non-negotiable, maybe it's not fair to stay in a relationship where he's not getting what he wants. However, breaking up under these circumstances could be seen as using her infertility as a reason to leave, which is hurtful. \n\nI think the key here is whether the man is being selfish by prioritizing his own desires over the relationship he's already committed to. Since they were about to get engaged, this is a significant step, and his decision could be seen as putting his needs above hers, especially when she's already dealing with the emotional impact of infertility. \n\nAlternatively, if he's truly unable to consider other options and they can't compromise, maybe it's not fair to stay in a relationship that he's not committed to long-term. But given the context, most people would argue that staying and supporting her through this would be the better choice, even if it means adjusting their family plans. \n\nSo, considering all this, the answer might lean towards A (he's in the wrong) because he's using infertility as a deal-breaker when it's not his fault, and breaking up might be more about his own preferences than a mutual issue.\n"
