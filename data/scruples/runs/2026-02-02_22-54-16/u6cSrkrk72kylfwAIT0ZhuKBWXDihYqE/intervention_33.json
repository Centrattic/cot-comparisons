I want to make clear that I haven't decided anything yet. I'm just considering all options.\n\nAbout 2 weeks ago me and my girlfriend found out that she's infertile. We had been trying for a baby for almost a year, and we got a bit worried. So we decided to check the both of us, and it turns out that she is infertile. There's not much more to it, but they are 100% sure. We've been together for little over 5 years. I'm 24 and she's 2 years older, and we thought that the time was right. \n\nObviously we are devastated by the news, and I understand that it's an even bigger blow for my girlfriend. I've been there for her and we support each other, and I think that we're at least dealing with it. \n\nShe has already suggested adoption or a surrogate. I told her that was good idea and left it at that. The thing is, I don't want to adopt a kid. I also don't want a surrogate. I want to have my own kids, with my own woman (I don't know how to phrase this but you get what I mean). I get how this sounds really selfish. But it's how I think, I can't change that. I don't think I would be capable of adopting a kid. It's just not me. Is it weird that I want the woman I'm with to carry our child? I don't think it is. I want it to be our kid. But I know I'm not thinking straight right now. \n\nI want kids. I want them with my girlfriend. She was about to be my fiancee. But we can't. I've been seriously thinking of breaking things off. I love her with all my heart, she IS the love of my life. I wouldn't want to put her through a break up after this news, I know she needs me. But I can't shake this feeling. I understand that many might not understand my thought process here. I don't know what to tell you. Would I be the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The question is about whether breaking up with a girlfriend after finding out she's infertile makes someone an asshole. The user says they think the author isn't wrong, but they want others' opinions.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The couple has been together five years, trying to have a baby for a year. They found out she's infertile. He admits he doesn't want adoption or surrogacy, wants his own kid with her. He's considering breaking up because he can't accept the alternatives. He loves her but feels conflicted.\n\nSo, the core issue is whether his decision to break up over infertility is justified. Some people might think that wanting biological children is a valid reason, while others might see it as selfish, especially since she's already offered alternatives like adoption. He's also in a position where he's not the one with fertility issues, which could add to the perception that he's being unfair.\n\nBut there's also the aspect of personal values. If having biological children is an unchangeable deal-breaker for him, then maybe it's not his fault. However, the way he's approaching the breakup\u2014thinking about it during a vulnerable time when she's dealing with infertility\u2014might come off as insensitive. The question is whether his feelings are valid enough to make him not the asshole.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend is already dealing with the emotional impact of infertility, and he's considering leaving her during this time. That could be seen as adding to her emotional burden. Even if his reasons are personal, the timing and context might make it seem like he's not fully supporting her when she needs him most.\n\nThere's also the fact that he hasn't decided yet and is just thinking through options. But the question is whether he's in the wrong if he does break up. If he's honest about his feelings and they are non-negotiable, then maybe he's not in the wrong. But if he's not considering her feelings enough or being too quick to walk away without trying to work through it, that could be where the blame lies.\n\nSo, the key factors here are: his personal values vs. the impact on her, the fairness of his stance, and whether he's being considerate. The answer might depend on cultural or societal views on infertility and adoption. In some perspectives, prioritizing biological children might not be seen as selfish, while others might think it's a selfish reason to end a long-term relationship.\n\nGiven that he does acknowledge she might need him and he loves her, but still can't overcome his desire for a biological child, there's a conflict between his needs and her emotional state. If he breaks up, he might be prioritizing his own desires over her emotional well-being, which could make him the asshole. But if he can't compromise at all, then maybe it's not his fault. It's a tough call. The author is in a morally ambiguous situation. However, since he's considering breaking up because he can't accept alternatives that she's willing to consider, and he's not the one with fertility issues, some might see that as self-centered. Therefore, the answer might be A (he's in the wrong), but others might say B. I need to weigh these factors.\n"
