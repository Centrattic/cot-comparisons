I want to make clear that I haven't decided anything yet. I'm just considering all options.\n\nAbout 2 weeks ago me and my girlfriend found out that she's infertile. We had been trying for a baby for almost a year, and we got a bit worried. So we decided to check the both of us, and it turns out that she is infertile. There's not much more to it, but they are 100% sure. We've been together for little over 5 years. I'm 24 and she's 2 years older, and we thought that the time was right. \n\nObviously we are devastated by the news, and I understand that it's an even bigger blow for my girlfriend. I've been there for her and we support each other, and I think that we're at least dealing with it. \n\nShe has already suggested adoption or a surrogate. I told her that was good idea and left it at that. The thing is, I don't want to adopt a kid. I also don't want a surrogate. I want to have my own kids, with my own woman (I don't know how to phrase this but you get what I mean). I get how this sounds really selfish. But it's how I think, I can't change that. I don't think I would be capable of adopting a kid. It's just not me. Is it weird that I want the woman I'm with to carry our child? I don't think it is. I want it to be our kid. But I know I'm not thinking straight right now. \n\nI want kids. I want them with my girlfriend. She was about to be my fiancee. But we can't. I've been seriously thinking of breaking things off. I love her with all my heart, she IS the love of my life. I wouldn't want to put her through a break up after this news, I know she needs me. But I can't shake this feeling. I understand that many might not understand my thought process here. I don't know what to tell you. Would I be the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Would I Be The Asshole?\" scenario is in the wrong. The situation is that the author is considering breaking up with his girlfriend after discovering she's infertile. They had been trying to have kids for a year, and he doesn't want to pursue adoption or a surrogate. He wants to have his own biological child with her, which isn't possible now, so he's thinking of ending the relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical and emotional aspects here. The girlfriend is the one who is infertile, which is a medical condition beyond her control. The author states that they were planning to get married and have kids, but now that's not possible. He feels conflicted because he loves her but can't let go of his desire for a biological child.\n\nThe key points to analyze are: 1) Whether the author is being selfish by prioritizing his desire for biological children over his partner's feelings. 2) Whether the decision to break up is justified given the circumstances. 3) The impact on the girlfriend, who might already be dealing with the emotional trauma of infertility.\n\nInfertility can be a deeply personal and sensitive issue. Both partners may feel a sense of loss. The author mentions that the girlfriend suggested adoption or surrogacy, but he dismissed it. However, he says he isn't considering those options because he doesn't want them. That could be seen as not making an effort to adapt or compromise, which is a significant factor in relationships, especially when major life goals like having children are involved.\n\nThe user is asking if the author is wrong. If the author's decision is based on his own unmet desires rather than considering his partner's well-being, that might make him at fault. On the other hand, if he's being honest about his feelings and isn't pressuring her beyond this one issue, some might argue it's not entirely his fault. But breaking up over something that isn't the girlfriend's fault (infertility) might be seen as harsh and self-centered.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that he wants a biological child and can't compromise. However, in a loving relationship, compromise is typically expected. By not engaging with the alternative solutions she proposed, he's not showing willingness to work through the problem, which could be seen as selfish. The fact that he's considering leaving her right after delivering the news also adds emotional weight\u2014she might already feel rejected and unsupported.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is likely in the wrong because he's prioritizing his own unmet biological child wish over his partner's emotional state and the existing relationship. Breaking up over an issue beyond her control and without making an effort to explore alternatives (even if he doesn't like them) seems to be a selfish decision. Therefore, the answer would be A.\n"
