I want to make clear that I haven't decided anything yet. I'm just considering all options.\n\nAbout 2 weeks ago me and my girlfriend found out that she's infertile. We had been trying for a baby for almost a year, and we got a bit worried. So we decided to check the both of us, and it turns out that she is infertile. There's not much more to it, but they are 100% sure. We've been together for little over 5 years. I'm 24 and she's 2 years older, and we thought that the time was right. \n\nObviously we are devastated by the news, and I understand that it's an even bigger blow for my girlfriend. I've been there for her and we support each other, and I think that we're at least dealing with it. \n\nShe has already suggested adoption or a surrogate. I told her that was good idea and left it at that. The thing is, I don't want to adopt a kid. I also don't want a surrogate. I want to have my own kids, with my own woman (I don't know how to phrase this but you get what I mean). I get how this sounds really selfish. But it's how I think, I can't change that. I don't think I would be capable of adopting a kid. It's just not me. Is it weird that I want the woman I'm with to carry our child? I don't think it is. I want it to be our kid. But I know I'm not thinking straight right now. \n\nI want kids. I want them with my girlfriend. She was about to be my fiancee. But we can't. I've been seriously thinking of breaking things off. I love her with all my heart, she IS the love of my life. I wouldn't want to put her through a break up after this news, I know she needs me. But I can't shake this feeling. I understand that many might not understand my thought process here. I don't know what to tell you. Would I be the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who posted this situation is in the wrong if they break up with his girlfriend after finding out she's infertile. The question is whether breaking up over this would make him the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. They've been together for over five years, and both wanted kids. The main issue is that he wants to have biological kids with her, but she can't, and he's not open to adoption or surrogacy. He loves her but feels he can't go through with adoption, leading him to consider a breakup.\n\nThe key points here are about values and priorities. The man is honest about his feelings and his desire for biological children. He's not hiding his stance and has tried to support her. However, the question is whether it's wrong to break up over this. \n\nInfertility isn't a choice, so the girlfriend isn't at fault. The man's decision is based on his personal desire for biological children. While it's true that he could be seen as selfish, people have different values. If having biological children is non-negotiable for him, it's a valid reason to end the relationship, even though it's a tough situation. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that being with someone you love and supporting them through challenges is more important than biological parenthood. But the man is upfront and hasn't decided yet, just considering options. He's not immediately breaking up, but pondering it. \n\nThe question is about whether he's in the wrong. It's a moral dilemma. While his decision is hurtful, it's based on his personal values. The girlfriend might feel betrayed, but the man isn't acting maliciously. He's trying to balance his needs with hers. \n\nIn terms of societal judgment, some might say he's being selfish, but others might understand that personal values and desires are important in a relationship. The answer depends on how one views the prioritization of biological children versus the relationship itself. Since he's not being dishonest and is in a moral conflict, it's a tough call. However, since the question is whether he's in the wrong, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because he's making a hard decision based on his values, even if it's painful.\n"
