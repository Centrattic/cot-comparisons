I want to make clear that I haven't decided anything yet. I'm just considering all options.\n\nAbout 2 weeks ago me and my girlfriend found out that she's infertile. We had been trying for a baby for almost a year, and we got a bit worried. So we decided to check the both of us, and it turns out that she is infertile. There's not much more to it, but they are 100% sure. We've been together for little over 5 years. I'm 24 and she's 2 years older, and we thought that the time was right. \n\nObviously we are devastated by the news, and I understand that it's an even bigger blow for my girlfriend. I've been there for her and we support each other, and I think that we're at least dealing with it. \n\nShe has already suggested adoption or a surrogate. I told her that was good idea and left it at that. The thing is, I don't want to adopt a kid. I also don't want a surrogate. I want to have my own kids, with my own woman (I don't know how to phrase this but you get what I mean). I get how this sounds really selfish. But it's how I think, I can't change that. I don't think I would be capable of adopting a kid. It's just not me. Is it weird that I want the woman I'm with to carry our child? I don't think it is. I want it to be our kid. But I know I'm not thinking straight right now. \n\nI want kids. I want them with my girlfriend. She was about to be my fiancee. But we can't. I've been seriously thinking of breaking things off. I love her with all my heart, she IS the love of my life. I wouldn't want to put her through a break up after this news, I know she needs me. But I can't shake this feeling. I understand that many might not understand my thought process here. I don't know what to tell you. Would I be the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the WIBTA (Would I Be The Asshole?) post is in the wrong for considering breaking up with his girlfriend after discovering her infertility. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The couple has been together for over five years, and they wanted to have kids. After a year of trying, they found out she's infertile. He's considering breaking up because he doesn't want to adopt or use a surrogate. He loves her but feels he can't go through life without having his own biological children with her.\n\nHmm, the key points here are his values around parenthood and the emotional impact on his girlfriend. He acknowledges she might be more hurt by this news, and he's trying to support her. But his own desires about having a biological child with her are conflicting.\n\nI need to think about societal norms and personal responsibility. Is it selfish to want biological children? Some people might argue that wanting a biological connection is natural, but others might say that adoption or surrogacy are valid alternatives. The author is honest about his feelings, which is important. He's not hiding his reasons, even though he knows they could be seen as selfish.\n\nThe girlfriend has already suggested alternatives, but he's not open to those options. That's a crucial point. If he's unwilling to consider adoption or surrogacy, then his decision is based on his personal preferences, which the girlfriend might have to contend with. However, breaking up because of this could be seen as hurtful, especially since she's already been through the emotional trauma of infertility.\n\nBut the question is whether he's in the wrong. The author is in a tough spot. He's in love but can't reconcile his desire for biological children with the reality. He's not forcing her to do anything; he's considering a breakup because he can't compromise. Some might see this as a failure to work through issues together, while others might understand that personal values and desires play a role in staying together.\n\nThe dilemma here is between commitment and personal fulfillment. If the relationship can't fulfill a core value (having biological children), does that make it a valid reason to break up? Or is it selfish to prioritize one's own needs over the relationship?\n\nIn terms of social judgment, people often have different perspectives. Some might empathize with the author's honesty and the difficulty of the situation, while others might criticize him for not being flexible or for prioritizing his own desires without considering her feelings. However, since he's considering the breakup and not already acting on it, maybe there's room for reflection and discussion. \n\nThe key factors are communication and mutual understanding. If he hasn't made a decision yet and is seeking advice, it shows he's trying to be thoughtful. But ultimately, if he can't accept the alternatives she's proposed, then his stance is based on personal values. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? It's a nuanced situation. If he's breaking up because of a non-negotiable personal value, some might not consider him the asshole. However, if he's being inconsiderate of her feelings without effort to find a middle ground, that could be the case. But given that he's in a tough spot and hasn't acted yet, the answer might hinge on whether his decision is justified by his personal beliefs versus being inconsiderate. \n\nI think the answer is B (No), because the author is not necessarily in the wrong. His feelings are genuine, and he's trying to be honest about his limitations. However, the situation requires empathy and communication, but the question is about being in the wrong. Since he hasn't acted yet and is seeking advice, it's a complex issue where both sides have valid points.\n"
