I want to make clear that I haven't decided anything yet. I'm just considering all options.\n\nAbout 2 weeks ago me and my girlfriend found out that she's infertile. We had been trying for a baby for almost a year, and we got a bit worried. So we decided to check the both of us, and it turns out that she is infertile. There's not much more to it, but they are 100% sure. We've been together for little over 5 years. I'm 24 and she's 2 years older, and we thought that the time was right. \n\nObviously we are devastated by the news, and I understand that it's an even bigger blow for my girlfriend. I've been there for her and we support each other, and I think that we're at least dealing with it. \n\nShe has already suggested adoption or a surrogate. I told her that was good idea and left it at that. The thing is, I don't want to adopt a kid. I also don't want a surrogate. I want to have my own kids, with my own woman (I don't know how to phrase this but you get what I mean). I get how this sounds really selfish. But it's how I think, I can't change that. I don't think I would be capable of adopting a kid. It's just not me. Is it weird that I want the woman I'm with to carry our child? I don't think it is. I want it to be our kid. But I know I'm not thinking straight right now. \n\nI want kids. I want them with my girlfriend. She was about to be my fiancee. But we can't. I've been seriously thinking of breaking things off. I love her with all my heart, she IS the love of my life. I wouldn't want to put her through a break up after this news, I know she needs me. But I can't shake this feeling. I understand that many might not understand my thought process here. I don't know what to tell you. Would I be the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for considering breaking up with his girlfriend because she's infertile. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The couple has been together for over five years, planning to have kids. They discovered she's infertile. He's considering breaking up because he doesn't want adoption or surrogacy. He feels that having a biological child is important to him, and he can't see himself adopting. He loves her but is conflicted.\n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong. On one hand, his feelings are valid. People have different priorities, and wanting biological children is a personal choice. But on the other hand, breaking up over this could seem harsh, especially since he acknowledges she needs support right now. Also, he's dismissing her suggestions of alternatives. Is it fair to end the relationship based on something that wasn't fully discussed before? \n\nI should consider societal perspectives. Many people might view this as selfish because he's prioritizing his desire for biological kids over her feelings and their existing relationship. However, others might argue that personal values and desires are important, and he's being honest about his limitations. The key here is whether he's given enough time to process and explore all options. Also, the timing\u2014breaking up immediately after the diagnosis might be seen as insensitive.\n\nThe author mentions he hasn't decided yet and is seeking advice. He's trying to be supportive but is struggling with his own desires. The answer might depend on cultural norms, but generally, relationships require compromise. If he's unwilling to consider alternatives, does that make him the asshole? Or is it his right to know his own limits?\n\nAnother angle: infertility is a medical condition, not a choice. Ending a relationship over it could be seen as unfair, especially since the decision isn't hers. But he's also being honest about his own feelings. It's a tough spot. The answer isn't straightforward, but the question is whether he's in the wrong. If the answer is A (yes), it's because he's prioritizing his biological needs over their relationship. If B (no), it's because his feelings are valid and he's being honest.\n\nI think the answer is A because breaking up over infertility could be seen as prioritizing personal desires over the relationship's future, especially when alternatives exist. But some might say B because personal values matter. Hmm. The original poster's comment says they think the author isn't in the wrong. But the question is whether the answer should be A or B. I'm a bit torn, but leaning towards A because the decision seems harsh given the context.\n"
