I want to make clear that I haven't decided anything yet. I'm just considering all options.\n\nAbout 2 weeks ago me and my girlfriend found out that she's infertile. We had been trying for a baby for almost a year, and we got a bit worried. So we decided to check the both of us, and it turns out that she is infertile. There's not much more to it, but they are 100% sure. We've been together for little over 5 years. I'm 24 and she's 2 years older, and we thought that the time was right. \n\nObviously we are devastated by the news, and I understand that it's an even bigger blow for my girlfriend. I've been there for her and we support each other, and I think that we're at least dealing with it. \n\nShe has already suggested adoption or a surrogate. I told her that was good idea and left it at that. The thing is, I don't want to adopt a kid. I also don't want a surrogate. I want to have my own kids, with my own woman (I don't know how to phrase this but you get what I mean). I get how this sounds really selfish. But it's how I think, I can't change that. I don't think I would be capable of adopting a kid. It's just not me. Is it weird that I want the woman I'm with to carry our child? I don't think it is. I want it to be our kid. But I know I'm not thinking straight right now. \n\nI want kids. I want them with my girlfriend. She was about to be my fiancee. But we can't. I've been seriously thinking of breaking things off. I love her with all my heart, she IS the love of my life. I wouldn't want to put her through a break up after this news, I know she needs me. But I can't shake this feeling. I understand that many might not understand my thought process here. I don't know what to tell you. Would I be the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the \"Would I Be The Asshole?\" scenario is in the wrong. The situation is that the author is considering breaking up with his girlfriend after finding out she's infertile. He wants to have his own biological kids and isn't open to adoption or surrogacy. He loves her but feels conflicted.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The couple has been together for five years, and they were planning to get married. The main issue here is the inability to have biological children. The author is being honest about his feelings and his desire for biological children, which he can't compromise on. \n\nI should think about societal views on relationships and family. Some people might see valuing biological children as important, while others might view it as selfish, especially when considering adoption or surrogacy as options. The author is upfront about his stance, which he's been clear isn't something he can change. \n\nThe girlfriend is suggesting alternatives like adoption, but the author is not open to them. However, he's not forcing her to do anything; he's considering breaking up because he can't compromise. The question is whether this decision makes him the asshole. \n\nI should also consider emotional aspects. The girlfriend is going through a tough time, and breaking up might be hard for her. But the author is also dealing with his own feelings and needs. Relationships require mutual goals. If they can't align on having children, it's a major issue. \n\nIt's possible that some people might think he's being selfish by not considering adoption or surrogacy, while others might empathize with his desire for biological kids. However, it's important to note that relationships are about both parties' needs and values. If the author isn't willing to compromise on this core value, it's a valid reason to consider ending the relationship, even if it's painful.\n\nI need to weigh whether the author is being inconsiderate or if he's being honest about his needs. The key here is that he's not making the decision lightly and is trying to process his feelings. He's also acknowledging the difficulty for his girlfriend. \n\nIn conclusion, whether he's in the wrong depends on perspectives. If the relationship requires a mutual desire for biological children, and she can't provide that, then his decision isn't necessarily wrong. But if he's dismissive of other options without considering her feelings, that could be an issue. However, the scenario shows he's respectful and supportive, just conflicted about his own desires.\n"
