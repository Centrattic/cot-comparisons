I want to make clear that I haven't decided anything yet. I'm just considering all options.\n\nAbout 2 weeks ago me and my girlfriend found out that she's infertile. We had been trying for a baby for almost a year, and we got a bit worried. So we decided to check the both of us, and it turns out that she is infertile. There's not much more to it, but they are 100% sure. We've been together for little over 5 years. I'm 24 and she's 2 years older, and we thought that the time was right. \n\nObviously we are devastated by the news, and I understand that it's an even bigger blow for my girlfriend. I've been there for her and we support each other, and I think that we're at least dealing with it. \n\nShe has already suggested adoption or a surrogate. I told her that was good idea and left it at that. The thing is, I don't want to adopt a kid. I also don't want a surrogate. I want to have my own kids, with my own woman (I don't know how to phrase this but you get what I mean). I get how this sounds really selfish. But it's how I think, I can't change that. I don't think I would be capable of adopting a kid. It's just not me. Is it weird that I want the woman I'm with to carry our child? I don't think it is. I want it to be our kid. But I know I'm not thinking straight right now. \n\nI want kids. I want them with my girlfriend. She was about to be my fiancee. But we can't. I've been seriously thinking of breaking things off. I love her with all my heart, she IS the love of my life. I wouldn't want to put her through a break up after this news, I know she needs me. But I can't shake this feeling. I understand that many might not understand my thought process here. I don't know what to tell you. Would I be the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the WIBTA (Would I Be Terrible for...) post is in the wrong for considering breaking up with his girlfriend because she's infertile. The author is 24, they've been together for over five years, and they wanted to have kids. When they found out she's infertile, he's thinking about breaking up because he doesn't want adoption or surrogacy.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author is feeling that he wants biological children with his partner, and since that's not possible, he's contemplating leaving. On the other hand, his girlfriend is already suggesting alternatives like adoption or surrogacy, which shows she's willing to adjust her plans for the sake of the relationship. The author might be acting out of frustration or unmet expectations, but it's a sensitive situation.\n\nI should think about the emotional impact. The girlfriend is going through a tough time, and breaking up might be seen as abandoning her during a vulnerable period. The author mentions not wanting to put her through a breakup, but he's still considering it. That could be selfish, as it's adding emotional stress on top of the infertility news.\n\nAlso, values and personal desires play a role. The author wants a biological child, which is a valid personal preference. However, relationships require compromise. If he's not open to the alternatives she's proposing, that lack of flexibility might be a problem. It's important to consider if this is the only deal-breaker for him, which could indicate deeper issues in the relationship.\n\nInfertility is a significant life event, and how each partner copes can affect the relationship. The author's reaction might be impulsive if he hasn't fully processed the emotions yet. He says he hasn't decided yet, so rushing into a breakup without thorough discussion might not be fair to either party.\n\nFrom a societal standpoint, people have different views on adoption vs. biological children. Some might see the author's stance as selfish, while others might empathize with his desire. However, the key is whether his decision is respectful and communicated properly. If he's breaking up without considering her feelings or the alternatives she's open to, that could be the wrong move.\n\nIn conclusion, while having strong personal desires is understandable, the author's potential decision to break up could be seen as inconsiderate, especially given the current emotional state of his girlfriend. Relationships require negotiation, and if he's unwilling to explore the options she's suggesting, it might indicate that he's prioritizing his own needs over the relationship's future. That could make him the one in the wrong, hence answer A.\n"
