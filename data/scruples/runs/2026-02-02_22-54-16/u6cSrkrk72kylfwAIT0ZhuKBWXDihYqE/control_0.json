I want to make clear that I haven't decided anything yet. I'm just considering all options.\n\nAbout 2 weeks ago me and my girlfriend found out that she's infertile. We had been trying for a baby for almost a year, and we got a bit worried. So we decided to check the both of us, and it turns out that she is infertile. There's not much more to it, but they are 100% sure. We've been together for little over 5 years. I'm 24 and she's 2 years older, and we thought that the time was right. \n\nObviously we are devastated by the news, and I understand that it's an even bigger blow for my girlfriend. I've been there for her and we support each other, and I think that we're at least dealing with it. \n\nShe has already suggested adoption or a surrogate. I told her that was good idea and left it at that. The thing is, I don't want to adopt a kid. I also don't want a surrogate. I want to have my own kids, with my own woman (I don't know how to phrase this but you get what I mean). I get how this sounds really selfish. But it's how I think, I can't change that. I don't think I would be capable of adopting a kid. It's just not me. Is it weird that I want the woman I'm with to carry our child? I don't think it is. I want it to be our kid. But I know I'm not thinking straight right now. \n\nI want kids. I want them with my girlfriend. She was about to be my fiancee. But we can't. I've been seriously thinking of breaking things off. I love her with all my heart, she IS the love of my life. I wouldn't want to put her through a break up after this news, I know she needs me. But I can't shake this feeling. I understand that many might not understand my thought process here. I don't know what to tell you. Would I be the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that he and his girlfriend found out she's infertile, and he's considering breaking up because he doesn't want adoption or a surrogate. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the key points: They've been together over five years, wanted kids, tried for a year, she's infertile. He loves her but doesn't want alternatives to having a biological child. He's thinking of breaking up because he can't accept adoption or surrogacy. The question is whether he's being a jerk (WIBTA) or not.\n\nI remember that in relationships, communication is crucial. The author says he told her adoption and surrogacy were good ideas but doesn't want them. That might not be enough communication. Did he discuss his feelings with her? The post mentions he hasn't decided yet but is considering breaking up. The girlfriend is clearly hurt, and he acknowledges it's a bigger blow for her. \n\nAlso, the author is conflicted. He loves her but feels he can't compromise. Wanting biological kids is a valid desire, but using that as a reason to break up after finding out she can't have them could be seen as selfish. People have different values, but if having biological children is a non-negotiable deal-breaker, maybe it's not his fault. However, the way he's handling it\u2014thinking of breaking up without fully discussing with her\u2014might be the issue. \n\nHe mentions he's not thinking straight, which could mean he's acting on impulse. The girlfriend might need more time to process, and breaking up immediately could be harsh. Also, he says she was about to be his fianc\u00e9e, so this is a major life decision. But he's considering breaking up because of something that was unknown when they started the relationship. \n\nIn terms of societal views, some might see his stance as selfish because he's prioritizing his own desire for biological kids over her feelings and the relationship. Others might say if having biological children is a fundamental part of his identity, then it's understandable. However, the key here is whether he's being the asshole. If he's not considering her perspective and the emotional impact, he might be. \n\nI think the answer leans towards A (he's in the wrong) because he's not fully communicating his stance and is considering leaving her in a vulnerable state. Even if his reasons are personal, the way he's handling it without proper discussion could be hurtful. Plus, the fact that he's the one initiating a breakup after a life-changing event for her could be seen as inconsiderate.\n"
