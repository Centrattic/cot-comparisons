I want to make clear that I haven't decided anything yet. I'm just considering all options.\n\nAbout 2 weeks ago me and my girlfriend found out that she's infertile. We had been trying for a baby for almost a year, and we got a bit worried. So we decided to check the both of us, and it turns out that she is infertile. There's not much more to it, but they are 100% sure. We've been together for little over 5 years. I'm 24 and she's 2 years older, and we thought that the time was right. \n\nObviously we are devastated by the news, and I understand that it's an even bigger blow for my girlfriend. I've been there for her and we support each other, and I think that we're at least dealing with it. \n\nShe has already suggested adoption or a surrogate. I told her that was good idea and left it at that. The thing is, I don't want to adopt a kid. I also don't want a surrogate. I want to have my own kids, with my own woman (I don't know how to phrase this but you get what I mean). I get how this sounds really selfish. But it's how I think, I can't change that. I don't think I would be capable of adopting a kid. It's just not me. Is it weird that I want the woman I'm with to carry our child? I don't think it is. I want it to be our kid. But I know I'm not thinking straight right now. \n\nI want kids. I want them with my girlfriend. She was about to be my fiancee. But we can't. I've been seriously thinking of breaking things off. I love her with all my heart, she IS the love of my life. I wouldn't want to put her through a break up after this news, I know she needs me. But I can't shake this feeling. I understand that many might not understand my thought process here. I don't know what to tell you. Would I be the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this \"Would I Be The Asshole\" (WIBTA) scenario is in the wrong. The scenario is about a guy considering breaking up with his girlfriend because she's infertile. They had been trying to have kids for a year and now she's suggested adoption or surrogacy, but he's not open to those options.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The man says he wants his own biological children, specifically with his partner. He feels that adoption or surrogacy isn't for him. The girlfriend is clearly affected by the news and suggested alternatives. The man is conflicted because he loves her but can't reconcile his desire for biological children with their current situation. He's considering breaking up because he can't see a way forward.\n\nNow, thinking about societal norms and personal values. People have different views on parenthood. Some value biological children highly, others don't. He might be seen as selfish for prioritizing his own desires over his partner's feelings. However, he's also honest about his limitations and feels that he can't adopt. It's important to note that he's not already breaking up, he's just thinking through options.\n\nAnother angle: communication. The man and his girlfriend haven't resolved this issue yet. He mentioned supporting each other, but he hasn't discussed his adoption stance in detail. Maybe he hasn't explored all possibilities with her. If he hasn't talked about it, he might be making a hasty decision based on assumptions. Also, the girlfriend's emotional state after the infertility diagnosis is a factor. She might feel betrayed if he breaks up, but it's also a matter of incompatible long-term goals.\n\nEthically, is it wrong to base a breakup on infertility? It's a personal choice. Some would argue it's valid if having biological kids is a non-negotiable for him. Others might see it as using his partner's infertility as an excuse to end the relationship under stress. The key is whether he's acting out of genuine incompatibility or just a sudden change in plans.\n\nAlso, considering the timing. They were about to get engaged, so this is a significant life decision. He's under a lot of pressure, but making a life-altering decision post-shock might not be the best approach. He needs to give it more time and communicate openly with his partner before deciding.\n\nIn terms of answer choice: If the answer is A (he's in the wrong), it's because he's prioritizing his own desires without fully considering the emotional impact on his partner. If B (not in the wrong), it's because personal values about having biological children are valid, and he's being honest about his limitations.\n\nI think the answer is B. While his decision might seem harsh, it's a personal choice regarding his own values. However, he should communicate this properly and consider if he's making the decision under stress. The question is whether he's in the wrong, not whether others might judge him. Since he's still considering options and hasn't acted yet, maybe he's not in the wrong yet. But if he breaks up, others might see it as wrong. The question is about whether the act of considering breaking up makes him the asshole. Since he's still thinking it through, and hasn't caused actual harm yet, maybe not. So the answer is B.\n"
