I want to make clear that I haven't decided anything yet. I'm just considering all options.\n\nAbout 2 weeks ago me and my girlfriend found out that she's infertile. We had been trying for a baby for almost a year, and we got a bit worried. So we decided to check the both of us, and it turns out that she is infertile. There's not much more to it, but they are 100% sure. We've been together for little over 5 years. I'm 24 and she's 2 years older, and we thought that the time was right. \n\nObviously we are devastated by the news, and I understand that it's an even bigger blow for my girlfriend. I've been there for her and we support each other, and I think that we're at least dealing with it. \n\nShe has already suggested adoption or a surrogate. I told her that was good idea and left it at that. The thing is, I don't want to adopt a kid. I also don't want a surrogate. I want to have my own kids, with my own woman (I don't know how to phrase this but you get what I mean). I get how this sounds really selfish. But it's how I think, I can't change that. I don't think I would be capable of adopting a kid. It's just not me. Is it weird that I want the woman I'm with to carry our child? I don't think it is. I want it to be our kid. But I know I'm not thinking straight right now. \n\nI want kids. I want them with my girlfriend. She was about to be my fiancee. But we can't. I've been seriously thinking of breaking things off. I love her with all my heart, she IS the love of my life. I wouldn't want to put her through a break up after this news, I know she needs me. But I can't shake this feeling. I understand that many might not understand my thought process here. I don't know what to tell you. Would I be the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking whether the author of the WIBTA (Would I Be a [X]) post is in the wrong for considering breaking up with his girlfriend after finding out she's infertile.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The couple has been together for over five years, and they were planning to start a family. They tried for a year and found out the girlfriend is infertile. The author admits he doesn't want adoption or a surrogate; he wants his own biological children. Because of that, he's considering breaking up despite loving her deeply.\n\nThe key points here are the author's motivations. He's not being cruel or manipulative; he's honest about his feelings and wants. Infertility can be a significant issue for some people when considering marriage and family. The author is struggling with his inability to accept alternatives, which might make him seem selfish, but he's also acknowledging that. He's trying to be supportive but feels conflicted.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, relationships are based on mutual understanding and shared values. If having biological children is a deal-breaker for the author, it's a valid reason to reconsider the relationship, especially if they're planning to get married. However, the timing and approach matter. Breaking up right after such a traumatic event might be seen as insensitive because his girlfriend is likely still processing the news and may feel rejected or blamed.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is trying to be honest with himself and his partner. He's not hiding his feelings and is considering the breakup out of self-awareness rather than sudden anger. But the question is whether he's wrong for doing so. It's a complex situation where personal values clash with emotional support. Some might see his desire for biological children as selfish, while others understand that everyone has non-negotiables.\n\nThe answer hinges on whether the decision is based on genuine incompatibility or a lack of support for his partner. Since he's being honest and has been supportive, maybe he's not at fault. However, breaking up during such a vulnerable time could be hurtful regardless of the reason. So, it's a tough call. The user thinks he's not in the wrong, and I might lean towards B (No), but there's a nuance here. The decision itself isn't inherently wrong, but the timing and sensitivity are important factors.\n"
