I want to make clear that I haven't decided anything yet. I'm just considering all options.\n\nAbout 2 weeks ago me and my girlfriend found out that she's infertile. We had been trying for a baby for almost a year, and we got a bit worried. So we decided to check the both of us, and it turns out that she is infertile. There's not much more to it, but they are 100% sure. We've been together for little over 5 years. I'm 24 and she's 2 years older, and we thought that the time was right. \n\nObviously we are devastated by the news, and I understand that it's an even bigger blow for my girlfriend. I've been there for her and we support each other, and I think that we're at least dealing with it. \n\nShe has already suggested adoption or a surrogate. I told her that was good idea and left it at that. The thing is, I don't want to adopt a kid. I also don't want a surrogate. I want to have my own kids, with my own woman (I don't know how to phrase this but you get what I mean). I get how this sounds really selfish. But it's how I think, I can't change that. I don't think I would be capable of adopting a kid. It's just not me. Is it weird that I want the woman I'm with to carry our child? I don't think it is. I want it to be our kid. But I know I'm not thinking straight right now. \n\nI want kids. I want them with my girlfriend. She was about to be my fiancee. But we can't. I've been seriously thinking of breaking things off. I love her with all my heart, she IS the love of my life. I wouldn't want to put her through a break up after this news, I know she needs me. But I can't shake this feeling. I understand that many might not understand my thought process here. I don't know what to tell you. Would I be the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a guy considering breaking up with his girlfriend after finding out she's infertile. They were planning to get married and have kids, but he doesn't want adoption or surrogacy, so he's thinking of ending the relationship because he wants his own biological children with her.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation from an ethical and emotional perspective. The key points here are the man's desire for biological children and his unwillingness to consider alternatives like adoption or surrogacy. The question is whether his decision to break up is justified or if he's being selfish.\n\nBiological factors are a big part of this. His girlfriend is infertile, so they can't have a child naturally. He's not open to alternatives, which means their shared goal of having a biological child can't be achieved. The man loves her but feels he can't proceed without that specific part of his life plan. On the other hand, his girlfriend is likely more affected because she might have hoped for a biological child and now faces the breakup on top of the infertility diagnosis.\n\nEthically, people have different values. Some prioritize biological children, others don't. If he's honest about his stance and they can't reconcile their differences, then breaking up might be his way of being true to himself. But it's also important to consider the emotional impact on his girlfriend. She might feel rejected or blamed for the infertility, which is a sensitive issue.\n\nThe man says he's been supportive and they both support each other, but his reasoning is that he can't adopt. That might come off as selfish because he's dismissing her suggestions. However, if he's genuinely unable to adopt due to personal convictions, that's his reality. The problem is whether it's right to end the relationship over this after being with her for five years.\n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong. From a moral standpoint, some might say it's wrong to break up over infertility if there are alternatives. Others might say he's being honest about his non-negotiables. The answer depends on cultural, personal values, and the context of their relationship. Since he hasn't made a decision yet and is seeking advice, it's a complex situation.\n\nIn terms of the options given (A or B), the user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. I need to decide if the answer is A or B. Considering that the man is making a difficult decision based on personal values, even if it's painful for his partner, it's a matter of personal choice. However, the way he's framing it might overlook her feelings and the fact that infertility is a shared issue. But since he's not blaming her and is considering his own needs, it's a tough call. Maybe leaning towards B (not in the wrong) because he's being honest with himself, even though the outcome is hurtful.\n"
