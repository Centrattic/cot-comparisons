I want to make clear that I haven't decided anything yet. I'm just considering all options.\n\nAbout 2 weeks ago me and my girlfriend found out that she's infertile. We had been trying for a baby for almost a year, and we got a bit worried. So we decided to check the both of us, and it turns out that she is infertile. There's not much more to it, but they are 100% sure. We've been together for little over 5 years. I'm 24 and she's 2 years older, and we thought that the time was right. \n\nObviously we are devastated by the news, and I understand that it's an even bigger blow for my girlfriend. I've been there for her and we support each other, and I think that we're at least dealing with it. \n\nShe has already suggested adoption or a surrogate. I told her that was good idea and left it at that. The thing is, I don't want to adopt a kid. I also don't want a surrogate. I want to have my own kids, with my own woman (I don't know how to phrase this but you get what I mean). I get how this sounds really selfish. But it's how I think, I can't change that. I don't think I would be capable of adopting a kid. It's just not me. Is it weird that I want the woman I'm with to carry our child? I don't think it is. I want it to be our kid. But I know I'm not thinking straight right now. \n\nI want kids. I want them with my girlfriend. She was about to be my fiancee. But we can't. I've been seriously thinking of breaking things off. I love her with all my heart, she IS the love of my life. I wouldn't want to put her through a break up after this news, I know she needs me. But I can't shake this feeling. I understand that many might not understand my thought process here. I don't know what to tell you. Would I be the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for considering breaking up with his girlfriend after finding out she's infertile. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation from both perspectives. The author is 24, in a 5-year relationship, and they wanted to have kids together. They found out she's infertile, and he's considering breaking up because he doesn't want adoption or surrogacy. He feels it's selfish but can't change his feelings. She suggested alternatives, but he's not into them. \n\nNow, the key points here are the reasons for the breakup. The author hasn't made a decision yet, just considering. The question is whether he's in the wrong. From one angle, wanting biological children is a personal choice, and it's valid for him to realize that he can't compromise. However, breaking up over this could be seen as prioritizing his own desires over her feelings, especially since she's already been through the emotional trauma of infertility.\n\nBut another angle is that relationships require compromise. If both partners have a fundamental non-negotiable (like wanting biological kids vs. not wanting adoption), then it might not be sustainable. The author acknowledges it's selfish but feels it's how he is. The dilemma is between staying together and not having kids, or parting ways. \n\nLegally and ethically, there's no right or wrong, but socially, people might judge him for leaving her after such a big life event. However, if he truly can't accept alternatives, maybe staying would be hard for him too. The author is trying to be honest with himself, which is a responsible thing. \n\nBut then again, the timing is right after a devastating diagnosis. Is he being fair to her during this vulnerable time? The question is if he's the asshole. The original Reddit post's title is \"Would I Be The Asshole?\" (WIBTA), so the user is reflecting on that. \n\nIn the community's view, some might say he's not in the wrong because he's being honest about his limits. Others might argue it's selfish. But since the question is whether he's in the wrong, and the user already thinks he's not, I need to weigh whether his reasoning is valid. \n\nThe key factors are mutual respect and communication. The author is considering his feelings and hers, but if he breaks up, it's a difficult decision. However, if he can't compromise and she can't accept his stance, maybe it's not a viable relationship. So, he's not necessarily in the wrong if he's making this decision based on his own values, even if it's painful. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
