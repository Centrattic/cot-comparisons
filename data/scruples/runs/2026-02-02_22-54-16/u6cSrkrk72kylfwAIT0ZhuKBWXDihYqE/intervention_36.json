I want to make clear that I haven't decided anything yet. I'm just considering all options.\n\nAbout 2 weeks ago me and my girlfriend found out that she's infertile. We had been trying for a baby for almost a year, and we got a bit worried. So we decided to check the both of us, and it turns out that she is infertile. There's not much more to it, but they are 100% sure. We've been together for little over 5 years. I'm 24 and she's 2 years older, and we thought that the time was right. \n\nObviously we are devastated by the news, and I understand that it's an even bigger blow for my girlfriend. I've been there for her and we support each other, and I think that we're at least dealing with it. \n\nShe has already suggested adoption or a surrogate. I told her that was good idea and left it at that. The thing is, I don't want to adopt a kid. I also don't want a surrogate. I want to have my own kids, with my own woman (I don't know how to phrase this but you get what I mean). I get how this sounds really selfish. But it's how I think, I can't change that. I don't think I would be capable of adopting a kid. It's just not me. Is it weird that I want the woman I'm with to carry our child? I don't think it is. I want it to be our kid. But I know I'm not thinking straight right now. \n\nI want kids. I want them with my girlfriend. She was about to be my fiancee. But we can't. I've been seriously thinking of breaking things off. I love her with all my heart, she IS the love of my life. I wouldn't want to put her through a break up after this news, I know she needs me. But I can't shake this feeling. I understand that many might not understand my thought process here. I don't know what to tell you. Would I be the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong if they break up with their girlfriend after finding out she's infertile. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key elements here. The couple has been together for five years, and they were trying to have a baby. The girlfriend is infertile, so the man is considering breaking up because he wants his own biological children. The girlfriend suggested adoption or surrogacy, but he's not into that. He feels he can't adopt, and he wants a child from his partner.\n\nNow, the ethical and moral aspects come into play. Is it fair for the man to end the relationship because of this? Some might argue that wanting biological children is a personal choice, and if they can't compromise, maybe breaking up is the right move. Others might say it's selfish to leave someone over something that's out of their control. The girlfriend is already dealing with a big emotional blow, and the man is considering leaving her, which could add to her distress.\n\nBut the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The man hasn't decided yet and is seeking validation. The scenario emphasizes his internal conflict\u2014he loves her but feels this is a dealbreaker. The user initially thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but I need to weigh the perspectives. \n\nFrom a relationship standpoint, communication is key. The man didn't clearly express his feelings about adoption or surrogacy earlier. However, in this case, the issue is a major life decision about having children, which is a significant factor for many people. If both partners can't meet each other's needs, ending the relationship might be seen as a difficult but necessary choice. \n\nHowever, the man is considering leaving his partner when she's already upset. That could be seen as cruel. On the other hand, if he stays, he might resent her later for not being able to have biological kids. There's no clear right or wrong answer here, but it's about personal values. \n\nIn many cases, people have different priorities, and if they can't align, it's not the person's fault. But in this context, the man is prioritizing his own desire for biological children over his partner's emotional state. That could be seen as self-centered. However, if he truly believes he can't be happy without biological kids and they can't compromise, maybe it's not his fault. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether it's fair to end the relationship over an issue that isn't the girlfriend's fault. Since infertility isn't her choice, the man might be in the wrong for using it as a reason to break up. But if he's clear that this is a non-negotiable for him, then it's a matter of personal values. However, the way he's considering leaving her during a vulnerable time might make him the asshole. \n\nSo, I'm leaning towards A (yes, the author is in the wrong) because he's prioritizing his own needs over her well-being at a tough time, even if he's conflicted. It's a selfish decision, though not entirely without justification. But in terms of being the asshole, it's more about the impact on her.\n"
