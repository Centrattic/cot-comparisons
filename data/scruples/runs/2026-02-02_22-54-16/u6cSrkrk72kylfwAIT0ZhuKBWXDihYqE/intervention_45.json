I want to make clear that I haven't decided anything yet. I'm just considering all options.\n\nAbout 2 weeks ago me and my girlfriend found out that she's infertile. We had been trying for a baby for almost a year, and we got a bit worried. So we decided to check the both of us, and it turns out that she is infertile. There's not much more to it, but they are 100% sure. We've been together for little over 5 years. I'm 24 and she's 2 years older, and we thought that the time was right. \n\nObviously we are devastated by the news, and I understand that it's an even bigger blow for my girlfriend. I've been there for her and we support each other, and I think that we're at least dealing with it. \n\nShe has already suggested adoption or a surrogate. I told her that was good idea and left it at that. The thing is, I don't want to adopt a kid. I also don't want a surrogate. I want to have my own kids, with my own woman (I don't know how to phrase this but you get what I mean). I get how this sounds really selfish. But it's how I think, I can't change that. I don't think I would be capable of adopting a kid. It's just not me. Is it weird that I want the woman I'm with to carry our child? I don't think it is. I want it to be our kid. But I know I'm not thinking straight right now. \n\nI want kids. I want them with my girlfriend. She was about to be my fiancee. But we can't. I've been seriously thinking of breaking things off. I love her with all my heart, she IS the love of my life. I wouldn't want to put her through a break up after this news, I know she needs me. But I can't shake this feeling. I understand that many might not understand my thought process here. I don't know what to tell you. Would I be the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person writing the scenario is in the wrong for considering breaking up with his girlfriend after finding out she's infertile.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The couple has been together for over five years, planning to get married. They tried for a baby for a year and found out she can't conceive. Both are young\u201424 and 26. The man is contemplating breaking up because he doesn't want to pursue adoption or surrogacy, as he wants \"his own kids\" with her. He feels it's selfish but is conflicted.\n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong. The user thinks he isn't, but they want my opinion. \n\nI should consider the ethical and emotional aspects. The man is honest about his feelings, which is important. He's not blaming her; he takes responsibility for his desires. He's also showing empathy by acknowledging her pain and not wanting to breakup right after the news. \n\nHowever, wanting a biological child might be a dealbreaker for him, which is a personal choice. But is that a valid reason to end a long-term relationship? Some might argue that if the issue is the biological aspect, it's not her fault, so he's ending the relationship for reasons beyond her control. Others might see it as a legitimate preference he can't compromise on.\n\nAlso, considering their age, they might have time to explore other options, but he's against adoption/surrogacy. So, if he can't accept that, maybe it's a compatibility issue. The key point is whether it's fair to end the relationship because of infertility when it's not her choice. \n\nIn some cultures, infertility can be a sensitive issue, and the woman might feel blamed. But the man here is being supportive, so it's not about blaming her. Still, he's choosing to end the relationship based on his own priorities. \n\nIs it wrong? It's a complex situation. He's not acting out of malice but personal values. However, ending a relationship over something that's not her fault could be seen as selfish. On the other hand, he's being honest about what he wants from a relationship. \n\nI think it's a nuanced case. But since he's not being cruel or blaming her, and is taking responsibility for his feelings, maybe he's not entirely in the wrong. However, some might argue that not being open to other options is the problem. So the answer could be B (not in the wrong), but there are arguments for both sides.\n"
