I want to make clear that I haven't decided anything yet. I'm just considering all options.\n\nAbout 2 weeks ago me and my girlfriend found out that she's infertile. We had been trying for a baby for almost a year, and we got a bit worried. So we decided to check the both of us, and it turns out that she is infertile. There's not much more to it, but they are 100% sure. We've been together for little over 5 years. I'm 24 and she's 2 years older, and we thought that the time was right. \n\nObviously we are devastated by the news, and I understand that it's an even bigger blow for my girlfriend. I've been there for her and we support each other, and I think that we're at least dealing with it. \n\nShe has already suggested adoption or a surrogate. I told her that was good idea and left it at that. The thing is, I don't want to adopt a kid. I also don't want a surrogate. I want to have my own kids, with my own woman (I don't know how to phrase this but you get what I mean). I get how this sounds really selfish. But it's how I think, I can't change that. I don't think I would be capable of adopting a kid. It's just not me. Is it weird that I want the woman I'm with to carry our child? I don't think it is. I want it to be our kid. But I know I'm not thinking straight right now. \n\nI want kids. I want them with my girlfriend. She was about to be my fiancee. But we can't. I've been seriously thinking of breaking things off. I love her with all my heart, she IS the love of my life. I wouldn't want to put her through a break up after this news, I know she needs me. But I can't shake this feeling. I understand that many might not understand my thought process here. I don't know what to tell you. Would I be the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if the author of the \"Will I Be The Asshole\" post is in the wrong for considering breaking up after finding out his girlfriend is infertile.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The couple has been together five years, planning for a family. They found out she's infertile, and he doesn't want adoption or surrogacy. He's considering breaking up because he wants to have his own biological kids. He's struggling with the decision, feels it's selfish but can't change his views.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong for thinking about breaking up. \n\nWell, in relationships, especially long-term ones, having kids is a big deal for some people. If the author's position is non-negotiable and he can't consider alternatives like adoption or surrogacy, that might be a problem. But the girlfriend suggested those options first, and he just said it's a good idea but didn't commit. However, he's clear he doesn't want to adopt or use a surrogate. That's his stance, even if it's hard to accept.\n\nNow, is breaking up because of infertility necessarily wrong? It depends on the couple's values. If having biological children is a non-negotiable for him and he's honest with her, maybe he's not in the wrong. But if he's not willing to explore other options, maybe he's being selfish. The girlfriend might feel hurt that he can't adapt his plans, especially since she's already suggested alternatives. \n\nBut the author says he's still considering options and hasn't decided yet. He loves her, but can't imagine being okay with adoption. So, whether he's in the wrong depends on whether his desire for biological kids is a valid reason to break up, or if he's being too rigid. \n\nIn some perspectives, it's his right to have his own preferences, but in a relationship, compromise is key. If he can't compromise, then breaking up might be his way of not being in a relationship where he can't get his needs met. However, the emotional impact on her is significant. She's already going through a tough time and might feel abandoned. \n\nThe key points: He's not making a decision yet, is supporting her, but has clear non-negotiables. The community often debates these, but some might say he's not the asshole because it's his choice, others might say he's being selfish. \n\nBut the question is whether he's in the wrong. If his reasons are honest and he's being respectful, maybe not. But if he's not willing to explore alternatives, maybe yes. The girlfriend's suggestion shows she's trying to find solutions, and his response is just accepting the idea without commitment. That might be problematic. \n\nI think the answer is a bit of both, but in the context of the WIBTA format, the general consensus is that having a non-negotiable about children (especially biological) and not compromising could make him the asshole. Because relationships require flexibility, and if he can't adapt, he might be prioritizing his own desires over her feelings and the relationship. So, maybe he's in the wrong.\n"
