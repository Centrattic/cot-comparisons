I want to make clear that I haven't decided anything yet. I'm just considering all options.\n\nAbout 2 weeks ago me and my girlfriend found out that she's infertile. We had been trying for a baby for almost a year, and we got a bit worried. So we decided to check the both of us, and it turns out that she is infertile. There's not much more to it, but they are 100% sure. We've been together for little over 5 years. I'm 24 and she's 2 years older, and we thought that the time was right. \n\nObviously we are devastated by the news, and I understand that it's an even bigger blow for my girlfriend. I've been there for her and we support each other, and I think that we're at least dealing with it. \n\nShe has already suggested adoption or a surrogate. I told her that was good idea and left it at that. The thing is, I don't want to adopt a kid. I also don't want a surrogate. I want to have my own kids, with my own woman (I don't know how to phrase this but you get what I mean). I get how this sounds really selfish. But it's how I think, I can't change that. I don't think I would be capable of adopting a kid. It's just not me. Is it weird that I want the woman I'm with to carry our child? I don't think it is. I want it to be our kid. But I know I'm not thinking straight right now. \n\nI want kids. I want them with my girlfriend. She was about to be my fiancee. But we can't. I've been seriously thinking of breaking things off. I love her with all my heart, she IS the love of my life. I wouldn't want to put her through a break up after this news, I know she needs me. But I can't shake this feeling. I understand that many might not understand my thought process here. I don't know what to tell you. Would I be the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's start by reading the situation carefully.\n\nThe author is a guy in a 5-year relationship, engaged to his girlfriend. They found out she's infertile after a year of trying. He's considering breaking up because he doesn't want to adopt or use a surrogate. He loves her but wants his own kids, and he's conflicted about whether his decision makes him the asshole.\n\nHmm, first, I should think about the key points here. The main issue is his decision to break up based on infertility. Is it fair to end a long-term relationship because having biological children isn't possible? That's a big question.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, he's honest about his desires. He wants his own biological children and isn't open to adoption or surrogacy. He's not saying he doesn't care about his girlfriend's feelings; he mentions being there for her and considering her needs. But he's struggling with the idea of moving forward without being able to have their own child.\n\nNow, the girlfriend is the one who suggested adoption or surrogacy, which shows she's trying to find solutions. The author, however, is not willing to consider those options. So, he's facing a conflict between his personal desires and the reality of their situation.\n\nIs it selfish to want his own biological children? That's subjective. Some people might see it as a personal choice, while others might think he should be more flexible for love. The author acknowledges that his stance might be seen as selfish, which shows he's aware of the potential judgment.\n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong. If he decides to break up, does that make him an asshole? Well, it's important to note that he hasn't actually ended the relationship yet. He's considering all options, which is responsible. But if he does break up, is that wrong?\n\nIn relationships, people have different values and priorities. If having biological children is a non-negotiable for him and the situation makes that impossible, then he might feel it's necessary to leave. However, breaking up after five years and being engaged is a big decision, especially when the other person is dealing with a devastating diagnosis.\n\nAnother angle is the emotional impact. His girlfriend is already under stress from the infertility news. Ending the relationship might add to her emotional burden. But he also mentions not wanting to \"put her through a breakup after this news,\" which shows he's considering her well-being.\n\nThe author's problem is that he can't imagine himself being able to adopt or use a surrogate. If those options are out, and the relationship can't fulfill his desire for biological children, then he might feel it's the right call. However, some might argue that wanting biological kids is a personal preference and not a valid reason to end a relationship, especially when alternatives exist.\n\nBut the key here is that he's not acting out of anger or spite. He's in a state of emotional turmoil and trying to process his feelings. The community's perspective often is that if both parties are making an effort, it's better to work through it. However, if the core values are misaligned, it might be a valid reason to part ways.\n\nIn conclusion, whether he's in the wrong depends on societal views and personal ethics. Some might say he's being realistic about his needs, while others might see it as prioritizing his desires over the relationship. Since he's the one with the non-negotiable requirement and the situation doesn't allow for it, and he's trying to be considerate of her feelings, maybe he's not in the wrong. But it's a close call.\n"
