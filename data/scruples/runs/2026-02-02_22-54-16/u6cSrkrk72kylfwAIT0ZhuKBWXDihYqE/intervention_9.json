I want to make clear that I haven't decided anything yet. I'm just considering all options.\n\nAbout 2 weeks ago me and my girlfriend found out that she's infertile. We had been trying for a baby for almost a year, and we got a bit worried. So we decided to check the both of us, and it turns out that she is infertile. There's not much more to it, but they are 100% sure. We've been together for little over 5 years. I'm 24 and she's 2 years older, and we thought that the time was right. \n\nObviously we are devastated by the news, and I understand that it's an even bigger blow for my girlfriend. I've been there for her and we support each other, and I think that we're at least dealing with it. \n\nShe has already suggested adoption or a surrogate. I told her that was good idea and left it at that. The thing is, I don't want to adopt a kid. I also don't want a surrogate. I want to have my own kids, with my own woman (I don't know how to phrase this but you get what I mean). I get how this sounds really selfish. But it's how I think, I can't change that. I don't think I would be capable of adopting a kid. It's just not me. Is it weird that I want the woman I'm with to carry our child? I don't think it is. I want it to be our kid. But I know I'm not thinking straight right now. \n\nI want kids. I want them with my girlfriend. She was about to be my fiancee. But we can't. I've been seriously thinking of breaking things off. I love her with all my heart, she IS the love of my life. I wouldn't want to put her through a break up after this news, I know she needs me. But I can't shake this feeling. I understand that many might not understand my thought process here. I don't know what to tell you. Would I be the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the WIBTA post is in the wrong after considering breaking up with his girlfriend due to her infertility. The author mentions they tried for a baby for a year, got tested, and she's infertile. He's 24, they've been together over five years, and he's thinking of breaking up because he doesn't want adoption or surrogacy. He loves her but doesn't think he can adopt.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical and emotional aspects. Infertility is a sensitive issue. The girlfriend might already be hurting, and the breakup could add to her emotional burden. The author is considering this because his personal desire for biological children isn't met. But is that a valid reason to break up?\n\nOn one hand, people have different values. If having a biological child is a non-negotiable for him, maybe he's being honest about his limitations. But on the other hand, ending the relationship immediately after such a traumatic discovery might seem harsh. The girlfriend might feel rejected or that the author is prioritizing his desires over her well-being. Also, he mentions she suggested adoption or surrogacy, and he dismissed it without really engaging. That could be seen as not trying to find a solution together.\n\nThe question is whether his decision is justified. Some might say it's his right to be honest about his limitations, especially if he can't support adoption. Others might argue that he's being selfish, not considering her feelings, and not making an effort to adjust his desires. The support he's given her so far is good, but the potential breakup could be seen as abandoning her during a difficult time.\n\nI think the key points are mutual respect, communication, and effort to find alternatives. The author didn't explore alternatives further, just considered breaking up. If he's not open to adoption, maybe that's a deal-breaker for him, but breaking up right after the diagnosis might not give them time to adjust or find another path. Also, the emotional impact on her is significant. So, while he's honest about his feelings, the timing and approach might make him in the wrong.\n"
