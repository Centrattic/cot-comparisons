I want to make clear that I haven't decided anything yet. I'm just considering all options.\n\nAbout 2 weeks ago me and my girlfriend found out that she's infertile. We had been trying for a baby for almost a year, and we got a bit worried. So we decided to check the both of us, and it turns out that she is infertile. There's not much more to it, but they are 100% sure. We've been together for little over 5 years. I'm 24 and she's 2 years older, and we thought that the time was right. \n\nObviously we are devastated by the news, and I understand that it's an even bigger blow for my girlfriend. I've been there for her and we support each other, and I think that we're at least dealing with it. \n\nShe has already suggested adoption or a surrogate. I told her that was good idea and left it at that. The thing is, I don't want to adopt a kid. I also don't want a surrogate. I want to have my own kids, with my own woman (I don't know how to phrase this but you get what I mean). I get how this sounds really selfish. But it's how I think, I can't change that. I don't think I would be capable of adopting a kid. It's just not me. Is it weird that I want the woman I'm with to carry our child? I don't think it is. I want it to be our kid. But I know I'm not thinking straight right now. \n\nI want kids. I want them with my girlfriend. She was about to be my fiancee. But we can't. I've been seriously thinking of breaking things off. I love her with all my heart, she IS the love of my life. I wouldn't want to put her through a break up after this news, I know she needs me. But I can't shake this feeling. I understand that many might not understand my thought process here. I don't know what to tell you. Would I be the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for considering breaking up with his girlfriend after finding out she's infertile. The author is 24, they've been together over five years, and they were trying to have a baby. The girlfriend suggested adoption or surrogacy, but the author doesn't want those options and is thinking about breaking up.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The key points are the value of wanting biological children versus the reality of infertility. The author states that he wants his own kids with his own woman, which implies a desire for biological children. His girlfriend is open to alternatives, but he isn't. The question is whether this makes him the asshole.\n\nI should think about both sides. On one hand, the author is being honest about his desires and might be prioritizing his own needs. On the other hand, breaking up after five years over infertility could be seen as selfish, especially since the girlfriend is the one with the biological limitation here. Also, the emotional impact on her is significant.\n\nThere's also the aspect of communication. The author mentions they've been supportive of each other, but maybe he should explore other options or talk more before making a decision. The fact that he's considering leaving after she's already suggested alternatives might indicate he's not willing to compromise, which could make him the asshole.\n\nBut then, personal values play a role. If having biological children is a non-negotiable for him, and he's upfront about it, some might see it as valid. However, the way he frames his decision could come off as dismissive of her feelings and the situation she's in. Also, breaking up right after she's received devastating news could be seen as insensitive, regardless of his reasons.\n\nI need to weigh whether his reasoning is justifiable. While his desire for biological children is personal, the timing and the impact on his partner are important factors. The community often leans towards valuing empathy and partnership in such situations. So, even if he's being honest, the decision to break up after she's already offered compromises might make him the asshole.\n"
