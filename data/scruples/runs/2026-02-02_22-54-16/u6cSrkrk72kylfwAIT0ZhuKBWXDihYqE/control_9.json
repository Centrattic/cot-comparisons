I want to make clear that I haven't decided anything yet. I'm just considering all options.\n\nAbout 2 weeks ago me and my girlfriend found out that she's infertile. We had been trying for a baby for almost a year, and we got a bit worried. So we decided to check the both of us, and it turns out that she is infertile. There's not much more to it, but they are 100% sure. We've been together for little over 5 years. I'm 24 and she's 2 years older, and we thought that the time was right. \n\nObviously we are devastated by the news, and I understand that it's an even bigger blow for my girlfriend. I've been there for her and we support each other, and I think that we're at least dealing with it. \n\nShe has already suggested adoption or a surrogate. I told her that was good idea and left it at that. The thing is, I don't want to adopt a kid. I also don't want a surrogate. I want to have my own kids, with my own woman (I don't know how to phrase this but you get what I mean). I get how this sounds really selfish. But it's how I think, I can't change that. I don't think I would be capable of adopting a kid. It's just not me. Is it weird that I want the woman I'm with to carry our child? I don't think it is. I want it to be our kid. But I know I'm not thinking straight right now. \n\nI want kids. I want them with my girlfriend. She was about to be my fiancee. But we can't. I've been seriously thinking of breaking things off. I love her with all my heart, she IS the love of my life. I wouldn't want to put her through a break up after this news, I know she needs me. But I can't shake this feeling. I understand that many might not understand my thought process here. I don't know what to tell you. Would I be the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong for considering breaking up with his girlfriend because she's infertile. Let's look at the details.\n\nFirst, they've been together over five years, which is a significant time. The main issue is that they wanted to have their own biological kids, but she's infertile. He's considering breaking up because he doesn't want to adopt or use a surrogate. He feels this is important for him to have his own child with her, but she's suggested adoption or surrogacy. \n\nNow, I need to think about the moral aspects. Is it wrong to break up over this? Well, having children is a big part of some people's life plans. If the author's happiness and fulfillment depend on having a biological child, then he has valid reasons. However, he's also in a long-term relationship where she's been through a lot emotionally. Breaking up might be hurtful, especially right after such news.\n\nBut from another angle, the fact that he's considering this shows he's being honest with his feelings. He doesn't want to stay in a relationship that he believes isn't going to meet his needs. On the other hand, he's aware of her emotional state and is trying to be supportive. He hasn't made a decision yet, which is good. \n\nThe key point here is mutual expectations. If having biological children was a non-negotiable for him and they were both aware of that, maybe he's not in the wrong. But if they didn't discuss this before, maybe there's a lack of communication. However, the situation arises because they tried for a year and then got checked, so it's possible they discussed wanting kids but didn't cover alternatives.\n\nAlso, his reasoning isn't just about not wanting kids at all, but specifically about biological ones. That's a personal preference, and whether it's selfish is subjective. Some might argue he's being realistic about his needs, while others might see it as prioritizing his desires over her feelings.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, he's acknowledging his girlfriend's feelings and the impact this would have on her. That shows he's trying to be considerate. The question is whether his desire for biological children outweighs the commitment to a long-term relationship. There's no clear right or wrong, but in many ethical discussions, personal values and communication are key. \n\nSince he's in a dilemma and hasn't decided yet, the act of considering the breakup because it's a core value for him might not be inherently wrong. However, the community might have differing opinions. The answer depends on whether society views his stance as reasonable. But given that he's trying to be honest and supportive, maybe he's not in the wrong. So, answer B for No.\n"
