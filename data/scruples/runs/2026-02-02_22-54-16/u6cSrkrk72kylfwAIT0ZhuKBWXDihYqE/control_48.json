I want to make clear that I haven't decided anything yet. I'm just considering all options.\n\nAbout 2 weeks ago me and my girlfriend found out that she's infertile. We had been trying for a baby for almost a year, and we got a bit worried. So we decided to check the both of us, and it turns out that she is infertile. There's not much more to it, but they are 100% sure. We've been together for little over 5 years. I'm 24 and she's 2 years older, and we thought that the time was right. \n\nObviously we are devastated by the news, and I understand that it's an even bigger blow for my girlfriend. I've been there for her and we support each other, and I think that we're at least dealing with it. \n\nShe has already suggested adoption or a surrogate. I told her that was good idea and left it at that. The thing is, I don't want to adopt a kid. I also don't want a surrogate. I want to have my own kids, with my own woman (I don't know how to phrase this but you get what I mean). I get how this sounds really selfish. But it's how I think, I can't change that. I don't think I would be capable of adopting a kid. It's just not me. Is it weird that I want the woman I'm with to carry our child? I don't think it is. I want it to be our kid. But I know I'm not thinking straight right now. \n\nI want kids. I want them with my girlfriend. She was about to be my fiancee. But we can't. I've been seriously thinking of breaking things off. I love her with all my heart, she IS the love of my life. I wouldn't want to put her through a break up after this news, I know she needs me. But I can't shake this feeling. I understand that many might not understand my thought process here. I don't know what to tell you. Would I be the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for considering breaking up because his girlfriend is infertile. First, I need to understand the situation. They've been together over five years, both 24 and 26, trying to have a baby for a year. The girlfriend is infertile, and the author doesn't want adoption or surrogacy. He feels conflicted about breaking up but is considering it because he wants biological kids.\n\nSo, the main issue here is whether it's justified to break up over infertility when the woman is unable to conceive, and the man is not open to alternatives. From a moral standpoint, some might argue that it's selfish to end the relationship based on this, especially since the infertility isn't the woman's fault. On the other hand, people have different desires regarding having biological children, and the man's feelings are genuine here.\n\nI should consider cultural perspectives too. In some cultures, biological parenthood is highly valued, but others prioritize the emotional bond. Also, the fact that the woman is offering alternatives like adoption or surrogacy shows she's trying to work around the issue. The man's refusal of those options might be seen as not being flexible or supportive.\n\nBut then again, the man is in a lot of emotional pain and might not realize how this decision affects his girlfriend. Ending the relationship right after such a revelation could be hurtful and seem like a cop-out. He mentions she needs him, so breaking up might leave her in a worse place emotionally. \n\nThe key points are: mutual support during the diagnosis, the man's clear stance against alternatives, and the emotional impact. The question is whether his desire for biological children justifies breaking up. I think most people would say it's selfish, but it's a personal choice. However, in terms of being \"in the wrong,\" it's likely A because he's prioritizing his biological wishes over the relationship and his partner's feelings, even if he's conflicted.\n"
