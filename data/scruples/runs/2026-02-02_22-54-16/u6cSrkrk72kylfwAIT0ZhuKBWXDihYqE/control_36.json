I want to make clear that I haven't decided anything yet. I'm just considering all options.\n\nAbout 2 weeks ago me and my girlfriend found out that she's infertile. We had been trying for a baby for almost a year, and we got a bit worried. So we decided to check the both of us, and it turns out that she is infertile. There's not much more to it, but they are 100% sure. We've been together for little over 5 years. I'm 24 and she's 2 years older, and we thought that the time was right. \n\nObviously we are devastated by the news, and I understand that it's an even bigger blow for my girlfriend. I've been there for her and we support each other, and I think that we're at least dealing with it. \n\nShe has already suggested adoption or a surrogate. I told her that was good idea and left it at that. The thing is, I don't want to adopt a kid. I also don't want a surrogate. I want to have my own kids, with my own woman (I don't know how to phrase this but you get what I mean). I get how this sounds really selfish. But it's how I think, I can't change that. I don't think I would be capable of adopting a kid. It's just not me. Is it weird that I want the woman I'm with to carry our child? I don't think it is. I want it to be our kid. But I know I'm not thinking straight right now. \n\nI want kids. I want them with my girlfriend. She was about to be my fiancee. But we can't. I've been seriously thinking of breaking things off. I love her with all my heart, she IS the love of my life. I wouldn't want to put her through a break up after this news, I know she needs me. But I can't shake this feeling. I understand that many might not understand my thought process here. I don't know what to tell you. Would I be the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this situation is in the wrong for considering breaking up with his girlfriend after finding out she's infertile. The author is 24, they've been together over five years, and they were planning to get married. They tried for a baby for a year and discovered she's infertile. He's considering breaking up because he doesn't want adoption or surrogacy, and he wants \"his own kids\" with her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the moral and ethical aspects. The author is torn between his desire for biological children and his love for his girlfriend. He acknowledges that his feelings might seem selfish but can't change them. The key points here are consent, mutual understanding, and whether the decision is fair.\n\nIn relationships, especially when considering marriage, it's important that both partners are on the same page regarding major life decisions like having children. The girlfriend suggested adoption or surrogacy, which the author dismissed without fully engaging in the conversation. That might be a problem because it's her suggestion, and he's not open to alternatives she's willing to consider. \n\nHowever, the author is struggling with his own feelings and is honest about them. He loves her but feels he can't adopt. Is it fair to end the relationship because of a personal preference that the other partner is willing to accommodate? The girlfriend is willing to explore options, but the author isn't open to them. That could lead to resentment on her part if the relationship continues, or on his part if it doesn't. \n\nAlso, the emotional impact is significant. The girlfriend is likely more affected by the infertility, and the author is considering leaving her during a vulnerable time. That could be seen as inconsiderate. But the author also feels that staying might lead to future unhappiness because of his inability to accept alternatives.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. From a moral standpoint, if the girlfriend is willing to explore alternatives and the author isn't, maybe the wrong is in not being open-minded. But the author is being honest about his feelings. It's a complex situation where both sides have valid points. The author isn't making a decision yet, just considering. The key issue is whether his desire for biological children overrides the commitment he has to his partner. \n\nIn many cases, people have different thresholds for compromise. If the author is unwilling to compromise, even though the partner is willing, perhaps he is in the wrong. However, some might argue that he's being honest about his non-negotiables. The answer might depend on cultural views, but generally, relationships require mutual compromise. If the author is not willing to meet her halfway, he could be at fault. The girlfriend might feel used if he leaves after she's already been through the emotional trauma of infertility. But the author is also being truthful about his needs. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might lean towards A (the author is in the wrong) because he's prioritizing his own desire for biological children over the existing relationship, and the girlfriend is willing to find alternatives. However, it's a tough call because he's also being honest. The community might split, but in the \"Would I Be the Asshole?\" context, the author is likely seen as the asshole for considering leaving over this when the partner is willing to compromise. So the answer is A.\n"
