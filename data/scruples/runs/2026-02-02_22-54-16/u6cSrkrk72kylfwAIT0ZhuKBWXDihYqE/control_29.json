I want to make clear that I haven't decided anything yet. I'm just considering all options.\n\nAbout 2 weeks ago me and my girlfriend found out that she's infertile. We had been trying for a baby for almost a year, and we got a bit worried. So we decided to check the both of us, and it turns out that she is infertile. There's not much more to it, but they are 100% sure. We've been together for little over 5 years. I'm 24 and she's 2 years older, and we thought that the time was right. \n\nObviously we are devastated by the news, and I understand that it's an even bigger blow for my girlfriend. I've been there for her and we support each other, and I think that we're at least dealing with it. \n\nShe has already suggested adoption or a surrogate. I told her that was good idea and left it at that. The thing is, I don't want to adopt a kid. I also don't want a surrogate. I want to have my own kids, with my own woman (I don't know how to phrase this but you get what I mean). I get how this sounds really selfish. But it's how I think, I can't change that. I don't think I would be capable of adopting a kid. It's just not me. Is it weird that I want the woman I'm with to carry our child? I don't think it is. I want it to be our kid. But I know I'm not thinking straight right now. \n\nI want kids. I want them with my girlfriend. She was about to be my fiancee. But we can't. I've been seriously thinking of breaking things off. I love her with all my heart, she IS the love of my life. I wouldn't want to put her through a break up after this news, I know she needs me. But I can't shake this feeling. I understand that many might not understand my thought process here. I don't know what to tell you. Would I be the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the WIBTA (Would I Be Terrible for...) post is in the wrong. The situation is that they found out their girlfriend is infertile and are considering breaking up because they don't want adoption or surrogacy. The author is 24, in a 5-year relationship, and wants biological kids.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The key points here are the author's reasons for considering the breakup. They mention not wanting adoption or surrogacy, which are alternatives to biological children. The girlfriend has already suggested those options, but the author isn't open to them. The author loves his girlfriend but feels he can't compromise on wanting his own biological children. \n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong. From a moral standpoint, relationships require compromise. If the author is unwilling to consider the alternatives she proposed, that might be seen as selfish. The girlfriend is in a more vulnerable position here, dealing with infertility, which can be emotionally taxing. The author is prioritizing his desire for biological kids over her emotional well-being and the relationship. \n\nBut there's also the aspect of personal values. If having biological children is a non-negotiable for him, maybe he's being honest about his limitations. However, breaking up immediately after the news, when she needs support, could be seen as cruel. The author mentions they support each other, but the thought of breaking up is still there. \n\nThere's also the element of timing. The author hasn't made a decision yet, just considering options. But the mere consideration of breaking up solely based on infertility, without exploring all possibilities (like the alternatives she suggested), might be problematic. \n\nIn many cultures, the ability to have children is seen as important, but relationships are supposed to involve mutual respect and compromise. If the author isn't open to adoption or surrogacy, that's a personal choice, but it might be selfish if he's not willing to adjust his stance to maintain the relationship. \n\nOn the other hand, if he truly cannot be happy with adoption, it might be better to part ways than to stay in a relationship where one partner's needs aren't met. However, the way he's framing it\u2014considering breaking up while she's still processing the news\u2014could be seen as insensitive. \n\nSo, weighing these factors, the author is prioritizing his own desires over the relationship and his partner's feelings. The girlfriend has already suggested solutions he dismissed. If he can't accept those, it's his choice, but it's considered selfish and could be seen as the wrong choice. Therefore, the answer is A (Yes, he's in the wrong).\n"
