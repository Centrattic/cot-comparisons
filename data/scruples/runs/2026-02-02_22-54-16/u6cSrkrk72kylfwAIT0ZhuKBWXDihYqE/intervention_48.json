I want to make clear that I haven't decided anything yet. I'm just considering all options.\n\nAbout 2 weeks ago me and my girlfriend found out that she's infertile. We had been trying for a baby for almost a year, and we got a bit worried. So we decided to check the both of us, and it turns out that she is infertile. There's not much more to it, but they are 100% sure. We've been together for little over 5 years. I'm 24 and she's 2 years older, and we thought that the time was right. \n\nObviously we are devastated by the news, and I understand that it's an even bigger blow for my girlfriend. I've been there for her and we support each other, and I think that we're at least dealing with it. \n\nShe has already suggested adoption or a surrogate. I told her that was good idea and left it at that. The thing is, I don't want to adopt a kid. I also don't want a surrogate. I want to have my own kids, with my own woman (I don't know how to phrase this but you get what I mean). I get how this sounds really selfish. But it's how I think, I can't change that. I don't think I would be capable of adopting a kid. It's just not me. Is it weird that I want the woman I'm with to carry our child? I don't think it is. I want it to be our kid. But I know I'm not thinking straight right now. \n\nI want kids. I want them with my girlfriend. She was about to be my fiancee. But we can't. I've been seriously thinking of breaking things off. I love her with all my heart, she IS the love of my life. I wouldn't want to put her through a break up after this news, I know she needs me. But I can't shake this feeling. I understand that many might not understand my thought process here. I don't know what to tell you. Would I be the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for considering breaking up with his girlfriend after learning she's infertile. The author mentions that they wanted their own biological child and aren't open to adoption or surrogacy. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. The author is in a long-term relationship, over five years, and they both wanted kids. Now that the option of biological children is off the table, he's contemplating breaking up. Is it fair to end a relationship because of this? On one hand, not wanting to adopt or use a surrogate is a personal choice. But relationships require compromise, especially on big issues like having kids. \n\nThe girlfriend is already suggesting alternatives, and the author is dismissing those options. That could be seen as not being supportive during a tough time. Also, the emotional impact on her is significant. Ending the relationship might be more about his personal desires not being met, which could be seen as selfish.\n\nBut then again, people have the right to their preferences. If having biological children is a non-negotiable for him, and he realizes that he can't adjust, maybe it's not fair to stay in the relationship. However, the way he's framing it\u2014considering breaking up immediately after such a devastating discovery\u2014might come off as insensitive. He acknowledges it's selfish but still feels it's valid. \n\nI should also think about the cultural context. In some societies, having biological children is highly valued, and not being able to might affect relationships. But in modern times, adoption and surrogacy are more accepted, so refusing them might be viewed as rigid. \n\nThe key points are: the author is in a long-term relationship where they both wanted kids, the girlfriend is trying to find solutions, and the author isn't open to alternatives. His reasoning is that he wants his own child from the woman he's with, but he also admits it's selfish. The question is whether his desire for biological children justifies breaking up, considering the emotional toll on her. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether his decision is based on a fundamental incompatibility he hadn't considered before. If he hadn't discussed his stance on adoption and surrogacy beforehand, it might be unfair to her. But since they had been trying for a baby, maybe biological children were a shared goal. Now that it's not possible, he's realizing his priorities. However, breaking up right after she's dealt a blow could be seen as inconsiderate. \n\nSo, the author might not be \"in the wrong\" in terms of having the right to his preferences, but ethically, it's questionable. The answer might depend on whether the decision is based on a non-negotiable aspect of his life goals or if he's being unrealistic. Since he admits it's selfish, maybe the answer leans towards A (wrong) because he's prioritizing his own desires without sufficient compromise, especially when his partner is already trying to adapt. But if he's honest about his needs and it's causing him to reconsider the relationship, perhaps it's a matter of personal ethics. I'm a bit torn here. Maybe the answer is A because he's not considering her feelings enough and is acting on his own wants without fully supporting her through this. So, I'll go with A.\n"
