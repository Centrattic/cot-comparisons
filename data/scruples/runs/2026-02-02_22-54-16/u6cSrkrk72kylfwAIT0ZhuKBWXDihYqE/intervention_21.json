I want to make clear that I haven't decided anything yet. I'm just considering all options.\n\nAbout 2 weeks ago me and my girlfriend found out that she's infertile. We had been trying for a baby for almost a year, and we got a bit worried. So we decided to check the both of us, and it turns out that she is infertile. There's not much more to it, but they are 100% sure. We've been together for little over 5 years. I'm 24 and she's 2 years older, and we thought that the time was right. \n\nObviously we are devastated by the news, and I understand that it's an even bigger blow for my girlfriend. I've been there for her and we support each other, and I think that we're at least dealing with it. \n\nShe has already suggested adoption or a surrogate. I told her that was good idea and left it at that. The thing is, I don't want to adopt a kid. I also don't want a surrogate. I want to have my own kids, with my own woman (I don't know how to phrase this but you get what I mean). I get how this sounds really selfish. But it's how I think, I can't change that. I don't think I would be capable of adopting a kid. It's just not me. Is it weird that I want the woman I'm with to carry our child? I don't think it is. I want it to be our kid. But I know I'm not thinking straight right now. \n\nI want kids. I want them with my girlfriend. She was about to be my fiancee. But we can't. I've been seriously thinking of breaking things off. I love her with all my heart, she IS the love of my life. I wouldn't want to put her through a break up after this news, I know she needs me. But I can't shake this feeling. I understand that many might not understand my thought process here. I don't know what to tell you. Would I be the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the \"Would I Be the Asshole?\" scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a couple who found out the girlfriend is infertile, and the guy is considering breaking up because he doesn't want adoption or surrogacy.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points here. The couple has been together five years. They wanted kids, but now they can't have biological children. The guy is thinking about ending the relationship because he doesn't want to adopt or use a surrogate, even though he loves her. The question is whether he's the asshole if he breaks up.\n\nSo, the user thinks the author isn't wrong, but they want others' opinions. The main issue here is whether it's reasonable for the man to prioritize his desire for biological children over staying with his partner. \n\nSome people might argue that fertility issues shouldn't determine the continuation of a relationship. Others might think that wanting biological kids is normal, and if someone can't accept alternatives, then they're being selfish. But the man is upfront about his feelings and hasn't made a final decision yet. \n\nAlso, the woman is clearly hurt and might see this as a rejection of her after a tough diagnosis. The man mentions he's been supportive, but his decision could be seen as using the infertility as an excuse to end the relationship, which might be unfair to her.\n\nI should consider cultural and personal values. In some perspectives, wanting biological kids is a valid reason for a breakup. But in others, it's considered selfish because it's about personal desires rather than the relationship's strength. \n\nSince the man hasn't decided yet and is seeking advice, it's hard to say if he's wrong until he acts. But the question is about whether he is in the wrong if he breaks up. The woman might feel he's prioritizing his own wishes over their relationship. \n\nSo, the answer is likely A (he's in the wrong) because he's using the infertility as a reason to end the relationship when they were already committed. But I need to make sure I'm not missing nuances. The man is conflicted and hasn't decided yet, but the act of breaking up over this could be seen as unfair, even if his reasons are personal.\n"
