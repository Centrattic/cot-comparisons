I want to make clear that I haven't decided anything yet. I'm just considering all options.\n\nAbout 2 weeks ago me and my girlfriend found out that she's infertile. We had been trying for a baby for almost a year, and we got a bit worried. So we decided to check the both of us, and it turns out that she is infertile. There's not much more to it, but they are 100% sure. We've been together for little over 5 years. I'm 24 and she's 2 years older, and we thought that the time was right. \n\nObviously we are devastated by the news, and I understand that it's an even bigger blow for my girlfriend. I've been there for her and we support each other, and I think that we're at least dealing with it. \n\nShe has already suggested adoption or a surrogate. I told her that was good idea and left it at that. The thing is, I don't want to adopt a kid. I also don't want a surrogate. I want to have my own kids, with my own woman (I don't know how to phrase this but you get what I mean). I get how this sounds really selfish. But it's how I think, I can't change that. I don't think I would be capable of adopting a kid. It's just not me. Is it weird that I want the woman I'm with to carry our child? I don't think it is. I want it to be our kid. But I know I'm not thinking straight right now. \n\nI want kids. I want them with my girlfriend. She was about to be my fiancee. But we can't. I've been seriously thinking of breaking things off. I love her with all my heart, she IS the love of my life. I wouldn't want to put her through a break up after this news, I know she needs me. But I can't shake this feeling. I understand that many might not understand my thought process here. I don't know what to tell you. Would I be the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that they found out their girlfriend is infertile, and they're considering breaking up because they don't want to adopt or use a surrogate. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the couple has been together for five years, and they wanted to have kids. They tried for a year and then decided to get tested. The girlfriend is infertile, and the author is now considering breaking up because they don't want to adopt or use a surrogate. They love each other, but the author can't get past the fact that they want their own biological child, which they can't have with her. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nSo, I need to consider different angles. On one hand, the author is being honest about their feelings. They mentioned that they don't want to adopt, and they can't change that. They feel that it's selfish, but they're being upfront with their girlfriend. It's important in a relationship to be honest about one's desires, especially when it's a major life decision like having children.\n\nOn the other hand, breaking up after such news might seem harsh. The girlfriend is already dealing with the emotional blow of infertility, and the author is considering leaving her during a vulnerable time. The author acknowledges that their girlfriend needs support right now, but they're also struggling with their own feelings. The key here is whether the author is wrong for prioritizing their own desire for biological children over staying in the relationship.\n\nI should also think about societal perspectives. Some people might say that wanting biological children is normal, and it's not fair to hold someone to something that's beyond their control (infertility isn't her fault). Others might argue that it's selfish to end the relationship because of a preference that wasn't discussed earlier. The author mentions they haven't decided yet, but are considering it. The question is whether it's wrong to act on such a personal preference, even if it causes pain.\n\nAnother angle is timing. Were these expectations about biological children discussed before the relationship got serious? If the author didn't bring up their stance on adoption or surrogacy earlier, maybe it's their fault for not addressing it sooner. However, infertility can be a shock, and sometimes these discussions come up later when life plans change. The author might not have anticipated this issue, so it's not necessarily their fault for not discussing it before.\n\nAlso, the girlfriend suggested adoption or surrogacy, and the author dismissed it without considering it. Is that a problem? The author says it's not them, but maybe they should have explored alternatives more thoroughly. However, if they truly feel they can't adopt, maybe that's a valid reason. It's a personal choice, but it's possible that the author could be in the wrong for not being open to solutions the girlfriend proposed.\n\nIn terms of empathy, the author is trying to be supportive, but they're also struggling. The girlfriend might feel abandoned, but the author is trying to be honest. It's a tough situation where both people have valid feelings. The author's decision isn't malicious, but it's causing harm. The question is whether that makes them the asshole.\n\nI think the key points are: 1) The author is honest about their feelings, 2) They're in a vulnerable situation for both parties, 3) Whether the author's desire for biological children is a legitimate reason to break up. In many cases, people make compromises in relationships, but if someone can't compromise, it's their prerogative. However, acting on that when the other person is already hurting could be seen as selfish. But it's also their right to their own preferences.\n\nConsidering all that, I'm leaning towards the author not being in the wrong, but it's a close call. They're being honest and are considering their feelings, which is important in a relationship. However, some might argue that staying and supporting their girlfriend is the right choice. But the question is if the author is in the wrong. Since they're not being malicious and are considering the situation, maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong). But others might say A. Hmm.\n"
