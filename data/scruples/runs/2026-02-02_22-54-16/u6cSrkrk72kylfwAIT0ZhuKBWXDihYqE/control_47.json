I want to make clear that I haven't decided anything yet. I'm just considering all options.\n\nAbout 2 weeks ago me and my girlfriend found out that she's infertile. We had been trying for a baby for almost a year, and we got a bit worried. So we decided to check the both of us, and it turns out that she is infertile. There's not much more to it, but they are 100% sure. We've been together for little over 5 years. I'm 24 and she's 2 years older, and we thought that the time was right. \n\nObviously we are devastated by the news, and I understand that it's an even bigger blow for my girlfriend. I've been there for her and we support each other, and I think that we're at least dealing with it. \n\nShe has already suggested adoption or a surrogate. I told her that was good idea and left it at that. The thing is, I don't want to adopt a kid. I also don't want a surrogate. I want to have my own kids, with my own woman (I don't know how to phrase this but you get what I mean). I get how this sounds really selfish. But it's how I think, I can't change that. I don't think I would be capable of adopting a kid. It's just not me. Is it weird that I want the woman I'm with to carry our child? I don't think it is. I want it to be our kid. But I know I'm not thinking straight right now. \n\nI want kids. I want them with my girlfriend. She was about to be my fiancee. But we can't. I've been seriously thinking of breaking things off. I love her with all my heart, she IS the love of my life. I wouldn't want to put her through a break up after this news, I know she needs me. But I can't shake this feeling. I understand that many might not understand my thought process here. I don't know what to tell you. Would I be the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this query. The user is asking whether the author of the WIBTA scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves breaking up with a girlfriend after finding out she's infertile. The author is considering breaking up because he wants his own biological children, doesn't want adoption or surrogacy, and feels conflicted about moving forward.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the moral and ethical angles here. The author loves his girlfriend, acknowledges her feelings, and is struggling with his own desires. He's not making a decision yet but is contemplating it. The key points are his reasons for considering the breakup and whether those reasons are valid or selfish.\n\nBiological child desire is a personal choice. Some people place high value on having biological children, while others don't. The author's stance that he doesn't want adoption or surrogacy suggests that his vision of parenthood is deeply tied to biological ties. However, his girlfriend is offering alternatives, which he dismisses without much engagement. This could be seen as not being supportive or considering her perspective fully.\n\nThe author mentions he can't change his feelings about wanting his own kids with his partner. That's his truth, but is it fair to end the relationship over it? Relationships require compromise. If they can't find a middle ground, maybe the breakup is necessary for both to find happiness elsewhere. However, timing matters. Ending it right after such a traumatic discovery might be seen as insensitive, as she's going through a major emotional crisis.\n\nAlso, the author's reasoning might be influenced by current emotional states. He admits he's not thinking straight. Taking more time to process, perhaps exploring other options together, might be healthier. But if he truly can't accept alternatives and sees no future without biological children, maybe it's a deal-breaker.\n\nSocietal views vary. Some might see his stance as selfish, prioritizing his desire for biological kids over the existing relationship. Others might empathize with his personal values. The question is whether his actions (considering breakup) are wrong. Since he hasn't acted yet and is seeking advice, it's about the intent rather than the action.\n\nIn conclusion, while having a biological child is a personal desire, the decision to break up immediately after the revelation might not consider his partner's needs and could be seen as self-centered. However, if he can't compromise, it's a personal choice, but the timing and emotional impact on his girlfriend might make him the asshole. So, the answer would lean towards A (he's in the wrong).\n"
