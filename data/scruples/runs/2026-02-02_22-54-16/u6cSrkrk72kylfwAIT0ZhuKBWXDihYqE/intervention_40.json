I want to make clear that I haven't decided anything yet. I'm just considering all options.\n\nAbout 2 weeks ago me and my girlfriend found out that she's infertile. We had been trying for a baby for almost a year, and we got a bit worried. So we decided to check the both of us, and it turns out that she is infertile. There's not much more to it, but they are 100% sure. We've been together for little over 5 years. I'm 24 and she's 2 years older, and we thought that the time was right. \n\nObviously we are devastated by the news, and I understand that it's an even bigger blow for my girlfriend. I've been there for her and we support each other, and I think that we're at least dealing with it. \n\nShe has already suggested adoption or a surrogate. I told her that was good idea and left it at that. The thing is, I don't want to adopt a kid. I also don't want a surrogate. I want to have my own kids, with my own woman (I don't know how to phrase this but you get what I mean). I get how this sounds really selfish. But it's how I think, I can't change that. I don't think I would be capable of adopting a kid. It's just not me. Is it weird that I want the woman I'm with to carry our child? I don't think it is. I want it to be our kid. But I know I'm not thinking straight right now. \n\nI want kids. I want them with my girlfriend. She was about to be my fiancee. But we can't. I've been seriously thinking of breaking things off. I love her with all my heart, she IS the love of my life. I wouldn't want to put her through a break up after this news, I know she needs me. But I can't shake this feeling. I understand that many might not understand my thought process here. I don't know what to tell you. Would I be the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through the situation carefully.\n\nThe author is a guy in a 5-year relationship with his girlfriend, who is 26. They found out she's infertile after trying for a baby for a year. He hasn't decided yet whether to break up but is considering it because he doesn't want adoption or a surrogate. He wants his own biological kids with his current partner, and since that's not possible, he's thinking about ending things. He loves her and feels it's selfish, but he can't imagine adopting. The question is whether he's wrong for considering a breakup over this.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The main issue is about the inability to conceive biologically and how that affects his decision to end the relationship. The user says he hasn't decided yet, just exploring options. He acknowledges his girlfriend's feelings and that she suggested adoption/surrogacy, which he dismissed.\n\nNow, considering if he's in the wrong. From an ethical standpoint, people have different values. If having biological children is important to him, is it wrong to leave the relationship because it can't fulfill that desire? On one hand, he's being honest about his wants. On the other, he might be prioritizing his desires over her feelings and the years of the relationship. The girlfriend is infertile, which isn't her fault, and she's offering solutions. He's saying he doesn't want those solutions. That could be seen as unfair or selfish.\n\nBut then, relationships are about mutual compatibility. If having biological children is non-negotiable for him, and he can't accept alternatives, maybe he's not wrong in considering the breakup. However, the way he's framing it could be problematic. He's putting the onus on her infertility, which is out of her control, rather than his inability to accept alternatives. That could make him the asshole for not being flexible. Also, breaking up during a time when she's already dealing with emotional trauma might be seen as insensitive.\n\nI need to weigh the factors. The girlfriend's infertility isn't her fault, and she's suggested alternatives. The author is choosing to leave because he doesn't want adoption, which is his personal choice, but it's causing a breakup. Some might argue that he should work through this with her, while others might say he's being honest about his needs. The key is whether the decision is based on her condition rather than her actions. Since infertility is a medical issue, not a choice, ending the relationship for that reason could be seen as discriminatory or unfair.\n\nAdditionally, he's not considering the emotional impact on her. Even if he loves her, breaking up after such news might be seen as cruel, especially if she's relying on him for support. The way he's considering leaving without fully processing the situation might indicate immaturity in handling the problem. However, if he believes that he can't be happy without biological children and that he can't adjust, it's a personal choice. But the fact that he's dismissing her solutions and causing a breakup over it might be where he's in the wrong.\n\nSo, in terms of answer A or B, I think the author is in the wrong (A) because he's ending the relationship over something beyond his partner's control and not being open to alternatives she's willing to consider. Even though having biological kids is important, the way he's handling it could be seen as selfish and insensitive.\n"
