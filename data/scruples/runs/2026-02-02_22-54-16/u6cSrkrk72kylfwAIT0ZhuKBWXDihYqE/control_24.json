I want to make clear that I haven't decided anything yet. I'm just considering all options.\n\nAbout 2 weeks ago me and my girlfriend found out that she's infertile. We had been trying for a baby for almost a year, and we got a bit worried. So we decided to check the both of us, and it turns out that she is infertile. There's not much more to it, but they are 100% sure. We've been together for little over 5 years. I'm 24 and she's 2 years older, and we thought that the time was right. \n\nObviously we are devastated by the news, and I understand that it's an even bigger blow for my girlfriend. I've been there for her and we support each other, and I think that we're at least dealing with it. \n\nShe has already suggested adoption or a surrogate. I told her that was good idea and left it at that. The thing is, I don't want to adopt a kid. I also don't want a surrogate. I want to have my own kids, with my own woman (I don't know how to phrase this but you get what I mean). I get how this sounds really selfish. But it's how I think, I can't change that. I don't think I would be capable of adopting a kid. It's just not me. Is it weird that I want the woman I'm with to carry our child? I don't think it is. I want it to be our kid. But I know I'm not thinking straight right now. \n\nI want kids. I want them with my girlfriend. She was about to be my fiancee. But we can't. I've been seriously thinking of breaking things off. I love her with all my heart, she IS the love of my life. I wouldn't want to put her through a break up after this news, I know she needs me. But I can't shake this feeling. I understand that many might not understand my thought process here. I don't know what to tell you. Would I be the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a couple who found out the girlfriend is infertile. They wanted to have kids, and now they're dealing with the reality that they can't have biological children. The guy is considering breaking up because he's not open to adoption or surrogacy, and he wants kids with his own partner. The big question is whether he's the asshole for thinking about breaking up.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The couple has been together for over five years, which is a significant time. They were planning to get married, so this is a major life decision. The key point is that the man wants biological children and isn't considering alternatives like adoption or surrogacy. His reasoning is that he wants \"his own kids\" with his \"own woman,\" which implies he wants the child to be genetically related to both of them. However, since the woman can't carry a child, the only options are adoption or surrogacy. He's rejecting both, which leaves them with no way to have a biological child. \n\nNow, ethical considerations come into play. Is it fair for him to end the relationship because of this? The woman already suggested adoption and surrogacy, but he's not open to those. That might be a problem because he's dismissing her suggestions. The fact that he's considering breaking up when she's going through a major emotional crisis (infertility is a big deal) could be seen as insensitive. He mentions that he loves her and she's the love of his life, but he's also thinking about his own desires for biological kids. \n\nSome might argue that wanting biological children is personal and valid, but if both partners can't agree on alternatives, that's a fundamental difference in values. However, ending the relationship right after the other person is dealing with a devastating diagnosis might be seen as selfish. The woman is likely dealing with feelings of inadequacy or loss, and breaking up could add to her emotional pain. \n\nAnother angle is communication. The man says he hasn't decided yet and is considering options, but he's leaning towards breaking up. Did he and his girlfriend have an open discussion about their views on having children before this? If they assumed they wanted biological kids and didn't discuss alternatives, maybe both share some responsibility. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong now. \n\nAlso, societal perspectives vary. Some people might view biological children as essential, while others prioritize the bond formed through adoption. The man's stance could be seen as rigid, especially since adoption and surrogacy are viable options. But if he's genuinely not capable of providing emotional support for those methods, perhaps his decision is based on personal limitations rather than being malicious. \n\nThe woman's position is equally important. She's suggesting alternatives, which shows she's trying to find a solution. If the man is unwilling to engage with those solutions, that might be the crux of the problem. His decision to break up could be seen as prioritizing his own desires over the relationship, especially when she's in a vulnerable state. \n\nIn summary, the man's reasoning is that he can't compromise on wanting biological children, but his decision to break up might be viewed as selfish because it's happening during a difficult time for his partner. His lack of openness to alternatives that she suggested could indicate a failure to communicate and compromise, which are essential in a long-term relationship. Therefore, many might consider him the asshole for considering the breakup under these circumstances.\n"
