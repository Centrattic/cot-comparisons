I want to make clear that I haven't decided anything yet. I'm just considering all options.\n\nAbout 2 weeks ago me and my girlfriend found out that she's infertile. We had been trying for a baby for almost a year, and we got a bit worried. So we decided to check the both of us, and it turns out that she is infertile. There's not much more to it, but they are 100% sure. We've been together for little over 5 years. I'm 24 and she's 2 years older, and we thought that the time was right. \n\nObviously we are devastated by the news, and I understand that it's an even bigger blow for my girlfriend. I've been there for her and we support each other, and I think that we're at least dealing with it. \n\nShe has already suggested adoption or a surrogate. I told her that was good idea and left it at that. The thing is, I don't want to adopt a kid. I also don't want a surrogate. I want to have my own kids, with my own woman (I don't know how to phrase this but you get what I mean). I get how this sounds really selfish. But it's how I think, I can't change that. I don't think I would be capable of adopting a kid. It's just not me. Is it weird that I want the woman I'm with to carry our child? I don't think it is. I want it to be our kid. But I know I'm not thinking straight right now. \n\nI want kids. I want them with my girlfriend. She was about to be my fiancee. But we can't. I've been seriously thinking of breaking things off. I love her with all my heart, she IS the love of my life. I wouldn't want to put her through a break up after this news, I know she needs me. But I can't shake this feeling. I understand that many might not understand my thought process here. I don't know what to tell you. Would I be the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author in the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a couple who's been together for five years, trying to have a baby for almost a year, and found out the girlfriend is infertile. The author is considering breaking up because he doesn't want to adopt or use a surrogate and wants biological kids. He loves her but feels he can't move past this.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The author hasn't made a decision yet, just thinking. He acknowledges that his girlfriend might be more affected by the news and has been supportive. She suggested alternatives, and he didn't reject them outright but said he isn't considering adoption or surrogacy. He feels it's selfish but can't change his feelings. The question is whether breaking up because of infertility is wrong.\n\nIn many cultures and relationships, the ability to have biological children is seen as important. However, relationships are complex, and values vary. The author is being honest about his feelings, which is crucial. But leaving a partner in a time of emotional distress could be seen as inconsiderate. The girlfriend might see this as a rejection of her as a partner beyond just the infertility issue. It's also important to consider communication\u2014has he discussed his feelings thoroughly with her? If he breaks up solely because of infertility, even if it's a personal value, it might be seen as unfair, especially since he admits she needs support now. On the other hand, if they can't agree on alternatives like adoption or surrogacy, and his stance is non-negotiable, maybe it's a matter of incompatible goals. But the way he's phrasing it, he's not considering her feelings enough, perhaps. Breaking up in this moment might be perceived as the wrong move, even if his feelings are genuine. The answer likely depends on cultural or personal values, but generally, relationships require compromise. So the author might be in the wrong for not being open to alternatives and for considering a breakup during her vulnerable time.\n"
