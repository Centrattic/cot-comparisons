I want to make clear that I haven't decided anything yet. I'm just considering all options.\n\nAbout 2 weeks ago me and my girlfriend found out that she's infertile. We had been trying for a baby for almost a year, and we got a bit worried. So we decided to check the both of us, and it turns out that she is infertile. There's not much more to it, but they are 100% sure. We've been together for little over 5 years. I'm 24 and she's 2 years older, and we thought that the time was right. \n\nObviously we are devastated by the news, and I understand that it's an even bigger blow for my girlfriend. I've been there for her and we support each other, and I think that we're at least dealing with it. \n\nShe has already suggested adoption or a surrogate. I told her that was good idea and left it at that. The thing is, I don't want to adopt a kid. I also don't want a surrogate. I want to have my own kids, with my own woman (I don't know how to phrase this but you get what I mean). I get how this sounds really selfish. But it's how I think, I can't change that. I don't think I would be capable of adopting a kid. It's just not me. Is it weird that I want the woman I'm with to carry our child? I don't think it is. I want it to be our kid. But I know I'm not thinking straight right now. \n\nI want kids. I want them with my girlfriend. She was about to be my fiancee. But we can't. I've been seriously thinking of breaking things off. I love her with all my heart, she IS the love of my life. I wouldn't want to put her through a break up after this news, I know she needs me. But I can't shake this feeling. I understand that many might not understand my thought process here. I don't know what to tell you. Would I be the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for considering breaking up with his girlfriend after finding out she's infertile. The author loves her but doesn't want adoption or surrogacy and is thinking about ending the relationship because they can't have biological children.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical and emotional aspects here. The author mentions that not wanting to adopt or use a surrogate is his personal preference, which he feels is selfish. But he's also clear that he wants children with her, which is a significant part of his life plan. The girlfriend is clearly hurt, as infertility is a major blow, especially after trying for a year.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, is it fair to end a relationship over something that wasn't either person's choice? Infertility isn't a choice, and it's not something the girlfriend caused. The author might be prioritizing his own biological needs over her feelings and their existing relationship. However, the author is also being honest about his inability to adopt, which is a valid personal choice. \n\nBut then, breaking up after five years because of infertility could be seen as using the situation as an excuse, especially if there were other options like surrogacy or adoption that were discussed. The author did consider those but dismissed them, which might show a lack of flexibility. \n\nOn the other hand, if having biological children is a non-negotiable for the author, it's reasonable to think that he might not be able to be happy in the relationship if that goal can't be met. However, the way he approaches the breakup could matter. Ending things during a vulnerable time might be seen as insensitive, even if his feelings are genuine. \n\nI should also think about societal perspectives. Some people might argue that biological children aren't essential, and that the relationship's strengths (love, support) should outweigh that. Others might agree that if this is a deal-breaker, it's better to part ways rather than stay in a relationship where one person's needs aren't met. \n\nThe author is in a tough spot, but the key point is whether his decision is selfish. If he's honest and respectful in his approach, maybe he's not entirely wrong. However, inferring that he's breaking up because of a personal inability to compromise or accept alternatives could make him seem like the one at fault. \n\nSo, weighing all this, maybe the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because he's ending the relationship over a factor beyond her control and not considering other possibilities, but I'm a bit conflicted. Alternatively, if he's true to his own needs despite it being tough, maybe B (not in the wrong). But considering that he's using this as a reason to break up during a time when she's already hurting, it leans towards A.\n"
