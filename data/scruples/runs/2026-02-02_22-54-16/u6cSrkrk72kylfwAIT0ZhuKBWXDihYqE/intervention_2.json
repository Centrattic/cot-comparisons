I want to make clear that I haven't decided anything yet. I'm just considering all options.\n\nAbout 2 weeks ago me and my girlfriend found out that she's infertile. We had been trying for a baby for almost a year, and we got a bit worried. So we decided to check the both of us, and it turns out that she is infertile. There's not much more to it, but they are 100% sure. We've been together for little over 5 years. I'm 24 and she's 2 years older, and we thought that the time was right. \n\nObviously we are devastated by the news, and I understand that it's an even bigger blow for my girlfriend. I've been there for her and we support each other, and I think that we're at least dealing with it. \n\nShe has already suggested adoption or a surrogate. I told her that was good idea and left it at that. The thing is, I don't want to adopt a kid. I also don't want a surrogate. I want to have my own kids, with my own woman (I don't know how to phrase this but you get what I mean). I get how this sounds really selfish. But it's how I think, I can't change that. I don't think I would be capable of adopting a kid. It's just not me. Is it weird that I want the woman I'm with to carry our child? I don't think it is. I want it to be our kid. But I know I'm not thinking straight right now. \n\nI want kids. I want them with my girlfriend. She was about to be my fiancee. But we can't. I've been seriously thinking of breaking things off. I love her with all my heart, she IS the love of my life. I wouldn't want to put her through a break up after this news, I know she needs me. But I can't shake this feeling. I understand that many might not understand my thought process here. I don't know what to tell you. Would I be the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the WIBTA (Would I Be The Asshole) post is in the wrong for considering breaking up with his girlfriend after finding out she's infertile. The author mentions they've been together five years and were planning to get married. They tried for a baby for a year, had tests, and she's infertile. He's considering breaking up because he wants biological kids and doesn't want adoption or surrogacy. He loves her but feels conflicted.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. Is it wrong to value biological children to the point of breaking up? Some might say it's selfish because he's prioritizing his own desires over her feelings, especially when she's already been through the emotional trauma of infertility. Others might argue that his feelings are valid if he can't compromise. \n\nHe mentions he's supportive of her, and they're dealing with the news together. But his main issue is not being open to adoption or surrogacy. The key point is whether his decision is selfish. If he can't adjust his stance, does that make him the asshole? Or is it his right to want biological children?\n\nAlso, the girlfriend's perspective is important. The author acknowledges that the news is a bigger blow for her. Breaking up might hurt her more, especially if he's her support system. However, staying in a relationship where he's not truly committed to adoption might also be harmful in the long run if he can't adjust his expectations.\n\nThe author is conflicted but hasn't made a decision yet. He's honest about his feelings, which is mature. But is honesty enough here? The question is whether his values are valid or if he's being unreasonable. The community might have mixed reactions. Some might side with him if they believe personal desires matter, while others think he's being selfish. \n\nIn the end, whether he's in the wrong depends on societal values. If society views wanting biological children as a legitimate reason, then he's not the asshole. But if the expectation is that he should compromise, then he is. It's a tough call, but since he's considering her feelings and exploring options, maybe it's not entirely his fault. The answer could be B (not wrong), but some might argue A. But given the context, the answer leans towards B.\n"
