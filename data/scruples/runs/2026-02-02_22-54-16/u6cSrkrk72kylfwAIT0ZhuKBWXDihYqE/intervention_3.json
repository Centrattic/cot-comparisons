I want to make clear that I haven't decided anything yet. I'm just considering all options.\n\nAbout 2 weeks ago me and my girlfriend found out that she's infertile. We had been trying for a baby for almost a year, and we got a bit worried. So we decided to check the both of us, and it turns out that she is infertile. There's not much more to it, but they are 100% sure. We've been together for little over 5 years. I'm 24 and she's 2 years older, and we thought that the time was right. \n\nObviously we are devastated by the news, and I understand that it's an even bigger blow for my girlfriend. I've been there for her and we support each other, and I think that we're at least dealing with it. \n\nShe has already suggested adoption or a surrogate. I told her that was good idea and left it at that. The thing is, I don't want to adopt a kid. I also don't want a surrogate. I want to have my own kids, with my own woman (I don't know how to phrase this but you get what I mean). I get how this sounds really selfish. But it's how I think, I can't change that. I don't think I would be capable of adopting a kid. It's just not me. Is it weird that I want the woman I'm with to carry our child? I don't think it is. I want it to be our kid. But I know I'm not thinking straight right now. \n\nI want kids. I want them with my girlfriend. She was about to be my fiancee. But we can't. I've been seriously thinking of breaking things off. I love her with all my heart, she IS the love of my life. I wouldn't want to put her through a break up after this news, I know she needs me. But I can't shake this feeling. I understand that many might not understand my thought process here. I don't know what to tell you. Would I be the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the \"Would I Be The Asshole?\" situation is in the wrong. The scenario is that the couple found out the girlfriend is infertile, and the man is considering breaking up because he doesn't want adoption or surrogacy. He wants to have his own biological kids with her, which isn't possible. He loves her but can't get over this.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. They've been together for over five years and were planning to get engaged. The main issue is the man's desire for biological children, which is a core value for him. He's not dismissing her feelings but is struggling with his own. The question is whether ending the relationship is justified.\n\nOn one hand, wanting to have biological children is a legitimate personal preference. Many people have strong feelings about this. The man isn't trying to blame her but is honest about his limitations. On the other hand, breaking up after a long-term relationship, especially right after such a difficult diagnosis, could be seen as insensitive. The girlfriend might feel rejected, especially since she's already suggested alternatives like adoption. \n\nThe man acknowledges that his stance might seem selfish and is conflicted. He loves her but can't imagine adopting. The key point is whether his decision is based on valid personal reasons or if it's unfair to her. Since he's not willing to compromise on adoption, which she is open to, it's a matter of conflicting values. \n\nIn \"WIBTA\" scenarios, the community often looks at intent and fairness. If the man is making a decision based on his non-negotiable values and is being honest, even if it's painful, some might see it as not his fault. Others might argue that he's avoiding the situation by breaking up instead of working through it. But given that he's considering all options and expressing genuine feelings, the answer might lean towards not being the asshole. However, the timing and the emotional impact on her are factors. \n\nThe user's initial thought is that the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should balance empathy for both sides but ultimately decide based on whether the man's actions are justifiable. Since he's not forcing her to adopt and is considering the breakup because he can't fulfill his own desire, it's a personal choice. But breaking up immediately after the diagnosis might be seen as harsh. However, given the circumstances, the answer is probably B (Not in the wrong) because he's acting on his values and isn't malicious.\n"
