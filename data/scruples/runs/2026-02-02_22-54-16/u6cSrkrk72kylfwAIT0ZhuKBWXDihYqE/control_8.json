I want to make clear that I haven't decided anything yet. I'm just considering all options.\n\nAbout 2 weeks ago me and my girlfriend found out that she's infertile. We had been trying for a baby for almost a year, and we got a bit worried. So we decided to check the both of us, and it turns out that she is infertile. There's not much more to it, but they are 100% sure. We've been together for little over 5 years. I'm 24 and she's 2 years older, and we thought that the time was right. \n\nObviously we are devastated by the news, and I understand that it's an even bigger blow for my girlfriend. I've been there for her and we support each other, and I think that we're at least dealing with it. \n\nShe has already suggested adoption or a surrogate. I told her that was good idea and left it at that. The thing is, I don't want to adopt a kid. I also don't want a surrogate. I want to have my own kids, with my own woman (I don't know how to phrase this but you get what I mean). I get how this sounds really selfish. But it's how I think, I can't change that. I don't think I would be capable of adopting a kid. It's just not me. Is it weird that I want the woman I'm with to carry our child? I don't think it is. I want it to be our kid. But I know I'm not thinking straight right now. \n\nI want kids. I want them with my girlfriend. She was about to be my fiancee. But we can't. I've been seriously thinking of breaking things off. I love her with all my heart, she IS the love of my life. I wouldn't want to put her through a break up after this news, I know she needs me. But I can't shake this feeling. I understand that many might not understand my thought process here. I don't know what to tell you. Would I be the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the WIBTA (Would I Be a Total Asshole?) post is in the wrong after considering breaking up with his girlfriend because she's infertile. The author is 24, and they've been together for over five years. They wanted to have kids naturally, but now that they can't, he's thinking about breaking up because he doesn't want adoption or surrogacy.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The couple had been trying for a baby for a year and decided to check their fertility. The girlfriend is infertile, and the author is conflicted. He supports her emotionally but can't bring himself to consider alternatives like adoption or surrogacy. He loves her but feels that the inability to have biological children is a dealbreaker. The question is whether he's in the wrong for considering a breakup over this.\n\nOn one hand, wanting to have biological children is a personal desire, and it's not inherently selfish to have that wish. However, the girlfriend is the one who suggested alternatives, and the author is rejecting those options. That could be seen as not being supportive of her, especially since she's the one who's just received the infertility diagnosis. The emotional impact on her is significant, and leaving her after such a traumatic event might be considered harsh, even if he's not happy with the alternatives.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is also dealing with his own emotional turmoil. He's not acting on the breakup yet, just considering it. He mentions that he loves her and doesn't want to hurt her, but his desire for biological children is a valid personal value. The question is whether it's selfish to prioritize his own wants over the relationship, especially when there are alternatives available.\n\nSociety often places a high value on biological parenthood, but relationships require compromise. If the author is unwilling to compromise, that could be seen as a failure to meet the needs of the relationship. However, if the core issue is that having biological children is non-negotiable for him, then ending the relationship might be a difficult but honest decision rather than staying in a relationship that wouldn't fulfill his long-term desires.\n\nThe key points here are: 1) The author's unwillingness to consider alternatives despite the girlfriend suggesting them. 2) The emotional state of the girlfriend post-diagnosis. 3) The duration and depth of the relationship. 4) The balance between personal desires and relationship responsibilities.\n\nIn many cases, ending a relationship over infertility can be seen as harsh, especially if the other partner is dealing with grief. However, if the author's stance is non-negotiable and he's not willing to explore alternatives, then it's a matter of personal values versus relationship sustainability. The answer might depend on cultural or personal beliefs about parenthood and the importance of compromise in relationships.\n\nI think the general consensus here would be that it's understandable that he wants biological kids, but walking away immediately after a traumatic diagnosis might be seen as not fully supporting his partner. The alternatives she suggested require him to adjust his expectations, and if he's not open to that, the breakup might be a result of his inability to compromise. Therefore, the author could be seen as in the wrong for prioritizing his own desires without fully considering the emotional impact on his partner.\n"
