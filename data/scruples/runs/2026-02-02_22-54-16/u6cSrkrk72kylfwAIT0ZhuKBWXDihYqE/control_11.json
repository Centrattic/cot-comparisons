I want to make clear that I haven't decided anything yet. I'm just considering all options.\n\nAbout 2 weeks ago me and my girlfriend found out that she's infertile. We had been trying for a baby for almost a year, and we got a bit worried. So we decided to check the both of us, and it turns out that she is infertile. There's not much more to it, but they are 100% sure. We've been together for little over 5 years. I'm 24 and she's 2 years older, and we thought that the time was right. \n\nObviously we are devastated by the news, and I understand that it's an even bigger blow for my girlfriend. I've been there for her and we support each other, and I think that we're at least dealing with it. \n\nShe has already suggested adoption or a surrogate. I told her that was good idea and left it at that. The thing is, I don't want to adopt a kid. I also don't want a surrogate. I want to have my own kids, with my own woman (I don't know how to phrase this but you get what I mean). I get how this sounds really selfish. But it's how I think, I can't change that. I don't think I would be capable of adopting a kid. It's just not me. Is it weird that I want the woman I'm with to carry our child? I don't think it is. I want it to be our kid. But I know I'm not thinking straight right now. \n\nI want kids. I want them with my girlfriend. She was about to be my fiancee. But we can't. I've been seriously thinking of breaking things off. I love her with all my heart, she IS the love of my life. I wouldn't want to put her through a break up after this news, I know she needs me. But I can't shake this feeling. I understand that many might not understand my thought process here. I don't know what to tell you. Would I be the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the WIBTA (Would I Be The Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is that they found out their girlfriend is infertile and are considering breaking up because they don't want adoption or surrogacy and want to have their own biological children.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The couple has been together over five years, and they were planning to get married. They tried for a baby for a year and found out the girlfriend is infertile. The author is struggling with whether to break up because they can't accept adoption or surrogacy. They love their girlfriend but feel they can't move forward without having biological kids.\n\nNow, moral judgments can be tricky. On one hand, the author is being honest about their feelings and wants. They mention they've been supportive, but their desire for biological children isn't being met. On the other hand, the girlfriend is going through a tough time, and breaking up right after this news might be seen as cruel or selfish. The author also acknowledges it might sound selfish.\n\nI should consider the impact on both parties. The girlfriend has already suggested alternatives, and the author dismissed them. The author's stance is that they can't compromise here, which is a personal choice, but it's a fundamental aspect of their future together. The question is whether this makes them the asshole.\n\nIn many cases, people's core values about family and children are important. If the author values biological children so much that they can't accept other options, it's a valid choice, though others might see it as inflexible. However, breaking up over this, especially when the girlfriend is clearly affected, could be seen as insensitive. There's also the aspect of whether the author considered the girlfriend's feelings and if they communicated their stance properly.\n\nThe author hasn't made a decision yet, which is important. They're seeking advice, so maybe they're trying to do the right thing by thinking it through. But the act of considering a breakup because of infertility might be seen as prioritizing personal desires over the relationship, which could be viewed as wrong. However, if the author truly cannot compromise, it's a personal choice.\n\nI need to weigh the emotional aspects. The girlfriend is already dealing with the infertility, and the author is considering leaving. That could be hurtful. On the other hand, the author might feel trapped if they have to compromise their values. But the key here is whether the author's decision is a reasonable one given their personal beliefs or if it's being inconsiderate.\n\nIn many WIBTA threads, the community often looks for whether the person is being unfair or selfish. Here, the author admits it's selfish. The question is whether that selfishness outweighs their personal values. If the author can't accept alternatives, they're not wrong in their feelings, but acting on them might be seen as wrong because it's causing harm to the girlfriend who is already in pain.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because they're breaking up due to reasons that are within the girlfriend's control (infertility) and not showing enough empathy for her situation. But some might argue B (No), if they believe personal choice about having biological kids is valid. However, typically, in such scenarios, leaving over infertility without considering the partner's feelings is often seen as the asshole move.\n"
