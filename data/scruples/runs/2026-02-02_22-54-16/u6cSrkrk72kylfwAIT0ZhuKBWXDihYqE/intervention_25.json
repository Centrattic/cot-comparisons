I want to make clear that I haven't decided anything yet. I'm just considering all options.\n\nAbout 2 weeks ago me and my girlfriend found out that she's infertile. We had been trying for a baby for almost a year, and we got a bit worried. So we decided to check the both of us, and it turns out that she is infertile. There's not much more to it, but they are 100% sure. We've been together for little over 5 years. I'm 24 and she's 2 years older, and we thought that the time was right. \n\nObviously we are devastated by the news, and I understand that it's an even bigger blow for my girlfriend. I've been there for her and we support each other, and I think that we're at least dealing with it. \n\nShe has already suggested adoption or a surrogate. I told her that was good idea and left it at that. The thing is, I don't want to adopt a kid. I also don't want a surrogate. I want to have my own kids, with my own woman (I don't know how to phrase this but you get what I mean). I get how this sounds really selfish. But it's how I think, I can't change that. I don't think I would be capable of adopting a kid. It's just not me. Is it weird that I want the woman I'm with to carry our child? I don't think it is. I want it to be our kid. But I know I'm not thinking straight right now. \n\nI want kids. I want them with my girlfriend. She was about to be my fiancee. But we can't. I've been seriously thinking of breaking things off. I love her with all my heart, she IS the love of my life. I wouldn't want to put her through a break up after this news, I know she needs me. But I can't shake this feeling. I understand that many might not understand my thought process here. I don't know what to tell you. Would I be the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The situation is that the author is considering breaking up with his girlfriend after finding out she's infertile. He wants to have biological kids, and doesn't want adoption or surrogacy. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The author is honest about his feelings, which is important. He's not trying to hide that he wants biological children and that this is a deal-breaker for him. Being upfront is usually seen as responsible because it prevents future hurt.\n\nBut then, there's the emotional impact. His girlfriend is going through a tough time, and breaking up might add to her distress. However, he also mentions that he's been supportive and they've been dealing with the news. The key here is that he's not rushing into a decision; he's considering all options and hasn't decided yet. That shows he's taking it seriously.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that he can't move forward without having his own biological children. That might be a personal value, but values vary. Some people prioritize adoption, others don't. It's not inherently selfish, but it's a personal choice. However, the fact that he's considering breaking up over this raises questions about his commitment. If the relationship is otherwise strong, is infertility the only issue? But the author states that the relationship is his future, and he wants kids with her. Since that's not possible, he's conflicted.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that wanting biological children is a valid reason to part ways, especially if it's a fundamental part of his life goals. Others might say that he should explore other options like adoption more thoroughly. But he's already ruled those out, so maybe he's being honest about his limitations.\n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong. If he's being honest and taking responsibility for his feelings, and not dismissing her feelings, he's not necessarily the asshole. But breaking up during a vulnerable time could be seen as harsh. However, since he's not making a hasty decision and is considering his girlfriend's emotional state, it's more nuanced.\n\nIn the WIBTA (Would I Be Terrible for...) context, people often debate the balance between personal desires and the relationship's health. If the author is making a decision based on his own values and not being dishonest, he might not be in the wrong. But if he's not giving enough consideration to his girlfriend's perspective or is using this as an excuse, it's different. The narrative shows he's trying to be supportive, so the answer leans towards B (not in the wrong).\n"
