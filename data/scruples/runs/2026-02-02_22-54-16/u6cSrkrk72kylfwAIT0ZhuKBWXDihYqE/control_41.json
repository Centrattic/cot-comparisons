I want to make clear that I haven't decided anything yet. I'm just considering all options.\n\nAbout 2 weeks ago me and my girlfriend found out that she's infertile. We had been trying for a baby for almost a year, and we got a bit worried. So we decided to check the both of us, and it turns out that she is infertile. There's not much more to it, but they are 100% sure. We've been together for little over 5 years. I'm 24 and she's 2 years older, and we thought that the time was right. \n\nObviously we are devastated by the news, and I understand that it's an even bigger blow for my girlfriend. I've been there for her and we support each other, and I think that we're at least dealing with it. \n\nShe has already suggested adoption or a surrogate. I told her that was good idea and left it at that. The thing is, I don't want to adopt a kid. I also don't want a surrogate. I want to have my own kids, with my own woman (I don't know how to phrase this but you get what I mean). I get how this sounds really selfish. But it's how I think, I can't change that. I don't think I would be capable of adopting a kid. It's just not me. Is it weird that I want the woman I'm with to carry our child? I don't think it is. I want it to be our kid. But I know I'm not thinking straight right now. \n\nI want kids. I want them with my girlfriend. She was about to be my fiancee. But we can't. I've been seriously thinking of breaking things off. I love her with all my heart, she IS the love of my life. I wouldn't want to put her through a break up after this news, I know she needs me. But I can't shake this feeling. I understand that many might not understand my thought process here. I don't know what to tell you. Would I be the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is considering breaking up with his girlfriend after finding out she's infertile. They had been trying to have a baby for a year, and now he realizes he wants biological kids. The girlfriend suggested adoption or surrogacy, but he's not open to those options.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if this is a valid reason for a breakup. Infertility is a medical issue that wasn't their choice. The man admits he doesn't want to adopt or use a surrogate, which means he can't move past the biological aspect of having children. That seems pretty selfish because the problem isn't the woman's fault. The girlfriend is already offering alternatives, but he's dismissing them.\n\nHe says he loves her and she's the love of his life, but he's still considering leaving because of something that's not her fault. That might be seen as using her as a backup plan for parenthood rather than valuing the relationship for its own sake. Also, he's not considering her feelings here\u2014she's already going through a lot, and he's thinking of abandoning her at her most vulnerable.\n\nBut on the other hand, people do have non-negotiables in a relationship. If having biological children is his deal-breaker, maybe it's not his fault. However, given that they've been together for 5 years and he's only now realizing this is a deal-breaker after she's been diagnosed, it could be seen as unfair. He might have known his priorities but didn't address them until after the problem arose.\n\nIn general, relationships require compromise. If he's unwilling to consider other options that she's open to, he's not meeting her halfway. The fact that he's the one with the biological requirement and she's the one with the medical issue might tip the scales. So, the answer might be A, he's in the wrong.\n"
