I want to make clear that I haven't decided anything yet. I'm just considering all options.\n\nAbout 2 weeks ago me and my girlfriend found out that she's infertile. We had been trying for a baby for almost a year, and we got a bit worried. So we decided to check the both of us, and it turns out that she is infertile. There's not much more to it, but they are 100% sure. We've been together for little over 5 years. I'm 24 and she's 2 years older, and we thought that the time was right. \n\nObviously we are devastated by the news, and I understand that it's an even bigger blow for my girlfriend. I've been there for her and we support each other, and I think that we're at least dealing with it. \n\nShe has already suggested adoption or a surrogate. I told her that was good idea and left it at that. The thing is, I don't want to adopt a kid. I also don't want a surrogate. I want to have my own kids, with my own woman (I don't know how to phrase this but you get what I mean). I get how this sounds really selfish. But it's how I think, I can't change that. I don't think I would be capable of adopting a kid. It's just not me. Is it weird that I want the woman I'm with to carry our child? I don't think it is. I want it to be our kid. But I know I'm not thinking straight right now. \n\nI want kids. I want them with my girlfriend. She was about to be my fiancee. But we can't. I've been seriously thinking of breaking things off. I love her with all my heart, she IS the love of my life. I wouldn't want to put her through a break up after this news, I know she needs me. But I can't shake this feeling. I understand that many might not understand my thought process here. I don't know what to tell you. Would I be the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the WIBTA post is in the wrong for considering breaking up after finding out his girlfriend is infertile. The options are A (yes, he's wrong) or B (no, he's not). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The couple has been together for five years, and they were trying to have a baby. After a year, they tested and found out she's infertile. He loves her, and she suggested adoption or surrogacy. He's considering breaking up because he doesn't want to adopt or use a surrogate. He wants to have his own biological children with her, which is impossible now, so he's conflicted.\n\nNow, to determine if he's in the wrong. The key points here are about values and personal beliefs. He admits it might sound selfish but feels he can't adopt. Is it his fault for having these feelings? Well, people have different values. If he's honest and they both decide it's not right, maybe it's not his fault. However, breaking up solely because of inability to have biological kids could be seen as prioritizing that over the relationship. But he's also considering her feelings and not rushing into a decision.\n\nAnother angle: The girlfriend might feel rejected because his main issue is her infertility. That's a big deal for her, and she might feel like she's not enough. But he's trying to be supportive and is struggling with his own needs. \n\nI think it's a complex situation. The user says he's not making a decision yet and is considering options. It's possible he's in a tough spot, but does that mean he's in the wrong? If he decides to leave, it's a call about his values. However, some might argue that wanting biological kids is a personal choice, and if he can't compromise, it's valid to him. Others might say it's unfair to her. \n\nBut the question is whether he's in the wrong. If he's processing his feelings and exploring all options, maybe not. The key is whether he's being selfish or just realistic. The fact that he's considering her feelings and not immediately breaking up suggests he's trying to be fair. So maybe B, he's not in the wrong. However, if the decision is based on something that's a dealbreaker for him, even if it's painful, it's his right. So B might be the answer.\n"
