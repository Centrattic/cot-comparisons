I want to make clear that I haven't decided anything yet. I'm just considering all options.\n\nAbout 2 weeks ago me and my girlfriend found out that she's infertile. We had been trying for a baby for almost a year, and we got a bit worried. So we decided to check the both of us, and it turns out that she is infertile. There's not much more to it, but they are 100% sure. We've been together for little over 5 years. I'm 24 and she's 2 years older, and we thought that the time was right. \n\nObviously we are devastated by the news, and I understand that it's an even bigger blow for my girlfriend. I've been there for her and we support each other, and I think that we're at least dealing with it. \n\nShe has already suggested adoption or a surrogate. I told her that was good idea and left it at that. The thing is, I don't want to adopt a kid. I also don't want a surrogate. I want to have my own kids, with my own woman (I don't know how to phrase this but you get what I mean). I get how this sounds really selfish. But it's how I think, I can't change that. I don't think I would be capable of adopting a kid. It's just not me. Is it weird that I want the woman I'm with to carry our child? I don't think it is. I want it to be our kid. But I know I'm not thinking straight right now. \n\nI want kids. I want them with my girlfriend. She was about to be my fiancee. But we can't. I've been seriously thinking of breaking things off. I love her with all my heart, she IS the love of my life. I wouldn't want to put her through a break up after this news, I know she needs me. But I can't shake this feeling. I understand that many might not understand my thought process here. I don't know what to tell you. Would I be the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the WIBTA (Would I Be A Twat for Asking) scenario is in the wrong for considering breaking up with his girlfriend after discovering her infertility.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The couple has been together for five years and wanted to have children. They found out she's infertile. He's considering breaking up because he doesn't want adoption or a surrogate and wants biological kids. The question is if he's in the wrong.\n\nThe key points here are about intent and communication. The author is clear that he hasn't decided yet. He's expressing his feelings about not wanting to adopt or use a surrogate, which are personal preferences. However, this situation involves a significant life decision that affects both people. He acknowledges that his stance might seem selfish and that he's struggling with his emotions.\n\nInfertility is a medical condition, and the author's reaction is based on his desire for biological children. But this decision could be seen as placing a condition on his relationship that's non-negotiable, which might be problematic if the other person isn't given the same space to process or if it's the sole reason for the breakup.\n\nThe girlfriend's perspective is also important. She's already suggested alternatives, which shows she's trying to find a solution. The author isn't considering her feelings fully by not engaging more with her suggestions. He's in a vulnerable state and might be rushing to a decision without proper discussion.\n\nIn relationships, major life decisions require mutual understanding and compromise. If the author values his girlfriend but can't move past the infertility issue, it might indicate that his priorities conflict with the relationship's future. However, the decision to break up because of infertility can be viewed as placing unrealistic expectations on the partner to fulfill a biological role that isn't possible.\n\nEthically, it's a gray area. On one hand, people have the right to their preferences. On the other, relationships require flexibility. The author's approach could be seen as prioritizing his own desires without sufficient empathy for his girlfriend's position, especially since she's already dealing with the emotional pain of infertility.\n\nAdditionally, the age of the couple (24 and 26) might be a factor in the urgency to have biological children, but that doesn't absolve him of responsibility in how he handles the situation. The key is whether the decision is made thoughtfully with mutual input, which seems lacking here.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author's decision to break up based solely on infertility, without exploring all options and without more open communication with his girlfriend, could be seen as selfish. It's not necessarily \"wrong\" in a legal or moral sense, but socially, it might be seen as an asshole move because it's prioritizing his own biological desires over the relationship he's in, especially when the other person is trying to adapt.\n"
