I want to make clear that I haven't decided anything yet. I'm just considering all options.\n\nAbout 2 weeks ago me and my girlfriend found out that she's infertile. We had been trying for a baby for almost a year, and we got a bit worried. So we decided to check the both of us, and it turns out that she is infertile. There's not much more to it, but they are 100% sure. We've been together for little over 5 years. I'm 24 and she's 2 years older, and we thought that the time was right. \n\nObviously we are devastated by the news, and I understand that it's an even bigger blow for my girlfriend. I've been there for her and we support each other, and I think that we're at least dealing with it. \n\nShe has already suggested adoption or a surrogate. I told her that was good idea and left it at that. The thing is, I don't want to adopt a kid. I also don't want a surrogate. I want to have my own kids, with my own woman (I don't know how to phrase this but you get what I mean). I get how this sounds really selfish. But it's how I think, I can't change that. I don't think I would be capable of adopting a kid. It's just not me. Is it weird that I want the woman I'm with to carry our child? I don't think it is. I want it to be our kid. But I know I'm not thinking straight right now. \n\nI want kids. I want them with my girlfriend. She was about to be my fiancee. But we can't. I've been seriously thinking of breaking things off. I love her with all my heart, she IS the love of my life. I wouldn't want to put her through a break up after this news, I know she needs me. But I can't shake this feeling. I understand that many might not understand my thought process here. I don't know what to tell you. Would I be the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the WIBTA (Would I Be A Total Asshole) scenario is in the wrong for considering breaking up after finding out his girlfriend is infertile. The author wants to have biological kids, doesn't want adoption or surrogacy, and is contemplating ending the relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical and emotional aspects. The key points here are the author's values regarding having biological children and his girlfriend's suggestions for alternatives. The author loves her but feels he can't go through with adoption or surrogacy, which are her proposed solutions. \n\nIn terms of moral judgment, is it fair to call him an asshole for prioritizing his own desires here? Well, relationships often require compromise. If having biological children is a non-negotiable for him and she's not willing to meet that need through her suggested options, it might be a deal-breaker. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong for considering the breakup. \n\nThe author is being honest about his feelings and is trying to support his girlfriend, which shows he's not being cruel. But the act of breaking up after she's already suggested alternatives might be seen as selfish, especially if she's emotionally vulnerable. However, it's also about personal values. If having a biological child is as important to him as he says, and he can't compromise, then it's a valid reason for him.\n\nAnother angle: communication. The author mentions he hasn't decided yet and is considering options. He told her adoption is a good idea but didn't push back until now. Maybe he didn't communicate his true feelings about adoption earlier, leading to this conflict. But the scenario states he's just now realizing he can't go through with it, which might not be his fault.\n\nCultural and societal norms also play a role. Some might see his stance as selfish, others as realistic. The key is whether he's respecting her feelings and the effort she's making to find alternatives. Since he loves her and is struggling with the decision, it complicates whether he's in the wrong. \n\nIn the end, it's a personal choice. If he's making this decision without coercion and is considering her well-being, it's not necessarily his fault. But if he's not taking her feelings into enough account, that's a different story. The question is about being in the wrong, not just whether it's understandable. Since he's trying to balance his needs with hers, but it's a tough situation, the answer might be that he's not in the wrong.\n"
