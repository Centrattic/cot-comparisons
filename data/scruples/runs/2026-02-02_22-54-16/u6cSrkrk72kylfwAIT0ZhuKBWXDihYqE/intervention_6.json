I want to make clear that I haven't decided anything yet. I'm just considering all options.\n\nAbout 2 weeks ago me and my girlfriend found out that she's infertile. We had been trying for a baby for almost a year, and we got a bit worried. So we decided to check the both of us, and it turns out that she is infertile. There's not much more to it, but they are 100% sure. We've been together for little over 5 years. I'm 24 and she's 2 years older, and we thought that the time was right. \n\nObviously we are devastated by the news, and I understand that it's an even bigger blow for my girlfriend. I've been there for her and we support each other, and I think that we're at least dealing with it. \n\nShe has already suggested adoption or a surrogate. I told her that was good idea and left it at that. The thing is, I don't want to adopt a kid. I also don't want a surrogate. I want to have my own kids, with my own woman (I don't know how to phrase this but you get what I mean). I get how this sounds really selfish. But it's how I think, I can't change that. I don't think I would be capable of adopting a kid. It's just not me. Is it weird that I want the woman I'm with to carry our child? I don't think it is. I want it to be our kid. But I know I'm not thinking straight right now. \n\nI want kids. I want them with my girlfriend. She was about to be my fiancee. But we can't. I've been seriously thinking of breaking things off. I love her with all my heart, she IS the love of my life. I wouldn't want to put her through a break up after this news, I know she needs me. But I can't shake this feeling. I understand that many might not understand my thought process here. I don't know what to tell you. Would I be the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author is a guy in a 5-year relationship with his girlfriend. They tried for a baby for a year and found out she's infertile. He's considering breaking up because he doesn't want adoption or surrogacy. He loves her but wants his own biological kids. The question is whether breaking up over this makes him the asshole.\n\nHmm. First, I should consider the context. The couple had been trying to have a baby, so having children was a significant goal for them. Now that they can't, the author is struggling with the idea of adoption or surrogacy. He admits it might sound selfish, but he can't change his feelings. He's torn between his love for her and his desire for biological children.\n\nNow, is he in the wrong? Well, breaking up because you can't have children naturally is a personal decision. But is it fair to her? She suggested adoption and surrogacy, which he dismissed. He says he's open to those options but later clarifies he doesn't want them. That might be a problem because he didn't fully consider her suggestions. Communication is key here. Did he explore her feelings about the options? Did he express his own thoughts clearly?\n\nAlso, the fact that they were about to get engaged adds weight. If having biological kids was a non-negotiable for him, maybe he should have discussed this earlier. But the situation came up after they were already in a committed relationship. He's in a tough spot, but breaking up over this could be seen as prioritizing his own desires over her feelings, especially when she's clearly devasted and needs support.\n\nOn the other hand, if he truly can't get on board with adoption or surrogacy, maybe it's not fair to stay in a relationship where they can't achieve a major life goal together. But there's a difference between being realistic and being selfish. The author is conflicted, which is understandable. However, the question is about whether he's in the wrong.\n\nI think the key points are: 1) Did he consider her perspective and their relationship's future before making a decision? 2) Is his prioritization of biological children over her well-being justified?\n\nHe mentions he's been there for her, but breaking up right after a major blow could be seen as abandoning her during a tough time. That might make him the asshole. However, if staying together would lead to ongoing conflict and unfulfilled desires, it's a complex situation. It's not a simple yes/no answer, but given the setup of the question, the answer likely is A (Yes, he's in the wrong) because breaking up over infertility when alternatives are possible might be seen as selfish, especially given her emotional state.\n"
