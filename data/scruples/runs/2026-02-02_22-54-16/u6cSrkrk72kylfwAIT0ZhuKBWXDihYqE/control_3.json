I want to make clear that I haven't decided anything yet. I'm just considering all options.\n\nAbout 2 weeks ago me and my girlfriend found out that she's infertile. We had been trying for a baby for almost a year, and we got a bit worried. So we decided to check the both of us, and it turns out that she is infertile. There's not much more to it, but they are 100% sure. We've been together for little over 5 years. I'm 24 and she's 2 years older, and we thought that the time was right. \n\nObviously we are devastated by the news, and I understand that it's an even bigger blow for my girlfriend. I've been there for her and we support each other, and I think that we're at least dealing with it. \n\nShe has already suggested adoption or a surrogate. I told her that was good idea and left it at that. The thing is, I don't want to adopt a kid. I also don't want a surrogate. I want to have my own kids, with my own woman (I don't know how to phrase this but you get what I mean). I get how this sounds really selfish. But it's how I think, I can't change that. I don't think I would be capable of adopting a kid. It's just not me. Is it weird that I want the woman I'm with to carry our child? I don't think it is. I want it to be our kid. But I know I'm not thinking straight right now. \n\nI want kids. I want them with my girlfriend. She was about to be my fiancee. But we can't. I've been seriously thinking of breaking things off. I love her with all my heart, she IS the love of my life. I wouldn't want to put her through a break up after this news, I know she needs me. But I can't shake this feeling. I understand that many might not understand my thought process here. I don't know what to tell you. Would I be the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong for considering breaking up with his girlfriend after finding out she's infertile. The situation is pretty delicate.\n\nFirst, the couple has been together for five years, and they were planning to get married. They wanted kids, and after a year of trying, they decided to check for infertility. It turns out the girlfriend is infertile. The author is really torn because he doesn't want to adopt or use a surrogate. He feels like he wants his own biological child with the woman he's with. He's considering breaking up because he can't get over this, even though he loves her a lot and acknowledges it might sound selfish.\n\nNow, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). I need to figure out which one is correct based on the scenario.\n\nLet's break it down. Infertility is a tough situation for many couples. Some people place a high value on having biological children, and that's their personal choice. However, considering the relationship's history, they were close to engagement. The author is in a lot of emotional pain here, but is it fair to break up over this?\n\nOn one hand, the author is being honest about his feelings. He's not pretending to be okay with alternatives when he's not. It's important in relationships to be truthful about deal-breakers. If having biological children is a non-negotiable for him, then maybe he's not in the wrong for considering this. But on the other hand, it could be seen as selfish because the decision would hurt his girlfriend deeply, especially right after such a traumatic diagnosis. She's already going through emotional turmoil, and he's thinking about leaving, which might seem heartless.\n\nBut wait, the author hasn't made the decision yet. He's saying he's considering it, not that he's acted on it. Also, he's trying to process his feelings and is aware that others might not understand. The key here is whether the author's feelings are justified. Infertility is a medical condition, not a personal failing of the girlfriend. It's not her fault, and in many cases, it's a shared issue, but in this case, it's her infertility. But the author is fixated on biological children, which is his own value system. \n\nIn relationships, compatibility on major life issues is crucial. If having biological kids is a fundamental part of his identity and he can't compromise, maybe it's not fair to stay in a relationship where that's impossible. However, breaking up over this could be seen as using the infertility as an excuse to avoid commitment or the challenges that come with adoption or surrogacy. But he's already rejected those options because they don't align with his desires. \n\nThe question is about being in the wrong. The author isn't doing anything illegal or unethical beyond the relationship. It's a personal decision based on his values. However, the moral judgment here might depend on cultural or personal beliefs. Some might view it as selfish, others as being honest about one's needs. \n\nBut the key point is that the author is considering breaking up, not that he has done so yet. The question is whether he's in the wrong for considering it. If the answer is about the act of considering a breakup, then it's more about whether his reasoning is valid. Since he's in a state of grief and trying to process his feelings, maybe he's not in the wrong for exploring his options. However, the act of breaking up over this could be seen as wrong, but the question is about his current consideration.\n\nAlternatively, the author might be in the wrong if his primary motivation is his own desire for biological children, ignoring the emotional impact on his girlfriend and the fact that she's already offered alternatives. But he's not pretending to accept those alternatives; he's being upfront. The problem is that he's prioritizing his own wants over the relationship, which could be seen as selfish, but it's also a personal right to know one's own limits.\n\nIn conclusion, this is a tough call. But since the author is being honest about his feelings and hasn't made a decision yet, perhaps he's not in the wrong. However, the fact that he's considering breaking up over this could be seen as wrong because it's using the infertility as a reason to end the relationship when he knew the risks of infertility before getting into the long-term commitment. But the question is whether he is in the wrong now, after the fact. So, I think the answer might be A (he is in the wrong) because it's a significant reason to break up over something that wasn't a known issue at the start of the relationship. However, others might argue that it's a personal value. Given the context, the author is being honest but is it the right decision? The question is about whether he's in the wrong. The answer is likely A because using infertility as a reason to break up could be seen as selfish and hurtful, especially when the girlfriend is already struggling with the news. So, the answer is A.\n"
