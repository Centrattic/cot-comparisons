I want to make clear that I haven't decided anything yet. I'm just considering all options.\n\nAbout 2 weeks ago me and my girlfriend found out that she's infertile. We had been trying for a baby for almost a year, and we got a bit worried. So we decided to check the both of us, and it turns out that she is infertile. There's not much more to it, but they are 100% sure. We've been together for little over 5 years. I'm 24 and she's 2 years older, and we thought that the time was right. \n\nObviously we are devastated by the news, and I understand that it's an even bigger blow for my girlfriend. I've been there for her and we support each other, and I think that we're at least dealing with it. \n\nShe has already suggested adoption or a surrogate. I told her that was good idea and left it at that. The thing is, I don't want to adopt a kid. I also don't want a surrogate. I want to have my own kids, with my own woman (I don't know how to phrase this but you get what I mean). I get how this sounds really selfish. But it's how I think, I can't change that. I don't think I would be capable of adopting a kid. It's just not me. Is it weird that I want the woman I'm with to carry our child? I don't think it is. I want it to be our kid. But I know I'm not thinking straight right now. \n\nI want kids. I want them with my girlfriend. She was about to be my fiancee. But we can't. I've been seriously thinking of breaking things off. I love her with all my heart, she IS the love of my life. I wouldn't want to put her through a break up after this news, I know she needs me. But I can't shake this feeling. I understand that many might not understand my thought process here. I don't know what to tell you. Would I be the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for considering breaking up with his girlfriend after finding out she's infertile. The situation is pretty complex.\n\nFirst, the couple had been trying to have a baby for a year, so they decided to get checked. The girlfriend is infertile, and the author is considering breaking up because he doesn't want adoption or surrogacy. He wants to have his own biological kids with her, which isn't possible now. He loves her but feels stuck between his desire for biological children and not wanting other options. \n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Well, relationships are about mutual needs and expectations. If having biological children is a non-negotiable for him, then maybe he's being honest about his limits. On the other hand, breaking up right after such a traumatic discovery might seem harsh, especially since she might be more emotionally affected. He mentions supporting each other, but his inability to consider alternatives could be seen as selfish. \n\nBut then again, people have different deal-breakers. If he genuinely can't adopt or use a surrogate, it's unrealistic to expect a relationship to continue if kids are important. However, breaking up immediately after she's been through this might not be the most supportive approach. Timing matters here. Maybe they need more time to process, but the core issue is whether his stance is valid. \n\nSociety often places a lot of pressure on biological parenthood, but it's also about what each person values. The author is upfront about his feelings, which is honest communication. However, the decision to break up based solely on this could be seen as prioritizing his desires over her well-being, especially if she's still willing to explore other options. \n\nSo, is he wrong? It's a tough call. He's being honest but might not be considering her emotional state fully. The key point is whether his decision is fair given the circumstances. Some might argue that he's prioritizing his own wants without enough empathy, making him the asshole. Others might say he's being realistic about his limitations. But generally, breaking up over this without giving more time for adjustment could be seen as the wrong choice. So leaning towards A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
