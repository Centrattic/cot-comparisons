I want to make clear that I haven't decided anything yet. I'm just considering all options.\n\nAbout 2 weeks ago me and my girlfriend found out that she's infertile. We had been trying for a baby for almost a year, and we got a bit worried. So we decided to check the both of us, and it turns out that she is infertile. There's not much more to it, but they are 100% sure. We've been together for little over 5 years. I'm 24 and she's 2 years older, and we thought that the time was right. \n\nObviously we are devastated by the news, and I understand that it's an even bigger blow for my girlfriend. I've been there for her and we support each other, and I think that we're at least dealing with it. \n\nShe has already suggested adoption or a surrogate. I told her that was good idea and left it at that. The thing is, I don't want to adopt a kid. I also don't want a surrogate. I want to have my own kids, with my own woman (I don't know how to phrase this but you get what I mean). I get how this sounds really selfish. But it's how I think, I can't change that. I don't think I would be capable of adopting a kid. It's just not me. Is it weird that I want the woman I'm with to carry our child? I don't think it is. I want it to be our kid. But I know I'm not thinking straight right now. \n\nI want kids. I want them with my girlfriend. She was about to be my fiancee. But we can't. I've been seriously thinking of breaking things off. I love her with all my heart, she IS the love of my life. I wouldn't want to put her through a break up after this news, I know she needs me. But I can't shake this feeling. I understand that many might not understand my thought process here. I don't know what to tell you. Would I be the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for considering breaking up with his girlfriend after finding out she's infertile. \n\nFirst, the situation: they've been together five years, both wanted kids, she's infertile. The author admits he doesn't want adoption or surrogacy, wants his own biological kids. He's considering breaking up because they can't have children the way he wants. He says he loves her but can't get past this.\n\nHmm, so the question is about whether he's in the wrong. On one hand, people have different priorities. If having biological children is a non-negotiable for him, maybe he's not in the wrong for being honest. On the other hand, breaking up over this could seem harsh, especially given the emotional impact on his girlfriend. She's already going through a tough time, and he's the one who's supposed to support her. \n\nBut wait, the author is struggling too. He's conflicted because he loves her but feels like he can't compromise. The problem is that he's choosing his desire for biological kids over their relationship. Is that fair? Some might say it's selfish, but others might say it's being honest about one's needs. \n\nAlso, the girlfriend suggested adoption or surrogacy, but the author isn't open to that. That's a key point. If he's not willing to consider alternatives she's proposed, is that fair? It might show a lack of willingness to work through the issue together. \n\nBut he also mentions he's not thinking straight. Maybe he's making a hasty decision. The question is whether it's right to break up over this. The user's initial thought is that the author isn't wrong, but others might see it differently. \n\nIn terms of societal views, some might see valuing biological children as important, others see it as a flaw. The answer depends on cultural or personal beliefs. Legally, he's not in the wrong, but morally? It's a gray area. He's being honest, but maybe not considering her feelings enough. \n\nI think the answer is that he's not in the wrong (B) because he's being honest about his desires, even though it's a tough decision. But others might argue he's being selfish. However, since the question is about being in the wrong in terms of the situation, the answer leans towards B.\n"
