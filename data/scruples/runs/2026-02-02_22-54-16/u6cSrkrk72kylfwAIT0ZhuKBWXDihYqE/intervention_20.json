I want to make clear that I haven't decided anything yet. I'm just considering all options.\n\nAbout 2 weeks ago me and my girlfriend found out that she's infertile. We had been trying for a baby for almost a year, and we got a bit worried. So we decided to check the both of us, and it turns out that she is infertile. There's not much more to it, but they are 100% sure. We've been together for little over 5 years. I'm 24 and she's 2 years older, and we thought that the time was right. \n\nObviously we are devastated by the news, and I understand that it's an even bigger blow for my girlfriend. I've been there for her and we support each other, and I think that we're at least dealing with it. \n\nShe has already suggested adoption or a surrogate. I told her that was good idea and left it at that. The thing is, I don't want to adopt a kid. I also don't want a surrogate. I want to have my own kids, with my own woman (I don't know how to phrase this but you get what I mean). I get how this sounds really selfish. But it's how I think, I can't change that. I don't think I would be capable of adopting a kid. It's just not me. Is it weird that I want the woman I'm with to carry our child? I don't think it is. I want it to be our kid. But I know I'm not thinking straight right now. \n\nI want kids. I want them with my girlfriend. She was about to be my fiancee. But we can't. I've been seriously thinking of breaking things off. I love her with all my heart, she IS the love of my life. I wouldn't want to put her through a break up after this news, I know she needs me. But I can't shake this feeling. I understand that many might not understand my thought process here. I don't know what to tell you. Would I be the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong after considering breaking up with his girlfriend because she's infertile. The situation is that they wanted to have their own kids, and when they found out she can't, he's thinking of breaking up because he doesn't want adoption or surrogacy. He loves her but can't reconcile his desire for a biological child with her situation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical perspectives. On one hand, the author is being honest about his feelings and needs. He's not pretending to want adoption or surrogacy if he doesn't. On the other hand, breaking up after a five-year relationship and when she's going through a tough time might be seen as insensitive. The question is whether his decision is selfish or a valid personal choice.\n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual expectations. Did they discuss their views on having children before this? If they had a shared goal of biological children and one partner can't adjust, is that a deal-breaker? The author mentions he doesn't want adoption or surrogacy, which are alternatives. However, his girlfriend is already suggesting those options, and he's not open to it. That's a major conflict.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, some might argue that wanting a biological child is a personal choice, but others might see it as selfish if it leads to ending a relationship. It's also about how the decision is handled. The author is considering the breakup, not rushing into it, and acknowledging the emotional impact on his girlfriend. He's trying to be supportive, which is a positive aspect.\n\nLegally, there's no wrongdoing here; it's a personal decision. Ethically, it's more nuanced. The author's intentions are based on his personal values, but relationships require compromise. If they couldn't find a middle ground, maybe the breakup is a result of incompatible goals. However, timing might be an issue\u2014breaking up right after such a traumatic event for her could be seen as unkind.\n\nAnother angle is whether the author's stance is based on genuine inability to consider alternatives or if it's a way to avoid responsibility. The author claims he can't adopt, which could be real, but others might argue that love should transcend biological ties. Still, everyone has different thresholds for what they can accept.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author isn't necessarily \"in the wrong\" for having these feelings, the decision to break up could be seen as harmful given the circumstances. However, if their core values are irreconcilable, it's a personal choice. The answer hinges on whether prioritizing biological children over the relationship is acceptable, which is subjective. So, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) but with reservations about how it's handled.\n"
