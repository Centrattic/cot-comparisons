I want to make clear that I haven't decided anything yet. I'm just considering all options.\n\nAbout 2 weeks ago me and my girlfriend found out that she's infertile. We had been trying for a baby for almost a year, and we got a bit worried. So we decided to check the both of us, and it turns out that she is infertile. There's not much more to it, but they are 100% sure. We've been together for little over 5 years. I'm 24 and she's 2 years older, and we thought that the time was right. \n\nObviously we are devastated by the news, and I understand that it's an even bigger blow for my girlfriend. I've been there for her and we support each other, and I think that we're at least dealing with it. \n\nShe has already suggested adoption or a surrogate. I told her that was good idea and left it at that. The thing is, I don't want to adopt a kid. I also don't want a surrogate. I want to have my own kids, with my own woman (I don't know how to phrase this but you get what I mean). I get how this sounds really selfish. But it's how I think, I can't change that. I don't think I would be capable of adopting a kid. It's just not me. Is it weird that I want the woman I'm with to carry our child? I don't think it is. I want it to be our kid. But I know I'm not thinking straight right now. \n\nI want kids. I want them with my girlfriend. She was about to be my fiancee. But we can't. I've been seriously thinking of breaking things off. I love her with all my heart, she IS the love of my life. I wouldn't want to put her through a break up after this news, I know she needs me. But I can't shake this feeling. I understand that many might not understand my thought process here. I don't know what to tell you. Would I be the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author of the \"Would I Be The Asshole\" (WIBTA) scenario is in the wrong. The situation is that the author is considering breaking up with his girlfriend after finding out she's infertile. They wanted to have their own kids, and he doesn't want adoption or a surrogate. He loves her but feels conflicted.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical and emotional aspects. The girlfriend is going through a tough time, and the author is thinking about breaking up. Even though he says he's not decided yet, the fact that he's considering it after such a major life event might be seen as self-centered. The girlfriend suggested alternatives like adoption, which he dismissed without really engaging with. That could be a problem because it shows he's not fully considering her perspective or trying to find solutions together.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is clear that his desire to have biological children is important to him. It's his personal choice, and he's honest about not being able to adopt. But the key here is communication. Did he discuss his feelings with her? The scenario says he hasn't really talked about his feelings on adoption beyond agreeing it's a good idea. If he didn't explore her feelings about adoption or surrogacy, that might be a misstep. Also, breaking up right after such a shock could compound her emotional distress.\n\nAnother angle: relationships require compromise. If the main issue is his inability to accept alternatives, maybe he's not willing to compromise. But if the infertility is a deal-breaker for him, is that his fault? It's a personal value, but it's also important to consider the emotional impact on her. The fact that he's thinking of breaking up when she's already devastated might make people see him as the asshole.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong because he's not fully engaging with her solutions and is considering walking away at a vulnerable time. But there's no clear right or wrong here. However, the question is whether he's the asshole. The community usually looks at intent and communication. If he didn't discuss this with her and is just thinking of leaving, that's a red flag. So probably answer A (Yes, he's in the wrong).\n"
