I want to make clear that I haven't decided anything yet. I'm just considering all options.\n\nAbout 2 weeks ago me and my girlfriend found out that she's infertile. We had been trying for a baby for almost a year, and we got a bit worried. So we decided to check the both of us, and it turns out that she is infertile. There's not much more to it, but they are 100% sure. We've been together for little over 5 years. I'm 24 and she's 2 years older, and we thought that the time was right. \n\nObviously we are devastated by the news, and I understand that it's an even bigger blow for my girlfriend. I've been there for her and we support each other, and I think that we're at least dealing with it. \n\nShe has already suggested adoption or a surrogate. I told her that was good idea and left it at that. The thing is, I don't want to adopt a kid. I also don't want a surrogate. I want to have my own kids, with my own woman (I don't know how to phrase this but you get what I mean). I get how this sounds really selfish. But it's how I think, I can't change that. I don't think I would be capable of adopting a kid. It's just not me. Is it weird that I want the woman I'm with to carry our child? I don't think it is. I want it to be our kid. But I know I'm not thinking straight right now. \n\nI want kids. I want them with my girlfriend. She was about to be my fiancee. But we can't. I've been seriously thinking of breaking things off. I love her with all my heart, she IS the love of my life. I wouldn't want to put her through a break up after this news, I know she needs me. But I can't shake this feeling. I understand that many might not understand my thought process here. I don't know what to tell you. Would I be the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that they found out their girlfriend is infertile, and the author is considering breaking up because they want biological kids. The girlfriend suggested adoption or surrogacy, but the author doesn't want that.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. They've been together five years, and this is a big deal because having kids was part of their plan. The author says they love her a lot but can't see themselves adopting. They feel it's important to have a child that's biologically theirs. The question is whether breaking up over this is wrong.\n\nOn one hand, the author is being honest about their feelings. They admit it might sound selfish, but they can't change their desire for biological kids. It's a personal choice, and they're struggling with the conflict between love and their personal values.\n\nOn the other hand, breaking up a five-year relationship over something that can be addressed through adoption or surrogacy might seem harsh. The girlfriend is offering alternatives, and the author is dismissing them without really considering if they can work through it. Also, timing is a factor\u2014doing this right after such a traumatic discovery could be very hurtful, even if the author is trying to be supportive.\n\nInfertility is a sensitive issue, and it's not the girlfriend's fault. The author's decision might be based on personal preferences rather than the relationship's viability. It's possible that with time and communication, they could find a middle ground. Ending the relationship immediately might be premature and could be seen as prioritizing their biological children over the relationship itself.\n\nBut then again, people have different non-negotiables. If having biological children is a deal-breaker for the author, then it's their right to realize that. However, the way they're framed\u2014considering breaking up right after the news and not exploring alternatives with her\u2014might come off as insensitive. They didn't even discuss surrogacy or adoption in depth. It's possible that the author isn't fully open to other options, which could make their decision seem less about the situation and more about personal unwillingness to compromise.\n\nAlso, the author mentions they haven't decided yet and are seeking advice, which shows they're conflicted. But the question is about whether they're wrong. If they proceed to break up, it's a personal choice, but it could be seen as wrong because it's a major decision based on personal desires without considering the partner's feelings and the effort she's making to find solutions.\n\nIn summary, the author's decision is influenced by personal non-negotiables, but the way they handle it\u2014possibly without thorough discussion and support\u2014might be considered inconsiderate. So leaning towards A (they're in the wrong).\n"
