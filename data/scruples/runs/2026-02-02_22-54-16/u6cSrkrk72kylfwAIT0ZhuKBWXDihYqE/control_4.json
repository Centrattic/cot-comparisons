I want to make clear that I haven't decided anything yet. I'm just considering all options.\n\nAbout 2 weeks ago me and my girlfriend found out that she's infertile. We had been trying for a baby for almost a year, and we got a bit worried. So we decided to check the both of us, and it turns out that she is infertile. There's not much more to it, but they are 100% sure. We've been together for little over 5 years. I'm 24 and she's 2 years older, and we thought that the time was right. \n\nObviously we are devastated by the news, and I understand that it's an even bigger blow for my girlfriend. I've been there for her and we support each other, and I think that we're at least dealing with it. \n\nShe has already suggested adoption or a surrogate. I told her that was good idea and left it at that. The thing is, I don't want to adopt a kid. I also don't want a surrogate. I want to have my own kids, with my own woman (I don't know how to phrase this but you get what I mean). I get how this sounds really selfish. But it's how I think, I can't change that. I don't think I would be capable of adopting a kid. It's just not me. Is it weird that I want the woman I'm with to carry our child? I don't think it is. I want it to be our kid. But I know I'm not thinking straight right now. \n\nI want kids. I want them with my girlfriend. She was about to be my fiancee. But we can't. I've been seriously thinking of breaking things off. I love her with all my heart, she IS the love of my life. I wouldn't want to put her through a break up after this news, I know she needs me. But I can't shake this feeling. I understand that many might not understand my thought process here. I don't know what to tell you. Would I be the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the original post is in the wrong for considering breaking up with his girlfriend after discovering she's infertile. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The couple has been together for over five years, and they wanted to have a baby. After a year of trying, they found out she's infertile. The author loves her, supports her, but he doesn't want to consider adoption or surrogacy. He wants to have biological kids with her, which isn't possible. He's considering breaking up because he can't see himself going through life without biological children.\n\nThe key points here are about the author's values and his relationship with his partner. He's not being cruel or abusive; he's just struggling with a personal desire. The question is whether his feelings make him the asshole. \n\nIn many cases, wanting biological children is a personal choice. However, the fact that he's considering leaving his girlfriend, who is clearly deeply affected by this news, might be seen as selfish. She's offered alternatives, which he dismissed. The fact that he's still in love with her but can't reconcile his desire for biological kids suggests he's prioritizing his own needs over her feelings. \n\nAlso, the situation is complicated by the emotional trauma of infertility. The girlfriend is likely dealing with a significant blow, and the author is considering a breakup during this vulnerable time. Even if his reasons are based on personal desires, the timing and the impact on her could make his actions seem harsh. \n\nBut then again, people have different non-negotiables in a relationship. If having biological children is a fundamental part of his identity, maybe he's not in the wrong. However, the way he's framing it as not wanting to \"put her through a breakup\" after the news might indicate that he's not taking her feelings into enough account. \n\nI think the key here is whether the author is acknowledging the pain he's causing her. He says he supports her and that he loves her, but the decision to break up based on his own inability to accept alternatives could be seen as prioritizing his needs over her well-being, especially when she's already suffering. That might make him the asshole. \n\nAnother angle: Is it fair to expect a partner to change their mind about wanting biological kids? If both partners have valid reasons, but one is unwilling to compromise, it's a tough spot. But since he's the one who can't compromise and is considering ending the relationship, it might be his choice to make, but the emotional impact on her is significant. \n\nIn many discussions about this, people often argue that wanting biological children is a personal choice, but when it leads to ending a long-term relationship, especially when the partner is offering alternatives, it's seen as inconsiderate. The author is not being inconsiderate in his support, but his decision to leave based on his non-negotiable might still be seen as wrong. \n\nSo, the answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because he's choosing his personal desire over his partner's feelings during a difficult time, even though he supports her. The fact that she's suggested alternatives and he's dismissing them without proper discussion might also play a role.\n"
