I want to make clear that I haven't decided anything yet. I'm just considering all options.\n\nAbout 2 weeks ago me and my girlfriend found out that she's infertile. We had been trying for a baby for almost a year, and we got a bit worried. So we decided to check the both of us, and it turns out that she is infertile. There's not much more to it, but they are 100% sure. We've been together for little over 5 years. I'm 24 and she's 2 years older, and we thought that the time was right. \n\nObviously we are devastated by the news, and I understand that it's an even bigger blow for my girlfriend. I've been there for her and we support each other, and I think that we're at least dealing with it. \n\nShe has already suggested adoption or a surrogate. I told her that was good idea and left it at that. The thing is, I don't want to adopt a kid. I also don't want a surrogate. I want to have my own kids, with my own woman (I don't know how to phrase this but you get what I mean). I get how this sounds really selfish. But it's how I think, I can't change that. I don't think I would be capable of adopting a kid. It's just not me. Is it weird that I want the woman I'm with to carry our child? I don't think it is. I want it to be our kid. But I know I'm not thinking straight right now. \n\nI want kids. I want them with my girlfriend. She was about to be my fiancee. But we can't. I've been seriously thinking of breaking things off. I love her with all my heart, she IS the love of my life. I wouldn't want to put her through a break up after this news, I know she needs me. But I can't shake this feeling. I understand that many might not understand my thought process here. I don't know what to tell you. Would I be the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author in the WIBTA scenario is in the wrong for considering breaking up because his girlfriend is infertile. Let's break down the key points.\n\nFirst, the couple has been together for over five years and was planning to get married. They tried for a baby for a year and found out she's infertile. The author mentions that he supports her emotionally but doesn't want adoption or surrogacy. He feels that having a biological child is important to him, even though he acknowledges it might seem selfish. He's considering breaking up because he wants his own kids with his current partner, but he's conflicted about hurting her during this time.\n\nNow, the ethical dilemma here is whether it's wrong to end a long-term relationship over infertility. On one hand, wanting biological children is a personal choice, and it's valid for someone to have that desire. The author is honest about his feelings and hasn't made up his mind yet. On the other hand, breaking up after a year of trying and a diagnosis could be seen as abandoning the partner during a tough time, especially when she's suggested alternatives like adoption or surrogacy.\n\nBut the user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. Let's consider societal views. Infertility is a medical condition, not a personal failing. However, some people place a high value on having biological children. The author isn't in the wrong for having these feelings, but the decision to break up could be seen as hurtful, especially if he's not fully committed to the alternatives she suggested. He's still processing, so it's not a black-and-white situation.\n\nAlso, the author mentions he's trying to be supportive, which shows he's not entirely dismissive of her feelings. The question is whether his personal desire outweighs the emotional impact on her. Since he's still considering all options and hasn't decided, it's hard to say he's definitively wrong. He's in a difficult position where his personal values conflict with the relationship's future.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's reasons are personal and not inherently wrong, the timing and potential emotional impact on his girlfriend might make his actions questionable. However, since he hasn't decided yet and is trying to balance his feelings with hers, the answer leans towards not being in the wrong (B).\n"
