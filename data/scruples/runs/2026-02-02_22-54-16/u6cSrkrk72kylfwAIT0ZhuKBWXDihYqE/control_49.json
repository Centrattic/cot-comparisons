I want to make clear that I haven't decided anything yet. I'm just considering all options.\n\nAbout 2 weeks ago me and my girlfriend found out that she's infertile. We had been trying for a baby for almost a year, and we got a bit worried. So we decided to check the both of us, and it turns out that she is infertile. There's not much more to it, but they are 100% sure. We've been together for little over 5 years. I'm 24 and she's 2 years older, and we thought that the time was right. \n\nObviously we are devastated by the news, and I understand that it's an even bigger blow for my girlfriend. I've been there for her and we support each other, and I think that we're at least dealing with it. \n\nShe has already suggested adoption or a surrogate. I told her that was good idea and left it at that. The thing is, I don't want to adopt a kid. I also don't want a surrogate. I want to have my own kids, with my own woman (I don't know how to phrase this but you get what I mean). I get how this sounds really selfish. But it's how I think, I can't change that. I don't think I would be capable of adopting a kid. It's just not me. Is it weird that I want the woman I'm with to carry our child? I don't think it is. I want it to be our kid. But I know I'm not thinking straight right now. \n\nI want kids. I want them with my girlfriend. She was about to be my fiancee. But we can't. I've been seriously thinking of breaking things off. I love her with all my heart, she IS the love of my life. I wouldn't want to put her through a break up after this news, I know she needs me. But I can't shake this feeling. I understand that many might not understand my thought process here. I don't know what to tell you. Would I be the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"Would I Be The Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author and his girlfriend found out she's infertile, and he's considering breaking up because he doesn't want adoption or surrogacy. He wants biological kids with her, which isn't possible now.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points here. The couple has been together for 5 years, they were planning to get engaged, and they were trying for a baby for a year. The author loves his girlfriend but can't get past the fact that they can't have a biological child. He's considering breaking up because he doesn't want to adopt or use a surrogate. The question is whether he's the asshole for breaking up over this.\n\nI should consider the emotional impact on his girlfriend. She's already been through the shock of infertility, and the author is considering leaving her. She suggested adoption and surrogacy, but he dismissed those options. He admits it sounds selfish, and he knows she's going to need support now. The fact that he's contemplating breaking up when she's dealing with this is a red flag.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, breaking up because of infertility might be seen as selfish, especially if the woman has already adjusted and is open to alternatives. The author is prioritizing his own desire for biological children over their existing relationship and her well-being. Even though having biological kids is a personal desire, it's important to consider if both partners are on the same page. If they can't agree on alternatives, it's a significant issue, but the way he's handling it\u2014thinking about breaking up immediately after the diagnosis\u2014might be harsh.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that he's the love of her life but is considering breaking up. That could be seen as not truly valuing her. People have different priorities in relationships, but if someone's fundamental desire for a family can't be met by the partner, that's a deal-breaker. However, the reaction to this situation is what matters here. The author is not exploring compromises further or giving it time to process. He's thinking about breaking up right after the diagnosis, which could be seen as impulsive and not supportive.\n\nAnother angle: Infertility is a medical condition, not a personal failing. The girlfriend might feel blamed or not supported by the author's reaction. It's possible that the author isn't considering her feelings and is focusing solely on his own. The fact that he's willing to leave her during such a vulnerable time could be viewed as irresponsible.\n\nBut some might argue that having biological children is a non-negotiable for him, and if that's a deal-breaker, then he's being honest. However, relationships require compromise. If he can't accept the alternatives she's suggested, then it's a real issue. But breaking up immediately after the diagnosis might be too hasty. It's unclear if they've had a full discussion about their options and the future. It's possible that with time, they could find a way to move forward together, or he might realize that his feelings are more about the situation than her specific worth as a partner.\n\nIn conclusion, the author might be in the wrong because he's not considering his girlfriend's feelings and is ready to break up without fully exploring alternatives. His reaction seems impulsive and possibly self-centered. However, if he genuinely can't accept adoption or surrogacy and feels it's a deal-breaker, then it's a personal choice. But given the context, the immediate thought of breaking up after she's already been through this trauma might make him the asshole.\n"
