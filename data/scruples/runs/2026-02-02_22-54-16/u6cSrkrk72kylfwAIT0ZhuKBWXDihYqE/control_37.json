I want to make clear that I haven't decided anything yet. I'm just considering all options.\n\nAbout 2 weeks ago me and my girlfriend found out that she's infertile. We had been trying for a baby for almost a year, and we got a bit worried. So we decided to check the both of us, and it turns out that she is infertile. There's not much more to it, but they are 100% sure. We've been together for little over 5 years. I'm 24 and she's 2 years older, and we thought that the time was right. \n\nObviously we are devastated by the news, and I understand that it's an even bigger blow for my girlfriend. I've been there for her and we support each other, and I think that we're at least dealing with it. \n\nShe has already suggested adoption or a surrogate. I told her that was good idea and left it at that. The thing is, I don't want to adopt a kid. I also don't want a surrogate. I want to have my own kids, with my own woman (I don't know how to phrase this but you get what I mean). I get how this sounds really selfish. But it's how I think, I can't change that. I don't think I would be capable of adopting a kid. It's just not me. Is it weird that I want the woman I'm with to carry our child? I don't think it is. I want it to be our kid. But I know I'm not thinking straight right now. \n\nI want kids. I want them with my girlfriend. She was about to be my fiancee. But we can't. I've been seriously thinking of breaking things off. I love her with all my heart, she IS the love of my life. I wouldn't want to put her through a break up after this news, I know she needs me. But I can't shake this feeling. I understand that many might not understand my thought process here. I don't know what to tell you. Would I be the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Would I Be The Asshole?\" (WIBTA) scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a couple who have been trying to conceive for a year and found out the girlfriend is infertile. The author is considering breaking up because he doesn't want to pursue adoption or surrogacy, even though he loves her deeply.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points here. The author is struggling with his desire to have biological children versus supporting his partner. He mentions that he loves her and considers her the love of his life, but his inability to accept alternatives is causing him to think about ending the relationship. \n\nThe main ethical question here is whether his decision to break up is justified. On one hand, his feelings and personal desires are valid\u2014many people do want to have biological children. On the other hand, ending a long-term relationship over this issue might be seen as selfish, especially since he acknowledges the emotional toll it's taking on his partner. \n\nIt's important to consider the perspective of the girlfriend. She suggested adoption or surrogacy, which shows she's still hopeful and willing to explore options. The author's refusal to consider these options, despite agreeing they're a good idea, might come off as dismissive of her efforts to adapt. Also, the timing is crucial\u2014they were about to get engaged, so the pressure to resolve this issue before making a lifelong commitment adds another layer of complexity.\n\nAnother angle is the communication aspect. The author states he's not making a decision yet, but his internal conflict is leading him toward a breakup. It's possible he hasn't fully discussed his feelings with his partner, which could prevent mutual understanding. Open communication is key in such situations, and breaking up without exhausting all possibilities might be premature.\n\nSocietal norms and personal values play a role too. Some people prioritize having biological children, while others can be flexible. However, the author's admission that he can't imagine adopting or using a surrogate might indicate a fundamental incompatibility on this issue, which is a significant factor in a relationship aiming for children.\n\nBut is it fair to label him as the asshole? The term \"asshole\" here is subjective. If the breakup is driven by his own priorities despite the emotional impact on his partner, it could be seen as selfish. Conversely, if he feels that he can't compromise on such a core value, some might argue he's making a difficult but honest decision. However, the fact that he's considering breaking up before exhausting all alternatives and without fully discussing it with her could make him the asshole, as it might prioritize his needs over hers during a vulnerable time.\n\nAlso, the question of whether wanting biological children is a deal-breaker is subjective. However, the way he approaches the situation without considering his partner's feelings and the immediate decision to break up might be the issue. The girlfriend is already dealing with the shock of infertility, and adding a breakup could be a traumatic double blow. The author needs to weigh his personal desires against the emotional well-being of his partner and whether there's room for compromise.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's feelings are valid, his potential decision to break up without thoroughly exploring options and without open communication with his partner might make him the asshole. It's a complex situation, but the immediate consideration of breaking up, especially when the partner is suggesting alternatives, leans toward him being in the wrong here.\n"
