I want to make clear that I haven't decided anything yet. I'm just considering all options.\n\nAbout 2 weeks ago me and my girlfriend found out that she's infertile. We had been trying for a baby for almost a year, and we got a bit worried. So we decided to check the both of us, and it turns out that she is infertile. There's not much more to it, but they are 100% sure. We've been together for little over 5 years. I'm 24 and she's 2 years older, and we thought that the time was right. \n\nObviously we are devastated by the news, and I understand that it's an even bigger blow for my girlfriend. I've been there for her and we support each other, and I think that we're at least dealing with it. \n\nShe has already suggested adoption or a surrogate. I told her that was good idea and left it at that. The thing is, I don't want to adopt a kid. I also don't want a surrogate. I want to have my own kids, with my own woman (I don't know how to phrase this but you get what I mean). I get how this sounds really selfish. But it's how I think, I can't change that. I don't think I would be capable of adopting a kid. It's just not me. Is it weird that I want the woman I'm with to carry our child? I don't think it is. I want it to be our kid. But I know I'm not thinking straight right now. \n\nI want kids. I want them with my girlfriend. She was about to be my fiancee. But we can't. I've been seriously thinking of breaking things off. I love her with all my heart, she IS the love of my life. I wouldn't want to put her through a break up after this news, I know she needs me. But I can't shake this feeling. I understand that many might not understand my thought process here. I don't know what to tell you. Would I be the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong after considering breaking up with his girlfriend because she's infertile. The author is 24, they've been together for five years, and they wanted to have kids. Now that they know she can't, he's thinking of breaking up because he doesn't want adoption or surrogacy. He loves her but can't get past wanting his own biological child.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. Is wanting biological children a valid reason to end a relationship? That's subjective. Some people value having biological kids, others don't. The girlfriend suggested adoption and surrogacy, but the author isn't open to those options. That's a key point. The author is being honest about his feelings, which is important in relationships. But is it selfish to prioritize his desire for biological children over staying with someone he loves?\n\nThen there's the emotional impact. The girlfriend is probably devastated, and breaking up after this news would add to her emotional burden. The author acknowledges that she needs support, but he's struggling with his own feelings. Is it fair to her to end things when she's already dealing with infertility? Also, the author mentions he hasn't decided yet, so he's still considering options.\n\nAnother angle is the communication. The author told her about his stance on adoption but didn't go into detail. Maybe they need more open conversation about their future. However, the author is clear that he can't change his feelings. In relationships, compromise is important, but if both partners can't meet in the middle, it's a tough call. The author isn't forcing her to leave; he's considering his own feelings.\n\nLegally and morally, there's no right or wrong here. Relationships are based on mutual compatibility. If having biological children is a non-negotiable for the author, and the girlfriend can't fulfill that, maybe it's a dealbreaker. But some might argue it's selfish to end a loving relationship over something that could be addressed with adoption or surrogacy. Others might say it's okay if it's a fundamental part of his identity.\n\nThe author is also young, at 24, and the situation is emotionally charged. He's trying to process the news and his feelings. The question is whether his potential decision makes him an asshole. It's a personal choice, but the key is whether he's being respectful and empathetic. The author seems to be trying to support her while also being honest about his feelings.\n\nIn conclusion, there's no clear right or wrong. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong for having these feelings, but he should consider the impact on his girlfriend and ensure they've fully discussed all options. However, since the question is whether he's in the wrong, the answer depends on perspective. If he's acting out of selfishness without considering her feelings, maybe A. But if he's being honest and struggling with a tough decision, then B. Since the author is trying to be supportive and hasn't made a decision yet, leaning towards B.\n"
