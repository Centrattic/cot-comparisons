I want to make clear that I haven't decided anything yet. I'm just considering all options.\n\nAbout 2 weeks ago me and my girlfriend found out that she's infertile. We had been trying for a baby for almost a year, and we got a bit worried. So we decided to check the both of us, and it turns out that she is infertile. There's not much more to it, but they are 100% sure. We've been together for little over 5 years. I'm 24 and she's 2 years older, and we thought that the time was right. \n\nObviously we are devastated by the news, and I understand that it's an even bigger blow for my girlfriend. I've been there for her and we support each other, and I think that we're at least dealing with it. \n\nShe has already suggested adoption or a surrogate. I told her that was good idea and left it at that. The thing is, I don't want to adopt a kid. I also don't want a surrogate. I want to have my own kids, with my own woman (I don't know how to phrase this but you get what I mean). I get how this sounds really selfish. But it's how I think, I can't change that. I don't think I would be capable of adopting a kid. It's just not me. Is it weird that I want the woman I'm with to carry our child? I don't think it is. I want it to be our kid. But I know I'm not thinking straight right now. \n\nI want kids. I want them with my girlfriend. She was about to be my fiancee. But we can't. I've been seriously thinking of breaking things off. I love her with all my heart, she IS the love of my life. I wouldn't want to put her through a break up after this news, I know she needs me. But I can't shake this feeling. I understand that many might not understand my thought process here. I don't know what to tell you. Would I be the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's start by understanding the situation. The person is in a 5-year relationship, they and their girlfriend tried to have a baby for a year, and she's found to be infertile. The author is considering breaking up because they don't want to adopt or use a surrogate and they want to have biological children. They love her but feel conflicted.\n\nFirst, I should consider the emotional aspects. The girlfriend is going through a major disappointment, and the author is being supportive but also struggling with their own feelings. The key issue is the author's stance on not wanting adoption or surrogacy. \n\nIs it selfish? The author admits they might sound selfish. But wanting biological children is a personal choice. However, the timing of the breakup after such news could be seen as insensitive. The girlfriend is likely already dealing with the emotional impact of infertility, and the author is considering breaking up right after that, which might make her feel rejected at a vulnerable time.\n\nAlso, the author hasn't discussed their feelings openly with the girlfriend. They mention she suggested adoption, but the author didn't explore that further. Maybe there's a lack of communication. The author is considering breaking up but hasn't had an honest conversation about their feelings, which could be a problem.\n\nBut then again, the author is in a tough spot. They love their girlfriend but can't reconcile their desire for biological children. It's a personal choice, but breaking up immediately after such news could be seen as using her vulnerability as an excuse. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for considering this breakup.\n\nLooking at societal perspectives, some people might see the author's desire for biological children as valid, while others might see the breakup as premature or not giving the relationship enough time. The answer hinges on whether the author is making a selfish decision or a difficult but honest one.\n\nI think the answer leans towards A (the author is in the wrong) because the breakup is being considered immediately after the infertility diagnosis, which could be seen as using her emotional state as a justification. The author hasn't fully explored alternatives with her and might be making a decision based on their own unresolved feelings rather than mutual discussion.\n"
