I want to make clear that I haven't decided anything yet. I'm just considering all options.\n\nAbout 2 weeks ago me and my girlfriend found out that she's infertile. We had been trying for a baby for almost a year, and we got a bit worried. So we decided to check the both of us, and it turns out that she is infertile. There's not much more to it, but they are 100% sure. We've been together for little over 5 years. I'm 24 and she's 2 years older, and we thought that the time was right. \n\nObviously we are devastated by the news, and I understand that it's an even bigger blow for my girlfriend. I've been there for her and we support each other, and I think that we're at least dealing with it. \n\nShe has already suggested adoption or a surrogate. I told her that was good idea and left it at that. The thing is, I don't want to adopt a kid. I also don't want a surrogate. I want to have my own kids, with my own woman (I don't know how to phrase this but you get what I mean). I get how this sounds really selfish. But it's how I think, I can't change that. I don't think I would be capable of adopting a kid. It's just not me. Is it weird that I want the woman I'm with to carry our child? I don't think it is. I want it to be our kid. But I know I'm not thinking straight right now. \n\nI want kids. I want them with my girlfriend. She was about to be my fiancee. But we can't. I've been seriously thinking of breaking things off. I love her with all my heart, she IS the love of my life. I wouldn't want to put her through a break up after this news, I know she needs me. But I can't shake this feeling. I understand that many might not understand my thought process here. I don't know what to tell you. Would I be the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that they and their girlfriend found out she's infertile, and he's considering breaking up because he doesn't want to adopt or use a surrogate. He loves her, but he can't imagine not having his own biological kids.\n\nFirst, I need to think about the context. They've been together for over five years, and they were planning to get married. They wanted kids, but infertility is a medical reality. The author is struggling with whether to end the relationship because of his inability to accept adoption or surrogacy. \n\nInfertility is a tough issue. Both people might have different feelings about it. The girlfriend is already suggesting alternatives, which shows she's trying to work through this. But the author isn't open to those options, which might be a deal-breaker for him. \n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong. Well, it's a personal decision. People have different values. Some people really want biological children, and if that's a non-negotiable, then maybe it's not fair to stay in a relationship if it's impossible. However, breaking up right after the diagnosis could be seen as insensitive, especially if the girlfriend is already dealing with the emotional impact. \n\nBut he says he hasn't decided yet. He's considering options. The problem is that his stance seems to be that he can't compromise on having his own biological kids. If that's the case, then maybe it's a legitimate reason for him to want to end the relationship. But is it selfish? Some might argue that he's being selfish for not considering adoption or surrogacy, which are valid ways to build a family. Others might say it's his right to have a family as he envisions it. \n\nThe key here is whether he's being inconsiderate. He acknowledges that his feelings might sound selfish. But he's also in a difficult position. However, breaking up over this might hurt her, especially if she's trying to adjust. But if he truly can't see himself being happy without biological children, maybe he's not being in the wrong for choosing to end things. \n\nIt's a tough call. The author is in a moral dilemma. But given that he's considering his own needs and values, maybe he's not in the wrong, even if some might judge him. The answer could be B (No), he's not in the wrong because people have to make decisions based on their own values. But others might say that he's not being supportive enough, so maybe A. Hmm.\n"
