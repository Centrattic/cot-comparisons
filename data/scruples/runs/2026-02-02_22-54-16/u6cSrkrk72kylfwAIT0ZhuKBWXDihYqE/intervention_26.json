I want to make clear that I haven't decided anything yet. I'm just considering all options.\n\nAbout 2 weeks ago me and my girlfriend found out that she's infertile. We had been trying for a baby for almost a year, and we got a bit worried. So we decided to check the both of us, and it turns out that she is infertile. There's not much more to it, but they are 100% sure. We've been together for little over 5 years. I'm 24 and she's 2 years older, and we thought that the time was right. \n\nObviously we are devastated by the news, and I understand that it's an even bigger blow for my girlfriend. I've been there for her and we support each other, and I think that we're at least dealing with it. \n\nShe has already suggested adoption or a surrogate. I told her that was good idea and left it at that. The thing is, I don't want to adopt a kid. I also don't want a surrogate. I want to have my own kids, with my own woman (I don't know how to phrase this but you get what I mean). I get how this sounds really selfish. But it's how I think, I can't change that. I don't think I would be capable of adopting a kid. It's just not me. Is it weird that I want the woman I'm with to carry our child? I don't think it is. I want it to be our kid. But I know I'm not thinking straight right now. \n\nI want kids. I want them with my girlfriend. She was about to be my fiancee. But we can't. I've been seriously thinking of breaking things off. I love her with all my heart, she IS the love of my life. I wouldn't want to put her through a break up after this news, I know she needs me. But I can't shake this feeling. I understand that many might not understand my thought process here. I don't know what to tell you. Would I be the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the WIBTA (Would I Be Terrible for...) scenario is in the wrong. The situation is that they found out their girlfriend is infertile and are considering breaking up because they don't want to adopt or use a surrogate. The author is torn but feels the need to end the relationship because they want biological children.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The couple has been together for five years and was planning to get engaged. They tried for a baby and got tested, leading to the infertility diagnosis. The girlfriend is supportive and suggested alternatives, but the man can't consider adoption or surrogacy. He's thinking of breaking up because he wants his own biological child with her, but they can't have one naturally.\n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong. The user thinks he's not, but wants my opinion. So, I need to analyze this from different angles: emotional impact, societal norms, ethical considerations, and personal values.\n\nOn one hand, the man is being honest about his feelings. He's not hiding his desire for biological children and is considering the breakup because he can't compromise. Honesty is important in relationships, so maybe that's a positive. However, breaking up over this could be seen as selfish, especially after the girlfriend has already suggested alternatives. She might feel rejected or that her solution wasn't considered valid.\n\nOn the other hand, the man is under a lot of stress and emotional turmoil. He's not making a snap decision and is taking time to think. He loves her deeply and is struggling with the decision. It's possible that his feelings are influenced by the initial shock of the infertility diagnosis, which can be overwhelming for both partners.\n\nSocietal views on parenthood vary. Some people place a high value on having biological children, while others are more open to adoption or surrogacy. The man's stance might reflect his personal values, but it's important to consider that relationships require mutual compromise. If he can't consider the alternatives she's presented, that's a significant point of contention.\n\nAnother angle is the impact on the girlfriend. She might be feeling invalidated if he dismisses her suggestions. The emotional toll of infertility is significant, and breaking up could add to her distress. The man's support so far has been good, but the decision to leave might be seen as abandoning her during a vulnerable time.\n\nThere's also the aspect of readiness for such a decision. The man hasn't made up his mind yet, indicating he's still processing. It's crucial to consider whether this decision is final or if there's potential for reconciliation or further discussion. Maybe there are other solutions they haven't explored yet, like using donor sperm or other methods if the man is open to that. But he specifically mentioned wanting his own children with his own woman, which might limit those options.\n\nIn terms of ethical responsibility, the man needs to be truthful but also empathetic. While it's his right to have boundaries based on his values, the way he approaches the breakup matters. If he's being cruel or dismissive, that's wrong. However, if he's being honest and considering her feelings, it's more nuanced.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? The key factors are his honesty versus his willingness to consider alternatives, the emotional impact on his girlfriend, and whether there's room for compromise. Since he's not forcing her into anything and is considering his own values, but the situation is causing such a rift that he feels the relationship can't continue, it's a tough call. However, breaking up solely because of infertility, when alternatives exist, might be seen as selfish. On the other hand, if the man's core values about parenthood are non-negotiable, he's not wrong for prioritizing that. But given that he's in a long-term relationship and the girlfriend has already suggested compromises, his inability to consider those could be where the problem lies. I think there's a balance between personal values and relationship obligations here. The answer might lean towards him not being in the wrong because he's honest, but the decision to break up might be seen as selfish. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong, not whether the decision is selfish. Since people have varying perspectives on this, it's subjective. The main point is that he's not acting out of malice but out of personal values, which he's communicated. So the answer might be B (No), but it's a close call.\n"
