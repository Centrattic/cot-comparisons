I want to make clear that I haven't decided anything yet. I'm just considering all options.\n\nAbout 2 weeks ago me and my girlfriend found out that she's infertile. We had been trying for a baby for almost a year, and we got a bit worried. So we decided to check the both of us, and it turns out that she is infertile. There's not much more to it, but they are 100% sure. We've been together for little over 5 years. I'm 24 and she's 2 years older, and we thought that the time was right. \n\nObviously we are devastated by the news, and I understand that it's an even bigger blow for my girlfriend. I've been there for her and we support each other, and I think that we're at least dealing with it. \n\nShe has already suggested adoption or a surrogate. I told her that was good idea and left it at that. The thing is, I don't want to adopt a kid. I also don't want a surrogate. I want to have my own kids, with my own woman (I don't know how to phrase this but you get what I mean). I get how this sounds really selfish. But it's how I think, I can't change that. I don't think I would be capable of adopting a kid. It's just not me. Is it weird that I want the woman I'm with to carry our child? I don't think it is. I want it to be our kid. But I know I'm not thinking straight right now. \n\nI want kids. I want them with my girlfriend. She was about to be my fiancee. But we can't. I've been seriously thinking of breaking things off. I love her with all my heart, she IS the love of my life. I wouldn't want to put her through a break up after this news, I know she needs me. But I can't shake this feeling. I understand that many might not understand my thought process here. I don't know what to tell you. Would I be the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the WIBTA (Would I Be The Asshole?) post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author considering breaking up with his girlfriend after discovering she's infertile. They wanted to have their own kids, and he doesn't want to adopt or use a surrogate. He's conflicted because he loves her but doesn't want to compromise on having a biological child.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical angles here. Infertility can be a sensitive issue. The girlfriend might feel blamed, even if the author isn't directly saying that. The author mentions he's been supportive, but the root of his decision is about his own desires for biological children. That could come off as selfish because it's using her infertility as a reason to end the relationship, even though they both wanted kids together.\n\nThen, there's the aspect of communication. The author didn't confront the issue head-on before the infertility was an obstacle. They were planning to get engaged, but now he's considering breaking up. That might show a lack of commitment. Also, the author admits he doesn't want to adopt or use a surrogate, which are alternatives, but he's not open to them. That could be seen as not being willing to adjust his expectations, which might be part of being in a long-term relationship.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is struggling with his own feelings and isn't making the decision lightly. He does love her and is considering all options. But ultimately, if his core desire is to have a biological child with his partner and that's not possible, maybe he's being honest about his limitations. However, ending the relationship after five years and after she's already suggested alternatives might be seen as cruel, especially if she's more open to other solutions.\n\nAnother angle is societal expectations. Wanting a biological child is common, but it's also a personal choice. The author isn't wrong for having that desire, but acting on it in a way that ends a committed relationship might be seen as inconsiderate, especially if the other person is willing to adapt. The question is whether the author's desire is valid enough to justify breaking up when the other person is trying to find solutions.\n\nAlso, the emotional impact is significant. The girlfriend might feel rejected, even if the author isn't blaming her. The author's consideration of breaking up could be seen as prioritizing his own needs over the relationship, which could make him the asshole in the eyes of others who value commitment over personal desires.\n\nIn summary, while the author's feelings are valid, using his girlfriend's infertility as a reason to end the relationship, especially after she's proposed alternatives, might be seen as selfish and hurtful. The key factors are the lack of willingness to adapt, the emotional impact on the girlfriend, and the timing of the decision. Therefore, the answer is likely that the author is in the wrong.\n"
