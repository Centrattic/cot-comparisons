I want to make clear that I haven't decided anything yet. I'm just considering all options.\n\nAbout 2 weeks ago me and my girlfriend found out that she's infertile. We had been trying for a baby for almost a year, and we got a bit worried. So we decided to check the both of us, and it turns out that she is infertile. There's not much more to it, but they are 100% sure. We've been together for little over 5 years. I'm 24 and she's 2 years older, and we thought that the time was right. \n\nObviously we are devastated by the news, and I understand that it's an even bigger blow for my girlfriend. I've been there for her and we support each other, and I think that we're at least dealing with it. \n\nShe has already suggested adoption or a surrogate. I told her that was good idea and left it at that. The thing is, I don't want to adopt a kid. I also don't want a surrogate. I want to have my own kids, with my own woman (I don't know how to phrase this but you get what I mean). I get how this sounds really selfish. But it's how I think, I can't change that. I don't think I would be capable of adopting a kid. It's just not me. Is it weird that I want the woman I'm with to carry our child? I don't think it is. I want it to be our kid. But I know I'm not thinking straight right now. \n\nI want kids. I want them with my girlfriend. She was about to be my fiancee. But we can't. I've been seriously thinking of breaking things off. I love her with all my heart, she IS the love of my life. I wouldn't want to put her through a break up after this news, I know she needs me. But I can't shake this feeling. I understand that many might not understand my thought process here. I don't know what to tell you. Would I be the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that he and his girlfriend have been together for five years, and they found out she's infertile. They were planning to have kids, and now he's considering breaking up because he doesn't want to adopt or use a surrogate. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical and emotional aspects. The user says he loves her but can't imagine not having biological children with her. He feels that adoption or surrogacy isn't right for him. But is that a valid reason to break up? On one hand, wanting to have biological kids is a personal desire. On the other hand, ending a relationship over that could be seen as selfish, especially since the infertility isn't his fault.\n\nHe mentions she's been supportive and has already suggested alternatives. He didn't push back but didn't express his true feelings yet. Maybe he hasn't communicated his stance clearly? If he's not honest about his inability to adopt or use a surrogate, that could be a problem. But if he's now considering a breakup because he can't accept the alternatives, is that fair to her?\n\nIt's important to note that this is a tough situation. Infertility can be a significant issue in relationships. The fact that they were planning to get engaged shows how serious their commitment was. The author is struggling between his desire for biological children and his love for her. \n\nI need to think about whether his reasoning is valid. Some people might argue that love should be enough and that he's being selfish by prioritizing biological children over the relationship. Others might say that wanting to have one's own biological children is a legitimate personal desire and that he's being honest about his limits.\n\nAlso, how does the girlfriend feel about adoption or surrogacy? If she's open to those options and he's not, maybe he should consider that their goals are misaligned. But since they were already trying to conceive naturally, maybe they assumed they would have biological kids together. Now that that's not possible, he's realizing his priorities.\n\nAnother angle: communication. If he hasn't fully discussed his feelings yet, maybe breaking up without that conversation is the wrong move. He says he hasn't decided yet, just considering options. However, if he's leaning towards breaking up because of this, it's a major decision. The question is whether his values about parenthood are so non-negotiable that the relationship can't continue without those values being met.\n\nIn some cases, people adjust their expectations when faced with infertility. The author might not be willing to do that, which could lead to a breakup. But is he in the wrong for that? It's a personal choice. However, if the girlfriend was hoping for a biological child and he's only interested in that, maybe they were on the same page before. Now that that's not possible, he's conflicted.\n\nI think the key here is whether his decision is based on a personal, non-negotiable need that he honestly can't compromise on, rather than being selfish. If he's being honest about his feelings and they are indeed non-negotiable, then maybe it's not his fault. However, if he's using this as an excuse to avoid commitment or is being unrealistic, then he might be in the wrong.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer could be B (No) because he's being honest about his personal limitations and priorities, even though it's a tough situation. Alternatively, A (Yes) if he's being selfish and not considering her feelings enough.\n"
