I want to make clear that I haven't decided anything yet. I'm just considering all options.\n\nAbout 2 weeks ago me and my girlfriend found out that she's infertile. We had been trying for a baby for almost a year, and we got a bit worried. So we decided to check the both of us, and it turns out that she is infertile. There's not much more to it, but they are 100% sure. We've been together for little over 5 years. I'm 24 and she's 2 years older, and we thought that the time was right. \n\nObviously we are devastated by the news, and I understand that it's an even bigger blow for my girlfriend. I've been there for her and we support each other, and I think that we're at least dealing with it. \n\nShe has already suggested adoption or a surrogate. I told her that was good idea and left it at that. The thing is, I don't want to adopt a kid. I also don't want a surrogate. I want to have my own kids, with my own woman (I don't know how to phrase this but you get what I mean). I get how this sounds really selfish. But it's how I think, I can't change that. I don't think I would be capable of adopting a kid. It's just not me. Is it weird that I want the woman I'm with to carry our child? I don't think it is. I want it to be our kid. But I know I'm not thinking straight right now. \n\nI want kids. I want them with my girlfriend. She was about to be my fiancee. But we can't. I've been seriously thinking of breaking things off. I love her with all my heart, she IS the love of my life. I wouldn't want to put her through a break up after this news, I know she needs me. But I can't shake this feeling. I understand that many might not understand my thought process here. I don't know what to tell you. Would I be the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the WIBTA (Would I Be The Asshole) post is in the wrong after considering breaking up with his girlfriend because she's infertile. The author states they want biological children and can't consider adoption or surrogacy, even though they acknowledge it's selfish. They love her but are conflicted.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether prioritizing biological children over a relationship is morally wrong. Infertility is a medical condition, not a choice. The girlfriend likely didn't choose this, and the breakup would be based on something beyond her control. The author is placing a high value on biological parenthood, which is a personal desire, but treating it as a deal-breaker might be seen as selfish or insensitive.\n\nThe author mentions they support each other and are dealing with the news, but the thought of breaking up because he can't accept alternatives (adoption/surrogacy) suggests his personal values are overriding her well-being. The girlfriend might feel blamed for their inability to have children, which could be traumatic. The author also mentions she suggested alternatives, which he dismissed. This could indicate he's not open to compromise, which is a key part of a healthy relationship.\n\nThere's a difference between a personal preference and a deal-breaker. If the author had discussed this before marriage and they were both on the same page, maybe it's different. But since they were planning to marry and this came up, it's a significant issue. The author might be in the wrong for not considering her suggestions and for prioritizing his own desires over the relationship. However, emotions are high here, and he's struggling. But the core issue is whether it's fair to end a long-term relationship over something neither of them caused. So, probably A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
