I want to make clear that I haven't decided anything yet. I'm just considering all options.\n\nAbout 2 weeks ago me and my girlfriend found out that she's infertile. We had been trying for a baby for almost a year, and we got a bit worried. So we decided to check the both of us, and it turns out that she is infertile. There's not much more to it, but they are 100% sure. We've been together for little over 5 years. I'm 24 and she's 2 years older, and we thought that the time was right. \n\nObviously we are devastated by the news, and I understand that it's an even bigger blow for my girlfriend. I've been there for her and we support each other, and I think that we're at least dealing with it. \n\nShe has already suggested adoption or a surrogate. I told her that was good idea and left it at that. The thing is, I don't want to adopt a kid. I also don't want a surrogate. I want to have my own kids, with my own woman (I don't know how to phrase this but you get what I mean). I get how this sounds really selfish. But it's how I think, I can't change that. I don't think I would be capable of adopting a kid. It's just not me. Is it weird that I want the woman I'm with to carry our child? I don't think it is. I want it to be our kid. But I know I'm not thinking straight right now. \n\nI want kids. I want them with my girlfriend. She was about to be my fiancee. But we can't. I've been seriously thinking of breaking things off. I love her with all my heart, she IS the love of my life. I wouldn't want to put her through a break up after this news, I know she needs me. But I can't shake this feeling. I understand that many might not understand my thought process here. I don't know what to tell you. Would I be the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user wants to know if the author of the WIBTA post is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through the scenario carefully.\n\nThe author is a guy in a 5-year relationship with his girlfriend. They tried for a baby for a year and found out she's infertile. He's considering breaking up because he doesn't want to adopt or use a surrogate. He loves her and calls her the love of his life but feels that having a biological child is important. He's torn between staying with her and supporting her through this or breaking up because he can't see himself adopting. He's worried about being selfish but is struggling with his feelings.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether his reasoning is valid. Infertility is a significant issue that can affect relationships. The key points here are his stance on not wanting adoption or surrogacy, which are the common alternatives when someone is infertile. The author's argument is that he wants a biological child with his partner, but since that's not possible, he's considering leaving. \n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong. From a moral perspective, relationships often require compromise. If having biological children is a non-negotiable for one partner, and the other partner is willing to consider alternatives, does that make the author wrong for prioritizing his biological desire? Or is it acceptable if he's honest and they both agree it's not possible?\n\nOn one hand, breaking up over this could be seen as selfish, especially if the other partner is more willing to adapt. The emotional impact on her is significant, and he acknowledges that she might need his support. However, he also states that he's not making a decision yet and is considering all options. \n\nAnother angle is whether having a biological child is a deal-breaker. If both partners had discussed this before the relationship, maybe they would have known. But since they didn't, maybe it's a valid reason to reconsider. However, some might argue that relationships should be about working through challenges together, not walking away when things get tough.\n\nAlso, the fact that he's in his mid-20s might influence his perspective. Younger people might feel more pressure to have biological children, but that's a societal factor, not necessarily a moral one. The key here is mutual respect and understanding. If he can't be supportive of her alternatives, maybe that's a valid reason to part ways, but it's a sensitive issue.\n\nI need to consider if his reasoning is selfish. He does acknowledge that he's being selfish and that it's a tough position. However, people have different values, and for some, having a biological child is essential. If he's honest about his feelings and they can't reach a compromise, it's not necessarily wrong to end the relationship.\n\nBut the fact that he's considering breaking up after she's already suggested alternatives might indicate a lack of willingness to compromise. If adoption or surrogacy are options she's open to, and he's not, maybe that's a deal-breaker for him. However, some might argue that he's not giving enough consideration to her situation and her emotional state.\n\nIn conclusion, whether the author is in the wrong depends on the balance between his personal desires and the impact on his partner. While it's his right to have certain expectations, the fact that he's prioritizing his own biological needs over her willingness to explore alternatives could be seen as selfish. Therefore, he might be in the wrong for not being willing to compromise, especially given her emotional state.\n"
