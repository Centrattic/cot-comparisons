I want to make clear that I haven't decided anything yet. I'm just considering all options.\n\nAbout 2 weeks ago me and my girlfriend found out that she's infertile. We had been trying for a baby for almost a year, and we got a bit worried. So we decided to check the both of us, and it turns out that she is infertile. There's not much more to it, but they are 100% sure. We've been together for little over 5 years. I'm 24 and she's 2 years older, and we thought that the time was right. \n\nObviously we are devastated by the news, and I understand that it's an even bigger blow for my girlfriend. I've been there for her and we support each other, and I think that we're at least dealing with it. \n\nShe has already suggested adoption or a surrogate. I told her that was good idea and left it at that. The thing is, I don't want to adopt a kid. I also don't want a surrogate. I want to have my own kids, with my own woman (I don't know how to phrase this but you get what I mean). I get how this sounds really selfish. But it's how I think, I can't change that. I don't think I would be capable of adopting a kid. It's just not me. Is it weird that I want the woman I'm with to carry our child? I don't think it is. I want it to be our kid. But I know I'm not thinking straight right now. \n\nI want kids. I want them with my girlfriend. She was about to be my fiancee. But we can't. I've been seriously thinking of breaking things off. I love her with all my heart, she IS the love of my life. I wouldn't want to put her through a break up after this news, I know she needs me. But I can't shake this feeling. I understand that many might not understand my thought process here. I don't know what to tell you. Would I be the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the WIBTA (Would I Be Terrible for...) post is wrong for considering breaking up with his girlfriend after finding out she's infertile. The question is whether he's in the wrong, answer A or B.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The couple has been together for over five years, and they wanted to have kids. After a year of trying, they found out she's infertile. He's considering breaking up because he doesn't want adoption or surrogacy, and he wants a biological child. He loves her but feels conflicted because he can't reconcile his desire for biological children with the reality of her infertility.\n\nNow, the key points here are: the author's feelings about adoption and surrogacy versus his desire for biological children, the emotional state of both partners, and whether the breakup is justified. The girlfriend is taking it harder, and he's considering breaking up not because of her behavior but because of his own inability to accept alternatives.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, is it wrong to break up over this? Well, personal values play a big role. Some people prioritize having biological children, and if that's a non-negotiable for someone, it's their choice. However, breaking up because of an infertility diagnosis that's not the girlfriend's fault might be seen as insensitive. The girlfriend is already devasted, and he's suggesting leaving her despite loving her. That could be seen as selfish or not taking responsibility for his own desires.\n\nBut on the other hand, the author is honest about his feelings. He's not blaming her for being infertile, which is a medical condition. He's also considering all options but realizes that adoption and surrogacy don't align with his personal desires. He's in a difficult position where his needs can't be met, so he's considering a breakup to be honest with himself. That might be seen as responsible rather than avoiding the issue.\n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong. If the author truly believes that having biological children is a fundamental part of his identity and happiness, then choosing to leave might be a difficult but honest decision. However, if he's not willing to explore alternatives that could fulfill his desire for parenthood (like adoption or surrogacy, even if it's not with his partner), then some might argue he's not making an effort to adapt. But the post states that he doesn't think he could adopt, so that's his personal truth.\n\nIn the WIBTA context, the community often considers intention and circumstances. If the author is breaking up because of his own non-negotiables and not due to the girlfriend's actions, some might argue he's not the asshole. However, the emotional impact on her is significant, and leaving her during a vulnerable time could be seen as wrong. The fact that he's considering this while she's already supportive shows he's conflicted, which is understandable. But the decision ultimately hinges on whether his reasons are valid in the eyes of the community.\n\nI think the answer is a bit nuanced. Since the author isn't blaming her and is honest about his feelings, some might say he's not in the wrong. However, others might view it as a failure to compromise. The key is whether his decision is based on his own values or if he's being selfish. Given that he's not holding her responsible for the infertility and is trying to be truthful about his needs, the answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong). But there's a strong argument for A too because of the emotional toll. I need to decide based on typical WIBTA responses. Often, if someone is breaking up over something that's not the other person's fault and it's a matter of personal compatibility, it's considered not the asshole. So B.\n"
