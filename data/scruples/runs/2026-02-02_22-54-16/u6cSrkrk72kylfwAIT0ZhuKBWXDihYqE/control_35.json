I want to make clear that I haven't decided anything yet. I'm just considering all options.\n\nAbout 2 weeks ago me and my girlfriend found out that she's infertile. We had been trying for a baby for almost a year, and we got a bit worried. So we decided to check the both of us, and it turns out that she is infertile. There's not much more to it, but they are 100% sure. We've been together for little over 5 years. I'm 24 and she's 2 years older, and we thought that the time was right. \n\nObviously we are devastated by the news, and I understand that it's an even bigger blow for my girlfriend. I've been there for her and we support each other, and I think that we're at least dealing with it. \n\nShe has already suggested adoption or a surrogate. I told her that was good idea and left it at that. The thing is, I don't want to adopt a kid. I also don't want a surrogate. I want to have my own kids, with my own woman (I don't know how to phrase this but you get what I mean). I get how this sounds really selfish. But it's how I think, I can't change that. I don't think I would be capable of adopting a kid. It's just not me. Is it weird that I want the woman I'm with to carry our child? I don't think it is. I want it to be our kid. But I know I'm not thinking straight right now. \n\nI want kids. I want them with my girlfriend. She was about to be my fiancee. But we can't. I've been seriously thinking of breaking things off. I love her with all my heart, she IS the love of my life. I wouldn't want to put her through a break up after this news, I know she needs me. But I can't shake this feeling. I understand that many might not understand my thought process here. I don't know what to tell you. Would I be the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for considering breaking up with his girlfriend after finding out she's infertile. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe author and his girlfriend have been together for over five years and were planning to get engaged. They wanted to have a baby, tried for a year, and she was found to be infertile. He says he's been there for her and they're dealing with it, but he doesn't want adoption or surrogacy. He wants biological children with her, but since she can't carry them, he's thinking about breaking up. He loves her and feels it's selfish, but he can't change his feelings. The question is whether he's the asshole here (A for yes, B for no).\n\nFirst, I should consider the ethical and emotional aspects. Infertility is a sensitive issue, and reactions can vary. The author is being honest about his feelings, but is that enough? He mentions that he doesn't want to adopt, which is a valid personal choice, but it's a major decision affecting his partner. If he breaks up, is he taking her needs into account? She might have already emotionally invested in surrogacy or adoption as solutions, and his rejection of those options could make her feel like she's being blamed for his inability to have biological kids.\n\nAlso, the fact that he's been there for her suggests support, but the breakup comes from a desire to avoid making her go through the process of ending the relationship. That seems a bit contradictory. If he's been supportive, maybe he should give more time to process this and explore the options they both discussed. Breaking up solely because of infertility could be seen as selfish, especially if it's a significant part of their future plans they had discussed. However, if having biological children is non-negotiable for him, maybe he's being honest about his limits, which is important for both to know.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that considering all options is part of a committed relationship. He hasn't decided yet, but the thought of breaking up is there. It's possible he's not fully considering the emotional impact on her. But then again, personal values and desires are valid. Maybe the problem is that he's not willing to compromise, which is a part of relationships. Infertility can be a deal-breaker for some, and if both can't agree on alternative solutions, it might lead to a breakup. But the question is about being in the wrong, not just if it's a bad decision.\n\nIf he truly loves her and they were about to get engaged, but he's considering breaking up over something that wasn't her fault, that could be seen as wrong. However, if he's been upfront and she still agrees to the breakup, then perhaps it's not entirely his fault. The key is whether he's being fair and considering her well-being. He mentions he doesn't want to put her through a breakup, but if he's not able to accept alternative parenthood methods, maybe it's honest to end it now rather than later. But the way he's phrasing it might come across as dismissive of her feelings and the effort to find solutions.\n\nI think the main issue is that he's not being clear about his stance and is possibly avoiding a deeper conversation. By saying he's considering breaking up because he doesn't want to adopt or use a surrogate, he's prioritizing his own desires over the relationship. That could be seen as selfish. However, if having a biological child is a fundamental part of his identity, it's a complex situation. But since the problem wasn't her fault, and he's at a point where it's causing him to think about ending the relationship, it's a tough call. I'm leaning towards A because the decision seems to be based on his personal desire without fully considering the partnership and alternative solutions, even though he's acknowledging that.\n"
