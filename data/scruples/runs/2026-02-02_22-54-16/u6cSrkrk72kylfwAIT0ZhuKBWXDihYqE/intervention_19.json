I want to make clear that I haven't decided anything yet. I'm just considering all options.\n\nAbout 2 weeks ago me and my girlfriend found out that she's infertile. We had been trying for a baby for almost a year, and we got a bit worried. So we decided to check the both of us, and it turns out that she is infertile. There's not much more to it, but they are 100% sure. We've been together for little over 5 years. I'm 24 and she's 2 years older, and we thought that the time was right. \n\nObviously we are devastated by the news, and I understand that it's an even bigger blow for my girlfriend. I've been there for her and we support each other, and I think that we're at least dealing with it. \n\nShe has already suggested adoption or a surrogate. I told her that was good idea and left it at that. The thing is, I don't want to adopt a kid. I also don't want a surrogate. I want to have my own kids, with my own woman (I don't know how to phrase this but you get what I mean). I get how this sounds really selfish. But it's how I think, I can't change that. I don't think I would be capable of adopting a kid. It's just not me. Is it weird that I want the woman I'm with to carry our child? I don't think it is. I want it to be our kid. But I know I'm not thinking straight right now. \n\nI want kids. I want them with my girlfriend. She was about to be my fiancee. But we can't. I've been seriously thinking of breaking things off. I love her with all my heart, she IS the love of my life. I wouldn't want to put her through a break up after this news, I know she needs me. But I can't shake this feeling. I understand that many might not understand my thought process here. I don't know what to tell you. Would I be the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for considering a breakup after his girlfriend was found infertile. The situation is pretty heavy; they've been together five years, were planning to get married, and wanted children. Now, the key issue is his unwillingness to consider adoption or surrogacy because he wants \"his own kid\" with her.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the moral and ethical aspects here. The author is clear that he's not selfish, but he feels that adoption isn't for him. He loves his partner deeply but can't move past the infertility. Is it wrong to base a relationship's continuation on the ability to have biological children? That's the crux.\n\nFrom a societal perspective, some might say that wanting biological children is a personal preference and that it's not fair to break up over that. Others might argue that if having a child is a non-negotiable for someone, then they have the right to make that decision, even if it's painful.\n\nThe author is considering the emotional impact on his girlfriend. He mentions she's devastated and that he doesn't want to leave her now. That shows empathy. However, he also feels conflicted, which adds complexity. He supports her but can't reconcile his own desires.\n\nLegally, he's not in the wrong, but ethically, people might have differing opinions. The question is whether his reasoning is valid. If having biological children is a core part of his identity, maybe it's a reasonable decision. However, the timing and the way he handles the breakup matter. Being honest and compassionate is key here.\n\nI should also consider cultural norms. In some cultures, biological children are highly valued, making this a more acceptable stance. In others, it might be seen as selfish. But since it's a personal relationship decision, it's subjective.\n\nThe girl's perspective is important too. She's already suggested alternatives, which shows she's trying to adapt. The author's refusal to consider those options might be seen as not trying to find a compromise, which could be viewed negatively. However, he's being upfront about his feelings, which is honest.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's feelings are genuine, but acting on them could be seen as breaking a commitment, especially since they were close to marriage. However, if the desire for biological children is a fundamental part of his life goals and he's communicated this, it's a matter of personal values. So, whether he's in the wrong is subjective, but the answer here leans towards not being in the wrong because his reasoning is based on personal desires and he's considering the impact carefully.\n"
