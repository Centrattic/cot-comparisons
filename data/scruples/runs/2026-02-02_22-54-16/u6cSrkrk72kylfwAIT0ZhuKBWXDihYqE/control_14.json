I want to make clear that I haven't decided anything yet. I'm just considering all options.\n\nAbout 2 weeks ago me and my girlfriend found out that she's infertile. We had been trying for a baby for almost a year, and we got a bit worried. So we decided to check the both of us, and it turns out that she is infertile. There's not much more to it, but they are 100% sure. We've been together for little over 5 years. I'm 24 and she's 2 years older, and we thought that the time was right. \n\nObviously we are devastated by the news, and I understand that it's an even bigger blow for my girlfriend. I've been there for her and we support each other, and I think that we're at least dealing with it. \n\nShe has already suggested adoption or a surrogate. I told her that was good idea and left it at that. The thing is, I don't want to adopt a kid. I also don't want a surrogate. I want to have my own kids, with my own woman (I don't know how to phrase this but you get what I mean). I get how this sounds really selfish. But it's how I think, I can't change that. I don't think I would be capable of adopting a kid. It's just not me. Is it weird that I want the woman I'm with to carry our child? I don't think it is. I want it to be our kid. But I know I'm not thinking straight right now. \n\nI want kids. I want them with my girlfriend. She was about to be my fiancee. But we can't. I've been seriously thinking of breaking things off. I love her with all my heart, she IS the love of my life. I wouldn't want to put her through a break up after this news, I know she needs me. But I can't shake this feeling. I understand that many might not understand my thought process here. I don't know what to tell you. Would I be the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this situation. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for considering breaking up with his girlfriend after finding out she's infertile. The key points here are the reasons behind the breakup and the emotional context.\n\nFirst, the couple had been trying to have a baby for a year, which led them to get tested. The girlfriend is infertile, and the author is conflicted. He loves her but doesn't want to pursue adoption or surrogacy, which are options she suggested. He feels that he can't adopt and wants a biological child with her, but since that's not possible, he's thinking of breaking up.\n\nNow, the main question is whether this makes him the asshole. There are a few angles to consider. On one hand, choosing a partner based on the ability to have biological children might be seen as prioritizing personal desires over the relationship. It could be argued that he's not considering her feelings and the support she needs during such a difficult time. Breaking up just because they can't have a biological child might come across as selfish, especially since she already suggested alternatives, and he dismissed them without really engaging in the conversation.\n\nOn the other hand, people have different values and non-negotiables in relationships. If having biological children is a fundamental part of his identity or values, and he can't compromise on that, then his decision might be seen as a matter of personal ethics. However, the way he's phrasing his thoughts\u2014acknowledging it sounds selfish and considering breaking up right after the news\u2014could indicate a lack of empathy. He mentions she was about to be his fianc\u00e9e, which implies they had a future together planned, but now he's considering walking away, which might be seen as abandoning her during a vulnerable time.\n\nAnother point is communication. He says he left the conversation about adoption/surrogacy at that, which might not have been a thorough discussion. Maybe exploring those options more deeply could have led to a different outcome. His decision seems abrupt without fully understanding her perspective or working through the issue together.\n\nAlso, infertility is a sensitive issue. It's not the girlfriend's fault, and using it as a reason to break up could be perceived as blaming her. The author's hesitation to adopt might stem from personal preferences, but it's important to recognize that adoption and surrogacy are valid ways to build a family. His inability to consider those options might show a lack of flexibility, especially since the problem isn't his fertility but hers.\n\nIn terms of societal expectations, some might argue that wanting biological children is natural, but relationships often require compromise. If he's willing to walk away over this issue without trying alternatives, it could be seen as prioritizing his own desires over the relationship. However, if the relationship is fundamentally about his desire for biological children and she can't fulfill that, then it's a difference in core values that might be difficult to reconcile.\n\nOverall, the author's decision to break up might be seen as the wrong choice because it could be viewed as abandoning his partner during a tough time and not making a genuine effort to adapt. But if his values are non-negotiable, then he might not be in the wrong. However, the way he's handling the situation\u2014without fully engaging in the alternatives and considering her emotional state\u2014tips the scale towards him being in the wrong.\n"
