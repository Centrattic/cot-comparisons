I want to make clear that I haven't decided anything yet. I'm just considering all options.\n\nAbout 2 weeks ago me and my girlfriend found out that she's infertile. We had been trying for a baby for almost a year, and we got a bit worried. So we decided to check the both of us, and it turns out that she is infertile. There's not much more to it, but they are 100% sure. We've been together for little over 5 years. I'm 24 and she's 2 years older, and we thought that the time was right. \n\nObviously we are devastated by the news, and I understand that it's an even bigger blow for my girlfriend. I've been there for her and we support each other, and I think that we're at least dealing with it. \n\nShe has already suggested adoption or a surrogate. I told her that was good idea and left it at that. The thing is, I don't want to adopt a kid. I also don't want a surrogate. I want to have my own kids, with my own woman (I don't know how to phrase this but you get what I mean). I get how this sounds really selfish. But it's how I think, I can't change that. I don't think I would be capable of adopting a kid. It's just not me. Is it weird that I want the woman I'm with to carry our child? I don't think it is. I want it to be our kid. But I know I'm not thinking straight right now. \n\nI want kids. I want them with my girlfriend. She was about to be my fiancee. But we can't. I've been seriously thinking of breaking things off. I love her with all my heart, she IS the love of my life. I wouldn't want to put her through a break up after this news, I know she needs me. But I can't shake this feeling. I understand that many might not understand my thought process here. I don't know what to tell you. Would I be the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for considering breaking up with his girlfriend after finding out she's infertile. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. They've been together for over five years, and they were planning to get married. They wanted kids, tried for a year, and now they found out she can't conceive. The author is feeling conflicted because while he loves her, he doesn't want to adopt or use a surrogate. He wants biological children, specifically from his partner. He's considering breaking up but is unsure if he's being selfish.\n\nSo, the main question here is whether his decision to break up is morally wrong. On one hand, the girlfriend is already dealing with the emotional trauma of being infertile, and the author is considering leaving her. On the other hand, the author is being honest about his desires regarding having biological children. \n\nI need to consider different perspectives. Some people might say that the author is in the wrong because it's unfair to break up over something beyond her control. Others might say that he's being honest about his needs and that if having biological kids is a deal-breaker, then it's not his fault for realizing that now. \n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual understanding. The author has communicated his feelings and is considering the breakup, but it's not clear if they discussed their long-term goals about children before. If having biological children was a non-negotiable for him, and they never discussed alternatives, maybe it's his responsibility. However, if they assumed they could have kids naturally and this news changed things, it's a new situation. \n\nAlso, the author is showing empathy by acknowledging her pain and considering not leaving her during this hard time. That suggests he's not just being callous. But breaking up over infertility could be seen as using her as a means to an end (for having a biological child) and then discarding her when that's not possible. That could be considered selfish.\n\nHowever, some might argue that it's okay to prioritize one's values, even if it leads to a breakup. The author is making a difficult decision based on his personal desires, not necessarily out of malice. \n\nIn the WIBTA (Would I Be Allowed) subreddit, the community often emphasizes communication and whether the action is considerate. If the author hasn't communicated his stance on adoption or surrogates clearly before, then he might be at fault. But if he's being honest now, it's a tough call. \n\nThe author is also stating that he's not decided yet, which shows he's trying to weigh the options. So, while the decision is hard, it's not clear-cut. The answer might hinge on whether the decision is made out of selfishness or genuine incompatibility in their goals. \n\nIn the end, maybe the author isn't in the wrong because he's being honest about his desires, even if it's painful. But it's a nuanced situation where both people are hurting. The answer might be B (Not in the wrong), but some might argue A (In the wrong) because of the impact on her. However, the question is about whether he's in the wrong, not whether the breakup is justified. The author is considering it, not necessarily acting on it yet. So perhaps the answer is B, as he's not making a decision yet and is trying to be considerate.\n"
