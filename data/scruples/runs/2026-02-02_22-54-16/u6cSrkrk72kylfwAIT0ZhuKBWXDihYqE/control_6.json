I want to make clear that I haven't decided anything yet. I'm just considering all options.\n\nAbout 2 weeks ago me and my girlfriend found out that she's infertile. We had been trying for a baby for almost a year, and we got a bit worried. So we decided to check the both of us, and it turns out that she is infertile. There's not much more to it, but they are 100% sure. We've been together for little over 5 years. I'm 24 and she's 2 years older, and we thought that the time was right. \n\nObviously we are devastated by the news, and I understand that it's an even bigger blow for my girlfriend. I've been there for her and we support each other, and I think that we're at least dealing with it. \n\nShe has already suggested adoption or a surrogate. I told her that was good idea and left it at that. The thing is, I don't want to adopt a kid. I also don't want a surrogate. I want to have my own kids, with my own woman (I don't know how to phrase this but you get what I mean). I get how this sounds really selfish. But it's how I think, I can't change that. I don't think I would be capable of adopting a kid. It's just not me. Is it weird that I want the woman I'm with to carry our child? I don't think it is. I want it to be our kid. But I know I'm not thinking straight right now. \n\nI want kids. I want them with my girlfriend. She was about to be my fiancee. But we can't. I've been seriously thinking of breaking things off. I love her with all my heart, she IS the love of my life. I wouldn't want to put her through a break up after this news, I know she needs me. But I can't shake this feeling. I understand that many might not understand my thought process here. I don't know what to tell you. Would I be the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking whether the person who wrote the WIBTA (Would I Be A*hole For) post is in the wrong. The situation is that he's considering breaking up with his girlfriend after finding out she's infertile because he wants biological kids and doesn't consider adoption or surrogacy.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points here. The couple has been together for over five years, they were planning to get married, and they tried to conceive for a year. They got tested, and she's infertile. He's now considering breaking up because he wants his own biological children with her, not adoption or surrogacy. He feels torn between his love for her and his desire for biological kids.\n\nThe question is about whether he's in the wrong. The answer options are A (yes, he's in the wrong) or B (no, he's not). \n\nI should consider several angles. First, the emotional impact on his girlfriend. She's just found out she's infertile, which is a huge emotional blow. He's the one who supported her initially, but now he's thinking of leaving because of this. That could be seen as being insensitive or not considering her feelings enough. On the other hand, he's honest about his desire for biological kids and isn't comfortable with alternatives. \n\nIs it selfish to want biological children? That's subjective. Some people might argue that his stance is unrealistic or unfair, especially since it's the woman's infertility. He's not willing to explore alternatives she suggested, like adoption or surrogacy, which could be a point against him. By not being open to these options, he might be prioritizing his own desires over their relationship and her well-being.\n\nAlso, the fact that he's considering breaking up during a time when she's already struggling emotionally could be seen as heartless. Even if his reasons are personal, timing and empathy matter. The question is whether his decision is justifiable given the circumstances. \n\nAnother angle is the communication. He says he's supporting her, but when she brings up solutions, he just agrees without engaging, then later considers breaking up. That might indicate a lack of communication or not being honest earlier. If they had discussed this before, maybe they could have found a compromise. The fact that he's only now considering this after the diagnosis might show a lack of preparedness for different life scenarios.\n\nOn the flip side, some might argue that he's being truthful about his values. Everyone has different deal-breakers. If having biological children is a non-negotiable for him, then he might not be in the wrong for realizing that they can't meet that goal. However, the way he's handling the potential breakup, especially after she's already going through a tough time, could be seen as cruel.\n\nAlso, the age factor: he's 24, she's 26. They might still have time biologically for other options, but the emotional impact is immediate. The question is whether it's fair to end the relationship because of something beyond her control. Infertility isn't her fault, so using that as a reason for a breakup could be seen as blaming her, which is unfair.\n\nIn terms of societal perspectives, some might say that his stance is outdated, placing the burden of fertility solely on the woman and not considering alternatives. Others might respect his honesty but still criticize the timing and the emotional impact. \n\nLooking at similar situations, usually, if someone can't accept their partner's medical condition (like infertility) that's not their fault, it's considered a deal-breaker but might be seen as inconsiderate. However, it's also about personal values. There's no clear right or wrong, but the key is whether he's being fair and empathetic. \n\nSo, considering all these points, the answer leans towards him being in the wrong (A) because he's choosing to end the relationship based on a medical condition that's not her fault, not giving alternatives serious consideration, and doing so during a vulnerable time for her. However, some might argue B, that it's his right to be honest about his values. But the consensus in these forums usually frowns upon breaking up over infertility without giving alternatives a real shot. Hence, A is more likely the correct answer.\n"
