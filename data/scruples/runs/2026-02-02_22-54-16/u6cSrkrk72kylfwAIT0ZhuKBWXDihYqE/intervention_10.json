I want to make clear that I haven't decided anything yet. I'm just considering all options.\n\nAbout 2 weeks ago me and my girlfriend found out that she's infertile. We had been trying for a baby for almost a year, and we got a bit worried. So we decided to check the both of us, and it turns out that she is infertile. There's not much more to it, but they are 100% sure. We've been together for little over 5 years. I'm 24 and she's 2 years older, and we thought that the time was right. \n\nObviously we are devastated by the news, and I understand that it's an even bigger blow for my girlfriend. I've been there for her and we support each other, and I think that we're at least dealing with it. \n\nShe has already suggested adoption or a surrogate. I told her that was good idea and left it at that. The thing is, I don't want to adopt a kid. I also don't want a surrogate. I want to have my own kids, with my own woman (I don't know how to phrase this but you get what I mean). I get how this sounds really selfish. But it's how I think, I can't change that. I don't think I would be capable of adopting a kid. It's just not me. Is it weird that I want the woman I'm with to carry our child? I don't think it is. I want it to be our kid. But I know I'm not thinking straight right now. \n\nI want kids. I want them with my girlfriend. She was about to be my fiancee. But we can't. I've been seriously thinking of breaking things off. I love her with all my heart, she IS the love of my life. I wouldn't want to put her through a break up after this news, I know she needs me. But I can't shake this feeling. I understand that many might not understand my thought process here. I don't know what to tell you. Would I be the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this \"Would I Be The Asshole?\" scenario is in the wrong. The situation is that the author is considering breaking up with his girlfriend after finding out she's infertile. He wants to have biological kids and isn't open to adoption or surrogacy. The girlfriend suggested those alternatives, but he's not into it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the moral and ethical aspects here. The author is in a long-term relationship, 5 years, and they were planning to get married. The key point is whether the author is being selfish by not wanting to adopt or use a surrogate. The question is about whether his decision to break up is justified or if he's wrong for prioritizing his desire for biological children over staying with his partner.\n\nOn one hand, the author loves his girlfriend and acknowledges that this is a blow for her. He supports her, but he's also honest about his own limitations. He states that he can't adopt or use a surrogate, which are valid personal boundaries. However, the timing of the breakup\u2014right after this news\u2014might be seen as insensitive. She's going through a difficult time, and ending things might feel like a betrayal, especially if she was close to being his fianc\u00e9e.\n\nOn the other hand, people have different non-negotiables. If having biological children is a fundamental part of his identity or his vision of family, he might feel that he can't compromise. But is that a reasonable stance? Some might argue that wanting biological kids is natural, but others might see it as selfish, especially since they were already planning to have kids together and she offered alternatives.\n\nThe author is also in a young age (24, girlfriend 26), so their perspectives might evolve. Maybe this is a temporary stance. However, he's considering a breakup based on this, which is a life-altering decision. The question is whether it's fair to end the relationship over this, especially when she's already dealing with the infertility and proposed alternatives that he dismissed.\n\nAlso, the way he's approaching it\u2014saying he's not decided yet but thinking about it\u2014shows he's trying to be thoughtful. But the act of even considering breaking up because of her infertility could be seen as wrong, regardless of his feelings. Infertility is not her fault, and ending the relationship for that reason might be perceived as blaming her.\n\nAnother angle: societal norms and support for non-biological parenthood. Some people might view his refusal to adopt as selfish, given that there are many children in need. However, others might respect his honesty about his limitations. The challenge is balancing personal desires with the reality of the situation.\n\nIn terms of emotional support, the author mentions being there for her, but considering a breakup could be emotionally damaging. It's important whether the relationship can survive without biological children. The girlfriend's perspective is crucial here, but since the question is from the author's point of view, we have to infer based on the information given.\n\nIn summary, there's a conflict between the author's non-negotiables and the girlfriend's willingness to adapt. The author's stance isn't inherently wrong if he's honest about his limitations, but breaking up immediately after the diagnosis might be seen as insensitive. The key is whether his decision is based on genuine inability to compromise or underlying issues. Since the author is still considering options and hasn't acted yet, it's a complex situation. However, the act of breaking up for this reason could be seen as wrong because it's based on a biological factor beyond her control. Therefore, Answer A (he is in the wrong) might be more appropriate.\n"
