I want to make clear that I haven't decided anything yet. I'm just considering all options.\n\nAbout 2 weeks ago me and my girlfriend found out that she's infertile. We had been trying for a baby for almost a year, and we got a bit worried. So we decided to check the both of us, and it turns out that she is infertile. There's not much more to it, but they are 100% sure. We've been together for little over 5 years. I'm 24 and she's 2 years older, and we thought that the time was right. \n\nObviously we are devastated by the news, and I understand that it's an even bigger blow for my girlfriend. I've been there for her and we support each other, and I think that we're at least dealing with it. \n\nShe has already suggested adoption or a surrogate. I told her that was good idea and left it at that. The thing is, I don't want to adopt a kid. I also don't want a surrogate. I want to have my own kids, with my own woman (I don't know how to phrase this but you get what I mean). I get how this sounds really selfish. But it's how I think, I can't change that. I don't think I would be capable of adopting a kid. It's just not me. Is it weird that I want the woman I'm with to carry our child? I don't think it is. I want it to be our kid. But I know I'm not thinking straight right now. \n\nI want kids. I want them with my girlfriend. She was about to be my fiancee. But we can't. I've been seriously thinking of breaking things off. I love her with all my heart, she IS the love of my life. I wouldn't want to put her through a break up after this news, I know she needs me. But I can't shake this feeling. I understand that many might not understand my thought process here. I don't know what to tell you. Would I be the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for considering breaking up because his girlfriend is infertile. The author loves her, they've been together for over five years, and they were planning to get engaged. They wanted to have kids naturally, but since they can't, he's thinking about leaving because he doesn't want to adopt or use a surrogate.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is struggling with his own desires versus what's best for his partner. He's being honest about his feelings but also showing empathy towards her situation. It's important to note that he hasn't made a decision yet. He's still considering all options and is trying to process the situation.\n\nNow, the key points here are about personal values and compatibility. The author wants biological children, which is a valid personal preference. However, the girlfriend is infertile, so they can't have biological kids. The author is conflicted because he doesn't want to adopt or use a surrogate, which are the alternative options she suggested. \n\nThe question is whether this makes him an asshole if he breaks up. On one hand, he's being honest about his limitations. On the other, it might come across as selfish to not consider alternatives. But it's also possible that his values are non-negotiable for him. \n\nI should also think about the emotional aspect. The girlfriend is going through a tough time, and breaking up might be hurtful. However, the author is trying to be supportive and hasn't made up his mind yet. He's in a state of processing, which is understandable given the circumstances.\n\nAnother angle is societal views on parenthood. Some people prioritize biological children, and others are open to adoption or surrogacy. The author's stance isn't inherently wrong, but it's a matter of personal choice. The question is whether it's unfair to the girlfriend. She might feel rejected or blamed, but the author is upfront about his feelings.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author is considering his own happiness and future. If he can't compromise and the relationship is built on shared goals (like having kids), then his decision is based on personal compatibility. However, it's also important to handle the breakup with care, especially since she's dealing with the infertility news.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for considering the breakup because he's being honest about his non-negotiable values. But the way he handles it matters. Since he's still thinking through the options and hasn't acted yet, the answer might be that he's not the asshole. However, some might argue that his stance is selfish. But given the context, it's a complex situation where both sides have valid points.\n"
