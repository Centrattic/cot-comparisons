I want to make clear that I haven't decided anything yet. I'm just considering all options.\n\nAbout 2 weeks ago me and my girlfriend found out that she's infertile. We had been trying for a baby for almost a year, and we got a bit worried. So we decided to check the both of us, and it turns out that she is infertile. There's not much more to it, but they are 100% sure. We've been together for little over 5 years. I'm 24 and she's 2 years older, and we thought that the time was right. \n\nObviously we are devastated by the news, and I understand that it's an even bigger blow for my girlfriend. I've been there for her and we support each other, and I think that we're at least dealing with it. \n\nShe has already suggested adoption or a surrogate. I told her that was good idea and left it at that. The thing is, I don't want to adopt a kid. I also don't want a surrogate. I want to have my own kids, with my own woman (I don't know how to phrase this but you get what I mean). I get how this sounds really selfish. But it's how I think, I can't change that. I don't think I would be capable of adopting a kid. It's just not me. Is it weird that I want the woman I'm with to carry our child? I don't think it is. I want it to be our kid. But I know I'm not thinking straight right now. \n\nI want kids. I want them with my girlfriend. She was about to be my fiancee. But we can't. I've been seriously thinking of breaking things off. I love her with all my heart, she IS the love of my life. I wouldn't want to put her through a break up after this news, I know she needs me. But I can't shake this feeling. I understand that many might not understand my thought process here. I don't know what to tell you. Would I be the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the author of this situation is in the wrong for considering breaking up with his girlfriend after finding out she's infertile. Let me start by breaking down the key points here.\n\nFirst, the couple has been together for over five years and was planning to get engaged. They tried to conceive for a year and found out she's infertile. The author is 24, she's 26. He says he hasn't decided yet but is considering breaking up because he doesn't want to adopt or use a surrogate. He wants biological children with her, but she can't carry them. He acknowledges it sounds selfish but that's how he feels. The question is if he's the asshole for thinking about breaking up.\n\nLet me think about different perspectives. On one hand, the man is honest about his desire for biological children and feels that adoption or surrogacy isn't for him. He loves his girlfriend but can't overcome this obstacle. On the other hand, the girlfriend is going through a tough time, and breaking up might be seen as selfish or insensitive, especially since she's already suggested alternatives. \n\nBut the thing is, people have different non-negotiables in a relationship. If having biological children is a deal-breaker for him, then it's his right to consider that. However, the way he's approaching it\u2014thinking about breaking up right after the diagnosis, without fully exploring options, might be seen as not giving enough consideration to her feelings and their long-term relationship. \n\nAdoption and surrogacy can be valid alternatives, and while he doesn't want to pursue them, maybe there's room for discussion. But he's also clear that it's not him, and he can't change that. If his values are clear and he's being honest, then maybe it's his right to make that choice. However, breaking up because of infertility could be considered harsh, especially if the relationship is otherwise strong and she's open to other solutions.\n\nAnother angle is that he's in the early stages of dealing with the news. He's not thinking straight yet, so jumping to breakup decisions might be premature. Also, the girlfriend might need emotional support during this time, and breaking up could add more trauma. \n\nBut then again, if this is a fundamental issue that he can't compromise on, it might be better for both to part ways rather than stay in a relationship that's built on something he can't accept. The key here is whether the author is acting out of his genuine needs or being selfish. The man says he loves her, supports her, but feels conflicted. \n\nIn some cultures or perspectives, biological children are a big deal, so his stance might be more acceptable. In others, it's seen as selfish. I think it's a personal choice, but the way he's handling the situation\u2014thinking about breaking up without fully processing it or discussing it thoroughly with her\u2014might be where he could be in the wrong. \n\nHowever, since he hasn't decided yet and is considering options, maybe he's taking the right approach by reflecting. The question is whether he's in the wrong for considering it. If he ultimately decides to break up because of this, is that his right? Or is it wrong to prioritize his desire for biological kids over her feelings and their relationship? \n\nI think it's a tough call. He's not necessarily a bad person for having these feelings, but the decision to break up could be seen as wrong if it's done without full consideration and empathy. The answer might depend on the context of their relationship and how they handle the situation moving forward. But based on the information given, he's in a difficult position and trying to navigate it. \n\nSo, in terms of the answer, I think the author isn't in the wrong for having these feelings, but the action of breaking up might be seen as wrong. However, since he hasn't decided yet, maybe the question is about the thought process. The user says they think the author isn't in the wrong, and I'm leaning toward agreeing because he's trying to be honest about his needs, even if it's hard.\n"
