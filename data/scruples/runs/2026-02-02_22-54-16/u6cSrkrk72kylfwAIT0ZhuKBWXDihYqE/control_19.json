I want to make clear that I haven't decided anything yet. I'm just considering all options.\n\nAbout 2 weeks ago me and my girlfriend found out that she's infertile. We had been trying for a baby for almost a year, and we got a bit worried. So we decided to check the both of us, and it turns out that she is infertile. There's not much more to it, but they are 100% sure. We've been together for little over 5 years. I'm 24 and she's 2 years older, and we thought that the time was right. \n\nObviously we are devastated by the news, and I understand that it's an even bigger blow for my girlfriend. I've been there for her and we support each other, and I think that we're at least dealing with it. \n\nShe has already suggested adoption or a surrogate. I told her that was good idea and left it at that. The thing is, I don't want to adopt a kid. I also don't want a surrogate. I want to have my own kids, with my own woman (I don't know how to phrase this but you get what I mean). I get how this sounds really selfish. But it's how I think, I can't change that. I don't think I would be capable of adopting a kid. It's just not me. Is it weird that I want the woman I'm with to carry our child? I don't think it is. I want it to be our kid. But I know I'm not thinking straight right now. \n\nI want kids. I want them with my girlfriend. She was about to be my fiancee. But we can't. I've been seriously thinking of breaking things off. I love her with all my heart, she IS the love of my life. I wouldn't want to put her through a break up after this news, I know she needs me. But I can't shake this feeling. I understand that many might not understand my thought process here. I don't know what to tell you. Would I be the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the WIBTA (Would I Be Terrible for...) post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author found out his girlfriend is infertile, and he's considering breaking up because he doesn't want adoption or surrogacy. He loves her but wants biological kids.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. They've been together for 5 years, and the issue is about having their own child. The author isn't immediately deciding; he's considering options. He's trying to be supportive but honestly expressing his feelings. \n\nBiological child is important to him. But is that a valid reason to break up? Well, having a child is a big decision, and if one partner doesn't want alternatives like adoption or surrogacy, that's a significant conflict. However, the girlfriend suggested adoption/surrogacy, and he didn't engage with that. \n\nIs it selfish to want a biological child? Some might say it's selfish to end a long-term relationship over infertility, especially when alternatives exist. But others might argue that wanting a biological child is a personal choice and valid. \n\nThe key here is communication. He hasn't had a proper discussion with his girlfriend about his stance on adoption/surrogacy. He just dismissed the options she suggested. That could be seen as not considering her feelings or her efforts to find a solution. \n\nHe also mentions he doesn't want to break up during this time because she's going through a tough time. That shows he's trying to be empathetic, but the underlying issue is his unwillingness to consider alternatives. \n\nIn relationships, major life goals are usually discussed. If having biological children is a non-negotiable for him, and the girlfriend is willing to explore alternatives, but he's not even considering them, that's a problem. However, if the woman is unable or unwilling to consider those options, then there's conflict. But here, she's open to alternatives, and he isn't. \n\nThe author might be in the wrong because he's not engaging with solutions she's proposed. Ending the relationship over an unmet desire for biological children, especially when alternatives are on the table, could be seen as callous. His reasoning might come across as prioritizing his own desires over her feelings and the relationship they've built. \n\nSo, the answer is A (Yes, he's in the wrong) because he's not considering alternatives she's willing to explore, and breaking up might be a selfish decision despite her needing support.\n"
