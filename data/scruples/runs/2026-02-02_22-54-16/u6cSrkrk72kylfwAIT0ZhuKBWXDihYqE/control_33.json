I want to make clear that I haven't decided anything yet. I'm just considering all options.\n\nAbout 2 weeks ago me and my girlfriend found out that she's infertile. We had been trying for a baby for almost a year, and we got a bit worried. So we decided to check the both of us, and it turns out that she is infertile. There's not much more to it, but they are 100% sure. We've been together for little over 5 years. I'm 24 and she's 2 years older, and we thought that the time was right. \n\nObviously we are devastated by the news, and I understand that it's an even bigger blow for my girlfriend. I've been there for her and we support each other, and I think that we're at least dealing with it. \n\nShe has already suggested adoption or a surrogate. I told her that was good idea and left it at that. The thing is, I don't want to adopt a kid. I also don't want a surrogate. I want to have my own kids, with my own woman (I don't know how to phrase this but you get what I mean). I get how this sounds really selfish. But it's how I think, I can't change that. I don't think I would be capable of adopting a kid. It's just not me. Is it weird that I want the woman I'm with to carry our child? I don't think it is. I want it to be our kid. But I know I'm not thinking straight right now. \n\nI want kids. I want them with my girlfriend. She was about to be my fiancee. But we can't. I've been seriously thinking of breaking things off. I love her with all my heart, she IS the love of my life. I wouldn't want to put her through a break up after this news, I know she needs me. But I can't shake this feeling. I understand that many might not understand my thought process here. I don't know what to tell you. Would I be the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for considering breaking up with his girlfriend because she's infertile. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The couple has been together five years, trying to have a baby for about a year. They found out she's infertile. He's considering breaking up because he doesn't want adoption or surrogacy and wants biological kids. He loves her but feels he can't go through life without having his own children.\n\nHmm, is wanting to have biological children a valid reason to break up? Well, having kids is a big part of many people's life plans. If someone's core desire is to have their own genetic children and that's no longer possible, it's understandable they might struggle. But at the same time, is it selfish to prioritize that over the relationship?\n\nThe girlfriend is offering alternatives, which he dismisses. He says he can't adopt or use a surrogate. The question is whether his stance is selfish. Some might argue that wanting to stay with someone you love despite not having biological kids is more mature. Others might say that his desire for biological children is legitimate, and if he can't compromise, it's okay to part ways.\n\nAlso, timing matters. He's 24, so they're relatively young. Maybe there's more time to adjust to this news. But if having kids is non-negotiable for him, maybe breaking up is the only way he can accept. However, is it fair to end the relationship because of an unforeseen medical condition? That's a tough call.\n\nIn terms of societal views, some people might see him as the asshole for breaking up over infertility, especially when she's already suggested alternatives. Others might support his decision because his needs aren't being met either. It's a personal choice, but considering the emotional impact on his girlfriend, who's already devastated, breaking up could be seen as adding to her pain.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? If he breaks up, does that make him the asshole? The key points are his inability to consider alternatives, his readiness to leave despite loving her, and the potential emotional harm. On the other hand, his feelings are valid if having biological kids is crucial. It's a complex situation without a clear right or wrong. But from a compassionate standpoint, walking away after she's already been hurt might be seen as selfish. Hence, maybe he's in the wrong.\n"
