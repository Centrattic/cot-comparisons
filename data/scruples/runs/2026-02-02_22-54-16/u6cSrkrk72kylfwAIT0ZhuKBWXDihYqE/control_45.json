I want to make clear that I haven't decided anything yet. I'm just considering all options.\n\nAbout 2 weeks ago me and my girlfriend found out that she's infertile. We had been trying for a baby for almost a year, and we got a bit worried. So we decided to check the both of us, and it turns out that she is infertile. There's not much more to it, but they are 100% sure. We've been together for little over 5 years. I'm 24 and she's 2 years older, and we thought that the time was right. \n\nObviously we are devastated by the news, and I understand that it's an even bigger blow for my girlfriend. I've been there for her and we support each other, and I think that we're at least dealing with it. \n\nShe has already suggested adoption or a surrogate. I told her that was good idea and left it at that. The thing is, I don't want to adopt a kid. I also don't want a surrogate. I want to have my own kids, with my own woman (I don't know how to phrase this but you get what I mean). I get how this sounds really selfish. But it's how I think, I can't change that. I don't think I would be capable of adopting a kid. It's just not me. Is it weird that I want the woman I'm with to carry our child? I don't think it is. I want it to be our kid. But I know I'm not thinking straight right now. \n\nI want kids. I want them with my girlfriend. She was about to be my fiancee. But we can't. I've been seriously thinking of breaking things off. I love her with all my heart, she IS the love of my life. I wouldn't want to put her through a break up after this news, I know she needs me. But I can't shake this feeling. I understand that many might not understand my thought process here. I don't know what to tell you. Would I be the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The question is whether the person who wrote the WIBTA (Would I Be A Total Asshole) scenario is in the wrong if they break up with their girlfriend after finding out she's infertile.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. They've been in a 5-year relationship, planning to get married. They wanted children together, but after a year of trying, they found out she's infertile. The author is struggling with the idea of adoption or surrogacy because they don't want to pursue those options. They feel selfish but are considering breaking up because they want their own biological children with someone who can carry them.\n\nNow, the key points here are: the author loves his girlfriend and acknowledges she's the love of his life. He's been supportive, but he's also honest about his own desires. However, breaking up over infertility might be seen as prioritizing his own desire for biological children over her feelings and their relationship. \n\nInfertility can be a deeply emotional issue for both partners. The girlfriend is already taking the hit harder, and the author is considering leaving her now, which could be seen as abandoning her during a tough time. The author admits it might sound selfish, which it does. The question is whether this is a valid reason to break up or if it's an irresponsible decision.\n\nOn the other hand, personal values and desires matter too. If the author truly can't reconcile his desire for biological children with adoption or surrogacy, maybe the breakup is about incompatibility in long-term goals. But the timing seems harsh, especially right after such a traumatic diagnosis. The girlfriend might not have had time to process it, and the author is considering leaving her during her vulnerable period.\n\nThe author's reasoning might not be malicious, but the act of breaking up based on infertility could be viewed as inconsiderate, especially if it's not a mutual decision. The girlfriend might feel rejected or that her partner values biology over their relationship. However, the author is trying to be honest about his feelings, which is important in a relationship.\n\nIn many cases, relationships face challenges that require compromise. If both were open to alternatives, maybe they could work through it. But the author isn't open to adoption or surrogacy, and the situation is irreversible. So if the couple's core value (having biological children) is a deal-breaker, maybe it's not the author's fault. But breaking up immediately after the diagnosis could be seen as not giving the relationship a chance to adjust or find new solutions.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer depends on cultural or societal views on infertility and relationships. However, given that the author loves her and is considering her feelings, but still prioritizes his own needs, it's a tough call. But since the break up is based on a medical condition that wasn't a choice, and the author is not taking responsibility for supporting her through it, it leans towards him being in the wrong. So I think the answer is A.\n"
