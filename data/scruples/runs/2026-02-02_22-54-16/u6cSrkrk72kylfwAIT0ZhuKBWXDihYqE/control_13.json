I want to make clear that I haven't decided anything yet. I'm just considering all options.\n\nAbout 2 weeks ago me and my girlfriend found out that she's infertile. We had been trying for a baby for almost a year, and we got a bit worried. So we decided to check the both of us, and it turns out that she is infertile. There's not much more to it, but they are 100% sure. We've been together for little over 5 years. I'm 24 and she's 2 years older, and we thought that the time was right. \n\nObviously we are devastated by the news, and I understand that it's an even bigger blow for my girlfriend. I've been there for her and we support each other, and I think that we're at least dealing with it. \n\nShe has already suggested adoption or a surrogate. I told her that was good idea and left it at that. The thing is, I don't want to adopt a kid. I also don't want a surrogate. I want to have my own kids, with my own woman (I don't know how to phrase this but you get what I mean). I get how this sounds really selfish. But it's how I think, I can't change that. I don't think I would be capable of adopting a kid. It's just not me. Is it weird that I want the woman I'm with to carry our child? I don't think it is. I want it to be our kid. But I know I'm not thinking straight right now. \n\nI want kids. I want them with my girlfriend. She was about to be my fiancee. But we can't. I've been seriously thinking of breaking things off. I love her with all my heart, she IS the love of my life. I wouldn't want to put her through a break up after this news, I know she needs me. But I can't shake this feeling. I understand that many might not understand my thought process here. I don't know what to tell you. Would I be the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the \"WIBTA\" scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a couple who found out the girlfriend is infertile. The guy is considering breaking up because he doesn't want to adopt or use a surrogate, and he wants biological kids.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The couple has been together for over five years, and they tried to conceive for a year before finding out. The guy is 24, the girl 26. The guy is thinking of breaking up because he can't accept adoption or surrogacy. He loves her but feels he can't move forward without biological children.\n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong. Let's break down the ethical aspects. The girl is clearly hurt, and she suggested adoption/surrogacy. The guy dismissed those options but said they were good ideas, then later clarified he doesn't want them. That's a problem because he didn't engage in meaningful discussion. He seems to prioritize his own desires over her feelings and the relationship they've built.\n\nAlso, he's considering breaking up immediately after the diagnosis, which might be impulsive. They need time to process and explore all options. His reasoning about wanting biological children might be a valid personal preference, but acting on it without full communication and considering her perspective could be seen as selfish. The girl might feel blamed for the infertility, especially since it's her condition, and breaking up right then could be emotionally damaging.\n\nEthically, relationships require compromise. If he's unwilling to consider alternatives she's open to, that's a conflict. But the main issue is his readiness to end the relationship without proper discussion. The question is whether his decision is selfish or if he's being realistic. However, given the circumstances, he might be in the wrong because he's causing unnecessary pain without exhausting all possibilities together.\n"
