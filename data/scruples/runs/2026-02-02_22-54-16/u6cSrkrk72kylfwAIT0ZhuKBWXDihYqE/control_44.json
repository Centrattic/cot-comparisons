I want to make clear that I haven't decided anything yet. I'm just considering all options.\n\nAbout 2 weeks ago me and my girlfriend found out that she's infertile. We had been trying for a baby for almost a year, and we got a bit worried. So we decided to check the both of us, and it turns out that she is infertile. There's not much more to it, but they are 100% sure. We've been together for little over 5 years. I'm 24 and she's 2 years older, and we thought that the time was right. \n\nObviously we are devastated by the news, and I understand that it's an even bigger blow for my girlfriend. I've been there for her and we support each other, and I think that we're at least dealing with it. \n\nShe has already suggested adoption or a surrogate. I told her that was good idea and left it at that. The thing is, I don't want to adopt a kid. I also don't want a surrogate. I want to have my own kids, with my own woman (I don't know how to phrase this but you get what I mean). I get how this sounds really selfish. But it's how I think, I can't change that. I don't think I would be capable of adopting a kid. It's just not me. Is it weird that I want the woman I'm with to carry our child? I don't think it is. I want it to be our kid. But I know I'm not thinking straight right now. \n\nI want kids. I want them with my girlfriend. She was about to be my fiancee. But we can't. I've been seriously thinking of breaking things off. I love her with all my heart, she IS the love of my life. I wouldn't want to put her through a break up after this news, I know she needs me. But I can't shake this feeling. I understand that many might not understand my thought process here. I don't know what to tell you. Would I be the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The author is considering breaking up with his girlfriend because she's infertile. They've been together over five years and were planning to get married. The key issue here is whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to end the relationship over infertility.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The couple had been trying for a baby for a year before seeking medical advice. The infertility was a significant factor for them, and now the author is struggling with not being able to have biological children. He mentions that adoption and surrogacy were suggested, but he's against those options. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that he wants biological children with his partner. He acknowledges that his stance might seem selfish but feels it's genuine. The question is whether this is a valid reason for breaking up. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, relationships require mutual understanding and compromise. If the girlfriend is willing to explore alternatives like adoption or surrogacy, but the author is not, that could be a deal-breaker for him. However, the girlfriend is clearly affected by the news, and the author is considering her emotional state. \n\nInfertility can impact both partners differently. Some people place a high value on having biological children, and if that's a non-negotiable for one person, it might lead to a breakup. However, others might argue that the author is being selfish by not considering alternatives. \n\nLegally and ethically, there's no right or wrong answer here, but it's about personal values. The author is not forcing the decision yet; he's contemplating it. The key is whether his reasons are selfish or based on his inability to adjust his desires. \n\nSince the author is still processing and hasn't made a decision, the question is whether his potential action is unjust. If he prioritizes his own desires over the relationship, especially when the girlfriend is already dealing with the emotional impact, it could be seen as wrong. However, if the relationship can't meet his needs, he might feel justified in ending it. \n\nUltimately, it's a personal choice, but the author might be in the wrong if he's not willing to explore alternatives that the girlfriend is open to. However, if he's certain that he can't be happy without biological children, it's a tough but personal decision. The answer could lean either way, but given the options, the author's stance might be seen as selfish, making him the asshole.\n"
