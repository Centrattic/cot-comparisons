I want to make clear that I haven't decided anything yet. I'm just considering all options.\n\nAbout 2 weeks ago me and my girlfriend found out that she's infertile. We had been trying for a baby for almost a year, and we got a bit worried. So we decided to check the both of us, and it turns out that she is infertile. There's not much more to it, but they are 100% sure. We've been together for little over 5 years. I'm 24 and she's 2 years older, and we thought that the time was right. \n\nObviously we are devastated by the news, and I understand that it's an even bigger blow for my girlfriend. I've been there for her and we support each other, and I think that we're at least dealing with it. \n\nShe has already suggested adoption or a surrogate. I told her that was good idea and left it at that. The thing is, I don't want to adopt a kid. I also don't want a surrogate. I want to have my own kids, with my own woman (I don't know how to phrase this but you get what I mean). I get how this sounds really selfish. But it's how I think, I can't change that. I don't think I would be capable of adopting a kid. It's just not me. Is it weird that I want the woman I'm with to carry our child? I don't think it is. I want it to be our kid. But I know I'm not thinking straight right now. \n\nI want kids. I want them with my girlfriend. She was about to be my fiancee. But we can't. I've been seriously thinking of breaking things off. I love her with all my heart, she IS the love of my life. I wouldn't want to put her through a break up after this news, I know she needs me. But I can't shake this feeling. I understand that many might not understand my thought process here. I don't know what to tell you. Would I be the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the WIBTA post is in the wrong for considering breaking up with his girlfriend after discovering her infertility.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The couple has been together five years, thinking it's time to have kids. They both wanted children, but she's infertile. The author is conflicted because he doesn't want adoption or surrogacy. He loves her but can't imagine moving forward without having their own biological child. He's considering breaking up because he can't compromise here.\n\nNow, the key points here are about personal values and relationship expectations. The author believes that having a biological child with his partner is essential. His girlfriend is open to alternatives, but he's not. The question is whether he's in the wrong for prioritizing his own desires over her feelings and their existing relationship.\n\nInfertility is a significant issue, and reactions can vary. Some people might see the author as selfish for not considering adoption or surrogacy, especially since his partner is willing to explore those options. Others might argue that his feelings are valid because he has a strong desire for biological children. However, relationships require compromise. If he's unwilling to consider alternatives she's open to, that could be seen as a failure to meet her halfway, which is a relationship issue.\n\nAlso, the emotional impact on his partner is important. She might feel rejected or abandoned, especially since she's already suggested alternatives. The author acknowledges her needing support but is considering leaving, which could be hurtful. While his reasons are personal and genuine, they might lead to a breakup that's more about his unmet expectations than her actions.\n\nIn terms of societal views, there's a tendency to judge people for being unwilling to adopt, but it's a personal choice. However, in a committed relationship, the inability to compromise on such a major issue can lead to a breakdown. The author isn't acting out of malice but from his own needs, which might not be inherently wrong, but it's causing harm. So, the answer might be A (Yes, in the wrong) because he's not willing to meet her halfway despite her efforts and his own acknowledgment of her needs. Alternatively, if it's seen as a matter of personal choice and values, maybe B. But considering the emotional impact and lack of compromise, A seems more likely.\n"
