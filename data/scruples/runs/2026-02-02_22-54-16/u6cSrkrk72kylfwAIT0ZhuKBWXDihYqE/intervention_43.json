I want to make clear that I haven't decided anything yet. I'm just considering all options.\n\nAbout 2 weeks ago me and my girlfriend found out that she's infertile. We had been trying for a baby for almost a year, and we got a bit worried. So we decided to check the both of us, and it turns out that she is infertile. There's not much more to it, but they are 100% sure. We've been together for little over 5 years. I'm 24 and she's 2 years older, and we thought that the time was right. \n\nObviously we are devastated by the news, and I understand that it's an even bigger blow for my girlfriend. I've been there for her and we support each other, and I think that we're at least dealing with it. \n\nShe has already suggested adoption or a surrogate. I told her that was good idea and left it at that. The thing is, I don't want to adopt a kid. I also don't want a surrogate. I want to have my own kids, with my own woman (I don't know how to phrase this but you get what I mean). I get how this sounds really selfish. But it's how I think, I can't change that. I don't think I would be capable of adopting a kid. It's just not me. Is it weird that I want the woman I'm with to carry our child? I don't think it is. I want it to be our kid. But I know I'm not thinking straight right now. \n\nI want kids. I want them with my girlfriend. She was about to be my fiancee. But we can't. I've been seriously thinking of breaking things off. I love her with all my heart, she IS the love of my life. I wouldn't want to put her through a break up after this news, I know she needs me. But I can't shake this feeling. I understand that many might not understand my thought process here. I don't know what to tell you. Would I be the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is that they found out their girlfriend is infertile, and they're considering breaking up because they don't want to adopt or use a surrogate. They love her, but they can't get over wanting biological kids. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the couple has been together for five years, and they were planning to get married. They wanted kids, tried for a year, and she's infertile. The author is 24, she's 26. They both got checked out, and it's confirmed she can't have biological kids. The author says he's supportive but doesn't want to adopt or a surrogate. He feels it's selfish but can't change his feelings. He's thinking of breaking up because he really wants his own kids with her, but they can't have them. He's torn between his love for her and his desire for biological children.\n\nSo, is he wrong? Well, everyone has different values and priorities. If having biological children is non-negotiable for him, then maybe he's not the asshole for prioritizing that. But on the other hand, breaking up over something that wasn't part of the initial relationship might seem harsh. The question is whether he's being selfish or realistic.\n\nThe girlfriend is offering alternatives like adoption or surrogacy. The author doesn't want those, which shows they have conflicting needs. In a relationship, both partners have to compromise. If he can't compromise on this, maybe he's not wrong for realizing that their future isn't aligned. However, breaking up right after the diagnosis might be seen as insensitive, especially if she's struggling with the news. He says he's been supportive, but the decision to leave could be seen as abandoning her when she needs him most.\n\nBut then again, if he can't be happy without biological kids and she can't provide that, maybe it's not fair to stay together in the long term. Relationships require mutual goals. If their goals are fundamentally incompatible, ending it might be the responsible choice, even if it's painful.\n\nSo the key points are: his stance on adoption/surrogacy, the timing of the breakup, and whether his decision is based on his genuine feelings or if he's being selfish. The author is being honest about his feelings, and while it's painful, he might not be in the wrong if he's clear about his needs. However, the way he handles the breakup is important. If he's giving her time to process and not rushing into it, maybe that's thoughtful. But the question is whether he's in the wrong, not just the action but the reasoning.\n\nIn the end, it's a tough call. Some might say he's being selfish for prioritizing his biological kids over her feelings, but others might see it as realistic. The answer might hinge on cultural or personal beliefs about parenthood. Since he's considering it carefully and hasn't made a decision yet, maybe he's trying to be fair. So, I think the answer is B (he's not in the wrong), but it's a close call.\n"
