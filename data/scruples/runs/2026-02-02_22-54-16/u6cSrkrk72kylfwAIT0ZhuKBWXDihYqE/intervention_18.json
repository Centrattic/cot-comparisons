I want to make clear that I haven't decided anything yet. I'm just considering all options.\n\nAbout 2 weeks ago me and my girlfriend found out that she's infertile. We had been trying for a baby for almost a year, and we got a bit worried. So we decided to check the both of us, and it turns out that she is infertile. There's not much more to it, but they are 100% sure. We've been together for little over 5 years. I'm 24 and she's 2 years older, and we thought that the time was right. \n\nObviously we are devastated by the news, and I understand that it's an even bigger blow for my girlfriend. I've been there for her and we support each other, and I think that we're at least dealing with it. \n\nShe has already suggested adoption or a surrogate. I told her that was good idea and left it at that. The thing is, I don't want to adopt a kid. I also don't want a surrogate. I want to have my own kids, with my own woman (I don't know how to phrase this but you get what I mean). I get how this sounds really selfish. But it's how I think, I can't change that. I don't think I would be capable of adopting a kid. It's just not me. Is it weird that I want the woman I'm with to carry our child? I don't think it is. I want it to be our kid. But I know I'm not thinking straight right now. \n\nI want kids. I want them with my girlfriend. She was about to be my fiancee. But we can't. I've been seriously thinking of breaking things off. I love her with all my heart, she IS the love of my life. I wouldn't want to put her through a break up after this news, I know she needs me. But I can't shake this feeling. I understand that many might not understand my thought process here. I don't know what to tell you. Would I be the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong if they break up with their girlfriend after finding out she's infertile. The author is 24, in a 5-year relationship, and they were trying for a baby. They\u2019re considering breaking up because they don't want adoption or surrogacy and want biological kids. He loves her but feels this is a deal-breaker.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. Having children is a significant life decision, and differing priorities can strain a relationship. The man's stance on wanting biological children is personal and valid for him, but choosing to break up over it might be seen as selfish, especially since the infertility isn't his fault. The girlfriend is already emotional, and breaking up might add to her distress. However, the author is clear that he's not decided yet and is seeking advice, showing he's trying to be thoughtful. \n\nThe key points are: mutual support after the diagnosis, his acknowledgment of his feelings, and the fact that he's considering all options. The dilemma here is balancing personal desires with compassion. While his feelings are genuine, the decision to break up solely based on infertility could be seen as prioritizing his wishes over her well-being, especially if she's more open to alternatives. But he's not forcing her; he's contemplating. \n\nIn some perspectives, wanting to have biological children is a legitimate reason to end a relationship if it's a non-negotiable. However, the way he approaches the breakup matters. If he's honest and empathetic, maybe it's more understanding. But the question is about being in the wrong. If the relationship hinges on something that's now impossible, ending it isn't inherently wrong. However, the emotional impact on her needs consideration. The author is conflicted, which adds nuance. So, the answer isn't black and white, but the user wants a Yes or No. \n\nI think the answer is A (he's in the wrong) because breaking up over infertility can be seen as prioritizing his desire for biological kids over the relationship, especially when alternatives exist. But the user's own thought is that the author isn't in the wrong. However, the community often leans towards valuing the relationship if both are committed, unless there's mutual agreement. So maybe B. Hmm. It's tricky. The author is struggling with conflicting feelings, but the act of breaking up might be seen as selfish. But if having kids is non-negotiable, maybe it's not wrong. I'm a bit torn. The user's initial thought is B, but I need to decide. Considering the scenario, the author is trying to be honest but might be acting on unprocessed emotions. The answer might be A because of the potential emotional harm, but B if it's a genuine incompatibility. Since the user is asking for the assistant's take, I'll go with A.\n"
