I want to make clear that I haven't decided anything yet. I'm just considering all options.\n\nAbout 2 weeks ago me and my girlfriend found out that she's infertile. We had been trying for a baby for almost a year, and we got a bit worried. So we decided to check the both of us, and it turns out that she is infertile. There's not much more to it, but they are 100% sure. We've been together for little over 5 years. I'm 24 and she's 2 years older, and we thought that the time was right. \n\nObviously we are devastated by the news, and I understand that it's an even bigger blow for my girlfriend. I've been there for her and we support each other, and I think that we're at least dealing with it. \n\nShe has already suggested adoption or a surrogate. I told her that was good idea and left it at that. The thing is, I don't want to adopt a kid. I also don't want a surrogate. I want to have my own kids, with my own woman (I don't know how to phrase this but you get what I mean). I get how this sounds really selfish. But it's how I think, I can't change that. I don't think I would be capable of adopting a kid. It's just not me. Is it weird that I want the woman I'm with to carry our child? I don't think it is. I want it to be our kid. But I know I'm not thinking straight right now. \n\nI want kids. I want them with my girlfriend. She was about to be my fiancee. But we can't. I've been seriously thinking of breaking things off. I love her with all my heart, she IS the love of my life. I wouldn't want to put her through a break up after this news, I know she needs me. But I can't shake this feeling. I understand that many might not understand my thought process here. I don't know what to tell you. Would I be the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the couple has been together for over five years, and they found out the girlfriend is infertile. The author is considering breaking up because he doesn't want to adopt or use a surrogate. He wants to have his own biological children with his partner, which isn't possible. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical angle. The author is honest about his feelings and is trying to be supportive. He mentions that he's not making a decision yet and is considering all options. That shows he's not rushing into anything. But the question is whether wanting biological kids is selfish. Some might argue that it's natural to want your own children, especially if that was part of their future plans. Others might say that being unwilling to consider alternatives like adoption is selfish, especially when it leads to breaking up after the partner has already suggested those options.\n\nThe girlfriend has proposed adoption and surrogacy, and the author said it's a good idea but left it at that. Then he reveals he doesn't want to adopt. That could be seen as not being fully open during the discussion. Maybe he should have communicated his true feelings earlier, but the situation is complex. The author is in emotional turmoil, which is understandable.\n\nIs breaking up after such a big life decision considered the right thing? If the author truly can't move past this, maybe it's not fair to stay in the relationship if it's causing him to consider breaking up. However, breaking up after the partner has already been through infertility news might be seen as adding insult to injury. The author also mentions that his girlfriend needs support, so leaving might be hurtful, but staying in a relationship where one partner is unhappy could also be a problem in the long run.\n\nSo, the key points are: the author's desire for biological children, the girlfriend's alternative suggestions, the timing of the revelation, and the emotional impact. The author isn't in denial; he's acknowledging his feelings and the situation. Whether he's in the wrong depends on whether his decision is based on valid personal beliefs or if it's inconsiderate. Since he's trying to be supportive and is conflicted, maybe it's not entirely his fault. However, some might argue that his stance is selfish and that he should have considered alternatives more seriously. But the question is whether he's in the wrong. If the community (like in a WIBTA scenario) would say it's not the author's fault, then the answer might be B. But if the community says he's being selfish and inconsiderate, then A.\n"
