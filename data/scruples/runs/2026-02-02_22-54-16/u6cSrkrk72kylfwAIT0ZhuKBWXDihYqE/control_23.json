I want to make clear that I haven't decided anything yet. I'm just considering all options.\n\nAbout 2 weeks ago me and my girlfriend found out that she's infertile. We had been trying for a baby for almost a year, and we got a bit worried. So we decided to check the both of us, and it turns out that she is infertile. There's not much more to it, but they are 100% sure. We've been together for little over 5 years. I'm 24 and she's 2 years older, and we thought that the time was right. \n\nObviously we are devastated by the news, and I understand that it's an even bigger blow for my girlfriend. I've been there for her and we support each other, and I think that we're at least dealing with it. \n\nShe has already suggested adoption or a surrogate. I told her that was good idea and left it at that. The thing is, I don't want to adopt a kid. I also don't want a surrogate. I want to have my own kids, with my own woman (I don't know how to phrase this but you get what I mean). I get how this sounds really selfish. But it's how I think, I can't change that. I don't think I would be capable of adopting a kid. It's just not me. Is it weird that I want the woman I'm with to carry our child? I don't think it is. I want it to be our kid. But I know I'm not thinking straight right now. \n\nI want kids. I want them with my girlfriend. She was about to be my fiancee. But we can't. I've been seriously thinking of breaking things off. I love her with all my heart, she IS the love of my life. I wouldn't want to put her through a break up after this news, I know she needs me. But I can't shake this feeling. I understand that many might not understand my thought process here. I don't know what to tell you. Would I be the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the WIBTA (Would I Be The Asshole) post is in the wrong for considering breaking up with his girlfriend after finding out she's infertile.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The couple has been together for over five years, and they were trying to have a baby for almost a year before getting tested. The girlfriend is infertile. The author is 24, she's 26. They were planning to get engaged. He mentions that he doesn't want to adopt or use a surrogate, and he wants biological kids. He's considering breaking up because he can't accept not having his own biological children with her.\n\nNow, the key points here are about his intentions and the ethical implications. The author is in a place where his personal desire for biological children is conflicting with the reality of the situation. The girlfriend is trying to suggest alternatives, but he's not open to those. The question is whether his considering breaking up makes him the asshole.\n\nOn one hand, the author is being honest about his feelings and priorities. He's not pretending to want adoption or surrogacy when he doesn't. It's important for both partners to be aligned on major life decisions like having children. If having biological children is a non-negotiable for him, then breaking up might be a difficult but honest choice.\n\nOn the other hand, the situation is emotionally challenging for both. The girlfriend is dealing with infertility, which can be a significant emotional burden. Ending the relationship at this time could be seen as adding to her distress. Also, the author is in a position of power here\u2014his decision could affect her deeply. There's a question of whether he's being selfish by prioritizing his desire for biological children over her emotional state, especially when she's already been through a traumatic experience.\n\nBut then again, relationships require mutual agreement on big issues. If he can't accept alternatives, and it's a fundamental part of his life goals, then it's valid for him to reconsider the relationship. However, timing is crucial. They were planning to get engaged, so breaking up right after such a devastating discovery might feel like a betrayal. He should also consider whether there's any possibility of compromise, like further discussions about alternatives, even if he's not excited about them. Maybe there's a middle ground he hasn't considered yet.\n\nAnother angle is societal expectations versus personal values. Some people might argue that it's selfish to end a serious relationship over infertility, especially when alternatives exist. Others might say it's fair to part ways if fundamental life goals are incompatible. The line between being realistic and being cruel is thin here.\n\nAlso, the author acknowledges it's selfish, but he's trying to be honest. He's in a tough spot. The question is whether his actions make him the asshole. If he breaks up, is he in the wrong for not sticking by her through this, or is he in the right for being truthful about his inability to adapt to the situation?\n\nConsidering all these factors, I think it's a nuanced situation. However, the key point is that the author is considering breaking up because he can't accept the situation, which is a valid personal decision. But the way it's handled matters. He's trying to be supportive and is in a state of contemplation, which shows he's not acting impulsively. The fact that he's asking for advice and trying to weigh his options suggests he's trying to be thoughtful. However, the act of breaking up over infertility when alternatives are possible could be seen as prioritizing his own desires over the relationship's potential for a different kind of future. But again, if having biological children is non-negotiable, then it's a matter of personal values. \n\nIn conclusion, there's no clear right or wrong here. But since the question is whether he's in the wrong, I need to decide based on the typical WIBTA criteria. Often, in these threads, people are considered assholes if they're being selfish, insensitive, or not taking responsibility. Here, he's being honest but also considering his own needs, which can be seen as self-aware. However, the emotional impact on his girlfriend is significant. The answer might lean towards A (he's in the wrong) because he's prioritizing his biological desires over the relationship, especially after she's already been through a lot. But others might argue B (not in the wrong) because he's being honest about his non-negotiables. It's a toss-up, but maybe the community would see him as not the asshole if he's being truthful, even if his decision is hard.\n"
