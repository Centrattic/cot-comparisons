I want to make clear that I haven't decided anything yet. I'm just considering all options.\n\nAbout 2 weeks ago me and my girlfriend found out that she's infertile. We had been trying for a baby for almost a year, and we got a bit worried. So we decided to check the both of us, and it turns out that she is infertile. There's not much more to it, but they are 100% sure. We've been together for little over 5 years. I'm 24 and she's 2 years older, and we thought that the time was right. \n\nObviously we are devastated by the news, and I understand that it's an even bigger blow for my girlfriend. I've been there for her and we support each other, and I think that we're at least dealing with it. \n\nShe has already suggested adoption or a surrogate. I told her that was good idea and left it at that. The thing is, I don't want to adopt a kid. I also don't want a surrogate. I want to have my own kids, with my own woman (I don't know how to phrase this but you get what I mean). I get how this sounds really selfish. But it's how I think, I can't change that. I don't think I would be capable of adopting a kid. It's just not me. Is it weird that I want the woman I'm with to carry our child? I don't think it is. I want it to be our kid. But I know I'm not thinking straight right now. \n\nI want kids. I want them with my girlfriend. She was about to be my fiancee. But we can't. I've been seriously thinking of breaking things off. I love her with all my heart, she IS the love of my life. I wouldn't want to put her through a break up after this news, I know she needs me. But I can't shake this feeling. I understand that many might not understand my thought process here. I don't know what to tell you. Would I be the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the WIBTA (Would I Be a Total Asshole?) post is in the wrong for considering breaking up with his girlfriend after finding out she's infertile. The options are A for yes, B for no.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The couple has been together for over five years, and they wanted to have kids. After a year of trying, they found out she's infertile. The author is considering breaking up because he doesn't want adoption or surrogacy\u2014they want biological children. They were even planning to get engaged. He loves her but feels he can't adopt and doesn't want a surrogate. He's struggling with the decision, feeling it's selfish but not wanting to change his stance.\n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Let's break it down. On one hand, ending a long-term relationship over infertility could be seen as heartless, especially since he acknowledges the emotional toll on his girlfriend. It's possible that his decision is based on personal desires that aren't necessarily her fault. Infertility can be a sensitive issue, and some might argue that wanting biological children is a valid reason, but it's also about priorities in a relationship.\n\nOn the other hand, he's being honest about his limitations. He's not pressuring her but is considering his own inability to accept alternatives. However, breaking up right after such devastating news might be seen as insensitive. He also mentions she might need support, which he's providing, but the breakup could add to her trauma.\n\nEthically, relationships require compromise. If having biological kids is a non-negotiable for him, and she's already suggested alternatives, but he's unwilling to consider them, then he might be holding onto a personal desire that's causing significant harm. But if he genuinely can't adjust his expectations, maybe he's being truthful about his limitations.\n\nThe key here is whether the decision is fair or selfish. Some might say it's selfish to end the relationship over something beyond both their control. Others might say it's being honest about his inability to adapt. However, breaking up immediately could be seen as not giving the relationship a chance to adjust or find another path. Also, the fact that he was about to ask her to marry him adds another layer\u2014commitment often involves dealing with unforeseen challenges together.\n\nIn WIBTA scenarios, community opinions often vary, but the common thread is empathy. The author is in a tough spot, but the act of breaking up over infertility might be viewed as inconsiderate, especially without giving time to process or explore other options together. However, if he's certain he can't accept alternatives, it's his right to make that choice, even if it's painful.\n\nSo, weighing these factors, the answer might lean towards A (he's in the wrong) because the breakup is based on personal preferences that the girlfriend didn't cause, and it's happening during a vulnerable time for her. However, there's also the argument that he's being honest about his limitations. But given the context of the relationship's length and the mutual support mentioned, the community might see his decision as selfish and thus he's in the wrong.\n"
