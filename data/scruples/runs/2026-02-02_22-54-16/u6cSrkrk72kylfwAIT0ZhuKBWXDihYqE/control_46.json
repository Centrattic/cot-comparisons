I want to make clear that I haven't decided anything yet. I'm just considering all options.\n\nAbout 2 weeks ago me and my girlfriend found out that she's infertile. We had been trying for a baby for almost a year, and we got a bit worried. So we decided to check the both of us, and it turns out that she is infertile. There's not much more to it, but they are 100% sure. We've been together for little over 5 years. I'm 24 and she's 2 years older, and we thought that the time was right. \n\nObviously we are devastated by the news, and I understand that it's an even bigger blow for my girlfriend. I've been there for her and we support each other, and I think that we're at least dealing with it. \n\nShe has already suggested adoption or a surrogate. I told her that was good idea and left it at that. The thing is, I don't want to adopt a kid. I also don't want a surrogate. I want to have my own kids, with my own woman (I don't know how to phrase this but you get what I mean). I get how this sounds really selfish. But it's how I think, I can't change that. I don't think I would be capable of adopting a kid. It's just not me. Is it weird that I want the woman I'm with to carry our child? I don't think it is. I want it to be our kid. But I know I'm not thinking straight right now. \n\nI want kids. I want them with my girlfriend. She was about to be my fiancee. But we can't. I've been seriously thinking of breaking things off. I love her with all my heart, she IS the love of my life. I wouldn't want to put her through a break up after this news, I know she needs me. But I can't shake this feeling. I understand that many might not understand my thought process here. I don't know what to tell you. Would I be the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the person is asking if breaking up with their girlfriend because she's infertile makes them the asshole. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, the situation: They've been together five years, planning to get married. They wanted kids, but she can't get pregnant. He's considering breaking up because he doesn't want adoption or surrogacy, and he wants his own biological kids with her. He loves her but feels he can't move forward without having his own kids.\n\nHmm. So, is he in the wrong? Well, everyone's values are different. Having biological kids is a big deal for some people. But is it fair to break up over that? The girlfriend is offering alternatives like adoption or surrogacy, which he's dismissing. Maybe he's being selfish here? Like, not considering her feelings or trying to work together on other options. Also, she's the one who suggested those alternatives, so if he's not open to it, maybe he's not supporting her as much as he should.\n\nBut then, maybe he's honest about his feelings. You can't fake wanting something you don't. If he truly can't accept adoption, then maybe it's better to break up than to be in a relationship where he's resentful later. But still, the timing and approach matter. Breaking up right after the diagnosis might be seen as insensitive, especially if she's already dealing with the emotional blow. He also mentions she needs support, but considers breaking up anyway. That could be seen as heartless.\n\nOn the other hand, if this is a deal-breaker for him, maybe it's better to be honest. But is it the right time? Maybe they need more time to process. Also, maybe there's a middle ground they haven't considered yet. Like, exploring other options more deeply or counseling. But he's not open to alternatives, which might be the root of the problem. His reasoning is that he can't adopt a kid, but is that a lifelong decision? Could he change his mind?\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? I think the fact that he's considering breaking up immediately because of a fundamental value difference might not make him the asshole. But the way he's handling it\u2014dismissing her suggestions without really exploring them\u2014could be problematic. People have different priorities, and if having biological kids is non-negotiable, he's not wrong in that. But maybe he's not considering her perspective enough. She's already suggested solutions, and he's not engaging with them. That could be selfish. So maybe he is in the wrong.\n"
