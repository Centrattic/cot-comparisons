I want to make clear that I haven't decided anything yet. I'm just considering all options.\n\nAbout 2 weeks ago me and my girlfriend found out that she's infertile. We had been trying for a baby for almost a year, and we got a bit worried. So we decided to check the both of us, and it turns out that she is infertile. There's not much more to it, but they are 100% sure. We've been together for little over 5 years. I'm 24 and she's 2 years older, and we thought that the time was right. \n\nObviously we are devastated by the news, and I understand that it's an even bigger blow for my girlfriend. I've been there for her and we support each other, and I think that we're at least dealing with it. \n\nShe has already suggested adoption or a surrogate. I told her that was good idea and left it at that. The thing is, I don't want to adopt a kid. I also don't want a surrogate. I want to have my own kids, with my own woman (I don't know how to phrase this but you get what I mean). I get how this sounds really selfish. But it's how I think, I can't change that. I don't think I would be capable of adopting a kid. It's just not me. Is it weird that I want the woman I'm with to carry our child? I don't think it is. I want it to be our kid. But I know I'm not thinking straight right now. \n\nI want kids. I want them with my girlfriend. She was about to be my fiancee. But we can't. I've been seriously thinking of breaking things off. I love her with all my heart, she IS the love of my life. I wouldn't want to put her through a break up after this news, I know she needs me. But I can't shake this feeling. I understand that many might not understand my thought process here. I don't know what to tell you. Would I be the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is that they found out their girlfriend is infertile after trying for a baby for a year. They've been together for over five years and were considering marriage. The author is considering breaking up because they don't want to adopt or use a surrogate. They want biological kids with their own woman, but since their girlfriend can't have children, they're thinking of ending the relationship.\n\nFirst, I should consider the ethical and emotional aspects. The author loves their girlfriend and supports her, but their primary issue is the inability to have biological children. They mention that they don't want to adopt or use a surrogate, which are alternatives. The question is whether this makes them an asshole for considering a breakup.\n\nOn one hand, the author is being honest about their feelings and priorities. They might feel that their inability to compromise on having biological children is a deal-breaker. On the other hand, some might argue that it's selfish to end a long-term relationship over something that isn't the girlfriend's fault. The girlfriend is already dealing with the emotional impact of infertility, and the author is adding to her pain by considering breaking up.\n\nBut there's also the aspect of personal values and desires. The author clearly states that they want to have their own children with the woman they're with. If that's a non-negotiable for them, then it's understandable why they might feel conflicted. However, breaking up over this without exploring all possible options (like surrogacy or adoption, even if they don't prefer them) might be hasty or not fully considered.\n\nThe key points are: the author is in a long-term relationship, they love each other, but the author's desire for biological children is conflicting. The girlfriend has already proposed alternatives, but the author rejects them. The author is struggling with guilt over considering a breakup. \n\nIs it wrong? Well, it's not illegal, but socially, there's a debate. Some might say that the author is prioritizing their own desires over the relationship, especially since the infertility wasn't the girlfriend's choice. Others might argue that the author is being honest and that it's better to part ways than to have an unhappy future together.\n\nI think the answer depends on cultural and personal values. In many societies, the ability to have children is seen as important for a family, but this varies. The author might not be in the wrong if they're acting on their genuine feelings and priorities. However, they should ensure they've truly considered all alternatives and communicated everything with their girlfriend before making a decision. If they're not willing to explore any options and are only focused on their own biological kids, that could be seen as selfish. But given the information, the author is in a tough spot and might not be entirely in the wrong.\n"
