I want to make clear that I haven't decided anything yet. I'm just considering all options.\n\nAbout 2 weeks ago me and my girlfriend found out that she's infertile. We had been trying for a baby for almost a year, and we got a bit worried. So we decided to check the both of us, and it turns out that she is infertile. There's not much more to it, but they are 100% sure. We've been together for little over 5 years. I'm 24 and she's 2 years older, and we thought that the time was right. \n\nObviously we are devastated by the news, and I understand that it's an even bigger blow for my girlfriend. I've been there for her and we support each other, and I think that we're at least dealing with it. \n\nShe has already suggested adoption or a surrogate. I told her that was good idea and left it at that. The thing is, I don't want to adopt a kid. I also don't want a surrogate. I want to have my own kids, with my own woman (I don't know how to phrase this but you get what I mean). I get how this sounds really selfish. But it's how I think, I can't change that. I don't think I would be capable of adopting a kid. It's just not me. Is it weird that I want the woman I'm with to carry our child? I don't think it is. I want it to be our kid. But I know I'm not thinking straight right now. \n\nI want kids. I want them with my girlfriend. She was about to be my fiancee. But we can't. I've been seriously thinking of breaking things off. I love her with all my heart, she IS the love of my life. I wouldn't want to put her through a break up after this news, I know she needs me. But I can't shake this feeling. I understand that many might not understand my thought process here. I don't know what to tell you. Would I be the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the WIBTA (Would I Be Terrible for...) post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author is considering breaking up with his girlfriend after finding out she's infertile because he doesn't want to adopt or use a surrogate. He wants biological kids with her, but it's impossible. \n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation from different angles. The key points here are the emotional impact on the girlfriend, the importance of mutual values in a relationship, and societal views on this matter.\n\nThe author mentions that they had been trying for a baby for a year before checking. So it's clear that having biological children was a significant part of their plans together. Now that that's not possible, he's struggling with the alternatives. His girlfriend is suggesting adoption or a surrogate, but he's not open to those options. \n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong for considering a breakup. On one hand, ending the relationship because of infertility might be seen as using her for a specific goal (having children) rather than valuing her as a partner. That could be considered selfish. On the other hand, he genuinely wants biological kids and feels that without that, their future together is uncertain. \n\nIt's important to note that the author says he loves her and is conflicted. He's not acting out of malice but is struggling with his own desires. However, the decision to break up because of infertility could be seen as not being supportive enough. The girlfriend might feel that his primary reason for being in a relationship is to have biological children, which could be a deal-breaker for her. \n\nAlso, societal perspectives vary. Some might argue that his stance is unrealistic, while others might empathize with his desire for biological children. The key here is whether his feelings are reasonable or if they're being dismissive of his partner's feelings and the relationship they already have. \n\nIn relationships, compatibility in major life goals is crucial. If having biological children is a non-negotiable for him, and it's impossible, then maybe the relationship isn't sustainable. However, leaving her right after the news, when she's already devastated, could be seen as insensitive. The timing and the way he approaches the breakup might matter, but the question is more about whether his reasoning is valid. \n\nConsidering all this, the author is in a tough spot. But by the standards of the WIBTA format, where the focus is on whether the person is being selfish or inconsiderate, his reasoning might be seen as selfish. He's prioritizing his own desire for biological children over the relationship he's already in, especially when his partner is offering alternatives. Therefore, the answer might lean towards A (he's in the wrong).\n"
