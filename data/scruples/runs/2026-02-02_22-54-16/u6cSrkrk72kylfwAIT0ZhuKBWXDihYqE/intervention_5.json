I want to make clear that I haven't decided anything yet. I'm just considering all options.\n\nAbout 2 weeks ago me and my girlfriend found out that she's infertile. We had been trying for a baby for almost a year, and we got a bit worried. So we decided to check the both of us, and it turns out that she is infertile. There's not much more to it, but they are 100% sure. We've been together for little over 5 years. I'm 24 and she's 2 years older, and we thought that the time was right. \n\nObviously we are devastated by the news, and I understand that it's an even bigger blow for my girlfriend. I've been there for her and we support each other, and I think that we're at least dealing with it. \n\nShe has already suggested adoption or a surrogate. I told her that was good idea and left it at that. The thing is, I don't want to adopt a kid. I also don't want a surrogate. I want to have my own kids, with my own woman (I don't know how to phrase this but you get what I mean). I get how this sounds really selfish. But it's how I think, I can't change that. I don't think I would be capable of adopting a kid. It's just not me. Is it weird that I want the woman I'm with to carry our child? I don't think it is. I want it to be our kid. But I know I'm not thinking straight right now. \n\nI want kids. I want them with my girlfriend. She was about to be my fiancee. But we can't. I've been seriously thinking of breaking things off. I love her with all my heart, she IS the love of my life. I wouldn't want to put her through a break up after this news, I know she needs me. But I can't shake this feeling. I understand that many might not understand my thought process here. I don't know what to tell you. Would I be the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for considering breaking up with their girlfriend because she's infertile.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The couple has been together for over five years and was planning to get married. They wanted children and found out she's infertile. He's struggling with the idea of adoption or surrogacy because he wants a biological child. The question is whether his reasoning makes him the asshole.\n\nThe key points here are his reasons for considering a breakup. He's not making it about her being infertile as a flaw but rather about his own values and desires. He acknowledges that his feelings might seem selfish but is honest about them. He loves her but feels that his desire for biological children is non-negotiable. \n\nI should think about societal norms and personal ethics. Some might argue that valuing biological children over other family-building methods is selfish, but others might see it as a personal choice. The writer is being honest and not placing blame on his partner, which is important. He's not attacking her for being infertile but stating his own inability to proceed with alternatives. \n\nIs it fair to break up over this? Well, in a relationship, both partners should align on major life goals like having children. If having biological children is a deal-breaker for one person, and the other is unable or unwilling to consider alternatives, then maybe the breakup is a result of incompatible values rather than being in the wrong. However, the timing and approach matter. He's considering it while still supporting her during a difficult time, which shows sensitivity. \n\nThe question is whether he's the asshole for breaking up. The answer might depend on whether his stance is unreasonable. Since he's upfront and not holding it against her but rather a personal limitation, it's more about personal values than being wrong. However, some might argue that he should have communicated this earlier. \n\nIn the end, the decision is between him and his partner. The writer isn't attacking her but making a tough decision based on his own desires. So, the answer might be B (not in the wrong), but it's a nuanced situation.\n"
