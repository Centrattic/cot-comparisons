I don't want to tell people, especially my son, that he is partly named after another man who his mom loved before me. She said, \"why can't you say he is named after my friend who died? We weren't even together when he died\". I continued saying no to the name and that it feels pretty shitty to even be asked to name him that. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to name his son after his girlfriend's ex-boyfriend who died. The girlfriend wants the middle name to honor her ex's family, but the author feels uncomfortable with it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's main concern is about the emotional implications. He doesn't want their son to be connected to someone else the mother loved before him. That's understandable; naming a child after an ex, even if deceased, could lead to questions and potential jealousy in the future. It's about the son's identity and the author's feelings towards the ex.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend wants to honor her deceased ex and his family. She mentions they're still close with the family, so it's important to her. She argues that the ex wasn't alive when the child is born, so maybe the connection isn't romantic but rather a tribute to a friendship. The family's importance is a factor here.\n\nBut naming a child after an ex, even if the person is deceased, can be a sensitive issue. The author has the right to feel uncomfortable, especially since he's the father. The child's name is a shared decision, and both parents should agree. The girlfriend's argument that she can just say it's a friend might not hold if the ex was a romantic partner. There's a risk of the child later finding out it's after a previous lover, which could cause confusion or emotional issues.\n\nAlso, the law usually requires both parents to agree on the child's name. So if the author is adamant, he has a right to refuse. The key here is mutual respect and compromise. The girlfriend might need to find another way to honor her ex without involving the child's name. The author isn't in the wrong for standing his ground on this, as it's a significant personal decision affecting their child.\n"
