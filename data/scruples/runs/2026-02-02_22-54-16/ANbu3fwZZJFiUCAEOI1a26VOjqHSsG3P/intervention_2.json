The other night when discussing names, she said she would like his middle name to be that of her ex, who died. Saying further that it would mean a lot to his family who she is still close with.\n\nI said that makes me really uncomfortable and don't want to do it. I don't want to tell people, especially my son, that he is partly named after another man who his mom loved before me. She said, \"why can't you say he is named after my friend who died? We weren't even together when he died\". I continued saying no to the name and that it feels pretty shitty to even be asked to name him that. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for not wanting to name their son after the girlfriend's ex. The girlfriend wants the middle name to be her ex's name because it's important to her family and they're still close. The author is uncomfortable with it, not wanting their son to be named after someone the mom previously loved. The girlfriend argues that the ex was just a friend who died, not a romantic partner at the time. The author says no and feels it's shitty to even be asked.\n\nI need to decide if the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. Naming a child is a significant decision, and both parents usually have a say. The author's discomfort is valid because they might not want their son to have a name that's connected to a previous relationship. The girlfriend's reasoning is that the ex was a friend, but the author perceives it as a romantic connection. The ex died, so there's a sentimental aspect from the girlfriend's side, and her family's involvement is another layer. \n\nIs the author wrong to refuse? Well, naming a child is a personal choice, and the author has the right to their feelings. The girlfriend's ex was a past relationship, and even if they weren't together when he died, the name choice might still make the author uncomfortable. The key here is whether the author's refusal is reasonable. Since the author is a parent-to-be, they have the right to object if it causes them emotional distress. The girlfriend's family's feelings might be a point, but the parents' agreement is crucial for the child's name. \n\nIn many cultures, parents co-decide the child's name, so the author isn't wrong to stand their ground. The girlfriend might need to find another way to honor the ex without using the name. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
