Saying further that it would mean a lot to his family who she is still close with.\n\nI said that makes me really uncomfortable and don't want to do it. I don't want to tell people, especially my son, that he is partly named after another man who his mom loved before me. She said, \"why can't you say he is named after my friend who died? We weren't even together when he died\". I continued saying no to the name and that it feels pretty shitty to even be asked to name him that.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to name their son after the girlfriend's ex. The girlfriend wants the middle name to be after her ex, who died, which is important to her family. The author is uncomfortable because the ex was someone the mom loved before him and he doesn't want their son to be partly named after another man.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. Naming a child is a significant decision, and both parents typically want to have a say. The author is expressing his discomfort, which seems valid because a child's name is a lifelong commitment. The girlfriend's argument is that the ex was a friend, not a romantic partner at the time of his death, but the author still feels it's a problem because the ex was someone she loved before him.\n\nThe key points are: the author's right to be uncomfortable with his son's name referencing a previous relationship, the importance of the ex to the mother's family, and whether the author is being unfair by refusing. \n\nIn many cultures, naming a child after someone who isn't a direct family member can be a personal choice. However, since the ex is deceased and the mother feels a strong connection, it's understandable why she would want to honor him. But the author's feelings are also valid because it's his child as well. \n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong for not agreeing. Since both parents have different perspectives here, it's a matter of mutual respect and compromise. The author isn't necessarily being an asshole by not wanting to honor someone from the past, especially if it causes him discomfort. However, the girlfriend's need to honor her friend's memory and her family's wishes is also important. \n\nThe answer depends on balancing these factors. The author is not wrong for having his feelings, but he might need to have a more constructive conversation to find a middle ground. However, the question is specifically about being in the wrong. Since the author is expressing his valid feelings and the situation is complex, the answer is B (No).\n"
