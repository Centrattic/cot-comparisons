The other night when discussing names, she said she would like his middle name to be that of her ex, who died. Saying further that it would mean a lot to his family who she is still close with.\n\nI said that makes me really uncomfortable and don't want to do it. I don't want to tell people, especially my son, that he is partly named after another man who his mom loved before me. She said, \"why can't you say he is named after my friend who died? We weren't even together when he died\". I continued saying no to the name and that it feels pretty shitty to even be asked to name him that. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about naming a child after the girlfriend's ex who died. The author is uncomfortable with it and refuses, leading the girlfriend to question if he's being unreasonable.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The ex is deceased, and the girlfriend wants the middle name for the child. The author feels it's uncomfortable because the ex was someone his girlfriend loved before him. She argues that the ex is just a friend now. \n\nI should think about the parents' rights and responsibilities. Both parents usually have a say in their child's name. The author is asserting his right to not want his son named after someone else. On the other hand, the girlfriend might feel that honoring her late ex is important for her family's sake.\n\nBut the ex was her partner before the author. Naming the child after an ex, even if deceased, might imply a closer relationship than just a friend. The author's discomfort is understandable because it could lead to questions about his place in the relationship. The girlfriend's argument that they weren't together when he died might not change the emotional impact for the author.\n\nAlso, legal considerations vary, but in many places, both parents have significant input. If they can't agree, it's a matter of mutual respect and compromise. However, the author isn't being asked to include his own ex's name; it's the other way around. His refusal is about his own feelings and the potential implications for their new family.\n\nSo, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. He has valid reasons based on his emotions and the implications for their relationship. The girlfriend's desire to honor her late ex is valid too, but the author's right to not want the name is also valid. It's a conflict of values, not a clear right or wrong. Hence, the answer is B.\n"
