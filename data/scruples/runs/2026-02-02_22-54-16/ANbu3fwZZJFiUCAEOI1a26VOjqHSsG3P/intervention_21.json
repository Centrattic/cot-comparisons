The other night when discussing names, she said she would like his middle name to be that of her ex, who died. Saying further that it would mean a lot to his family who she is still close with.\n\nI said that makes me really uncomfortable and don't want to do it. I don't want to tell people, especially my son, that he is partly named after another man who his mom loved before me. She said, \"why can't you say he is named after my friend who died? We weren't even together when he died\". I continued saying no to the name and that it feels pretty shitty to even be asked to name him that. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about naming their son after the girlfriend's ex who died.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author is uncomfortable with naming their son after the ex, even as a middle name. The girlfriend wants to honor the ex because his family is important to her, but she's still close with them. The author feels it's awkward because the ex was someone the mother loved before him, and he doesn't want their son to know he's named after another man. The girlfriend argues that the ex was just a friend who died and they weren't together when he died.\n\nI think the key points here are the author's emotional well-being and the potential impact on their son. The author has valid feelings about this. Naming a child after someone else can feel like a loss of personal connection to the child's identity. The girlfriend's request is understandable, as honoring a deceased person can be meaningful, especially for family reasons. However, the author's discomfort is also significant. It's a personal choice, and forcing someone to name their child after a former partner, even if they're deceased, might not be fair.\n\nThe author is standing up for their own feelings here, which is important in a relationship. Compromise is necessary, but so is respecting each other's boundaries. If the author truly can't get over this, it's their right to express that. The girlfriend might need to find another way to honor the ex, perhaps through different means rather than the child's name. \n\nSo, in this case, the author isn't in the wrong. They have every right to feel uncomfortable. The answer should be B for No.\n"
