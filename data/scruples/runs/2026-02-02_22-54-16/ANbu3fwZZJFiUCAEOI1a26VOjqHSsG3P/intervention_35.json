The other night when discussing names, she said she would like his middle name to be that of her ex, who died. Saying further that it would mean a lot to his family who she is still close with.\n\nI said that makes me really uncomfortable and don't want to do it. I don't want to tell people, especially my son, that he is partly named after another man who his mom loved before me. She said, \"why can't you say he is named after my friend who died? We weren't even together when he died\". I continued saying no to the name and that it feels pretty shitty to even be asked to name him that. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person (the author) is in the wrong for not wanting to name their son after the girlfriend's ex, who has passed away. The girlfriend wants the middle name as a tribute to her ex's family, but the author feels uncomfortable.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. Naming a child is a significant decision, and both parents typically have a say. The author's discomfort is valid because they might feel it's honoring a previous relationship, even if the girlfriend clarifies the ex's role now. However, the girlfriend is honoring a deceased loved one's family, which she's still close to. \n\nThe key points are mutual respect and compromise. The author's feelings are understandable\u2014they might not want their son's name to be associated with someone else. On the other hand, the girlfriend has a valid emotional reason tied to her family. If they can't reach a compromise, the author isn't wrong for standing their ground. The question is about whether the author is in the wrong, not about the resolution of their conflict. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the author's refusal is reasonable. Since it's a personal choice and they have a valid reason, they're not in the wrong. The girlfriend's request is also valid, but both need to negotiate. The author's \"no\" isn't necessarily wrong.\n"
