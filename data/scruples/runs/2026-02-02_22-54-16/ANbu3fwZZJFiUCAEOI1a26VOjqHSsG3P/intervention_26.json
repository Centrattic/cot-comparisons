Saying further that it would mean a lot to his family who she is still close with.\n\nI said that makes me really uncomfortable and don't want to do it. I don't want to tell people, especially my son, that he is partly named after another man who his mom loved before me. She said, \"why can't you say he is named after my friend who died? We weren't even together when he died\". I continued saying no to the name and that it feels pretty shitty to even be asked to name him that. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is the asshole (AITA) for not wanting to name their son after the girlfriend's ex who died. The girlfriend wants the middle name as a tribute, but the author is uncomfortable.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the perspectives. The author is the father-to-be, and naming a child is a big decision. They have the right to feel uncomfortable about their child being named after someone the mother was in a relationship with before them, even if that person is deceased. The girlfriend argues that the ex was a friend, not a romantic partner, and that it's important for her family. But the author doesn't want to go along with it.\n\nIn many cultures, naming a child after someone who is not a close family member, especially a former partner, can be a sensitive issue. The father's feelings about the name being a part of their child's identity and the potential for the child to be confused or for the father to feel uneasy are valid. The fact that the ex is dead might not change the fact that the name is tied to a past relationship, which the current partner wants to honor, but the father isn't on board.\n\nI should also think about the fairness in the situation. Both partners should have a say in their child's name. The girlfriend is pushing for a name that the author is against. While the reasons are understandable (honoring a friend and family), the author's discomfort is a significant factor. The key here is mutual respect and compromise. If the author is firm in their refusal, the girlfriend might need to find another way to honor the ex without the name.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. They have the right to set boundaries about their child's name. The girlfriend's insistence without considering the father's feelings could be the issue here. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
