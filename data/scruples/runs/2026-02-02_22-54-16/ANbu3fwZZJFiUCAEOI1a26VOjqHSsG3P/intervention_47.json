I don't want to tell people, especially my son, that he is partly named after another man who his mom loved before me. She said, \"why can't you say he is named after my friend who died?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to name their son after the girlfriend's ex. The situation is that the girlfriend wants the middle name to be her ex's name, even though he died. The author is uncomfortable with it because it feels like their son is named after someone the mom loved before him. The girlfriend argues that the ex was a friend, not in a relationship when he died, and that it's important to the family.\n\nSo, the user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. I need to decide if the answer is A or B. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, naming a child is a big decision. Both parents usually have a say. The author's discomfort is valid because having a middle name of an ex, even deceased, might create confusion or emotional issues. The girlfriend is trying to honor the ex's family, which is understandable, but the author's feelings are also important. The ex was a significant person in her past, and the author doesn't want their son to be associated with someone he's not connected to. \n\nBut wait, the girlfriend mentions that they weren't together when the ex died. She says he's a friend. But the author still feels it's about someone she loved before him. There's a difference between a friend and someone you were in a relationship with. However, the author's main issue is the emotional aspect of naming their child after someone from her past. \n\nIs it fair for the author to say no? Well, both partners should have a say in their child's name. The girlfriend is trying to honor someone's memory, but the author is prioritizing their own feelings here. It's a conflict between honoring the past and the current relationship's needs. \n\nIn many cases, compromise is needed. Maybe the author could consider other ways to honor the ex's family without using the name. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since they expressed their discomfort and refused, does that make them the asshole?\n\nI think the author is justified in their feelings. Naming a child is a personal choice, and if it's causing emotional distress, it's reasonable to decline. The girlfriend's ex is part of her past, but the author's feelings about the child's identity are valid. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
