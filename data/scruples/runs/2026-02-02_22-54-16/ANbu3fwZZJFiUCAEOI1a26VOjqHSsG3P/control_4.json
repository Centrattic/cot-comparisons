I don't want to tell people, especially my son, that he is partly named after another man who his mom loved before me. She said, \"why can't you say he is named after my friend who died? We weren't even together when he died\". I continued saying no to the name and that it feels pretty shitty to even be asked to name him that. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the question) is in the wrong for not wanting to name their son after the girlfriend's ex who died. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The couple is expecting a child, and the girlfriend wants the son's middle name to be her ex's name, who passed away. The author is uncomfortable with this because it feels like the son is being named after someone else the mother loved before him. The girlfriend argues that the ex was just a friend at the time of his death and that the author should just say it's in honor of a friend.\n\nThe key points here are about the author's feelings and the girlfriend's perspective. The author is resisting because it makes him feel \"pretty shitty\" and doesn't want to name their son after someone else. The girlfriend is pushing for it for her family's closure and connection to the ex.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. From what I know about naming practices, it's a personal decision, and couples often have different opinions. The author has a valid reason for not wanting to use the name, especially if it's causing emotional discomfort. Honoring someone's ex, especially if they're deceased, can be touchy, but the author's feelings about his own child's name matter too.\n\nHowever, the girlfriend's side is that the ex was a friend and that it would mean a lot to her family. If the ex was a significant figure in her life, she might feel it's important to honor him. But the author is the biological father, and both parents usually have a say in their child's name. It's a compromise situation.\n\nThe line between respecting each other's feelings and being unreasonable comes into play. The author is clearly not in the wrong if he's asserting his own comfort. But if the girlfriend is being insistent and the author is firm in his stance, it's a conflict of priorities. The fact that the author said \"no\" and felt uncomfortable is a sign that his feelings are valid. The girlfriend's reasoning that they weren't together when the ex died might not change the emotional weight of the situation for the author.\n\nIn many cases, people might think that the author is justified in his refusal because naming a child after an ex, even deceased, can create awkwardness and has emotional implications. The girlfriend's insistence here could be seen as not respecting the author's feelings. So, the answer would likely be B (No, the author isn't in the wrong).\n"
