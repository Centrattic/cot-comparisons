The other night when discussing names, she said she would like his middle name to be that of her ex, who died. Saying further that it would mean a lot to his family who she is still close with.\n\nI said that makes me really uncomfortable and don't want to do it. I don't want to tell people, especially my son, that he is partly named after another man who his mom loved before me. She said, \"why can't you say he is named after my friend who died? We weren't even together when he died\". I continued saying no to the name and that it feels pretty shitty to even be asked to name him that. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to name their son after the girlfriend's ex. The situation is about naming a child, which can be a sensitive issue.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend wants the middle name to be her ex's name, who has passed away. She says it would mean a lot to her family, and she's still close with them. The author is uncomfortable with this because he doesn't want their son to be named after someone the mother loved before him. The girlfriend argues that the ex was just a friend who died and they weren't together when he died.\n\nSo, the key points here are the author's feelings versus the girlfriend's wishes. The author feels it's inappropriate to name their son after a previous relationship partner, even if the ex is deceased. The girlfriend sees it as honoring a friend and her family's wishes. \n\nLegally, both parents usually have a say in the child's name. Emotionally, the author is justified in feeling that having his child's name be after someone else's ex might be hurtful. The girlfriend might feel she's being inconsiderate by not honoring her friend. But the author's discomfort is valid because it could lead to future emotional issues. \n\nThe ex is deceased, so it's not about the person being alive, but the fact that the name is part of the child's identity. The author might be right to want to avoid potential confusion or emotional conflict. On the other hand, the girlfriend might feel her family's needs are being ignored. However, the child's father's feelings are equally important in such a decision. \n\nIn many cases, naming a child involves compromise. But if one parent is strongly against it, it's reasonable to not proceed. The author is asserting his right to not have his child's name be a direct reference to a former relationship, which is a common concern. \n\nSo considering all that, I think the author is not in the wrong. He has a legitimate right to his feelings about this matter. Answer B.\n"
