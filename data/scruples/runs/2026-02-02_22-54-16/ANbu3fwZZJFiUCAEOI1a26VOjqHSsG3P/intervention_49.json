The other night when discussing names, she said she would like his middle name to be that of her ex, who died. Saying further that it would mean a lot to his family who she is still close with.\n\nI said that makes me really uncomfortable and don't want to do it. I don't want to tell people, especially my son, that he is partly named after another man who his mom loved before me. She said, \"why can't you say he is named after my friend who died? We weren't even together when he died\". I continued saying no to the name and that it feels pretty shitty to even be asked to name him that. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for not wanting to name his son after his girlfriend's ex-boyfriend who died. The girlfriend wants the middle name as a tribute to her ex, who she's still close with, and his family. The author is uncomfortable with the idea because he feels it's naming the child after someone else he loved before him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The girlfriend has a reason: honoring her ex and his family. She argues that the ex was a friend who died, and they weren't together when he passed. The author, on the other hand, is upset because he doesn't want his son to be partly named after someone else he (the author) is not connected to. He finds it \"shitty\" to be asked.\n\nNow, naming a child is a big decision. Both parents usually have a say. The author is expressing his discomfort, which is valid. But the girlfriend is also trying to honor someone important to her. The key here might be communication and compromise. \n\nThe girlfriend's reasoning is that the ex is just a friend now, but the author still feels it's about a past romantic connection. The ex's death adds another layer\u2014honoring someone's memory can be important to a family. However, the author's feelings about the child being named after someone else might take precedence in a new family dynamic.\n\nIs the author wrong? It's a personal choice. If he's not comfortable with the name, it's his right to express that. The question is whether his refusal is unreasonable. Since the ex is deceased and she's not in a relationship with him anymore, maybe the author isn't wrong in standing his ground. But the girlfriend's perspective is also valid. \n\nIn these situations, compromise is key. Maybe they can find another name that honors the ex without using his name directly. But the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. I think he's not in the wrong because he's asserting his boundary, even if it's a tough situation. The girlfriend might need to respect his feelings here. So the answer would be B.\n"
