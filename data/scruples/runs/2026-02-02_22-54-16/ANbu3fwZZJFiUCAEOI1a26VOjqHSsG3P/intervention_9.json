The other night when discussing names, she said she would like his middle name to be that of her ex, who died. Saying further that it would mean a lot to his family who she is still close with.\n\nI said that makes me really uncomfortable and don't want to do it. I don't want to tell people, especially my son, that he is partly named after another man who his mom loved before me. She said, \"why can't you say he is named after my friend who died? We weren't even together when he died\". I continued saying no to the name and that it feels pretty shitty to even be asked to name him that. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a couple expecting a son, and the girlfriend wants the middle name to be her ex's, who died. The author is uncomfortable with this and says no. The question is whether the author is wrong for not wanting to do that.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is the father-to-be, and having a child's name after an ex can be a sensitive issue. The girlfriend's reasoning is that the ex is now just a friend, and she wants to honor the family's wishes. But the author feels it's uncomfortable because it implies the ex was someone she loved before him, even if they weren't together when the ex died.\n\nI think about naming rights in a relationship. Usually, both parents have a say in their child's name, and it's important that both agree. The author is expressing his discomfort, which is valid. The girlfriend is suggesting that the ex is now just a friend, but the author might feel that the ex still holds a significant place in her life, which he's not comfortable with. \n\nAlso, considering the child's perspective in the future. If the son grows up knowing part of his name is from someone else, especially a parent's ex, it could lead to questions or emotional issues. The author is concerned about how this might affect their son's identity and his own feelings as a father.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's family might have their own reasons for wanting the name, and she's trying to honor them. But the author's feelings are about his own relationship and the child's naming. It's a matter of mutual respect and boundaries in the relationship. \n\nI think the key here is that both parties have valid perspectives, but the author is within his rights to refuse. It's about respecting each other's feelings and finding a compromise. Since the author has made his position clear, and the girlfriend is not backing down, there might be a need for further discussion or maybe choosing a different middle name that both agree on. \n\nThe author isn't in the wrong for setting a boundary that's important to him. The girlfriend might need to consider his feelings and perhaps find another way to honor the ex without including the name in their child's. So, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
