The other night when discussing names, she said she would like his middle name to be that of her ex, who died. Saying further that it would mean a lot to his family who she is still close with.\n\nI said that makes me really uncomfortable and don't want to do it. I don't want to tell people, especially my son, that he is partly named after another man who his mom loved before me. She said, \"why can't you say he is named after my friend who died? We weren't even together when he died\". I continued saying no to the name and that it feels pretty shitty to even be asked to name him that. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is the asshole for not wanting to name their son after the girlfriend's ex, who died. The girlfriend wants the middle name as a tribute to her ex's family, but the author feels uncomfortable.\n\nFirst, naming a child is a big decision. Both partners usually have a say. The author's discomfort makes sense because the ex is someone from the past, even though the relationship ended before his death. The girlfriend argues that the ex was a friend who died, but the author still feels it's about a previous love.\n\nThe key points here are autonomy in decision-making and emotional impact. The author has every right to have reservations about their child being named after someone else, especially a former partner. The girlfriend's family might still be important, but the author's feelings should also be considered. The situation isn't black and white, but the author isn't in the wrong for expressing their discomfort and refusing to go along with the name. They are not being unreasonable; it's a personal choice affecting their child's identity. The answer should be B.\n"
