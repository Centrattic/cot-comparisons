The other night when discussing names, she said she would like his middle name to be that of her ex, who died. Saying further that it would mean a lot to his family who she is still close with.\n\nI said that makes me really uncomfortable and don't want to do it. I don't want to tell people, especially my son, that he is partly named after another man who his mom loved before me. She said, \"why can't you say he is named after my friend who died? We weren't even together when he died\". I continued saying no to the name and that it feels pretty shitty to even be asked to name him that. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to name their son after the girlfriend's ex. The situation is that the girlfriend wants the middle name to be her ex's, even though he died, and her family is close to his. The author is uncomfortable with the idea because he doesn't want the son to be partly named after someone the mom loved before him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is the father-to-be, and naming a child is a significant decision. Both parents usually have a say in it. The girlfriend's ex is deceased, so she wants to honor him, perhaps to maintain her relationship with his family. But the author's feelings are valid too. He might feel threatened or insecure, thinking that the ex is being prioritized over him, even if they weren't together when the ex died.\n\nThe key points are: the author's discomfort, the girlfriend's desire to honor her ex, and the potential impact on their son. The author's refusal is based on his emotional reaction, which is understandable. The girlfriend is trying to balance her past and present relationships. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a matter of perspective. But naming a child is a joint decision. The author has the right to express his discomfort and refuse if it causes him pain. The girlfriend's argument that the ex was a friend might be a way to reframe it, but the author doesn't see it that way. \n\nSo, considering that both parents have a say and the author's feelings are valid, the answer is likely B (not in the wrong). The author isn't wrong for prioritizing his own feelings in this situation.\n"
