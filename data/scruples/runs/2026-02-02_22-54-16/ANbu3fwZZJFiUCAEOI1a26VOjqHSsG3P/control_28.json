The other night when discussing names, she said she would like his middle name to be that of her ex, who died. Saying further that it would mean a lot to his family who she is still close with.\n\nI said that makes me really uncomfortable and don't want to do it. I don't want to tell people, especially my son, that he is partly named after another man who his mom loved before me. She said, \"why can't you say he is named after my friend who died? We weren't even together when he died\". I continued saying no to the name and that it feels pretty shitty to even be asked to name him that. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person is wrong for not wanting to name their son after the girlfriend's ex who died. The girlfriend wants the middle name in honor of her ex, who she's still close with, and the author is uncomfortable with it.\n\nFirst, the key points here are about personal boundaries and feelings. The author feels it's uncomfortable to have their son named after someone the mom loved before them. That's a valid feeling. The girlfriend argues that the ex is now just a friend who died, but the author is still against it.\n\nI need to consider if the author is in the wrong. Well, naming a child is a big decision, and both parents usually have a say. The author is asserting their own discomfort, which is their right. The girlfriend's family is close to the ex, so there's also social pressure from her side. But the author's feelings matter as well. \n\nIs there a middle ground? Maybe they could compromise, but the question is about being in the wrong. The author isn't being unreasonable here. It's their child too, and they have the right to express their discomfort. The girlfriend might feel hurt or overlooked, but the author isn't wrong for standing by their feelings. \n\nAlso, the ex is deceased, so there's a historical aspect. The author isn't in conflict with the ex, just reluctant to honor him in their child's name. The answer likely leans towards the author not being in the wrong because it's about personal choice in naming.\n"
