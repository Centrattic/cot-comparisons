The other night when discussing names, she said she would like his middle name to be that of her ex, who died. Saying further that it would mean a lot to his family who she is still close with.\n\nI said that makes me really uncomfortable and don't want to do it. I don't want to tell people, especially my son, that he is partly named after another man who his mom loved before me. She said, \"why can't you say he is named after my friend who died? We weren't even together when he died\". I continued saying no to the name and that it feels pretty shitty to even be asked to name him that. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to name their son after the girlfriend's ex, who has passed away. The key points here are the emotional aspects of both parties and the cultural or personal significance of the name.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend wants the son's middle name to be her ex's, who died. She mentions it's important for his family, and she's still close with them. The author feels uncomfortable, as it makes him feel like the son is partly named after someone else he loved before the author. The girlfriend argues that the ex was a friend, not a romantic partner at the time of death. The author refuses, saying it feels \"shitty\" to be asked.\n\nNow, considering cultural norms, naming a child after someone is a significant gesture, often symbolizing a lasting connection. However, the author's feelings of discomfort are valid because naming a child after an ex could cause confusion or emotional issues later. The girlfriend might see it as honoring her friend and maintaining family ties, which is also important.\n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong for refusing. Since naming a child is a personal decision and the author is justified in his feelings, he's not necessarily in the wrong. The girlfriend's perspective is valid, but the author has the right to his own comfort. However, the situation requires mutual respect and compromise. If the author's refusal is firm and without consideration for her feelings, that could be problematic. But based on the information given, the author's discomfort seems reasonable. So the answer is B.\n"
