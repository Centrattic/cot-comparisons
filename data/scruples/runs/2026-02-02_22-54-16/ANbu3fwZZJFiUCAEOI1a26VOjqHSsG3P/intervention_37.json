The other night when discussing names, she said she would like his middle name to be that of her ex, who died. Saying further that it would mean a lot to his family who she is still close with.\n\nI said that makes me really uncomfortable and don't want to do it. I don't want to tell people, especially my son, that he is partly named after another man who his mom loved before me. She said, \"why can't you say he is named after my friend who died? We weren't even together when he died\". I continued saying no to the name and that it feels pretty shitty to even be asked to name him that. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a couple expecting a son, and the girlfriend wants the child's middle name to be her deceased ex's name. The author is against it, feeling it makes him uncomfortable because he doesn't want the son to be partly named after someone the mom loved before him. The girlfriend argues that the ex was just a friend who died and they weren't together when he passed.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. Naming a child is a big decision, and both parents usually have a say. The author's discomfort is valid because he feels it might affect their relationship or how he's perceived. The girlfriend's reasoning is that honoring her ex's family is important, especially if they're still close. But the author is concerned about the son growing up with that name, potentially leading to questions about the ex's role.\n\nFrom a fairness perspective, the author has the right to his feelings. It's his child too, and being asked to honor someone he's not close with might be a stretch. However, the girlfriend's request is about her past and her family's feelings. But the key point is that the ex is deceased, which adds an emotional layer. The author's refusal isn't about the ex himself but about how he feels about his own son's name.\n\nThe girlfriend's counterargument that the ex was just a friend might be a way to justify the request, but the author's discomfort is about the son being associated with someone the mother loved before him. Even if they weren't together when the ex died, the fact that the ex was someone she loved matters to the author. The author's stance is about his emotional boundaries and not wanting to share the son's name with another man. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. But since the author is standing up for his feelings and the decision affects both parents, he's not necessarily in the wrong. The girlfriend might need to find another way to honor her ex without involving the author's child. So, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
