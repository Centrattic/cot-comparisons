The other night when discussing names, she said she would like his middle name to be that of her ex, who died. Saying further that it would mean a lot to his family who she is still close with.\n\nI said that makes me really uncomfortable and don't want to do it. I don't want to tell people, especially my son, that he is partly named after another man who his mom loved before me. She said, \"why can't you say he is named after my friend who died? We weren't even together when he died\". I continued saying no to the name and that it feels pretty shitty to even be asked to name him that. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're wrong for not wanting to name their son after their girlfriend's ex who died. The girlfriend wants the middle name as a tribute to her ex, which is important to her family. The author feels uncomfortable because the ex was someone the girlfriend loved before them. They don't want their son to be associated with another man the mom loved before. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The ex is deceased, and the girlfriend is still close with his family. She's framing it as a tribute to a friend, not as a romantic partner. The author's objection is about the emotional implication for the son and themselves. The key points are consent in naming, emotional impact, and mutual respect.\n\nIn many cultures, naming a child is a significant decision where both parents should have a say. The author's discomfort is valid because the name might affect their child's identity and their own feelings. The girlfriend's perspective is about honoring a deceased friend and family ties, which is understandable. However, the author's objection isn't about the deceased but about the implication of the name. \n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong. Legally and socially, both parents usually have a say in the child's name. If one parent feels strongly against it, their input should be respected. The girlfriend's request might stem from her need for closure or honoring a relationship from her past, but the author's feelings are also important. \n\nIt's a gray area. The author isn't wrong for having boundaries, especially considering the potential impact on their child. However, the girlfriend's request is about her emotional needs. The right approach would be open communication to find a compromise. But in terms of being in the wrong, the author's stance is valid. They have every right to express discomfort and refuse. So the answer is B.\n"
