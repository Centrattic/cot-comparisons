      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for not wanting to name their son after the girlfriend's ex who passed away. \n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The girlfriend wants the middle name of her ex, who she's still close with and who died. She mentions that it's important to his family, and she's not even together with him when he died. The author is uncomfortable because he feels it might imply that the son is partially named after someone the mom loved before him. He refuses and calls it \"shitty\" to even be asked.\n\nNow, thinking about naming a child. It's a big deal and involves both parents. The girlfriend's reasoning is that the ex is now just a friend, not a romantic partner, so maybe she's trying to honor his memory and her family. But the author is concerned about the implications for their son. If the son grows up knowing his middle name is after someone else, even if it's a friend, might there be confusion or hurt feelings? \n\nBut then again, the ex is deceased, so there's no ongoing romantic relationship. The author's discomfort might stem from insecurity or fear of being compared. However, the girlfriend's family still wants to honor him, so it's a matter of respecting her wishes versus his feelings. \n\nIn many cases, naming a child after a deceased person is common and seen as a way to honor them. The key here is that the ex is not a current romantic partner, just a friend who died. The author's main issue is the implication of being named after someone the mother loved before him. If the ex was truly just a friend, maybe the author's reaction is more about personal feelings than the situation itself. \n\nBut the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. If the girlfriend is still close with the ex's family and it's important to her, but the author is strongly against it, there's a conflict in priorities. However, naming a child is a joint decision. The author has the right to express discomfort, but the girlfriend also has her reasons. \n\nIn some perspectives, the author isn't wrong to feel uncomfortable about the son being named after someone else, even if that person isn't a current partner. But others might argue that the author is being too sensitive and that the deceased's family should be honored. \n\nSo, the answer might depend on cultural norms, personal values, and how much weight each parent gives to their own feelings versus the other's. Since the author clearly states his discomfort and doesn't want to go through with it, maybe he isn't the asshole. However, if the girlfriend is insistent and it's important to her and her family, the author's refusal could be seen as dismissing her needs. \n\nBut the ex died before they were together, so the author's concern about being compared to the ex is less valid. The girlfriend clarifies they weren't together when he died, so the connection is more as a friend. Therefore, the author's discomfort might be unfounded, but he's within his rights to feel that way. \n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for expressing his feelings, but the situation is a matter of differing priorities. Since he communicated his feelings and the decision is mutual, he isn't the asshole. So the answer is B (No).\n"
