The other night when discussing names, she said she would like his middle name to be that of her ex, who died. Saying further that it would mean a lot to his family who she is still close with.\n\nI said that makes me really uncomfortable and don't want to do it. I don't want to tell people, especially my son, that he is partly named after another man who his mom loved before me. She said, \"why can't you say he is named after my friend who died? We weren't even together when he died\". I continued saying no to the name and that it feels pretty shitty to even be asked to name him that. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit-style post is in the wrong. The situation is about naming their son after the girlfriend's ex who died. The girlfriend wants the middle name to be the ex's name, saying it's important for his family who are still close. The author is uncomfortable with that, not wanting to imply their son is partly named after another man the mom loved before him. The girlfriend argues it's just a friend who died, not a romantic partner.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. The author's discomfort is understandable. Naming a child after an ex, especially a deceased romantic partner, can be emotionally charged. It might cause future issues for the child, especially if the ex is a significant part of the mother's past. The author is standing up for his feelings, which is valid. However, the girlfriend has her reasons, citing the importance of the family and her feelings towards the ex. \n\nBut the key point is the author's right to feel that way. It's their child too, so both parents should have a say in the naming. The author isn't being unreasonable by not wanting to honor an ex in that way. The girlfriend might be in a position where she needs to respect her partner's feelings here. \n\nAlso, the ex is deceased, which complicates things. The girlfriend might feel a connection to the family, but the author's perspective is about the implications for their son. The question is about whether the author is in the wrong for objecting. Since both have valid points, but the author is not being unreasonable, the answer might be B\u2014No, the author isn't in the wrong. They have the right to their feelings about naming their child. The girlfriend's insistence could be seen as not respecting the author's boundaries, but it's a sensitive situation. It's a matter of mutual respect and compromise. So the author isn't the asshole here."
