The other night when discussing names, she said she would like his middle name to be that of her ex, who died. Saying further that it would mean a lot to his family who she is still close with.\n\nI said that makes me really uncomfortable and don't want to do it. I don't want to tell people, especially my son, that he is partly named after another man who his mom loved before me. She said, \"why can't you say he is named after my friend who died? We weren't even together when he died\". I continued saying no to the name and that it feels pretty shitty to even be asked to name him that. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is in the wrong for not wanting to name their son after the girlfriend's ex. The girlfriend wants the middle name as a tribute to her ex, who has passed away, which is important to her family. The author is uncomfortable with it because it feels like the son is partially named after someone else the mother loved before him. The girlfriend argues it's just a friend, but the author still refuses.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. Naming a child is a significant decision that both parents usually have a say in. The author's discomfort is valid because it's their child too. Even if the ex was a friend, the author might feel it's a personal connection they don't want to honor. The girlfriend's reasoning is about honoring her family's wishes, which is understandable. But the author's feelings about the name being linked to a past relationship could lead to future issues, especially if the child asks about the name.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, it's a personal choice with both sides having valid points. The author isn't being unreasonable by refusing. The girlfriend's request is about her emotional needs and family, but the author's right to object should also be respected. Since the final decision on the name requires mutual agreement, the author isn't obligated to agree. So, the answer would lean towards B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
