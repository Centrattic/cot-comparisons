I don't want to tell people, especially my son, that he is partly named after another man who his mom loved before me. She said, \"why can't you say he is named after my friend who died? We weren't even together when he died\". I continued saying no to the name and that it feels pretty shitty to even be asked to name him that.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The situation is about a couple expecting a child, and the girlfriend wants the son's middle name to be after her ex, who died. The author is uncomfortable with this and says they don't want to name their son after someone who was significant in the ex's life before them. The girlfriend argues that the ex is now just a friend and that it's important for her family, with whom she's still close, to have the name. The author insists on saying no, feeling it's \"pretty shitty\" to be asked.\n\nFirst, the core issue is about naming a child after a deceased ex. The author is concerned about the emotional implications and the son's future. Naming a child after an ex, even deceased, can be a sensitive topic. The key points to consider are the author's feelings, the relationship with the ex, and the family dynamics.\n\nThe author's discomfort is valid. They might worry that the son will associate the name with his mother's past relationship, even if the ex is deceased. It's about the perception and potential for the child to feel there's a ghost in the relationship. The girlfriend's reasoning is that the ex was a friend and that the family, still close, would appreciate it. But the author is part of the family now, as the child's parent, so naming the child after the ex could imply a level of respect or closeness that the author doesn't feel comfortable with.\n\nIn such cases, compromise is essential. The author has the right to express their discomfort, especially since they will be the child's parent and are responsible for the name. The girlfriend's family's feelings are important, but they shouldn't override the parent's objection. The fact that the ex is deceased doesn't eliminate the author's right to set boundaries. However, the author could be seen as being rigid if they don't consider the girlfriend's emotional ties to the ex's family. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the author is advocating for their own feelings and the child's future, it's reasonable. The girlfriend's ex was a significant part of her life, but the author has the right to not want their child to be named after someone else's partner. It's a matter of personal boundaries and the child's identity. The answer is likely B (No), as the author isn't obligated to agree to a name they find uncomfortable, especially considering the child's perspective and their own feelings about the ex.\n"
