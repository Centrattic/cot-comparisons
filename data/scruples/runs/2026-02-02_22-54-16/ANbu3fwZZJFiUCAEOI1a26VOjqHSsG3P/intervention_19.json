The other night when discussing names, she said she would like his middle name to be that of her ex, who died. Saying further that it would mean a lot to his family who she is still close with.\n\nI said that makes me really uncomfortable and don't want to do it. I don't want to tell people, especially my son, that he is partly named after another man who his mom loved before me. She said, \"why can't you say he is named after my friend who died? We weren't even together when he died\". I continued saying no to the name and that it feels pretty shitty to even be asked to name him that. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong for not wanting to name their son after the girlfriend's ex. The girlfriend wants the middle name in honor of her ex, who died, and she's close with his family. The author feels uncomfortable because he doesn't want to imply that the son is named after someone he's not, especially since the ex was significant in the mother's life before him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. Naming a child is a big decision, and both parents usually have a say. The author has valid reasons for feeling uncomfortable\u2014it's about their own emotional response and potential future explanations to the child. The girlfriend, on the other hand, sees it as honoring a friend and her late ex, which is important to her family. \n\nBut wait, the ex is deceased, and they weren't together when he died. So the girlfriend is trying to honor a friend, not an ex in a romantic context. The author might be conflating the ex's role as a romantic partner rather than a friend. However, the fact that she was in a relationship with him before the author complicates things. The author might feel that naming the child after him could imply a romantic connection that isn't there anymore, which could cause confusion or jealousy.\n\nBut then again, the girlfriend is making an effort to see it's not about a romantic partner but a friend. The author's discomfort is real, though. It's important to consider mutual respect in such decisions. If both can't agree, maybe a compromise is needed. However, naming a child isn't something to be decided on a compromise if one parent is strongly against it. The author's feelings about their own child's name should matter. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. Both have valid points. But the key here is whether the author is wrong. The author is asserting their own emotional stance, which is understandable. The girlfriend's request is about honoring her past, but respecting the author's feelings is also crucial. Since the author is the one who would have to live with the name and explain it to the child, their objection isn't without merit. \n\nSo, the answer is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. They have a right to feel uncomfortable and to set boundaries about their child's name, especially when it involves a previous romantic partner of the other parent. The girlfriend might need to find another way to honor her ex without imposing it on the child's name, perhaps through other means like a memorial or family traditions. The author's discomfort is valid, and they shouldn't be forced into a decision that makes them feel uneasy about their child's identity.\n"
