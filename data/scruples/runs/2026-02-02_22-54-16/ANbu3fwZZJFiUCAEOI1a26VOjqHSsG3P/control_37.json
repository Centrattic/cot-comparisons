I don't want to tell people, especially my son, that he is partly named after another man who his mom loved before me. She said, \"why can't you say he is named after my friend who died? We weren't even together when he died\". I continued saying no to the name and that it feels pretty shitty to even be asked to name him that. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a couple expecting a son, and the girlfriend wants the middle name to be her ex's name, who has died. The author is uncomfortable with that and refuses.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The girlfriend's ex died, and she wants to honor him because of her family's closeness. The author doesn't want the son to be named after someone his mother loved before him. The girlfriend argues that it's just a friend now, not an ex anymore.\n\nSo, the main conflict is about naming a child after a deceased ex. The author feels it's uncomfortable and doesn't want to do it. The girlfriend sees it as honoring a friend and her family's wishes. \n\nI should consider common perspectives on naming children after ex-partners. Usually, naming a child after an ex can be seen as problematic because it might cause future issues for the child. The ex is deceased, which adds another layer. The girlfriend's reasoning that it's about honoring a friend might be a way to make it less about the ex, but the author is still uncomfortable.\n\nThe author is standing by their boundary, which is important in relationships. However, the girlfriend's desire to honor her deceased friend and family's wishes is also valid. But naming a child after someone who was a significant relationship might carry emotional weight. \n\nIn many cases, people might side with the author here because naming a child after an ex can lead to the child feeling connected to a parent's past relationship. Even if the ex is deceased, it's a sensitive issue. The author's discomfort is reasonable, and refusing isn't necessarily wrong. The girlfriend's insistence might be seen as not respecting the author's feelings, but the author isn't in the wrong for setting that boundary.\n\nSo, the answer is B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
