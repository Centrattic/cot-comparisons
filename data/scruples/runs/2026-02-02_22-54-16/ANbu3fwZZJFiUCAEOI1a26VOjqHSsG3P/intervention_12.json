The other night when discussing names, she said she would like his middle name to be that of her ex, who died. Saying further that it would mean a lot to his family who she is still close with.\n\nI said that makes me really uncomfortable and don't want to do it. I don't want to tell people, especially my son, that he is partly named after another man who his mom loved before me. She said, \"why can't you say he is named after my friend who died? We weren't even together when he died\". I continued saying no to the name and that it feels pretty shitty to even be asked to name him that. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about naming their son after the girlfriend's ex who has died. The author is uncomfortable with the middle name being the ex's name because it feels like the son is named after someone else the mom loved before him. The girlfriend argues that the ex was a friend, not a romantic partner at the time of death, and it's important for her family.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's perspective is about his feelings of discomfort and not wanting to honor someone else as a parent. It's natural to want to feel that your child's name is connected to your family or your own relationships. On the other hand, the girlfriend might see this as important for her emotional connection and her family's acceptance. \n\nThe girlfriend mentions that the ex was a friend who died, and they weren't together when he died. So maybe the author is overreacting, thinking it's about a past romantic relationship when the girlfriend is framing it as a friendship. However, the author's discomfort is valid because the name would still be part of their child's identity, and it's a significant decision for a lifelong name. \n\nIn terms of rights, naming a child is a shared decision between the parents. The author has the right to express discomfort and push back on a choice that doesn't sit well with him. The girlfriend is also within her rights to want to honor someone she cares about, but she needs to respect her partner's feelings. However, the author is not wrong for setting boundaries here. \n\nI should check if there are any cultural or societal norms that might influence this. It's common for grandparents to have their names used, but in this case, it's a former partner's name. There might be different opinions on that. However, the main point is about mutual agreement. Since the author is firm in his stance and the girlfriend is pushing despite his discomfort, the author is justified in standing his ground.\n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). He's expressing his feelings and boundaries, which is reasonable in a partnership.\n"
