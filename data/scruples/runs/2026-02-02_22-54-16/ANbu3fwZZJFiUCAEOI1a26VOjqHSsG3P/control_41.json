The other night when discussing names, she said she would like his middle name to be that of her ex, who died. Saying further that it would mean a lot to his family who she is still close with.\n\nI said that makes me really uncomfortable and don't want to do it. I don't want to tell people, especially my son, that he is partly named after another man who his mom loved before me. She said, \"why can't you say he is named after my friend who died? We weren't even together when he died\". I continued saying no to the name and that it feels pretty shitty to even be asked to name him that. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about naming their son after the girlfriend's ex who died. The author's girlfriend wants the middle name of the ex, but the author is uncomfortable with that. \n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author is not okay with naming their child after someone who was significant to the mother but not to the father. That makes sense because naming a child after a former partner, even deceased, might cause confusion or emotional issues. The son might wonder why someone else is part of his name, especially if the ex had a significant role in the mother's life.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend feels it's important for the family connection and to honor the ex as a friend. But the author is the one who will be raising the child, so his feelings about the name matter too. It's a joint decision, so both partners should have a say. The author has a valid right to express discomfort here. \n\nThe ex isn't even the one who died; the girlfriend's ex died. Wait, the ex is the one who died. The girlfriend is still close to his family. The problem is that the author doesn't want the child to be named after someone else's father figure. Maybe there's a history here that's not fully explained, but the author's objection is about not wanting to honor someone he's not connected to. \n\nThe key point is mutual agreement on a child's name. The girlfriend is pushing for a name that makes the author uncomfortable. In most cases, such decisions require both parents to agree. If the author is really against it, he's not wrong to resist. However, the girlfriend's reasons are about honoring a friend and family ties. But if the author's feelings are strong, it's not fair to expect him to go along just to please her. \n\nI think the author is not in the wrong here because he's standing up for his own feelings and considering the child's future. Naming a child after a deceased ex can be a sensitive issue, especially if the parents have conflicting views. The answer should be B (No).\n"
