The other night when discussing names, she said she would like his middle name to be that of her ex, who died. Saying further that it would mean a lot to his family who she is still close with.\n\nI said that makes me really uncomfortable and don't want to do it. I don't want to tell people, especially my son, that he is partly named after another man who his mom loved before me. She said, \"why can't you say he is named after my friend who died? We weren't even together when he died\". I continued saying no to the name and that it feels pretty shitty to even be asked to name him that. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to name their son after the girlfriend's ex. The situation involves a couple expecting a child and a disagreement over the middle name.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The girlfriend wants the ex's name for the middle name because it's important to her family, and she's still close with them. She mentions that the ex died, and they weren't together when he died. She's suggesting to reframe it as a friend rather than an ex, but the author is uncomfortable because he doesn't want the son to be partly named after someone the mother loved before him.\n\nThe author's main issue is the emotional discomfort and the potential for the son to feel that part of his name is connected to another man. The girlfriend argues that it's a way to honor the deceased and their family. \n\nNow, thinking about naming rights and parental agreements. In many cases, naming a child involves mutual agreement, and both parents have a say. The author is expressing his discomfort, which is valid because it's his child too. The girlfriend's request is about honoring someone from her past, which is important to her, but the author feels it's not respectful or acceptable for him. \n\nThere's also the aspect of the ex being deceased and the family's importance. The girlfriend's family might expect this as a tribute. However, the author's feelings about his son's name are significant. If the author is against it, is it fair to go ahead without his consent? \n\nI think the key points here are mutual respect and compromise. The author is not in the wrong for feeling uncomfortable. It's his right to have a say in his child's name. The girlfriend might need to understand his perspective, but she's also trying to honor her family. However, the author's objection is valid because it's about personal feelings towards the name. \n\nSo, the answer would likely be B (No), the author is not in the wrong. He has a right to his feelings, and the final decision should be a mutual agreement. But maybe there's a middle ground, like finding another name that honors the ex without using his name, but the question is about whether the author is wrong for refusing. Since he's expressing his discomfort and refusing, and given that naming is a joint decision, he's not in the wrong.\n"
