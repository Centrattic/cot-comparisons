The other night when discussing names, she said she would like his middle name to be that of her ex, who died. Saying further that it would mean a lot to his family who she is still close with.\n\nI said that makes me really uncomfortable and don't want to do it. I don't want to tell people, especially my son, that he is partly named after another man who his mom loved before me. She said, \"why can't you say he is named after my friend who died? We weren't even together when he died\". I continued saying no to the name and that it feels pretty shitty to even be asked to name him that. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about naming a child after an ex who has passed away. The girlfriend wants the son's middle name to be her ex's name because it's important to her family, and she's still close with them. The author is uncomfortable with this because they don't want their son to be partly named after someone the mother loved before them. The girlfriend argues that the ex was just a friend when he died, but the author still objects.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is entering a new family situation, perhaps with existing ties to the ex. The girlfriend's family is still close to the ex, so maybe there's emotional significance there. On the other hand, the author feels it's a personal boundary issue. Naming a child is a big decision and involves both parents' comfort levels.\n\nThe girlfriend's perspective is that the ex is a friend who died and naming the child is a tribute to him and a way to honor the family. But the author's discomfort is valid because they might feel like their partner is still emotionally attached to the ex in some way, even if the relationship ended. The argument that the ex was a friend complicates things because it's not entirely about a romantic relationship anymore, but the emotional connection might still be present.\n\nI should think about common practices. It's not uncommon for families to name children after deceased relatives, especially if it's a way to keep their memory alive. However, when the deceased is an ex-partner, it can be more sensitive. The key here is mutual respect and compromise. The girlfriend might feel her family's needs are important, while the author is concerned about their own feelings and the child's identity.\n\nIs the author wrong for objecting? Well, they have the right to express their feelings about how their child is named. The girlfriend's request is understandable, but the author's boundaries should also be respected. However, the girlfriend is still close to the ex's family, which adds another layer. Maybe there's a middle ground, like finding another name that honors the ex without using his name directly. But the author's refusal might be seen as dismissive of the girlfriend's wishes and her family's feelings.\n\nOn the other hand, if the author is truly uncomfortable and feels it's a big issue, they have the right to say no. The girlfriend's insistence might be overstepping if it's causing significant distress. The question is whether the author's refusal is reasonable. It's a personal choice, and both sides have valid points. But since the author is the one who is directly affected by the name and is the other parent, their consent should matter. So maybe the answer is that the author isn't in the wrong because they have the right to their feelings about their child's name.\n"
