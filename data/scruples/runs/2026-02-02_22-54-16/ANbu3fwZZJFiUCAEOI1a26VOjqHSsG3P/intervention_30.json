The other night when discussing names, she said she would like his middle name to be that of her ex, who died. Saying further that it would mean a lot to his family who she is still close with.\n\nI said that makes me really uncomfortable and don't want to do it. I don't want to tell people, especially my son, that he is partly named after another man who his mom loved before me. She said, \"why can't you say he is named after my friend who died? We weren't even together when he died\". I continued saying no to the name and that it feels pretty shitty to even be asked to name him that. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the question is in the wrong. The situation is about naming their son after the girlfriend's ex who died. \n\nFirst, the girlfriend wants the middle name to be her ex's name. She says it's important for his family, and she's still close to them. The author feels uncomfortable because it might confuse the son or make him think his mom loved someone else before him. He refuses and says it feels bad to even be asked.\n\nFrom my perspective, naming a child is a significant decision that both parents should agree on. The author has a valid reason for being uncomfortable. The ex is part of the girlfriend's past, and even though he's deceased, using his name could have emotional implications for the child later. The girlfriend's argument that the ex was a friend might not fully address the author's concerns, especially if the relationship history is complex.\n\nThe author isn't being unreasonable by saying no. It's about his feelings and the potential impact on their son. The girlfriend should respect his boundaries here. So, I think the author is not in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
