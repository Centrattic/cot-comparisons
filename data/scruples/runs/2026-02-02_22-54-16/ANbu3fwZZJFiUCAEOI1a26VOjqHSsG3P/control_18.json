The other night when discussing names, she said she would like his middle name to be that of her ex, who died. Saying further that it would mean a lot to his family who she is still close with.\n\nI said that makes me really uncomfortable and don't want to do it. I don't want to tell people, especially my son, that he is partly named after another man who his mom loved before me. She said, \"why can't you say he is named after my friend who died? We weren't even together when he died\". I continued saying no to the name and that it feels pretty shitty to even be asked to name him that. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about naming their son after the girlfriend's ex who died. The author says they're uncomfortable with it and refuse, while the girlfriend argues it's for her family and that the ex was a friend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is the father-to-be, and naming a child is a significant decision. The girlfriend wants to honor her ex's memory, but the author feels it's inappropriate because the ex was someone she loved before them. The ex is deceased, which adds another layer. The girlfriend's family is still close to the ex, so this might be important to them.\n\nThe key points are consent and mutual agreement in naming a child. Both parents usually have a say. The author is standing his ground, which is valid because it's their child. The girlfriend is trying to honor her past relationship, but the author might feel it's not his place to allow that if it makes him uncomfortable. Also, the child being partly named after someone else's ex could lead to questions or complications later. \n\nThe girlfriend's argument that the ex was a friend is a bit weak since they were in a relationship. The author has a valid point about the child being named after someone the mother loved before him. It's about both parents' comfort. Since the author is firm in his refusal and the girlfriend is pushing for it despite his objections, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. The right answer is B.\n"
