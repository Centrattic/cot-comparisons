Saying further that it would mean a lot to his family who she is still close with.\n\nI said that makes me really uncomfortable and don't want to do it. I don't want to tell people, especially my son, that he is partly named after another man who his mom loved before me. She said, \"why can't you say he is named after my friend who died? We weren't even together when he died\". I continued saying no to the name and that it feels pretty shitty to even be asked to name him that. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who posted the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about naming a child after an ex who has died. The girlfriend wants the son's middle name to be her ex's name because it's important to her family, but the author is uncomfortable with that because it reminds him that his girlfriend loved someone else before him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is not the ex, so the ex isn't part of the current relationship. The ex died, so the situation is a bit more sensitive. The girlfriend is still close to the ex's family. Naming a child after someone is a big deal; it's a lasting part of their identity. The author feels it's uncomfortable to have their child partially named after another man his mother loved. The girlfriend suggests reclassifying the ex as a friend, but the author still refuses.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, it's about their emotional well-being and the potential impact on their child. They might feel that the name could cause confusion or unnecessary emotional weight for the child later. It's a valid concern, as the child might grow up wondering about the significance of that name, especially if the ex is someone their mother had a serious relationship with.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's side is about honoring her deceased ex and the importance of family ties. She might feel that this is a meaningful way to remember someone who was significant to her and her family, even if they aren't in a relationship anymore. She might also feel that the author is overreacting, especially if they weren't together when the ex died, as she mentioned.\n\nThe key here is mutual respect and compromise. Both partners have valid feelings here. The author's discomfort is understandable because it's their child and they have the right to their feelings about the name. However, the girlfriend has her own reasons tied to her personal history and family connections.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a matter of perspective. The author isn't wrong for feeling uncomfortable and setting a boundary. It's important in a relationship to communicate boundaries. However, the girlfriend isn't wrong either in wanting to honor her ex. The problem arises if one partner is being dismissive of the other's feelings. Since the author is clear about their discomfort and refuses, but in a respectful way, it's more about whether they are being unreasonable. Since they have the final say in naming their child (as it's a joint decision), the author isn't in the wrong for not agreeing. The answer would likely be B (No), as the author is justified in their feelings and right to set that boundary.\n"
