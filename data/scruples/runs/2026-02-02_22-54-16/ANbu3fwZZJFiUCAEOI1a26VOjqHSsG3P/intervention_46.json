The other night when discussing names, she said she would like his middle name to be that of her ex, who died. Saying further that it would mean a lot to his family who she is still close with.\n\nI said that makes me really uncomfortable and don't want to do it. I don't want to tell people, especially my son, that he is partly named after another man who his mom loved before me. She said, \"why can't you say he is named after my friend who died? We weren't even together when he died\". I continued saying no to the name and that it feels pretty shitty to even be asked to name him that. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong. The situation involves a couple expecting a child, and the girlfriend wants to name their son's middle name after her ex who died. The author is against it and feels uncomfortable because it's the ex's name, even though the ex is dead and they weren't together when he died.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the perspectives here. The girlfriend wants to honor her ex's family by using his name as the middle name. She might see it as a way to remember a friend who is no longer around and keep his memory alive, especially if her family is still close to his. On the other hand, the author is uncomfortable with the idea because it might make him feel like his son is partially named after someone else he loved before him. Even though the ex is deceased, the author's feelings are valid because he might worry about how it affects their son in the future or how it makes him feel as a parent.\n\nI should think about the dynamics of their relationship. They are in a new relationship, and naming a child is a significant decision that both partners should agree on. The author's discomfort is understandable. If the girlfriend is pushing for this name, it could create tension between them. The author has a right to his feelings about this matter. At the same time, the girlfriend is trying to honor someone important to her, which is also a valid perspective.\n\nThe key point here is mutual respect and compromise. If the author is genuinely uncomfortable, he has a right to express that. However, the girlfriend's request isn't necessarily unreasonable. The question is whether the author is wrong for not wanting to comply. The answer might depend on whether there's room for negotiation. If the author is willing to discuss other options or compromises, that's a good step. But if he's outright refusing without understanding her reasons, that could be an issue. However, in this case, he did explain his feelings and stands by his decision, which is his right. It's a personal choice, and both parties need to find a middle ground. Since the author is asserting his feelings and not being disrespectful, he might not be in the wrong. The girlfriend might need to consider his feelings as well. So, the answer is B\u2014Not the author's fault.\n"
