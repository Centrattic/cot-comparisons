The other night when discussing names, she said she would like his middle name to be that of her ex, who died. Saying further that it would mean a lot to his family who she is still close with.\n\nI said that makes me really uncomfortable and don't want to do it. I don't want to tell people, especially my son, that he is partly named after another man who his mom loved before me. She said, \"why can't you say he is named after my friend who died? We weren't even together when he died\". I continued saying no to the name and that it feels pretty shitty to even be asked to name him that. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to name his son after the girlfriend's ex, who died. The girlfriend wants the middle name for the ex, citing that it's important to her family and the ex was a friend (though they weren't together when he died). The author feels uncomfortable because he doesn't want his son to be named after someone the mother loved before him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the perspectives. The author is the father-to-be, and maybe the ex was someone who had a significant relationship with the mother. Even if they weren't together when the ex died, the fact that the ex was a previous partner might still make the author uncomfortable. The mother feels it's important to honor her friend's memory and her family's wishes. \n\nFrom the author's side, it's about feeling like he's being asked to include someone else in his child's name, which could lead to questions or explanations later. He might also be concerned about how it affects his relationship with his girlfriend or the child. From the mother's side, it's about honoring a deceased friend and maintaining family ties, which she sees as important.\n\nLegally, in many places, both parents have the right to choose the child's name, but it's a shared decision. Emotionally, it's about respect and mutual compromise. The author is expressing his discomfort, which is valid. The mother is expressing her desire to honor someone, which is also valid. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, he's standing up for his own feelings, which is reasonable. However, he might need to consider the mother's reasons and see if there's a middle ground. But the question is whether he's in the wrong. Since he's not being rude or unreasonable in his stance, just expressing his discomfort, it's more of a valid difference in opinion. So the answer might be B, he's not in the wrong.\n"
