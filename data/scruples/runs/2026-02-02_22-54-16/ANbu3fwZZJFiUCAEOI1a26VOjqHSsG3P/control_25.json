I don't want to tell people, especially my son, that he is partly named after another man who his mom loved before me. She said, \"why can't you say he is named after my friend who died? We weren't even together when he died\". I continued saying no to the name and that it feels pretty shitty to even be asked to name him that. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about naming their son's middle name after the girlfriend's ex who died. The girlfriend wants to do this because it's important to her and her family, but the author is really uncomfortable with the idea.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The girlfriend's ex is deceased, and she wants to honor him, maybe for family reasons. She argues that they weren't together when he died and that he was just a friend. The author feels it's uncomfortable because he doesn't want the child to be partly named after someone the mother loved before him. That makes sense because it might cause jealousy or confusion later.\n\nOn the other hand, the author has the right to be uncomfortable about this. Naming a child is a significant decision and a shared responsibility between the parents. If one parent is strongly against it, there should be mutual respect. The girlfriend is suggesting something that the author finds \"shitty\" to even be asked, so there's a valid emotional response there.\n\nThe key points here are consent and mutual agreement. The author is not wrong to express his feelings and set boundaries. The girlfriend might be overstepping by pushing for a name that causes discomfort. However, it's also about the child's name and what's best for their family. The author isn't being unreasonable by refusing something that makes him feel this way.\n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the author's refusal is valid. Since both parents have a say, and the author isn't being hostile but rather respectful in his refusal, he's not in the wrong. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
