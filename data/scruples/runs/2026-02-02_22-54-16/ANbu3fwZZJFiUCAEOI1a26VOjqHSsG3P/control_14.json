Saying further that it would mean a lot to his family who she is still close with.\n\nI said that makes me really uncomfortable and don't want to do it. I don't want to tell people, especially my son, that he is partly named after another man who his mom loved before me. She said, \"why can't you say he is named after my friend who died? We weren't even together when he died\". I continued saying no to the name and that it feels pretty shitty to even be asked to name him that. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to name their son after the girlfriend's ex. So the situation is that the girlfriend wants the middle name to be her ex's name, who died. The author is uncomfortable with that because it feels like their son is partly named after someone else the mom loved before him. The girlfriend argues that the ex was a friend and they weren't even together when he died.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the emotional aspects. The author is the one expecting to be a parent, and the idea of their child being named after an ex, even a deceased one, could be sensitive. It's a big decision involving a family name and personal feelings. The girlfriend's side is that it's important to her family and she's still close with them, so maybe there's a family connection or tradition involved.\n\nBut then, the author's discomfort is valid. Naming a child after an ex, even a deceased friend, could cause complications later. The child might wonder why he's named after someone else's significant other. The author might feel that it's a personal boundary that's being crossed here. The girlfriend is pushing for it despite the author's clear discomfort, which could be seen as not respecting his feelings.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might be trying to honor her ex's memory and maintain family ties. If the ex was a friend and not in a current relationship, maybe the author's resistance is about something more than just the ex's name. But the key point is that the author is not happy with the suggestion and the girlfriend is not backing down.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. However, the author's feelings are valid. It's their child too, and they should have a say in the name. The girlfriend's insistence without considering the author's comfort might make her the one in the wrong here. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
