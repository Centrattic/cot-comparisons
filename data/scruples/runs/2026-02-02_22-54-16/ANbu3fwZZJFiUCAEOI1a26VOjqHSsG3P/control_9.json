The other night when discussing names, she said she would like his middle name to be that of her ex, who died. Saying further that it would mean a lot to his family who she is still close with.\n\nI said that makes me really uncomfortable and don't want to do it. I don't want to tell people, especially my son, that he is partly named after another man who his mom loved before me. She said, \"why can't you say he is named after my friend who died? We weren't even together when he died\". I continued saying no to the name and that it feels pretty shitty to even be asked to name him that. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for not wanting to name their son after the girlfriend's ex who has passed away. \n\nFirst, the girlfriend wants the son's middle name to be her ex's name because it's important to her and her family. The author is uncomfortable because it feels like the son is being named after someone the mom loved before him. The ex died, and the girlfriend argues he was more of a friend at the time of death.\n\nSo, the key points here are about comfort, respect for the past, and the significance of names. The author's main issue is emotional discomfort, not the relationship with the ex's family. The girlfriend's family still being close adds another layer, maybe pressure from them.\n\nI need to consider cultural aspects too. In some cultures, naming children after deceased relatives is common and a way to honor them. However, the author feels it's not right for their child to have that connection. The girlfriend is framing it as a friend, but the author still sees it as an ex, which is a sensitive issue.\n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong for objecting. Legally, parents can choose any name they want, but it's more about the relationship dynamics. The author has the right to their feelings here. However, the girlfriend's request is also about her emotional needs and honoring her past. \n\nThe author isn't being malicious; they just don't want their son to be partially named after a former lover. The girlfriend's argument that he was a friend is a point, but if the author is uncomfortable, that's valid. The ex's family being close might make it harder to refuse, but the couple should prioritize their own comfort.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Probably not. They have the right to express discomfort. However, the situation requires compromise. The answer might depend on whether the author is being unreasonable. Since the author clearly stated their feelings and the girlfriend is pushing despite that, the author isn't the asshole.\n"
