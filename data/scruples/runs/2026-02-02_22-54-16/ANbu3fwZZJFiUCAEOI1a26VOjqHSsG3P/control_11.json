The other night when discussing names, she said she would like his middle name to be that of her ex, who died. Saying further that it would mean a lot to his family who she is still close with.\n\nI said that makes me really uncomfortable and don't want to do it. I don't want to tell people, especially my son, that he is partly named after another man who his mom loved before me. She said, \"why can't you say he is named after my friend who died? We weren't even together when he died\". I continued saying no to the name and that it feels pretty shitty to even be asked to name him that. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to name their son after the girlfriend's ex. The situation is that the girlfriend wants the son's middle name to be her ex's name, who has passed away, because it's important to her family. The author finds this uncomfortable and refuses, while the girlfriend argues that they weren't together when the ex died and he was just a friend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical and emotional aspects. Naming a child is a big decision that affects both parents. The author's discomfort is valid because the ex is someone the mother had a past relationship with, which could complicate the child's understanding of their identity later. The girlfriend's ex is deceased, and she's close to his family, so her desire to honor him is understandable. However, the author has the right to feel that honoring another man's name in their child's name is uncomfortable, especially since it's a middle name which is more personal and enduring.\n\nI should also think about the dynamics here. The author is not the ex, so the decision should be mutual between the parents-to-be. The girlfriend might be trying to honor her past and family, but the author's feelings are equally important in this partnership. It's a matter of balancing respect for the past with the present relationship. The key here is mutual agreement. Since the author clearly expressed his discomfort and refused, it's not necessarily wrong for him to hold his stance, especially if he's the one who will have to live with the name as the child's father.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might feel that her family's wishes are being disregarded. But the author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing his own feelings in this situation. It's a personal choice, and both parents need to agree on the child's name. The fact that the ex is deceased and not part of the current relationship might tip the balance in the author's favor, as it's about the future child's identity and the parents' shared decision.\n\nSo, considering all angles, the author isn't in the wrong for not wanting to use the ex's name. It's a personal decision, and he has the right to refuse if it makes him uncomfortable. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
