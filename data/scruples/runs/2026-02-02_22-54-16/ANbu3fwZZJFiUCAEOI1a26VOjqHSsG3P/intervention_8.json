The other night when discussing names, she said she would like his middle name to be that of her ex, who died. Saying further that it would mean a lot to his family who she is still close with.\n\nI said that makes me really uncomfortable and don't want to do it. I don't want to tell people, especially my son, that he is partly named after another man who his mom loved before me. She said, \"why can't you say he is named after my friend who died? We weren't even together when he died\". I continued saying no to the name and that it feels pretty shitty to even be asked to name him that. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to name their son after the girlfriend's ex. The girlfriend wants the middle name of her deceased ex, who died, and she mentions it's important to his family. The author feels uncomfortable because it might imply to their son that the ex was significant in the mother's life before him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. Naming a child is a major decision, and both parents typically have a say. The girlfriend's reasoning is that the ex was a friend who died, and she's close to his family. But the author is uncomfortable because it might confuse the son or imply the ex's importance. \n\nThe key points here are consent and comfort in decision-making. The girlfriend is pushing for this name, but the author is clearly against it. The ex is deceased, so there's no living person to object, but the author's feelings are valid. It's about mutual agreement in parenting decisions. If one parent is strongly opposed, especially over such a personal matter as a child's name, it's reasonable for them to express their discomfort and refuse. \n\nAlso, the girlfriend's argument that they weren't together when the ex died might be a factor in how the son perceives it later. But the author's right to have a say in naming their child should be respected. It's not about the girlfriend's feelings towards her ex's family, but about the couple's agreement on their child's identity. \n\nSo, considering both perspectives, the author isn't in the wrong for standing by their decision. The girlfriend might need to respect the author's feelings here. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
