The other night when discussing names, she said she would like his middle name to be that of her ex, who died. Saying further that it would mean a lot to his family who she is still close with.\n\nI said that makes me really uncomfortable and don't want to do it. I don't want to tell people, especially my son, that he is partly named after another man who his mom loved before me. She said, \"why can't you say he is named after my friend who died? We weren't even together when he died\". I continued saying no to the name and that it feels pretty shitty to even be asked to name him that. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me break down the situation.\n\nThe author's girlfriend wants their son's middle name to be after her ex, who died. The ex's family is still close with her, and she says it would mean a lot to them. The author is uncomfortable with this because he doesn't want their son to be partly named after someone else he loved before. The girlfriend is trying to reframe it as a friend who died, not a romantic partner. He's saying \"no\" and feels bad even being asked.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The ex is deceased, which adds a layer of complexity. The girlfriend still has a connection with the ex's family, so maybe she feels a responsibility or emotional bond there. But the author is a new parent, and the idea of naming their child after someone he's not close with, especially a former partner, might cause jealousy or discomfort. \n\nIn many cultures, naming a child after an ex is frowned upon because it can imply that the ex still has a significant place in the parent's life. Even if the ex is deceased, the author might feel that the child is being tied to a past relationship. The girlfriend's argument is that they weren't together when the ex died and that she's close to the family. However, the author's feelings are valid. He's not wrong to feel that the child shouldn't have a middle name from someone else's past, especially if it's an ex. \n\nThe key points are mutual respect and communication. The author has a right to his feelings about the name. If the girlfriend is insistent and the author is uncomfortable, it's a matter of negotiation. There's no clear right or wrong here, but the author's perspective is understandable. The answer would likely be B, No, the author isn't in the wrong because it's about personal comfort and the child's identity. They need to find a compromise, but the author's refusal isn't unjustified.\n"
