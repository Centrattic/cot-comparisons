I don't want to tell people, especially my son, that he is partly named after another man who his mom loved before me. She said, \"why can't you say he is named after my friend who died?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves naming a child after the girlfriend's ex, who has passed away. The girlfriend wants the middle name to be that of her ex, especially since she's still close to his family. The author of the post is uncomfortable with this and refuses, feeling it's not right to name their son after someone else's ex, even if that person is deceased. The girlfriend argues that the ex was just a friend when he died, but the author still objects.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. I need to decide between A (Yes) or B (No). Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, naming a child is a significant decision that both parents usually have a say in. The author is asserting his discomfort and refusing, which is his right. On the other hand, the girlfriend has her reasons related to her relationship with the ex and her family's feelings. But the ex is deceased, and the author might feel it's unnecessary to honor someone who isn't a parent or a direct family member of the child. \n\nThe key points here are the author's emotional discomfort and the fact that the ex isn't a parent. The girlfriend is still close to the ex's family, which might be a factor. However, the author has the right to voice his feelings about naming his child. It's a personal choice, and neither parent is obligated to agree on every aspect, especially if it causes one of them distress. \n\nIn many cases, naming a child after a deceased parent is common, but this is a different scenario. The ex isn't a parent, and the author's objection is valid because it could lead to complications in the child's life, having a middle name that references someone else the mother loved. The girlfriend's argument that the ex was a friend might not hold weight if the author is uncomfortable. \n\nSo, considering the emotional impact on the author and the fact that naming a child involves mutual agreement, the author is not necessarily in the wrong for expressing his refusal. The answer is likely B (No).\n"
