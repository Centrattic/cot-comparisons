The other night when discussing names, she said she would like his middle name to be that of her ex, who died. Saying further that it would mean a lot to his family who she is still close with.\n\nI said that makes me really uncomfortable and don't want to do it. I don't want to tell people, especially my son, that he is partly named after another man who his mom loved before me. She said, \"why can't you say he is named after my friend who died? We weren't even together when he died\". I continued saying no to the name and that it feels pretty shitty to even be asked to name him that. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for not wanting to name their son after the girlfriend's ex. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The couple is expecting a child, and the girlfriend wants the son's middle name to be that of her ex, who has passed away. The author is uncomfortable with this idea because he doesn't want his son to be partly named after someone his mother loved before him. The girlfriend argues that the ex was just a friend at the time of his death and that it's meaningful to her family.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. I need to consider both sides. Naming a child is a significant decision, and both partners usually have strong opinions. The author's discomfort is valid because naming a child after an ex, even deceased, could lead to questions or feelings of insecurity. However, the girlfriend has her reasons, including family connections and honoring someone from her past.\n\nI should consider cultural norms around naming. In some cultures, naming after deceased relatives is common, but if the ex was not a close relative, it might be less so. The fact that the ex is dead complicates things, but the author's feelings are still important. The girlfriend's family's wishes might add pressure, but the child's future identity and the parents' mutual agreement should take precedence.\n\nThe key points are consent and mutual agreement in a relationship. Both partners should feel comfortable with major decisions like naming. The author's refusal isn't about the ex per se but about not wanting to honor him in that way. The girlfriend's argument that the ex was a friend might not alleviate the author's discomfort, as the emotional aspect remains.\n\nI think the author is justified in his feelings. It's his child too, and he shouldn't have to agree to something that makes him uncomfortable. The girlfriend might need to find another way to honor her ex without involving the child's name. So, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
