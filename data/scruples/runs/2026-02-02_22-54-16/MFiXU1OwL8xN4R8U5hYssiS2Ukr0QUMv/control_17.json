She eats lunch with us and hangs around before classes start, but that\u2019s it.  None of us hang out with her outside of school.  Mostly because she\u2019s very insulting, all the time.  It\u2019s seriously like she doesn\u2019t know how to have a conversation without shitting on someone.  She just says \u201cI\u2019m just being honest\u201d a lot. The problem is that she can\u2019t take a joke herself.  Even polite criticism pisses her off A LOT and makes shit super awkward.  My friends and I have talked about her and all of us are really sick of her, but no one has wanted to say anything because she blows stuff way out of proportion when it\u2019s about her.  \n\nToday at lunch though I had enough.  She was shit talking one of my friends for being really skinny.  \u201cAre you sure you\u2019re not trans?  I\u2019ve never heard of a guy being anorexic.\u201d  And then, \u201cIt\u2019s not attractive. Just being honest.\u201d   So I said, \u201cYou\u2019re not just being honest, you\u2019re being a bitch.\u201d  She asked me what my problem was, that she was just kidding.  And I was like, \u201cNo one thinks you\u2019re funny.  The only thing that\u2019s funny is that you of all people think you can talk shit about how other people look.  Take a look at yourself.\u201d  \n\nNo one else was saying anything. She got mad and told me to go fuck myself and got up and left.  I was feeling pretty good about the whole thing, but my one friend told me I went to far with her and should try to talk to her tomorrow.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for calling the girl a bitch when she was being insulting. The situation is that the girl is part of their group but not really friends, and she's always making others uncomfortable with her comments, claiming she's just being honest. The author snapped when she mocked a friend's body, retorting that she's not just honest but a bitch.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if the author overstepped. The girl's behavior is clearly problematic and hurtful. The author's friends are also tired of her but haven't spoken up. The author's response was direct and confrontational. The question is whether this response was justified or too harsh.\n\nOn one hand, calling someone a bitch is pretty harsh. It's a derogatory term and can come off as aggressive. The author might have escalated the situation. The girl did walk out, which could lead to further conflict. The friend's advice to talk to her the next day suggests that a more constructive approach might have been better.\n\nOn the other hand, the girl's behavior is hurtful and unkind. The author stood up for their friend, which could be seen as a positive. However, the method might not be the healthiest. The author's response might not teach the girl to be more considerate but instead make her defensive. Also, confronting someone in public like that can make them more resistant to change.\n\nSo, the author's intention was to stop the bullying, but the method was confrontational and possibly counterproductive. The answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong because of the harsh language and lack of a constructive approach, even though the underlying issue is valid. But there's also the aspect of defending a friend, which complicates things. I need to weigh the intent against the method. The friend's advice to talk later suggests a more measured approach would have been better.\n"
