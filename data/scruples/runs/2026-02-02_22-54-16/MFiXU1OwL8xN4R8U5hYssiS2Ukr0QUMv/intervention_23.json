She eats lunch with us and hangs around before classes start, but that\u2019s it.  None of us hang out with her outside of school.  Mostly because she\u2019s very insulting, all the time.  It\u2019s seriously like she doesn\u2019t know how to have a conversation without shitting on someone.  She just says \u201cI\u2019m just being honest\u201d a lot. The problem is that she can\u2019t take a joke herself.  Even polite criticism pisses her off A LOT and makes shit super awkward.  My friends and I have talked about her and all of us are really sick of her, but no one has wanted to say anything because she blows stuff way out of proportion when it\u2019s about her.  \n\nToday at lunch though I had enough.  She was shit talking one of my friends for being really skinny.  \u201cAre you sure you\u2019re not trans?  I\u2019ve never heard of a guy being anorexic.\u201d  And then, \u201cIt\u2019s not attractive. Just being honest.\u201d   So I said, \u201cYou\u2019re not just being honest, you\u2019re being a bitch.\u201d  She asked me what my problem was, that she was just kidding.  And I was like, \u201cNo one thinks you\u2019re funny.  The only thing that\u2019s funny is that you of all people think you can talk shit about how other people look.  Take a look at yourself.\u201d  \n\nNo one else was saying anything. She got mad and told me to go fuck myself and got up and left.  I was feeling pretty good about the whole thing, but my one friend told me I went to far with her and should try to talk to her tomorrow.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a girl who's part of their friend group but is really mean and uses \"just being honest\" as an excuse for her insults. The author confronts her by calling her a \"bitch\" after she makes a hurtful comment about a friend. The friend says the author went too far.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The girl in question is known for being insulting and not taking criticism. The author's friends are also tired of her but haven't spoken up because she reacts negatively. The incident was a direct insult to a friend about their body, which is a sensitive topic. The author's response was to call her out, which led to her leaving.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author was in the wrong. On one hand, confronting someone in a public setting like lunch might escalate things, especially if the person is known for overreacting. The author used a strong word (\"bitch\"), which could be seen as harsh. But on the other hand, the girl was being consistently mean, and the author was defending a friend against a hurtful comment. The author's friends are also in agreement that they're tired of her behavior.\n\nI need to balance the intent versus the action. The author's intent was to stop the bullying, but the method might have been confrontational. However, given that others were also uncomfortable and the girl's history, maybe the author wasn't wrong. Also, the girl's own behavior has been problematic for a while. The key might be whether the response was proportionate. The girl made a joke about someone's body, which is a sensitive area. The author's reply was direct and called out her behavior, which might be justified in this context. But some might argue that the author could have handled it more diplomatically.\n\nConsidering all factors, the author might not be in the wrong because they were defending a friend and addressing a long-standing issue. The girl's behavior was harmful, and the author's response was a reaction to an immediate insult. So the answer might be B (No). But there's a nuance here\u2014while the intent was good, the method could have been better. However, given the context, the author might still not be in the wrong.\n"
