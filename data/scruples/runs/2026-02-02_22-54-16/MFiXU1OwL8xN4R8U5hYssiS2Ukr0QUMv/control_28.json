She eats lunch with us and hangs around before classes start, but that\u2019s it.  None of us hang out with her outside of school.  Mostly because she\u2019s very insulting, all the time.  It\u2019s seriously like she doesn\u2019t know how to have a conversation without shitting on someone.  She just says \u201cI\u2019m just being honest\u201d a lot. The problem is that she can\u2019t take a joke herself.  Even polite criticism pisses her off A LOT and makes shit super awkward.  My friends and I have talked about her and all of us are really sick of her, but no one has wanted to say anything because she blows stuff way out of proportion when it\u2019s about her.  \n\nToday at lunch though I had enough.  She was shit talking one of my friends for being really skinny.  \u201cAre you sure you\u2019re not trans?  I\u2019ve never heard of a guy being anorexic.\u201d  And then, \u201cIt\u2019s not attractive. Just being honest.\u201d   So I said, \u201cYou\u2019re not just being honest, you\u2019re being a bitch.\u201d  She asked me what my problem was, that she was just kidding.  And I was like, \u201cNo one thinks you\u2019re funny.  The only thing that\u2019s funny is that you of all people think you can talk shit about how other people look.  Take a look at yourself.\u201d  \n\nNo one else was saying anything. She got mad and told me to go fuck myself and got up and left.  I was feeling pretty good about the whole thing, but my one friend told me I went to far with her and should try to talk to her tomorrow.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for telling the girl she's a bitch instead of just being honest. The situation is that the girl is part of their friend group but is constantly insulting others and claims she's just being honest. The author confronts her after she makes a hurtful comment about a friend's appearance.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The girl's behavior is ongoing, and others are also annoyed. The author felt it was time to call her out. The friend says the author went too far, but another part of the group agrees that they're sick of her. The key points are: the girl's behavior is hurtful, she doesn't take criticism well, and the author's response was direct but maybe harsh.\n\nThe question is about whether the author was wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). I should think about whether the author had the right to confront her in that way. The author's retort was to call her a bitch, which is a strong term. Even if the author's intention was to stop the girl from being mean, the method might have been confrontational, leading to the girl leaving and the situation becoming more awkward. However, the girl's behavior was also problematic. \n\nBut the issue here is about whether the author was wrong. In terms of conflict resolution, calling someone a bitch is not a constructive approach. It's a personal attack rather than addressing the behavior. The author could have addressed the behavior without attacking the person. So maybe the author is in the wrong because their response was not the best way to handle the situation, even if the girl's actions were wrong. Alternatively, some might argue that the author was standing up for their friend and the group's feelings, so they aren't in the wrong.\n\nI need to weigh the pros and cons. The girl's behavior is hurtful, but the author's response could escalate things. The friend's advice to talk to her tomorrow suggests that a more measured approach might be better. So, perhaps the answer is A, the author is in the wrong for using an aggressive response that might not resolve the issue and could make things worse. However, others might say that the author was justified in calling out the girl's behavior. But the problem is the method. The author should have addressed the behavior without personal insults. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
