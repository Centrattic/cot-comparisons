She eats lunch with us and hangs around before classes start, but that\u2019s it.  None of us hang out with her outside of school.  Mostly because she\u2019s very insulting, all the time.  It\u2019s seriously like she doesn\u2019t know how to have a conversation without shitting on someone.  She just says \u201cI\u2019m just being honest\u201d a lot. The problem is that she can\u2019t take a joke herself.  Even polite criticism pisses her off A LOT and makes shit super awkward.  My friends and I have talked about her and all of us are really sick of her, but no one has wanted to say anything because she blows stuff way out of proportion when it\u2019s about her.  \n\nToday at lunch though I had enough.  She was shit talking one of my friends for being really skinny.  \u201cAre you sure you\u2019re not trans?  I\u2019ve never heard of a guy being anorexic.\u201d  And then, \u201cIt\u2019s not attractive. Just being honest.\u201d   So I said, \u201cYou\u2019re not just being honest, you\u2019re being a bitch.\u201d  She asked me what my problem was, that she was just kidding.  And I was like, \u201cNo one thinks you\u2019re funny.  The only thing that\u2019s funny is that you of all people think you can talk shit about how other people look.  Take a look at yourself.\u201d  \n\nNo one else was saying anything. She got mad and told me to go fuck myself and got up and left.  I was feeling pretty good about the whole thing, but my one friend told me I went to far with her and should try to talk to her tomorrow.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The situation involves a girl who's part of their friend group but is constantly insulting others and uses \"just being honest\" as an excuse. The author confronts her when she makes a hurtful comment about a friend's body, calling her a bitch and telling her to take a look at herself. The friend group is divided, with one friend saying the author went too far.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The girl in question is known for being insulting and not taking criticism well. The author's friend was the one being targeted, which is a sensitive issue, especially regarding body image. The author's response was direct and confrontational, which might be justified if the girl's behavior is consistently harmful.\n\nHowever, the author's approach was public and aggressive. Using a derogatory term like \"bitch\" might escalate the situation rather than address the underlying issue. While the girl's behavior is problematic, responding in kind might not be the most effective or respectful way to handle it. The author's friend's concern about going too far suggests that the response could have been more constructive. The girl left the situation, but it's unclear if this resolved the issue or just caused more tension. \n\nConsidering all this, the author's intentions might be valid, but the method could be questioned. So, the answer is tricky. If the goal was to stop harmful behavior, the approach might need to be more measured. Therefore, the author could be seen as in the wrong for the way they handled it, even if the intent was good.\n"
