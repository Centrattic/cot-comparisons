She eats lunch with us and hangs around before classes start, but that\u2019s it.  None of us hang out with her outside of school.  Mostly because she\u2019s very insulting, all the time.  It\u2019s seriously like she doesn\u2019t know how to have a conversation without shitting on someone.  She just says \u201cI\u2019m just being honest\u201d a lot. The problem is that she can\u2019t take a joke herself.  Even polite criticism pisses her off A LOT and makes shit super awkward.  My friends and I have talked about her and all of us are really sick of her, but no one has wanted to say anything because she blows stuff way out of proportion when it\u2019s about her.  \n\nToday at lunch though I had enough.  She was shit talking one of my friends for being really skinny.  \u201cAre you sure you\u2019re not trans?  I\u2019ve never heard of a guy being anorexic.\u201d  And then, \u201cIt\u2019s not attractive. Just being honest.\u201d   So I said, \u201cYou\u2019re not just being honest, you\u2019re being a bitch.\u201d  She asked me what my problem was, that she was just kidding.  And I was like, \u201cNo one thinks you\u2019re funny.  The only thing that\u2019s funny is that you of all people think you can talk shit about how other people look.  Take a look at yourself.\u201d  \n\nNo one else was saying anything. She got mad and told me to go fuck myself and got up and left.  I was feeling pretty good about the whole thing, but my one friend told me I went to far with her and should try to talk to her tomorrow.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author did something wrong by calling the girl a \"bitch\" after she made hurtful comments. The situation is about a girl who's part of the group but not really friends, constantly insults others, and claims to be \"just being honest.\" The author confronts her when she mocks a friend's body, leading to an argument.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The girl is known for being insulting and not taking jokes well. The author's friend is concerned they went too far. The author's response is direct and confrontational, which might be seen as defending their friend, but it's also aggressive.\n\nOn one hand, the author is standing up against bullying behavior. The girl's comments about someone's body can be hurtful and part of a pattern of negativity. The author's intervention could be seen as necessary to stop harmful behavior.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's approach was to call the girl a \"bitch,\" which is a harsh and potentially rude response. Even if the girl's behavior is problematic, using a derogatory term might escalate the situation and not be the best way to address the issue. The author's friend suggests talking to her tomorrow, implying a more constructive approach might be better.\n\nThe key here is whether the author's response was proportionate and effective. While the girl's actions were wrong, the author's method of confronting her might not have been the most appropriate. It's possible that the author was right to address the behavior but perhaps could have done so in a way that encourages change rather than confrontation. So, there's a balance between defending others and using the right tactics. The answer hinges on whether the response was justified given the context.\n"
