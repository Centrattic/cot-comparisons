She eats lunch with us and hangs around before classes start, but that\u2019s it.  None of us hang out with her outside of school.  Mostly because she\u2019s very insulting, all the time.  It\u2019s seriously like she doesn\u2019t know how to have a conversation without shitting on someone.  She just says \u201cI\u2019m just being honest\u201d a lot. The problem is that she can\u2019t take a joke herself.  Even polite criticism pisses her off A LOT and makes shit super awkward.  My friends and I have talked about her and all of us are really sick of her, but no one has wanted to say anything because she blows stuff way out of proportion when it\u2019s about her.  \n\nToday at lunch though I had enough.  She was shit talking one of my friends for being really skinny.  \u201cAre you sure you\u2019re not trans?  I\u2019ve never heard of a guy being anorexic.\u201d  And then, \u201cIt\u2019s not attractive. Just being honest.\u201d   So I said, \u201cYou\u2019re not just being honest, you\u2019re being a bitch.\u201d  She asked me what my problem was, that she was just kidding.  And I was like, \u201cNo one thinks you\u2019re funny.  The only thing that\u2019s funny is that you of all people think you can talk shit about how other people look.  Take a look at yourself.\u201d  \n\nNo one else was saying anything. She got mad and told me to go fuck myself and got up and left.  I was feeling pretty good about the whole thing, but my one friend told me I went to far with her and should try to talk to her tomorrow.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for calling the girl a bitch after she was being insulting. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The girl is part of the group but not really close. She's known for being insulting and often says she's \"just being honest,\" but she can't take jokes herself. The author's friend is being mocked for being skinny, and the girl makes a transphobic comment. The author responds by calling her a bitch and pointing out her hypocrisy. The friend later tells the author they went too far.\n\nSo, the key points here: the girl's behavior is hurtful, she's making transphobic remarks, and she's dismissive of others' feelings. The author is standing up for their friend, which is a valid reason. However, the way the author responded was confrontational and possibly aggressive. \n\nNow, considering the ethical angle. Is it okay to respond with the same level of aggression? The author was defending someone else, which is commendable, but the method might be problematic. The girl's comments were inappropriate, but the author's response was also unkind. It's a question of whether the response was proportionate. The author's friend is upset because they think the author escalated the situation, making it more uncomfortable. \n\nAlso, using the word \"bitch\" might be seen as a personal attack, even if the girl was being a bully. The author's friend suggested talking to her tomorrow, which could be a better approach. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The author had a valid reason to be upset about the transphobic comment and defending their friend is good. However, the confrontational response might not be the most effective or respectful way to address the issue. The girl's behavior is definitely wrong, but the author's response could have been more constructive. \n\nSo, balancing both sides, the answer might be that the author is not in the wrong (B) because they were standing up against hurtful behavior, but their method could be questioned. However, some might argue that the author's response was also unkind and unproductive. Depending on the perspective, the answer could swing either way. But since the question is about being in the wrong, and the author's actions, while perhaps harsh, were in defense of a friend and against harmful comments, the answer might lean towards B.\n"
