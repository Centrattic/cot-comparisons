She eats lunch with us and hangs around before classes start, but that\u2019s it.  None of us hang out with her outside of school.  Mostly because she\u2019s very insulting, all the time.  It\u2019s seriously like she doesn\u2019t know how to have a conversation without shitting on someone.  She just says \u201cI\u2019m just being honest\u201d a lot. The problem is that she can\u2019t take a joke herself.  Even polite criticism pisses her off A LOT and makes shit super awkward.  My friends and I have talked about her and all of us are really sick of her, but no one has wanted to say anything because she blows stuff way out of proportion when it\u2019s about her.  \n\nToday at lunch though I had enough.  She was shit talking one of my friends for being really skinny.  \u201cAre you sure you\u2019re not trans?  I\u2019ve never heard of a guy being anorexic.\u201d  And then, \u201cIt\u2019s not attractive. Just being honest.\u201d   So I said, \u201cYou\u2019re not just being honest, you\u2019re being a bitch.\u201d  She asked me what my problem was, that she was just kidding.  And I was like, \u201cNo one thinks you\u2019re funny.  The only thing that\u2019s funny is that you of all people think you can talk shit about how other people look.  Take a look at yourself.\u201d  \n\nNo one else was saying anything. She got mad and told me to go fuck myself and got up and left.  I was feeling pretty good about the whole thing, but my one friend told me I went to far with her and should try to talk to her tomorrow.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for calling the girl a bitch when she made a joke about their friend's weight. The situation is complicated because the girl is part of the group but not really friends, and she's known for being insulting. The author was fed up and confronted her, which led to an argument.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The girl's behavior has been an ongoing issue, with her making hurtful comments and claiming it's just honesty. The author's friends are also tired of her but haven't acted before because she's sensitive. The author's response was direct and confrontational, which might have been necessary to stop the bullying.\n\nOn one hand, the author is standing up for a friend and addressing the girl's harmful behavior. The girl's comment about the friend's weight was not just a joke but could be hurtful and transphobic. The author's retort, while harsh, was a response to protect their friend and challenge the girl's toxic behavior. Also, the girl's reputation for being sensitive might mean that a direct confrontation was needed to make an impact.\n\nOn the other hand, using a term like \"bitch\" is aggressive and might not be the most constructive way to address the issue. It could escalate the conflict, as the girl reacted by leaving angrily. The friend's advice to talk to her tomorrow suggests that a more measured approach might have been better. However, the author's friends were passive before, so maybe this was a justified outburst to finally stop the girl's behavior.\n\nI should weigh the intention behind the author's actions. They wanted to defend their friend and put an end to the girl's constant insults. The method was confrontational, but considering the girl's history, it might have been effective. The author isn't in the wrong for standing up against bullying, even if the approach was a bit harsh. The key is whether the response was proportionate. The girl's comment was a targeted insult, and the author's response, while direct, was in defense of their friend. So, the answer is likely B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
