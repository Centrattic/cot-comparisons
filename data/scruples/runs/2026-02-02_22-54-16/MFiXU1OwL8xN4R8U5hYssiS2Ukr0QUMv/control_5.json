She eats lunch with us and hangs around before classes start, but that\u2019s it.  None of us hang out with her outside of school.  Mostly because she\u2019s very insulting, all the time.  It\u2019s seriously like she doesn\u2019t know how to have a conversation without shitting on someone.  She just says \u201cI\u2019m just being honest\u201d a lot. The problem is that she can\u2019t take a joke herself.  Even polite criticism pisses her off A LOT and makes shit super awkward.  My friends and I have talked about her and all of us are really sick of her, but no one has wanted to say anything because she blows stuff way out of proportion when it\u2019s about her.  \n\nToday at lunch though I had enough.  She was shit talking one of my friends for being really skinny.  \u201cAre you sure you\u2019re not trans?  I\u2019ve never heard of a guy being anorexic.\u201d  And then, \u201cIt\u2019s not attractive. Just being honest.\u201d   So I said, \u201cYou\u2019re not just being honest, you\u2019re being a bitch.\u201d  She asked me what my problem was, that she was just kidding.  And I was like, \u201cNo one thinks you\u2019re funny.  The only thing that\u2019s funny is that you of all people think you can talk shit about how other people look.  Take a look at yourself.\u201d  \n\nNo one else was saying anything. She got mad and told me to go fuck myself and got up and left.  I was feeling pretty good about the whole thing, but my one friend told me I went to far with her and should try to talk to her tomorrow.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a girl who's part of their friend group but is very insulting. The author snaps at her when she makes a joke about a friend's weight, calling her a \"bitch\" and pointing out that she's not being funny.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The girl is known for being insulting and not taking criticism well. The friends have discussed her but haven't confronted her because she reacts poorly. The author's outburst might have been a response to a specific incident that was hurtful. But was it justified?\n\nCalling someone a \"bitch\" is pretty harsh. Even if the girl's behavior was annoying, using such a term could escalate the situation. The author's friend thinks they went too far, which might indicate that while the girl's behavior is problematic, the response might not have been the best approach. The author did confront her, which is understandable, but the method might have made things worse instead of resolving the issue. It's a balance between standing up for a friend and handling it in a way that's constructive. The author might be in the wrong for the harsh language, even if the underlying issue is valid. So I think the answer is A, but I need to make sure.\n"
