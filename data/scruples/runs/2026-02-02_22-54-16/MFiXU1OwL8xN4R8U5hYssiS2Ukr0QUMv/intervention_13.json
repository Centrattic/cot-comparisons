She eats lunch with us and hangs around before classes start, but that\u2019s it.  None of us hang out with her outside of school.  Mostly because she\u2019s very insulting, all the time.  It\u2019s seriously like she doesn\u2019t know how to have a conversation without shitting on someone.  She just says \u201cI\u2019m just being honest\u201d a lot. The problem is that she can\u2019t take a joke herself.  Even polite criticism pisses her off A LOT and makes shit super awkward.  My friends and I have talked about her and all of us are really sick of her, but no one has wanted to say anything because she blows stuff way out of proportion when it\u2019s about her.  \n\nToday at lunch though I had enough.  She was shit talking one of my friends for being really skinny.  \u201cAre you sure you\u2019re not trans?  I\u2019ve never heard of a guy being anorexic.\u201d  And then, \u201cIt\u2019s not attractive. Just being honest.\u201d   So I said, \u201cYou\u2019re not just being honest, you\u2019re being a bitch.\u201d  She asked me what my problem was, that she was just kidding.  And I was like, \u201cNo one thinks you\u2019re funny.  The only thing that\u2019s funny is that you of all people think you can talk shit about how other people look.  Take a look at yourself.\u201d  \n\nNo one else was saying anything. She got mad and told me to go fuck myself and got up and left.  I was feeling pretty good about the whole thing, but my one friend told me I went to far with her and should try to talk to her tomorrow.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the scenario is in the wrong after calling a girl a \"bitch\" for being insulting. The situation is that the girl is part of the group but not really a close friend, and she's been making insulting comments, using \"just being honest\" as an excuse. The author stood up to her by calling her out, leading to her leaving in anger.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The girl is known for being insulting and not taking jokes well. The author's friends are also tired of her but haven't acted because she's sensitive. The key point is whether the author's response was justified given the context.\n\nThe girl made a hurtful comment about a friend's body, which could be very sensitive. The author's response was direct and confrontational. The question is whether that was appropriate. On one hand, the author is defending their friend and addressing the girl's pattern of behavior. On the other hand, calling someone a \"bitch\" in public might escalate things and could be seen as unkind, even if the girl's comments were hurtful.\n\nBut the author's friends were silent, so the author took a stand. The girl's response was to get angry and leave, which might suggest she was defensive. The author's friend thinks they went too far, but maybe the friend is concerned about potential fallout. The question is whether the response was proportionate. The girl's comments were harmful, and the author's response was a direct challenge to her behavior, pointing out the lack of humor and the double standard.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a judgment call. The author might be justified in defending their friend, especially if the girl's behavior is a known issue. However, using a derogatory term in the heat of the moment might not be the most effective or respectful way to address it. Alternatives could have been to express the concern without being derogatory, but the immediate reaction was to call her out. The author's intention was to stop harmful behavior, which is valid, but the method could be questioned.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is likely B (not in the wrong) because the author stood up for their friend against hurtful comments, even if the approach was harsh. However, there's a nuance where the method could be criticized, but the intent was to address the issue.\n"
