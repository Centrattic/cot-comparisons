She eats lunch with us and hangs around before classes start, but that\u2019s it.  None of us hang out with her outside of school.  Mostly because she\u2019s very insulting, all the time.  It\u2019s seriously like she doesn\u2019t know how to have a conversation without shitting on someone.  She just says \u201cI\u2019m just being honest\u201d a lot. The problem is that she can\u2019t take a joke herself.  Even polite criticism pisses her off A LOT and makes shit super awkward.  My friends and I have talked about her and all of us are really sick of her, but no one has wanted to say anything because she blows stuff way out of proportion when it\u2019s about her.  \n\nToday at lunch though I had enough.  She was shit talking one of my friends for being really skinny.  \u201cAre you sure you\u2019re not trans?  I\u2019ve never heard of a guy being anorexic.\u201d  And then, \u201cIt\u2019s not attractive. Just being honest.\u201d   So I said, \u201cYou\u2019re not just being honest, you\u2019re being a bitch.\u201d  She asked me what my problem was, that she was just kidding.  And I was like, \u201cNo one thinks you\u2019re funny.  The only thing that\u2019s funny is that you of all people think you can talk shit about how other people look.  Take a look at yourself.\u201d  \n\nNo one else was saying anything. She got mad and told me to go fuck myself and got up and left.  I was feeling pretty good about the whole thing, but my one friend told me I went to far with her and should try to talk to her tomorrow.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for calling the girl a bitch after she was being insulting. Let's break this down.\n\nFirst, the girl in question is part of their friend group but not really close. She's known for being insulting and using \"just being honest\" as a defense. The author got fed up when she mocked a friend's body, so he called her out.\n\nNow, the key points here: the girl's behavior is hurtful and repetitive. The author's response was direct and confrontational. The friend thinks he went too far. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nOn one hand, the girl's comments about someone's appearance are clearly hurtful and not justifiable as humor. The author stood up against that, which could be seen as standing up for his friend. But on the other hand, his response was aggressive. He called her a bitch, which is a harsh insult. Even if her behavior is bad, responding with similar aggression might escalate the situation and not address the root issue effectively.\n\nAlso, considering the girl's history of not taking criticism well, the author's approach might have been too confrontational. Maybe a different approach, like calmly pointing out the harm in her words without attacking her personally, could have been better. However, the author's intention was to stop the bullying, which is understandable.\n\nBut the problem is that the author's method might have been counterproductive. While defending his friend is commendable, the way he did it could have made her defensive and more hostile. The friend's suggestion to talk to her tomorrow implies that a more measured approach might be better.\n\nSo, balancing both sides: the girl's behavior is bad, but the author's response might have been too harsh. Therefore, the author could be in the wrong for the method, even if the intent was good.\n"
