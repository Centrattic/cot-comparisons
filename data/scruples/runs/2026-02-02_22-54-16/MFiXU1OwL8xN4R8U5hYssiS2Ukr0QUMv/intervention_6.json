She eats lunch with us and hangs around before classes start, but that\u2019s it.  None of us hang out with her outside of school.  Mostly because she\u2019s very insulting, all the time.  It\u2019s seriously like she doesn\u2019t know how to have a conversation without shitting on someone.  She just says \u201cI\u2019m just being honest\u201d a lot. The problem is that she can\u2019t take a joke herself.  Even polite criticism pisses her off A LOT and makes shit super awkward.  My friends and I have talked about her and all of us are really sick of her, but no one has wanted to say anything because she blows stuff way out of proportion when it\u2019s about her.  \n\nToday at lunch though I had enough.  She was shit talking one of my friends for being really skinny.  \u201cAre you sure you\u2019re not trans?  I\u2019ve never heard of a guy being anorexic.\u201d  And then, \u201cIt\u2019s not attractive. Just being honest.\u201d   So I said, \u201cYou\u2019re not just being honest, you\u2019re being a bitch.\u201d  She asked me what my problem was, that she was just kidding.  And I was like, \u201cNo one thinks you\u2019re funny.  The only thing that\u2019s funny is that you of all people think you can talk shit about how other people look.  Take a look at yourself.\u201d  \n\nNo one else was saying anything. She got mad and told me to go fuck myself and got up and left.  I was feeling pretty good about the whole thing, but my one friend told me I went to far with her and should try to talk to her tomorrow.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for calling a girl a \"bitch\" after she made insulting comments. The situation involves a girl who's part of their friend group but isn't really close. She's known for being insulting and saying she's \"just being honest.\" The author finally snaps when she makes a joke about a friend's body, telling her she's a bitch instead of just being honest. The friend thinks the author went too far, and the author is conflicted.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author did the wrong thing. Let me break it down. First, the girl has a history of making hurtful comments and not taking criticism. The author and friends are fed up. The trigger is the girl making a joke about a friend's body, which is a sensitive topic. The author confronts her, calling her a bitch, which is a strong term. The friend says it was too far, but others might see it as standing up for someone.\n\nOn one hand, the author was defending their friend and challenging the girl's behavior. On the other hand, using a derogatory term like \"bitch\" could be seen as aggressive and might not have resolved the issue constructively. The girl then left, and the situation became tense. The author's friend suggests talking to her tomorrow, which might be a better approach.\n\nBut considering the context of ongoing behavior, maybe the author felt justified. However, the method might not be the best. Instead of calling her a bitch, maybe addressing the behavior without the insult would have been better. The key points are the girl's history, the sensitive nature of the comment, and the author's response. So, is the author in the wrong? It's a judgment call. The answer could be B (not wrong) if we consider standing up for others, but A if the method was too harsh. I think the answer depends on whether the response was proportionate. Since the girl was being hurtful and the author was defending a friend, maybe B is the answer. But the use of a derogatory term complicates it. Hmm.\n"
