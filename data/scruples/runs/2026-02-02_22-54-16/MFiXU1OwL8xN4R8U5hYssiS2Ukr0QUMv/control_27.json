She eats lunch with us and hangs around before classes start, but that\u2019s it.  None of us hang out with her outside of school.  Mostly because she\u2019s very insulting, all the time.  It\u2019s seriously like she doesn\u2019t know how to have a conversation without shitting on someone.  She just says \u201cI\u2019m just being honest\u201d a lot. The problem is that she can\u2019t take a joke herself.  Even polite criticism pisses her off A LOT and makes shit super awkward.  My friends and I have talked about her and all of us are really sick of her, but no one has wanted to say anything because she blows stuff way out of proportion when it\u2019s about her.  \n\nToday at lunch though I had enough.  She was shit talking one of my friends for being really skinny.  \u201cAre you sure you\u2019re not trans?  I\u2019ve never heard of a guy being anorexic.\u201d  And then, \u201cIt\u2019s not attractive. Just being honest.\u201d   So I said, \u201cYou\u2019re not just being honest, you\u2019re being a bitch.\u201d  She asked me what my problem was, that she was just kidding.  And I was like, \u201cNo one thinks you\u2019re funny.  The only thing that\u2019s funny is that you of all people think you can talk shit about how other people look.  Take a look at yourself.\u201d  \n\nNo one else was saying anything. She got mad and told me to go fuck myself and got up and left.  I was feeling pretty good about the whole thing, but my one friend told me I went to far with her and should try to talk to her tomorrow.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that this girl is part of their friend group but is really insulting and uses \"just being honest\" as an excuse. The author snaps when she's making fun of a friend's appearance and calls her a bitch. The friend says the author went too far, and the author is now second-guessing.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The girl is known for being mean, and others are annoyed. The author's friend was targeted with a hurtful comment about being trans and anorexic. The author confronts her, which leads to the girl walking out. \n\nOn one hand, the author is standing up for their friend against bullying, which is a good thing. Calling someone out for being mean can be justified if it's to protect others. But on the other hand, the author's response was pretty harsh. They called her a bitch, which is a strong insult. Even if the girl deserved it, responding with aggression might not be the best approach, especially in a public setting like lunch where it could escalate tensions.\n\nThe friend's reaction is also important. The friend is concerned that the author went too far, which suggests that maybe the author could have handled it differently. The girl already has a history of getting upset over polite criticism, so a direct insult might have made things worse. The author's friend might be worried about the consequences, like further conflict or the girl retaliating.\n\nAlso, the author's comment about the girl's own appearance (\"Take a look at yourself\") could be seen as attacking her, which might have been more hurtful. This could make the situation more personal and less about stopping the bullying. \n\nSo, while the author had a valid reason to confront the girl for targeting their friend, the method used might have been too aggressive. Maybe a calmer approach, like addressing the behavior without the harsh language, could have been more effective. The author might have overreacted, leading to the girl feeling attacked and walking out. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The author was defending a friend, which is commendable, but the way they did it could be seen as excessive. The friend's concern that they went too far might be valid. So, the answer might be A (yes, the author is in the wrong) because the response was overly harsh and could have been handled more constructively.\n"
