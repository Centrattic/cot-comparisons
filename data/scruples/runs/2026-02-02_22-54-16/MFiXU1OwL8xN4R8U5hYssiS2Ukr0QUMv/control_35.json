She eats lunch with us and hangs around before classes start, but that\u2019s it.  None of us hang out with her outside of school.  Mostly because she\u2019s very insulting, all the time.  It\u2019s seriously like she doesn\u2019t know how to have a conversation without shitting on someone.  She just says \u201cI\u2019m just being honest\u201d a lot. The problem is that she can\u2019t take a joke herself.  Even polite criticism pisses her off A LOT and makes shit super awkward.  My friends and I have talked about her and all of us are really sick of her, but no one has wanted to say anything because she blows stuff way out of proportion when it\u2019s about her.  \n\nToday at lunch though I had enough.  She was shit talking one of my friends for being really skinny.  \u201cAre you sure you\u2019re not trans?  I\u2019ve never heard of a guy being anorexic.\u201d  And then, \u201cIt\u2019s not attractive. Just being honest.\u201d   So I said, \u201cYou\u2019re not just being honest, you\u2019re being a bitch.\u201d  She asked me what my problem was, that she was just kidding.  And I was like, \u201cNo one thinks you\u2019re funny.  The only thing that\u2019s funny is that you of all people think you can talk shit about how other people look.  Take a look at yourself.\u201d  \n\nNo one else was saying anything. She got mad and told me to go fuck myself and got up and left.  I was feeling pretty good about the whole thing, but my one friend told me I went to far with her and should try to talk to her tomorrow.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author did something wrong by calling a girl a \"bitch\" in response to her being insulting. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The girl is part of their group but not close friends. She's known for being insulting and using \"just being honest\" as an excuse. The author heard her making a hurtful comment about a friend's appearance and called her out. The friend got mad, left, and now the author is being told they went too far.\n\nSo, the key points are: the girl's behavior is consistently negative, the author stood up for their friend, but the response was confrontational. The question is whether that response was wrong.\n\nOn one hand, defending someone from hurtful comments is good. The author was protecting their friend from bullying. But on the other hand, the way they did it was direct and possibly escalated the situation. The girl might have felt attacked, leading her to leave. \n\nThe author's friend thinks they went too far. The girl also claims she was just joking, though her comments were mean. The author's response was public, which might have made her feel embarrassed and defensive. \n\nBut if the girl's behavior is a pattern and others are just as tired of it, maybe the author was right to stand up. However, the approach could have been better. Maybe a private conversation would have been more effective. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The intention was good, but the method might have been problematic. So, the answer might depend on whether the author's response was justified given the context. If the girl is used to being insulting and the author is trying to stop the behavior, maybe not in the wrong. But the harshness of the response could be seen as excessive. \n\nI think the answer leans towards B (not in the wrong) because they stood up for their friend against consistent negativity. But some might argue A because the confrontation could have been handled better. But given the user's perspective, the author is defending against a bully, so B might be more appropriate.\n"
