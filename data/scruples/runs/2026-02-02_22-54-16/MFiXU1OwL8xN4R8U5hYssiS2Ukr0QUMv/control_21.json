She eats lunch with us and hangs around before classes start, but that\u2019s it.  None of us hang out with her outside of school.  Mostly because she\u2019s very insulting, all the time.  It\u2019s seriously like she doesn\u2019t know how to have a conversation without shitting on someone.  She just says \u201cI\u2019m just being honest\u201d a lot. The problem is that she can\u2019t take a joke herself.  Even polite criticism pisses her off A LOT and makes shit super awkward.  My friends and I have talked about her and all of us are really sick of her, but no one has wanted to say anything because she blows stuff way out of proportion when it\u2019s about her.  \n\nToday at lunch though I had enough.  She was shit talking one of my friends for being really skinny.  \u201cAre you sure you\u2019re not trans?  I\u2019ve never heard of a guy being anorexic.\u201d  And then, \u201cIt\u2019s not attractive. Just being honest.\u201d   So I said, \u201cYou\u2019re not just being honest, you\u2019re being a bitch.\u201d  She asked me what my problem was, that she was just kidding.  And I was like, \u201cNo one thinks you\u2019re funny.  The only thing that\u2019s funny is that you of all people think you can talk shit about how other people look.  Take a look at yourself.\u201d  \n\nNo one else was saying anything. She got mad and told me to go fuck myself and got up and left.  I was feeling pretty good about the whole thing, but my one friend told me I went to far with her and should try to talk to her tomorrow.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author did the wrong thing here. So the situation is that the girl is part of their group but isn't really close friends. She's known for being insulting and always says she's \"just being honest,\" but she can't take jokes herself. The author's friend is being mocked about being skinny, and the author confronts the girl by calling her a bitch. The friend later says the author went too far.\n\nHmm, the girl was being mean and making offensive comments. The author stood up to her, which might be seen as defending their friend. But maybe the way they did it was too harsh? The author called her a bitch, which is pretty strong language. The girl then got upset and left. The friend is advising the author to talk to her tomorrow, maybe suggesting a more constructive approach.\n\nOn one hand, standing up to bullying is good, but using aggressive language might escalate things. The girl might not respond well to being called a bitch, even if her comments were hurtful. The author could have addressed the behavior without the personal attack. Also, since the girl is part of the group, creating tension might affect the whole group's dynamic. The friend's advice might be right in wanting to approach it more calmly. So maybe the author did go too far in their response, even if their intent was good. So answer A: yes, the author is in the wrong.\n"
