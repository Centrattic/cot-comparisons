She eats lunch with us and hangs around before classes start, but that\u2019s it.  None of us hang out with her outside of school.  Mostly because she\u2019s very insulting, all the time.  It\u2019s seriously like she doesn\u2019t know how to have a conversation without shitting on someone.  She just says \u201cI\u2019m just being honest\u201d a lot. The problem is that she can\u2019t take a joke herself.  Even polite criticism pisses her off A LOT and makes shit super awkward.  My friends and I have talked about her and all of us are really sick of her, but no one has wanted to say anything because she blows stuff way out of proportion when it\u2019s about her.  \n\nToday at lunch though I had enough.  She was shit talking one of my friends for being really skinny.  \u201cAre you sure you\u2019re not trans?  I\u2019ve never heard of a guy being anorexic.\u201d  And then, \u201cIt\u2019s not attractive. Just being honest.\u201d   So I said, \u201cYou\u2019re not just being honest, you\u2019re being a bitch.\u201d  She asked me what my problem was, that she was just kidding.  And I was like, \u201cNo one thinks you\u2019re funny.  The only thing that\u2019s funny is that you of all people think you can talk shit about how other people look.  Take a look at yourself.\u201d  \n\nNo one else was saying anything. She got mad and told me to go fuck myself and got up and left.  I was feeling pretty good about the whole thing, but my one friend told me I went to far with her and should try to talk to her tomorrow.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong here. The scenario is that someone called a girl a bitch for being insulting and not taking jokes. The girl was part of their friend group but not really close. She often makes hurtful comments and uses the \"just being honest\" excuse.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the context. The girl's behavior is described as consistently insulting and not taking criticism well. The author felt that her comments about a friend being skinny were hurtful and responded by calling her a bitch. The friend is now questioning if the author went too far.\n\nSo, the key points are: the girl's behavior was already problematic, the author's response was direct and confrontational, and the friend is concerned about escalating the situation. The author's intention was to stop the bullying, but using a harsh term like \"bitch\" might have been counterproductive. Even if the girl was being mean, the author's approach might have made things worse instead of resolving the issue. \n\nThe girl's reaction was to leave, and the friend suggests talking to her the next day. Maybe a more constructive approach would be to address the behavior calmly rather than attacking her character. The author's method could be seen as aggressive, even if the intent was to put a stop to the hurtful comments. \n\nAlso, considering that the girl is part of the group but not close, the author's public confrontation might have caused more tension. So, while the author's intention was to stand up for a friend, the method used could be seen as inappropriate. The friend's advice to talk to her the next day suggests that a more composed approach might have been better. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for responding with such a harsh term instead of addressing the issue more constructively.\n"
