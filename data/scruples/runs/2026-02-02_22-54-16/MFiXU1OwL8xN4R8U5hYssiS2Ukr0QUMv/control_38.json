She eats lunch with us and hangs around before classes start, but that\u2019s it.  None of us hang out with her outside of school.  Mostly because she\u2019s very insulting, all the time.  It\u2019s seriously like she doesn\u2019t know how to have a conversation without shitting on someone.  She just says \u201cI\u2019m just being honest\u201d a lot. The problem is that she can\u2019t take a joke herself.  Even polite criticism pisses her off A LOT and makes shit super awkward.  My friends and I have talked about her and all of us are really sick of her, but no one has wanted to say anything because she blows stuff way out of proportion when it\u2019s about her.  \n\nToday at lunch though I had enough.  She was shit talking one of my friends for being really skinny.  \u201cAre you sure you\u2019re not trans?  I\u2019ve never heard of a guy being anorexic.\u201d  And then, \u201cIt\u2019s not attractive. Just being honest.\u201d   So I said, \u201cYou\u2019re not just being honest, you\u2019re being a bitch.\u201d  She asked me what my problem was, that she was just kidding.  And I was like, \u201cNo one thinks you\u2019re funny.  The only thing that\u2019s funny is that you of all people think you can talk shit about how other people look.  Take a look at yourself.\u201d  \n\nNo one else was saying anything. She got mad and told me to go fuck myself and got up and left.  I was feeling pretty good about the whole thing, but my one friend told me I went to far with her and should try to talk to her tomorrow.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who told the girl she's being a bitch instead of just being honest is in the wrong. \n\nFirst, the context: the girl is part of the group but not a close friend. She's known for being insulting, uses \"being honest\" as an excuse, and can't take jokes. The author's friend was being body-shamed, and the author responded by calling her a bitch. The friend told the author to talk to her tomorrow.\n\nSo, the key points here. The girl's behavior is consistently negative and hurtful. She targets others, uses humor to mask insults, and gets defensive when criticized. The author's response was direct and confrontational, which might have been necessary because others didn't speak up. However, the author's tone was harsh, and while the girl's behavior is bad, the way the author addressed it could be seen as aggressive rather than constructive.\n\nOn one hand, defending a friend from body-shaming is commendable. On the other, calling someone a \"bitch\" in public could escalate the situation. The author might have wanted to put a stop to the hurtful comments, but the method might not have been the best approach. The friend's advice to talk to her tomorrow suggests that a more measured approach could help de-escalate things.\n\nAlso, the girl's history of not handling criticism well means that a direct confrontation might not be effective. The author might have been right to stand up for their friend, but the approach could be seen as too harsh, leading to the girl leaving without resolving the issue. So, while the intent was good, the method might be in question. Therefore, the author could be in the wrong for not handling it more diplomatically.\n"
