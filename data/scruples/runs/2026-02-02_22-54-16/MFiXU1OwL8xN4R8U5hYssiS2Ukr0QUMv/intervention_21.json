She eats lunch with us and hangs around before classes start, but that\u2019s it.  None of us hang out with her outside of school.  Mostly because she\u2019s very insulting, all the time.  It\u2019s seriously like she doesn\u2019t know how to have a conversation without shitting on someone.  She just says \u201cI\u2019m just being honest\u201d a lot. The problem is that she can\u2019t take a joke herself.  Even polite criticism pisses her off A LOT and makes shit super awkward.  My friends and I have talked about her and all of us are really sick of her, but no one has wanted to say anything because she blows stuff way out of proportion when it\u2019s about her.  \n\nToday at lunch though I had enough.  She was shit talking one of my friends for being really skinny.  \u201cAre you sure you\u2019re not trans?  I\u2019ve never heard of a guy being anorexic.\u201d  And then, \u201cIt\u2019s not attractive. Just being honest.\u201d   So I said, \u201cYou\u2019re not just being honest, you\u2019re being a bitch.\u201d  She asked me what my problem was, that she was just kidding.  And I was like, \u201cNo one thinks you\u2019re funny.  The only thing that\u2019s funny is that you of all people think you can talk shit about how other people look.  Take a look at yourself.\u201d  \n\nNo one else was saying anything. She got mad and told me to go fuck myself and got up and left.  I was feeling pretty good about the whole thing, but my one friend told me I went to far with her and should try to talk to her tomorrow.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking whether the person who told the girl she's being a \"bitch\" instead of just being honest is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the context: The girl in question is part of the group but not close friends. She's known for being insulting without realizing it, often using \"just being honest\" as an excuse. She can't take criticism and gets defensive. The author's friend was mocked for being skinny, and the author snapped back.\n\nThe key points here are intent and proportionality. The girl's comments were about body-shaming, which is a sensitive issue. The author called her out directly, which could be seen as defending their friend. However, using the term \"bitch\" is harsh. The author's friend suggested they went too far, which is a common reaction when someone uses aggressive language even if the underlying issue is valid.\n\nThe author argues that the girl can't take jokes and is harmful. But responding with strong language might escalate the situation. Even if the girl is insufferable, the author's response could be seen as unconstructive. The friend's advice to talk tomorrow suggests a more measured approach might be better.\n\nSo, while the girl's behavior is problematic, the author's response might not be the most effective way to address it. The line between standing up to someone and becoming part of the problem can be thin here. So, maybe the author did overstep, making them partially at fault. Answer A.\n"
