She eats lunch with us and hangs around before classes start, but that\u2019s it.  None of us hang out with her outside of school.  Mostly because she\u2019s very insulting, all the time.  It\u2019s seriously like she doesn\u2019t know how to have a conversation without shitting on someone.  She just says \u201cI\u2019m just being honest\u201d a lot. The problem is that she can\u2019t take a joke herself.  Even polite criticism pisses her off A LOT and makes shit super awkward.  My friends and I have talked about her and all of us are really sick of her, but no one has wanted to say anything because she blows stuff way out of proportion when it\u2019s about her.  \n\nToday at lunch though I had enough.  She was shit talking one of my friends for being really skinny.  \u201cAre you sure you\u2019re not trans?  I\u2019ve never heard of a guy being anorexic.\u201d  And then, \u201cIt\u2019s not attractive. Just being honest.\u201d   So I said, \u201cYou\u2019re not just being honest, you\u2019re being a bitch.\u201d  She asked me what my problem was, that she was just kidding.  And I was like, \u201cNo one thinks you\u2019re funny.  The only thing that\u2019s funny is that you of all people think you can talk shit about how other people look.  Take a look at yourself.\u201d  \n\nNo one else was saying anything. She got mad and told me to go fuck myself and got up and left.  I was feeling pretty good about the whole thing, but my one friend told me I went to far with her and should try to talk to her tomorrow.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a girl who's part of the group but not really friends with the main character. She's known for being insulting and uses \"I'm just being honest\" as an excuse. The main character snaps when she insults a friend about being skinny, calling her a bitch and telling her to look at herself. Now, a friend says the author went too far.\n\nHmm, so the key points here are about whether the response was appropriate. The girl in question is constantly putting others down, which is rude and hurtful. The main character confronts her, using strong language. The question is whether that confrontation was justified or if it crossed a line.\n\nFirst, the girl's behavior is problematic. She targets others' appearances and uses humor as a defense. The main character's friends are also tired of her but haven't acted. The author's response was direct and confrontational but perhaps not the most constructive. Insulting someone in return can escalate conflict, especially if the person isn't receptive to feedback. The girl got defensive and left, which might lead to a worse situation. However, the author was standing up for their friend, which is understandable. \n\nBut the method used\u2014calling her a bitch and attacking her appearance\u2014might not be the best approach. It could be seen as responding with the same level of meanness, which might not resolve the issue. The friend's advice to talk to her tomorrow suggests that a calmer, more constructive dialogue might be better. The author's actions might have been justified in defending their friend, but the manner could be improved. So, the answer might be A (in the wrong) because while the intent was good, the response was harsh and could have been handled more effectively without escalating the conflict. Alternatively, B (not in the wrong) if we consider defending against hurtful behavior. But since the response was confrontational and not respectful, maybe A is the answer.\n"
