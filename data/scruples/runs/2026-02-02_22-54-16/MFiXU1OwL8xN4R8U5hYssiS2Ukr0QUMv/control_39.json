She eats lunch with us and hangs around before classes start, but that\u2019s it.  None of us hang out with her outside of school.  Mostly because she\u2019s very insulting, all the time.  It\u2019s seriously like she doesn\u2019t know how to have a conversation without shitting on someone.  She just says \u201cI\u2019m just being honest\u201d a lot. The problem is that she can\u2019t take a joke herself.  Even polite criticism pisses her off A LOT and makes shit super awkward.  My friends and I have talked about her and all of us are really sick of her, but no one has wanted to say anything because she blows stuff way out of proportion when it\u2019s about her.  \n\nToday at lunch though I had enough.  She was shit talking one of my friends for being really skinny.  \u201cAre you sure you\u2019re not trans?  I\u2019ve never heard of a guy being anorexic.\u201d  And then, \u201cIt\u2019s not attractive. Just being honest.\u201d   So I said, \u201cYou\u2019re not just being honest, you\u2019re being a bitch.\u201d  She asked me what my problem was, that she was just kidding.  And I was like, \u201cNo one thinks you\u2019re funny.  The only thing that\u2019s funny is that you of all people think you can talk shit about how other people look.  Take a look at yourself.\u201d  \n\nNo one else was saying anything. She got mad and told me to go fuck myself and got up and left.  I was feeling pretty good about the whole thing, but my one friend told me I went to far with her and should try to talk to her tomorrow.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for calling the girl a bitch after she made hurtful comments. The situation is a bit complex.\n\nFirst, the girl in question is part of the group but not a close friend. She often insults others and claims she's \"just being honest,\" but she can't take jokes herself. The author and friends are tired of her behavior. In this instance, the girl made a joke about a friend being skinny, which was clearly mean. The author retorts by calling her a bitch and points out her hypocrisy.\n\nNow, the key points here are about the appropriateness of the author's response. On one hand, the girl was being cruel, and the author is defending their friend. Standing up against bullying or hurtful comments can be seen as justified. On the other hand, the author's response was direct and confrontational, using a harsh term which might escalate the situation. The friend's advice to talk to her tomorrow suggests that a more constructive approach might be better.\n\nBut the girl has a history of being rude and not taking criticism well. The author might have felt that a direct approach was necessary since others weren't addressing it. However, the method of calling her a bitch could be seen as unprofessional or aggressive, even if the intent was good. The line between defending someone and becoming part of the problem is thin here.\n\nConsidering the context, the author's intentions were to stop the girl's behavior, but the method might not have been the most effective. It's possible that the author is in the wrong because the response could have been more constructive, even if the initial provocation was bad. Alternatively, if the girl's behavior is ongoing and toxic, the author's reaction could be seen as justified in defending their friend and group.\n"
