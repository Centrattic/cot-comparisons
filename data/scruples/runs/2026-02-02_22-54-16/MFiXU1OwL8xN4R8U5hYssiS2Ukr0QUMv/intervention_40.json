She eats lunch with us and hangs around before classes start, but that\u2019s it.  None of us hang out with her outside of school.  Mostly because she\u2019s very insulting, all the time.  It\u2019s seriously like she doesn\u2019t know how to have a conversation without shitting on someone.  She just says \u201cI\u2019m just being honest\u201d a lot. The problem is that she can\u2019t take a joke herself.  Even polite criticism pisses her off A LOT and makes shit super awkward.  My friends and I have talked about her and all of us are really sick of her, but no one has wanted to say anything because she blows stuff way out of proportion when it\u2019s about her.  \n\nToday at lunch though I had enough.  She was shit talking one of my friends for being really skinny.  \u201cAre you sure you\u2019re not trans?  I\u2019ve never heard of a guy being anorexic.\u201d  And then, \u201cIt\u2019s not attractive. Just being honest.\u201d   So I said, \u201cYou\u2019re not just being honest, you\u2019re being a bitch.\u201d  She asked me what my problem was, that she was just kidding.  And I was like, \u201cNo one thinks you\u2019re funny.  The only thing that\u2019s funny is that you of all people think you can talk shit about how other people look.  Take a look at yourself.\u201d  \n\nNo one else was saying anything. She got mad and told me to go fuck myself and got up and left.  I was feeling pretty good about the whole thing, but my one friend told me I went to far with her and should try to talk to her tomorrow.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a girl who's part of their friend group but is known for being insulting and not taking jokes well. The author confronts her after she makes a hurtful comment about a friend's body, calling her a \"bitch\" and telling her to look at herself.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate both sides. On one hand, the girl in question is described as constantly being insulting and not taking criticism well. The author and their friends are clearly frustrated. The comment about the friend's body is specific and could be hurtful. The author's response is direct and confrontational, which might be justified given the girl's history.\n\nOn the other hand, responding with strong language like \"bitch\" and telling her to take a look at herself might be seen as aggressive. The fact that the girl left and the author's friend is now upset could indicate that the confrontation escalated the situation. The author's friend thinks they went too far, suggesting that maybe a different approach could have been better, like a private conversation instead of a public confrontation.\n\nThe key points are whether the author's response was proportional to the situation. The girl was being cruel, but the author's response was public and harsh. While the girl's behavior was problematic, the author's method of addressing it might have been counterproductive. Public shaming can backfire, especially if the person is sensitive to criticism. The author might have aimed to stop the bullying but could have used a calmer approach to address the issue without escalating tensions.\n\nAlso, the fact that the author's friend is now concerned and suggests talking to her tomorrow implies that the immediate confrontation might not have been the best strategy. Maybe the author could have handled it in a way that de-escalates the situation, like addressing the girl privately or not engaging in the moment to avoid making it worse.\n\nIn conclusion, while the girl's behavior was indeed hurtful, the author's public and confrontational response might not be the most effective or appropriate way to address the issue. Therefore, the author could be considered in the wrong for handling the situation poorly, even if their intentions were good.\n"
