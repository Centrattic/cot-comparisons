She eats lunch with us and hangs around before classes start, but that\u2019s it.  None of us hang out with her outside of school.  Mostly because she\u2019s very insulting, all the time.  It\u2019s seriously like she doesn\u2019t know how to have a conversation without shitting on someone.  She just says \u201cI\u2019m just being honest\u201d a lot. The problem is that she can\u2019t take a joke herself.  Even polite criticism pisses her off A LOT and makes shit super awkward.  My friends and I have talked about her and all of us are really sick of her, but no one has wanted to say anything because she blows stuff way out of proportion when it\u2019s about her.  \n\nToday at lunch though I had enough.  She was shit talking one of my friends for being really skinny.  \u201cAre you sure you\u2019re not trans?  I\u2019ve never heard of a guy being anorexic.\u201d  And then, \u201cIt\u2019s not attractive. Just being honest.\u201d   So I said, \u201cYou\u2019re not just being honest, you\u2019re being a bitch.\u201d  She asked me what my problem was, that she was just kidding.  And I was like, \u201cNo one thinks you\u2019re funny.  The only thing that\u2019s funny is that you of all people think you can talk shit about how other people look.  Take a look at yourself.\u201d  \n\nNo one else was saying anything. She got mad and told me to go fuck myself and got up and left.  I was feeling pretty good about the whole thing, but my one friend told me I went to far with her and should try to talk to her tomorrow.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author of the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a girl who's part of the group but not really friends. She's known for being insulting and using \"just being honest\" as an excuse. The author confronts her after she mocks a friend's weight, calling her a bitch and pointing out her own behavior. The friend says the author went too far.\n\nSo, the key points here: the girl is hurtful, uses humor as an excuse, and the author stood up to her. The question is whether the author's response was appropriate. \n\nFirst, defending a friend from bullying is a good thing. But the method used was direct and confrontational. The girl had a history of being a jerk, so maybe the author felt justified. However, calling someone a \"bitch\" is pretty harsh. It's a derogatory term and could be seen as just as unkind as the girl's comments. \n\nThe group was uncomfortable with her behavior but didn't act before. Now the author took a stand, but maybe the friend's reaction is because it could escalate the situation. The girl might react more negatively, and the author might have made things worse. \n\nOn the other hand, the girl was being mean, and the author's comment was a response to that. The author might be right in pointing out the hypocrisy. However, the use of a derogatory term might not be the best approach. Sometimes, responding with similar harshness can make things worse, even if the intent is good. \n\nAlso, the fact that the group didn't want to confront her before might mean they didn't want to start a conflict. The author's action could have unintended consequences, like making the girl even more defensive. But the fact that the girl left and the author felt good might suggest that it was a necessary confrontation. \n\nSo, the answer isn't clear-cut. It depends on perspective. If the author's actions stopped the bullying and made a point, maybe it's justified. But if it led to more conflict without resolving the issue, maybe the author overreacted. The friend's advice to talk to her tomorrow might be a better approach. Therefore, the author might be in the right for standing up for their friend but in the wrong for the harsh language. But since the options are A or B, the user wants a single answer. Considering that, maybe the answer is A (in the wrong) because the response was confrontational and used a derogatory term, which isn't the most constructive way to handle it. However, if the girl was being malicious, the author had a right to defend their friend. Hmm. It's a toss-up. But I think the better answer is A because the method was inappropriate even if the intent was good.\n"
