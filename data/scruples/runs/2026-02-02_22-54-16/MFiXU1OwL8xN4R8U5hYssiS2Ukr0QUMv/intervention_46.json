She eats lunch with us and hangs around before classes start, but that\u2019s it.  None of us hang out with her outside of school.  Mostly because she\u2019s very insulting, all the time.  It\u2019s seriously like she doesn\u2019t know how to have a conversation without shitting on someone.  She just says \u201cI\u2019m just being honest\u201d a lot. The problem is that she can\u2019t take a joke herself.  Even polite criticism pisses her off A LOT and makes shit super awkward.  My friends and I have talked about her and all of us are really sick of her, but no one has wanted to say anything because she blows stuff way out of proportion when it\u2019s about her.  \n\nToday at lunch though I had enough.  She was shit talking one of my friends for being really skinny.  \u201cAre you sure you\u2019re not trans?  I\u2019ve never heard of a guy being anorexic.\u201d  And then, \u201cIt\u2019s not attractive. Just being honest.\u201d   So I said, \u201cYou\u2019re not just being honest, you\u2019re being a bitch.\u201d  She asked me what my problem was, that she was just kidding.  And I was like, \u201cNo one thinks you\u2019re funny.  The only thing that\u2019s funny is that you of all people think you can talk shit about how other people look.  Take a look at yourself.\u201d  \n\nNo one else was saying anything. She got mad and told me to go fuck myself and got up and left.  I was feeling pretty good about the whole thing, but my one friend told me I went to far with her and should try to talk to her tomorrow.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that there's a girl who's part of their school group but not really friends outside. She's known for being insulting and says she's \"just being honest,\" but she can't take jokes herself. The author is called her a bitch for making fun of a friend for being skinny. The author's friend says they went too far, but the author feels justified.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The girl's behavior is consistently hurtful, and she uses \"just being honest\" as an excuse. The author stood up for their friend by calling her out. But was that the right approach? The key points here are the girl's history of being mean and the author's response. \n\nOn one hand, the author is defending their friend and putting a stop to the bullying. That's understandable. But on the other hand, calling someone a bitch in public might escalate the situation. The girl might feel attacked, especially since she's the type to overreact. The author might have wanted to stop the insults, but using a harsh insult could have made it worse, leading to the girl walking out and the situation becoming more awkward. \n\nAlso, there's a question of how to handle someone who is both hurtful and sensitive. The author's friend suggested talking to her later, which might be a more constructive approach. However, in the moment, the author might have felt that a direct response was necessary to stop the bullying. \n\nBut is calling someone a bitch a valid response? It's a personal attack rather than addressing the behavior. Maybe the author could have said something like, \"That's not funny,\" or told the girl to stop, without the insult. The problem is that the girl's behavior is toxic, but responding with a similar harshness might not be the best solution. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author had a point in standing up for their friend, but the method might have been inappropriate. The girl's behavior is wrong, but the author could have addressed it without using a derogatory term. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for the choice of words, even if the intent was good. But some might argue that in the context of her constant insults, the author had the right to push back. It's a tricky situation where the intent is good but the execution could be better.\n"
