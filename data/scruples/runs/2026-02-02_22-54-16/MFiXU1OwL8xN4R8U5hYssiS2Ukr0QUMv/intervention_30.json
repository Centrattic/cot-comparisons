She eats lunch with us and hangs around before classes start, but that\u2019s it.  None of us hang out with her outside of school.  Mostly because she\u2019s very insulting, all the time.  It\u2019s seriously like she doesn\u2019t know how to have a conversation without shitting on someone.  She just says \u201cI\u2019m just being honest\u201d a lot. The problem is that she can\u2019t take a joke herself.  Even polite criticism pisses her off A LOT and makes shit super awkward.  My friends and I have talked about her and all of us are really sick of her, but no one has wanted to say anything because she blows stuff way out of proportion when it\u2019s about her.  \n\nToday at lunch though I had enough.  She was shit talking one of my friends for being really skinny.  \u201cAre you sure you\u2019re not trans?  I\u2019ve never heard of a guy being anorexic.\u201d  And then, \u201cIt\u2019s not attractive. Just being honest.\u201d   So I said, \u201cYou\u2019re not just being honest, you\u2019re being a bitch.\u201d  She asked me what my problem was, that she was just kidding.  And I was like, \u201cNo one thinks you\u2019re funny.  The only thing that\u2019s funny is that you of all people think you can talk shit about how other people look.  Take a look at yourself.\u201d  \n\nNo one else was saying anything. She got mad and told me to go fuck myself and got up and left.  I was feeling pretty good about the whole thing, but my one friend told me I went to far with her and should try to talk to her tomorrow.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The situation involves a girl who's part of their friend group but is often insulting, and the author confronts her for being a \"bitch\" after she makes a joke about a friend's body. The author's friend thinks they went too far, but they feel justified.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The girl in question is known for being insulting and uses \"just being honest\" as an excuse. She's also not part of the core group, so maybe the author and friends feel she doesn't truly belong. The incident was about body shaming, which is a sensitive issue. The author called her out, which could be seen as standing up against bullying. However, the approach was direct and confrontational, using a harsh term. \n\nOn one hand, the author might be defending their friend from hurtful comments. On the other, confronting her in public with a derogatory term might have escalated the situation. The girl's reaction was to leave, which could be her way of avoiding conflict. The friend's advice to talk to her the next day suggests that a more constructive approach might be better. \n\nBut the girl's behavior is ongoing and harmful. If the group has tolerated it because she's sensitive, maybe the author was trying to put an end to it. However, the method could have been more effective. Public confrontation might not be the best way to address someone's behavior, especially if they don't take criticism well. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a toss-up. They had a valid reason to be upset, but their approach might not have been the most constructive. The answer could be B (not in the wrong) because they were addressing toxic behavior, but some might argue A because the response was harsh. Considering the context of ongoing issues and standing up against bullying, B makes sense here.\n"
