She eats lunch with us and hangs around before classes start, but that\u2019s it.  None of us hang out with her outside of school.  Mostly because she\u2019s very insulting, all the time.  It\u2019s seriously like she doesn\u2019t know how to have a conversation without shitting on someone.  She just says \u201cI\u2019m just being honest\u201d a lot. The problem is that she can\u2019t take a joke herself.  Even polite criticism pisses her off A LOT and makes shit super awkward.  My friends and I have talked about her and all of us are really sick of her, but no one has wanted to say anything because she blows stuff way out of proportion when it\u2019s about her.  \n\nToday at lunch though I had enough.  She was shit talking one of my friends for being really skinny.  \u201cAre you sure you\u2019re not trans?  I\u2019ve never heard of a guy being anorexic.\u201d  And then, \u201cIt\u2019s not attractive. Just being honest.\u201d   So I said, \u201cYou\u2019re not just being honest, you\u2019re being a bitch.\u201d  She asked me what my problem was, that she was just kidding.  And I was like, \u201cNo one thinks you\u2019re funny.  The only thing that\u2019s funny is that you of all people think you can talk shit about how other people look.  Take a look at yourself.\u201d  \n\nNo one else was saying anything. She got mad and told me to go fuck myself and got up and left.  I was feeling pretty good about the whole thing, but my one friend told me I went to far with her and should try to talk to her tomorrow.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a girl who's part of the group but not really close friends. She's known for being insultingly honest, and the author finally snaps when she makes a joke about a friend's body. The author calls her a bitch, which leads to an argument and her leaving. The friend says the author went too far.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The girl in question is a bit of a problem, making hurtful comments and not taking criticism well. The author's friends are also fed up but haven't addressed it before. The trigger here is when the girl makes a transphobic and body-shaming comment. The author responds by calling her a bitch and pointing out her hypocrisy.\n\nNow, the key points here are whether the response was justified. The girl's behavior is clearly hurtful and possibly transphobic, which is a serious issue. However, the author's response was direct and confrontational. While the girl's comments are problematic, the author's reply might not have been the best approach. Publicly calling someone a bitch and attacking their self-image could escalate the situation instead of resolving it. \n\nThe author's friend suggests talking to her tomorrow, which implies a more private and constructive approach. The author's action was a reaction in the heat of the moment, which might not be the most effective way to address the issue. Even if the girl deserves criticism, the method of confrontation could be seen as harsh and not conducive to change.\n\nBut then again, if the girl is making harmful comments and others are afraid to speak up, the author might feel a duty to intervene. However, using aggressive language might not be the right way to handle it. The line between standing up for someone and escalating conflict is thin here. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for trying to stand up against bullying, but the approach could be questioned. The problem is that the response might not have been productive. The author's friend's advice to talk to her tomorrow suggests a more constructive method. So, while the intent might be good, the method could be considered too harsh, making the author at least partially at fault for the escalation.\n"
