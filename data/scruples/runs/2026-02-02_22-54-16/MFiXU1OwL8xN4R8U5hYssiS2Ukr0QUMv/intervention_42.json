She eats lunch with us and hangs around before classes start, but that\u2019s it.  None of us hang out with her outside of school.  Mostly because she\u2019s very insulting, all the time.  It\u2019s seriously like she doesn\u2019t know how to have a conversation without shitting on someone.  She just says \u201cI\u2019m just being honest\u201d a lot. The problem is that she can\u2019t take a joke herself.  Even polite criticism pisses her off A LOT and makes shit super awkward.  My friends and I have talked about her and all of us are really sick of her, but no one has wanted to say anything because she blows stuff way out of proportion when it\u2019s about her.  \n\nToday at lunch though I had enough.  She was shit talking one of my friends for being really skinny.  \u201cAre you sure you\u2019re not trans?  I\u2019ve never heard of a guy being anorexic.\u201d  And then, \u201cIt\u2019s not attractive. Just being honest.\u201d   So I said, \u201cYou\u2019re not just being honest, you\u2019re being a bitch.\u201d  She asked me what my problem was, that she was just kidding.  And I was like, \u201cNo one thinks you\u2019re funny.  The only thing that\u2019s funny is that you of all people think you can talk shit about how other people look.  Take a look at yourself.\u201d  \n\nNo one else was saying anything. She got mad and told me to go fuck myself and got up and left.  I was feeling pretty good about the whole thing, but my one friend told me I went to far with her and should try to talk to her tomorrow.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this situation. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for calling the girl a \"bitch\" after she made a hurtful comment about a friend's body.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The girl in question is part of their group but not close friends. She's known for being insulting and uses \"just being honest\" as a defense. The author's friend was targeted with a transphobic comment about being anorexic, which is pretty harsh. The author responded by calling her a bitch, which led to the girl getting upset and leaving.\n\nNow, the key points here. The girl's behavior has been ongoing; she's consistently insulting others and doesn't take criticism well. The author's friends have been discussing her but no one else has confronted her. When the author finally speaks up, it's in response to a specific, hurtful comment. The author's intention was to defend their friend and point out the girl's insensitivity.\n\nBut is the author in the wrong for using harsh language? Well, the girl's comment was about body shaming, which is a sensitive and serious issue. The author's response was direct but might be seen as aggressive. However, given the context of her pattern of behavior, the author might feel justified in calling out her behavior as harmful, not just \"honest.\"\n\nOn the other hand, using a term like \"bitch\" could be seen as unprofessional or uncivil, even if the intent was to correct her. The friend's advice to talk to her the next day suggests that a calmer approach might have been better. The author's reaction, while understandable, might escalate the situation. However, the girl's own behavior in not taking responsibility and walking out complicates things.\n\nConsidering all this, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because they're standing up for their friend against harmful comments. Their approach might have been rough, but the intent was to address the ongoing issue. The girl's history of being dismissive and unkind plays a role here. So, the answer might lean towards B (No), but it's a nuanced situation where both parties have contributed to the conflict.\n"
