She eats lunch with us and hangs around before classes start, but that\u2019s it.  None of us hang out with her outside of school.  Mostly because she\u2019s very insulting, all the time.  It\u2019s seriously like she doesn\u2019t know how to have a conversation without shitting on someone.  She just says \u201cI\u2019m just being honest\u201d a lot. The problem is that she can\u2019t take a joke herself.  Even polite criticism pisses her off A LOT and makes shit super awkward.  My friends and I have talked about her and all of us are really sick of her, but no one has wanted to say anything because she blows stuff way out of proportion when it\u2019s about her.  \n\nToday at lunch though I had enough.  She was shit talking one of my friends for being really skinny.  \u201cAre you sure you\u2019re not trans?  I\u2019ve never heard of a guy being anorexic.\u201d  And then, \u201cIt\u2019s not attractive. Just being honest.\u201d   So I said, \u201cYou\u2019re not just being honest, you\u2019re being a bitch.\u201d  She asked me what my problem was, that she was just kidding.  And I was like, \u201cNo one thinks you\u2019re funny.  The only thing that\u2019s funny is that you of all people think you can talk shit about how other people look.  Take a look at yourself.\u201d  \n\nNo one else was saying anything. She got mad and told me to go fuck myself and got up and left.  I was feeling pretty good about the whole thing, but my one friend told me I went to far with her and should try to talk to her tomorrow.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for calling the girl a \"bitch\" when she was making hurtful comments. The situation is that the girl is part of their group, but she's really insulting a lot and uses \"just being honest\" as an excuse. The author snapped when she made a joke about a friend's body.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The girl's behavior has been ongoing\u2014constantly insulting others and not taking jokes well. The friends are all tired of her but avoid confrontation because she overreacts. The author decided to confront her after she targeted a friend's body image, which is a sensitive topic.\n\nThe key point here is whether the author's response was justified. The girl was being cruel, and the author called her out, which might be seen as defending their friend. However, the method used was to label her as a \"bitch,\" which is derogatory. The friend who told the author they went too far might be concerned about escalating the situation or making it personal.\n\nBut then again, the author's friends were also tired of her and the author might have felt it was necessary to stop the harmful behavior. The girl walked out, so maybe she didn't want to engage further. The question is whether the author's response was proportionate. The girl was making hurtful remarks, so the author's reaction could be seen as a form of standing up to her. However, using a harsh term like \"bitch\" might not be the best approach for constructive communication. \n\nThere's also the aspect of the girl's inability to take criticism. If the author had tried to address the behavior without attacking her personally, maybe it would have been more effective. But given the girl's history, she might not respond to a softer approach. The author's friends not saying anything suggests they might agree with the sentiment but didn't want to confront her. \n\nSo, weighing the pros and cons: the author acted because of the girl's hurtful comments, but the method was confrontational. It's a judgment call whether that's justified. Since the girl was being cruel, and the author's friends were also frustrated, the author might not be in the wrong. But the use of a derogatory term could be seen as the wrong approach. However, considering the context of ongoing issues, maybe it's not the author's fault. The answer might be B, but I should check if there's any other factors. The girl's comment about the friend's body is a serious issue, and the author intervened. So, probably B.\n"
