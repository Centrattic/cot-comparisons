She eats lunch with us and hangs around before classes start, but that\u2019s it.  None of us hang out with her outside of school.  Mostly because she\u2019s very insulting, all the time.  It\u2019s seriously like she doesn\u2019t know how to have a conversation without shitting on someone.  She just says \u201cI\u2019m just being honest\u201d a lot. The problem is that she can\u2019t take a joke herself.  Even polite criticism pisses her off A LOT and makes shit super awkward.  My friends and I have talked about her and all of us are really sick of her, but no one has wanted to say anything because she blows stuff way out of proportion when it\u2019s about her.  \n\nToday at lunch though I had enough.  She was shit talking one of my friends for being really skinny.  \u201cAre you sure you\u2019re not trans?  I\u2019ve never heard of a guy being anorexic.\u201d  And then, \u201cIt\u2019s not attractive. Just being honest.\u201d   So I said, \u201cYou\u2019re not just being honest, you\u2019re being a bitch.\u201d  She asked me what my problem was, that she was just kidding.  And I was like, \u201cNo one thinks you\u2019re funny.  The only thing that\u2019s funny is that you of all people think you can talk shit about how other people look.  Take a look at yourself.\u201d  \n\nNo one else was saying anything. She got mad and told me to go fuck myself and got up and left.  I was feeling pretty good about the whole thing, but my one friend told me I went to far with her and should try to talk to her tomorrow.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for calling the girl a \"bitch\" after she made hurtful comments.\n\nFirst, the girl in question often insults others and claims it's just being honest. The author's friend was targeted with a comment about their appearance, which is a sensitive topic. The author responds by calling her a bitch and pointing out her hypocrisy. \n\nOn one hand, the girl's behavior seems toxic, and the author might feel justified in standing up for their friend. But on the other hand, the author's response is confrontational. Publicly calling someone a bitch could escalate the situation and might not be the most effective way to address the issue. The friend's reaction was to get upset and leave, which could mean the situation became more tense rather than resolved.\n\nAlso, the group's history shows that they've avoided confronting her before because she overreacts. The author's friend suggests talking to her tomorrow, which might be a better approach. So, while the girl's behavior is problematic, the author's response may have made things worse instead of addressing the root issue. \n\nI think the key here is whether the author's method was appropriate. Insulting someone in return, even if they deserve it, might not be the right approach. It's about promoting a respectful dialogue rather than a confrontation. So, the author might be in the wrong for not handling it more constructively.\n"
