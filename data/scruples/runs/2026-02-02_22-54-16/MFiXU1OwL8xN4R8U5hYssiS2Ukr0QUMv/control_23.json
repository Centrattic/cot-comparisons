She eats lunch with us and hangs around before classes start, but that\u2019s it.  None of us hang out with her outside of school.  Mostly because she\u2019s very insulting, all the time.  It\u2019s seriously like she doesn\u2019t know how to have a conversation without shitting on someone.  She just says \u201cI\u2019m just being honest\u201d a lot. The problem is that she can\u2019t take a joke herself.  Even polite criticism pisses her off A LOT and makes shit super awkward.  My friends and I have talked about her and all of us are really sick of her, but no one has wanted to say anything because she blows stuff way out of proportion when it\u2019s about her.  \n\nToday at lunch though I had enough.  She was shit talking one of my friends for being really skinny.  \u201cAre you sure you\u2019re not trans?  I\u2019ve never heard of a guy being anorexic.\u201d  And then, \u201cIt\u2019s not attractive. Just being honest.\u201d   So I said, \u201cYou\u2019re not just being honest, you\u2019re being a bitch.\u201d  She asked me what my problem was, that she was just kidding.  And I was like, \u201cNo one thinks you\u2019re funny.  The only thing that\u2019s funny is that you of all people think you can talk shit about how other people look.  Take a look at yourself.\u201d  \n\nNo one else was saying anything. She got mad and told me to go fuck myself and got up and left.  I was feeling pretty good about the whole thing, but my one friend told me I went to far with her and should try to talk to her tomorrow.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the author (the person who wrote the scenario) is in the wrong. The situation is about a girl who's part of their friend group but is very insulting. The author confronts her after she makes hurtful comments, calling her a bitch and pointing out her hypocrisy. Friends say he went too far.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The girl is known for being insulting all the time and doesn't take constructive criticism well. The author's friends are also frustrated but haven't addressed it because she overreacts. The trigger here is when the girl makes a joke about a friend's body, which crosses into bullying territory. The author's response is direct and confrontational, which led to her leaving.\n\nNow, the key points to consider: Was the author's response proportionate? The girl's previous behavior was ongoing, but the author chose a public confrontation. While the girl's comments are clearly hurtful, calling someone a \"bitch\" in front of others can be seen as aggressive, even if the intent was to stop her behavior. The author's friend suggested talking to her the next day, which might be a more constructive approach. However, the author's action was a direct response to a specific incident. \n\nOn one hand, the author addressed a harmful behavior that others were avoiding, which could be seen as standing up for a friend. On the other hand, the method might have been confrontational and didn't allow for a dialogue, possibly escalating the situation. The line between holding someone accountable and being harsh is thin here. \n\nIn many social contexts, public shaming can be counterproductive, even if the intent is good. The girl's reaction was to get angry and leave, which might have been expected. The author's friends are divided, indicating that while the action was necessary for some, others felt it was too harsh. \n\nSo, whether the author is in the wrong might depend on the approach. If the goal was to stop the behavior without further conflict, the method could be questioned. But if the goal was to address a persistent issue, the author might feel justified. However, the use of a derogatory term and public confrontation could be seen as excessive. Therefore, the answer could lean towards A (the author is in the wrong) because the approach might have been too harsh and not the most effective, even if the intent was good.\n"
