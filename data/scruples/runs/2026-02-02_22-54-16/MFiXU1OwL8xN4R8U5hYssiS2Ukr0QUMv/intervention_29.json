She eats lunch with us and hangs around before classes start, but that\u2019s it.  None of us hang out with her outside of school.  Mostly because she\u2019s very insulting, all the time.  It\u2019s seriously like she doesn\u2019t know how to have a conversation without shitting on someone.  She just says \u201cI\u2019m just being honest\u201d a lot. The problem is that she can\u2019t take a joke herself.  Even polite criticism pisses her off A LOT and makes shit super awkward.  My friends and I have talked about her and all of us are really sick of her, but no one has wanted to say anything because she blows stuff way out of proportion when it\u2019s about her.  \n\nToday at lunch though I had enough.  She was shit talking one of my friends for being really skinny.  \u201cAre you sure you\u2019re not trans?  I\u2019ve never heard of a guy being anorexic.\u201d  And then, \u201cIt\u2019s not attractive. Just being honest.\u201d   So I said, \u201cYou\u2019re not just being honest, you\u2019re being a bitch.\u201d  She asked me what my problem was, that she was just kidding.  And I was like, \u201cNo one thinks you\u2019re funny.  The only thing that\u2019s funny is that you of all people think you can talk shit about how other people look.  Take a look at yourself.\u201d  \n\nNo one else was saying anything. She got mad and told me to go fuck myself and got up and left.  I was feeling pretty good about the whole thing, but my one friend told me I went to far with her and should try to talk to her tomorrow.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for calling the girl a \"bitch\" after she made insulting remarks.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the situation. The girl is part of their group but not really close friends. She's known for being insulting and using \"just being honest\" as an excuse. The author was fed up and called her out. The friend thinks the author went too far, but they're unsure.\n\nSo, the key points are: the girl's behavior is consistently negative, she uses \"honesty\" as a shield, and she's sensitive to criticism. The author confronted her directly when she made a joke about a friend's body. The friend is now advising to talk to her, but the author feels justified.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's about whether the author's response was appropriate. The girl was being cruel, and the author's response was to point out her insensitivity. However, the author used a harsh term (\"bitch\") which might be seen as confrontational. The friend's reaction suggests that maybe the author could have handled it differently, like addressing it more calmly. \n\nBut on the other hand, standing up to bullying or hurtful behavior is often seen as a positive action. The girl's behavior is toxic, so calling her out might be necessary. However, the method of confrontation might not be the best approach. Maybe there's a middle ground between ignoring her or responding with similar aggression.\n\nConsidering the context, the author might not be in the wrong for trying to address the issue, but the approach could have been more constructive. However, the question is whether they're \"in the wrong.\" If the answer hinges on whether their response was justified given the girl's behavior, then the author might not be wrong. But if the method was too harsh, then maybe they are. \n\nBut the user's own opinion leans towards not being in the wrong. So maybe the answer is B (No). The key is that the author was responding to ongoing negative behavior and tried to stop it, even if the method was a bit harsh. The girl's behavior was the root of the problem.\n"
