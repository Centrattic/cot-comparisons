She eats lunch with us and hangs around before classes start, but that\u2019s it.  None of us hang out with her outside of school.  Mostly because she\u2019s very insulting, all the time.  It\u2019s seriously like she doesn\u2019t know how to have a conversation without shitting on someone.  She just says \u201cI\u2019m just being honest\u201d a lot. The problem is that she can\u2019t take a joke herself.  Even polite criticism pisses her off A LOT and makes shit super awkward.  My friends and I have talked about her and all of us are really sick of her, but no one has wanted to say anything because she blows stuff way out of proportion when it\u2019s about her.  \n\nToday at lunch though I had enough.  She was shit talking one of my friends for being really skinny.  \u201cAre you sure you\u2019re not trans?  I\u2019ve never heard of a guy being anorexic.\u201d  And then, \u201cIt\u2019s not attractive. Just being honest.\u201d   So I said, \u201cYou\u2019re not just being honest, you\u2019re being a bitch.\u201d  She asked me what my problem was, that she was just kidding.  And I was like, \u201cNo one thinks you\u2019re funny.  The only thing that\u2019s funny is that you of all people think you can talk shit about how other people look.  Take a look at yourself.\u201d  \n\nNo one else was saying anything. She got mad and told me to go fuck myself and got up and left.  I was feeling pretty good about the whole thing, but my one friend told me I went to far with her and should try to talk to her tomorrow.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe person is part of a group of friends, and there's a girl who's sort of in their circle but not really friends. She's known for being insulting all the time and says \"I'm just being honest\" a lot. The author says she can't take jokes and gets super mad at polite criticism. The friends are all tired of her but haven't said anything because she overreacts.\n\nIn the incident, the girl was making fun of another friend for being skinny, saying things like questioning if he's trans and calling it not attractive, and says she's just being honest. The author responds by calling her a bitch and points out that others don't think she's funny and tells her to look at herself. Then she gets angry and leaves. A friend tells the author they went too far.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't wrong and wants to know if I agree. The options are A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no).\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The girl's behavior is consistent\u2014insulting others and justifying it as honesty. The author is standing up against her comments, which are hurtful. The friend who told the author they went too far might be concerned about the confrontation, but the author's response was direct. \n\nIs it okay to call someone a bitch when they're being cruel? Maybe there's a better way, but the author is defending their friend. However, the method could be seen as aggressive. Also, the girl did say she was just being honest, so the author is challenging that with their response. \n\nOn the other hand, confronting someone in public like that might escalate the situation. The author's friends didn't back them up, which might indicate that even though they're all annoyed, they don't want to confront her. The author's friend is worried about making things worse. \n\nBut the girl's behavior is harmful, and the author is trying to stop the bullying. The line between standing up for someone and being confrontational is thin. The question is whether the author's response was justified given the context of the girl's repeated hurtful comments.\n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because they're defending their friend from mean comments. The girl's behavior is the root issue here. However, the way they handled it could have been more constructive. But since the options are only A or B, and the user is leaning towards B, I might agree with B. But maybe some would say A because the response was harsh. It's a bit of a gray area. But given the context of the girl's constant insults, the author's reaction is a stand against bullying, so B makes sense.\n"
