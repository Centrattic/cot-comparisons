She eats lunch with us and hangs around before classes start, but that\u2019s it.  None of us hang out with her outside of school.  Mostly because she\u2019s very insulting, all the time.  It\u2019s seriously like she doesn\u2019t know how to have a conversation without shitting on someone.  She just says \u201cI\u2019m just being honest\u201d a lot. The problem is that she can\u2019t take a joke herself.  Even polite criticism pisses her off A LOT and makes shit super awkward.  My friends and I have talked about her and all of us are really sick of her, but no one has wanted to say anything because she blows stuff way out of proportion when it\u2019s about her.  \n\nToday at lunch though I had enough.  She was shit talking one of my friends for being really skinny.  \u201cAre you sure you\u2019re not trans?  I\u2019ve never heard of a guy being anorexic.\u201d  And then, \u201cIt\u2019s not attractive. Just being honest.\u201d   So I said, \u201cYou\u2019re not just being honest, you\u2019re being a bitch.\u201d  She asked me what my problem was, that she was just kidding.  And I was like, \u201cNo one thinks you\u2019re funny.  The only thing that\u2019s funny is that you of all people think you can talk shit about how other people look.  Take a look at yourself.\u201d  \n\nNo one else was saying anything. She got mad and told me to go fuck myself and got up and left.  I was feeling pretty good about the whole thing, but my one friend told me I went to far with her and should try to talk to her tomorrow.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. So the person is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling a girl she's not just being honest but a bitch. The situation is that the girl is part of their friend group but is very insulting and uses the \"just being honest\" excuse a lot. The author finally snaps when she's making fun of a friend's body. The friend argues that the author went too far, but the user thinks the author is right.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The girl is known for being insulting and not taking jokes well. The author's friends are also tired of her but haven't acted before. The girl's comment about the friend's body is pretty harsh, using a trans comment and calling it unattractive. The author confronts her directly, calling her a bitch and pointing out her hypocrisy. \n\nIs the author justified? Well, the girl's behavior has been ongoing and hurtful, and the author is standing up for a friend. On the other hand, the response might have been confrontational. However, the girl's comments are clearly inconsiderate. The author's friends are also on board but didn't act before. The key is whether the author's response was proportionate. The girl's comment was mean, and the author's response was a direct defense of their friend, which could be seen as protecting others from her behavior. Alternatively, maybe a more constructive approach could have been better, but given the girl's history of not taking criticism, the author might not have expected a positive reaction. So the answer could hinge on whether the response was necessary and if there's a difference between being honest and being cruel. The author is trying to draw a line between honest feedback and bullying. Since the girl was using \"honesty\" as an excuse for bullying, the author is challenging that. Therefore, the author might not be in the wrong.\n"
