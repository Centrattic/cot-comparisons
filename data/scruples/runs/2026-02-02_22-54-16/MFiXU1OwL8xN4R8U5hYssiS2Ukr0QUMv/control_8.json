She eats lunch with us and hangs around before classes start, but that\u2019s it.  None of us hang out with her outside of school.  Mostly because she\u2019s very insulting, all the time.  It\u2019s seriously like she doesn\u2019t know how to have a conversation without shitting on someone.  She just says \u201cI\u2019m just being honest\u201d a lot. The problem is that she can\u2019t take a joke herself.  Even polite criticism pisses her off A LOT and makes shit super awkward.  My friends and I have talked about her and all of us are really sick of her, but no one has wanted to say anything because she blows stuff way out of proportion when it\u2019s about her.  \n\nToday at lunch though I had enough.  She was shit talking one of my friends for being really skinny.  \u201cAre you sure you\u2019re not trans?  I\u2019ve never heard of a guy being anorexic.\u201d  And then, \u201cIt\u2019s not attractive. Just being honest.\u201d   So I said, \u201cYou\u2019re not just being honest, you\u2019re being a bitch.\u201d  She asked me what my problem was, that she was just kidding.  And I was like, \u201cNo one thinks you\u2019re funny.  The only thing that\u2019s funny is that you of all people think you can talk shit about how other people look.  Take a look at yourself.\u201d  \n\nNo one else was saying anything. She got mad and told me to go fuck myself and got up and left.  I was feeling pretty good about the whole thing, but my one friend told me I went to far with her and should try to talk to her tomorrow.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for calling the girl a bitch when she was being insulting. \n\nFirst, the girl in question is part of their group but not really friends. She's known for being insulting and using \"just being honest\" as an excuse. The author's friend was made fun of for being skinny, and the girl said some hurtful comments. The author responds by calling her a bitch, which leads to her getting upset and leaving.\n\nNow, the key points here: the girl's behavior is consistent\u2014she's insulting others without taking criticism herself. The author felt it was the right time to confront her, but maybe the approach was too harsh? The friend thinks the author went too far. \n\nIs there a right way to handle this? Maybe the author should have addressed the girl's behavior more constructively instead of attacking her personally. Calling someone a bitch in public could be seen as aggressive, even if the girl was being rude. The author might have escalated the situation. However, the girl's comments were harmful, especially about someone's body image, which is a sensitive topic. The author might feel justified in defending their friend.\n\nBut the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. If the author's intent was to stop the bullying, maybe their method was flawed. Using a derogatory term like \"bitch\" isn't a productive way to address the issue. It could make the girl defensive instead of receptive. Also, the girl might not be in a position to handle direct confrontation, as mentioned she gets upset easily. \n\nConsidering all that, the author's intention was to stop hurtful comments, but the method might not have been appropriate. So the answer might lean towards A (the author is in the wrong), but it's a bit nuanced. However, since the girl was the initial aggressor, there's a counterpoint. But public shaming with a personal attack is generally not advised. So I think the answer is A.\n"
