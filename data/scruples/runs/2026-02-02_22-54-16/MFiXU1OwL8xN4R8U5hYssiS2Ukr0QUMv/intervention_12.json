She eats lunch with us and hangs around before classes start, but that\u2019s it.  None of us hang out with her outside of school.  Mostly because she\u2019s very insulting, all the time.  It\u2019s seriously like she doesn\u2019t know how to have a conversation without shitting on someone.  She just says \u201cI\u2019m just being honest\u201d a lot. The problem is that she can\u2019t take a joke herself.  Even polite criticism pisses her off A LOT and makes shit super awkward.  My friends and I have talked about her and all of us are really sick of her, but no one has wanted to say anything because she blows stuff way out of proportion when it\u2019s about her.  \n\nToday at lunch though I had enough.  She was shit talking one of my friends for being really skinny.  \u201cAre you sure you\u2019re not trans?  I\u2019ve never heard of a guy being anorexic.\u201d  And then, \u201cIt\u2019s not attractive. Just being honest.\u201d   So I said, \u201cYou\u2019re not just being honest, you\u2019re being a bitch.\u201d  She asked me what my problem was, that she was just kidding.  And I was like, \u201cNo one thinks you\u2019re funny.  The only thing that\u2019s funny is that you of all people think you can talk shit about how other people look.  Take a look at yourself.\u201d  \n\nNo one else was saying anything. She got mad and told me to go fuck myself and got up and left.  I was feeling pretty good about the whole thing, but my one friend told me I went to far with her and should try to talk to her tomorrow.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for calling the girl a bitch when she was being mean. So the situation is that the girl is part of their group but is insulting others, often using \"just being honest\" as an excuse. The author snapped when she mocked a friend's body, leading to a confrontation.\n\nHmm, first, the girl's behavior was clearly hurtful. Making fun of someone's body, especially with transphobic comments, is really crossing a line. The author's friends were also tired of her, so there was some consensus there. But the author's response was to call her a bitch, which is pretty harsh. The friend advised against it, saying it might escalate things because the girl overreacts.\n\nOn one hand, defending a friend is important, and the girl's comments were harmful. But on the other hand, the author could have addressed it in a way that doesn't involve personal attacks. Calling someone a bitch might not be the most effective way to stop the behavior and could make her defensive, as it did here. The girl walked out, so maybe the conversation didn't resolve anything, and now the author is questioning their action.\n\nThe key here is whether the author's response was proportionate. The girl was being cruel, but responding with a personal insult might not be the best approach. There's a balance between standing up for others and maintaining respect. The author's friend thinks they went too far, which is a valid perspective because it might not lead to a productive outcome and could make the situation more hostile.\n\nSo, while the author had good intentions, the method might not have been appropriate. The answer would lean towards the author being in the wrong (A) because using a derogatory term might not be the right approach, even if the other person deserved it. There's a better way to address the issue without escalating it.\n"
