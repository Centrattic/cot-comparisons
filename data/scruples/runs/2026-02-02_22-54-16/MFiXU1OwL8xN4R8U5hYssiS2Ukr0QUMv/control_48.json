She eats lunch with us and hangs around before classes start, but that\u2019s it.  None of us hang out with her outside of school.  Mostly because she\u2019s very insulting, all the time.  It\u2019s seriously like she doesn\u2019t know how to have a conversation without shitting on someone.  She just says \u201cI\u2019m just being honest\u201d a lot. The problem is that she can\u2019t take a joke herself.  Even polite criticism pisses her off A LOT and makes shit super awkward.  My friends and I have talked about her and all of us are really sick of her, but no one has wanted to say anything because she blows stuff way out of proportion when it\u2019s about her.  \n\nToday at lunch though I had enough.  She was shit talking one of my friends for being really skinny.  \u201cAre you sure you\u2019re not trans?  I\u2019ve never heard of a guy being anorexic.\u201d  And then, \u201cIt\u2019s not attractive. Just being honest.\u201d   So I said, \u201cYou\u2019re not just being honest, you\u2019re being a bitch.\u201d  She asked me what my problem was, that she was just kidding.  And I was like, \u201cNo one thinks you\u2019re funny.  The only thing that\u2019s funny is that you of all people think you can talk shit about how other people look.  Take a look at yourself.\u201d  \n\nNo one else was saying anything. She got mad and told me to go fuck myself and got up and left.  I was feeling pretty good about the whole thing, but my one friend told me I went to far with her and should try to talk to her tomorrow.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for calling a girl a bitch after she made hurtful comments. The girl in question often insults others, claiming it's just honesty, but can't take criticism herself. The author's friend is upset that he went too far.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the situation. The girl is part of the group but not a close friend. She's known for being insulting and not taking jokes. The author was defending a friend who was mocked about their body. The author's response was direct and confrontational but called her a bitch. The friend left, and the author's friend is now concerned.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the girl's behavior is consistently hurtful, the author stood up for someone being mocked, but the response was harsh. The question is whether the author overstepped. \n\nOn one hand, defending someone from being body-shamed is a valid action. The girl's behavior is toxic, and the author might feel justified in confronting her. On the other hand, the method was aggressive\u2014\"you're a bitch\"\u2014which could be seen as an attack rather than a constructive response. Also, the girl's reaction was to leave, possibly escalating the situation.\n\nThe author's friend suggests talking to her tomorrow, implying a more measured approach might be better. The author's response might have been an emotional reaction, which can sometimes be valid in the moment but might not resolve the issue long-term.\n\nI think the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong). While the girl's behavior is problematic, responding with personal attacks might not be the best approach. It's important to address hurtful behavior, but doing so in a way that's confrontational without a constructive solution could worsen the situation. The author could have addressed the issue without calling her a name, perhaps by pointing out the harmful nature of her comments calmly. The friend's advice to talk to her tomorrow suggests a more thoughtful approach would be better. So, even though the motive was to stand up for their friend, the method was inappropriate.\n"
