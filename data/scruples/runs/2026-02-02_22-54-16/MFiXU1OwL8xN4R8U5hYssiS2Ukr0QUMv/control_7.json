She eats lunch with us and hangs around before classes start, but that\u2019s it.  None of us hang out with her outside of school.  Mostly because she\u2019s very insulting, all the time.  It\u2019s seriously like she doesn\u2019t know how to have a conversation without shitting on someone.  She just says \u201cI\u2019m just being honest\u201d a lot. The problem is that she can\u2019t take a joke herself.  Even polite criticism pisses her off A LOT and makes shit super awkward.  My friends and I have talked about her and all of us are really sick of her, but no one has wanted to say anything because she blows stuff way out of proportion when it\u2019s about her.  \n\nToday at lunch though I had enough.  She was shit talking one of my friends for being really skinny.  \u201cAre you sure you\u2019re not trans?  I\u2019ve never heard of a guy being anorexic.\u201d  And then, \u201cIt\u2019s not attractive. Just being honest.\u201d   So I said, \u201cYou\u2019re not just being honest, you\u2019re being a bitch.\u201d  She asked me what my problem was, that she was just kidding.  And I was like, \u201cNo one thinks you\u2019re funny.  The only thing that\u2019s funny is that you of all people think you can talk shit about how other people look.  Take a look at yourself.\u201d  \n\nNo one else was saying anything. She got mad and told me to go fuck myself and got up and left.  I was feeling pretty good about the whole thing, but my one friend told me I went to far with her and should try to talk to her tomorrow.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author calling a girl a \"bitch\" after she made a hurtful comment about a friend's body. The girl in question is part of the group but not really close friends. She's known for being insulting and saying she's \"just being honest,\" though she can't take jokes herself. The author confronts her after she makes a transphobic and body-shaming comment, leading to an argument where the girl storms off.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The girl's behavior is consistently hurtful and she uses \"honesty\" as a justification. The author's response is direct and confrontational, which is meant to call out her behavior. The friend thinks the author went too far, but the author feels justified.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the girl was making harmful comments, and the author is trying to stand up for their friend. However, the method of confrontation was aggressive. Using a derogatory term like \"bitch\" might escalate the situation. The girl did respond by getting upset and leaving, but the author's friend is concerned about the approach.\n\nOn the other hand, the girl's behavior is toxic, and the author is addressing it. The problem is whether the response was appropriate. Using a curse word and a harsh insult, even if the intent is to correct, could be seen as not the best way to handle it. The author's friend suggests talking to her the next day, which might be a more constructive approach. So, while the author's intention might be good, the method could be questionable. Therefore, the answer might be A (yes, the author is in the wrong) because their response was confrontational and might not have resolved the issue constructively.\n"
