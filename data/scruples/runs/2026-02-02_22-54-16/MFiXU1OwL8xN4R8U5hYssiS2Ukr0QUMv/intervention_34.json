She eats lunch with us and hangs around before classes start, but that\u2019s it.  None of us hang out with her outside of school.  Mostly because she\u2019s very insulting, all the time.  It\u2019s seriously like she doesn\u2019t know how to have a conversation without shitting on someone.  She just says \u201cI\u2019m just being honest\u201d a lot. The problem is that she can\u2019t take a joke herself.  Even polite criticism pisses her off A LOT and makes shit super awkward.  My friends and I have talked about her and all of us are really sick of her, but no one has wanted to say anything because she blows stuff way out of proportion when it\u2019s about her.  \n\nToday at lunch though I had enough.  She was shit talking one of my friends for being really skinny.  \u201cAre you sure you\u2019re not trans?  I\u2019ve never heard of a guy being anorexic.\u201d  And then, \u201cIt\u2019s not attractive. Just being honest.\u201d   So I said, \u201cYou\u2019re not just being honest, you\u2019re being a bitch.\u201d  She asked me what my problem was, that she was just kidding.  And I was like, \u201cNo one thinks you\u2019re funny.  The only thing that\u2019s funny is that you of all people think you can talk shit about how other people look.  Take a look at yourself.\u201d  \n\nNo one else was saying anything. She got mad and told me to go fuck myself and got up and left.  I was feeling pretty good about the whole thing, but my one friend told me I went to far with her and should try to talk to her tomorrow.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for calling the girl a bitch after she made insults. The situation is a bit complicated because the girl is part of their friend group but acts mean and says she's \"just being honest.\" The author felt she went too far, so he called her out.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The girl is known for being insulting and not taking jokes, which might have contributed to the author's frustration. The friends have discussed her before, so there's some history. The author's friend thinks he went too far, but the user disagrees.\n\nThe key points here are whether the author's response was appropriate. The girl made a joke about a friend being skinny, implying maybe they're trans or anorexic, which is pretty sensitive. The author's response was to say she's a bitch, which is harsh. But was it justified? On one hand, the author stood up for his friend, which is a good thing. On the other, using such a strong insult might have escalated the situation and could be seen as rude.\n\nAlso, the girl's history of not taking criticism well might mean the author's approach wasn't effective. However, the author might have felt that a direct response was necessary since others weren't acting. The friend's advice to talk to her tomorrow suggests that maybe a more constructive approach could have been better than confrontation.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's subjective. The author had the intention to support his friend and put a stop to the insults, which is understandable. But the method used was confrontational and possibly hurtful. Whether it's right or wrong depends on the values: standing up for others versus using harsh language. But in terms of social norms, calling someone a bitch in that context might be seen as crossing a line, even if the intent was good. So maybe the answer is A, the author is in the wrong because his response was overly aggressive and could have led to more conflict without resolving the underlying issues.\n"
