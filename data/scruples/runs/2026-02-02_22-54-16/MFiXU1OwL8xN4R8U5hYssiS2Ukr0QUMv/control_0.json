She eats lunch with us and hangs around before classes start, but that\u2019s it.  None of us hang out with her outside of school.  Mostly because she\u2019s very insulting, all the time.  It\u2019s seriously like she doesn\u2019t know how to have a conversation without shitting on someone.  She just says \u201cI\u2019m just being honest\u201d a lot. The problem is that she can\u2019t take a joke herself.  Even polite criticism pisses her off A LOT and makes shit super awkward.  My friends and I have talked about her and all of us are really sick of her, but no one has wanted to say anything because she blows stuff way out of proportion when it\u2019s about her.  \n\nToday at lunch though I had enough.  She was shit talking one of my friends for being really skinny.  \u201cAre you sure you\u2019re not trans?  I\u2019ve never heard of a guy being anorexic.\u201d  And then, \u201cIt\u2019s not attractive. Just being honest.\u201d   So I said, \u201cYou\u2019re not just being honest, you\u2019re being a bitch.\u201d  She asked me what my problem was, that she was just kidding.  And I was like, \u201cNo one thinks you\u2019re funny.  The only thing that\u2019s funny is that you of all people think you can talk shit about how other people look.  Take a look at yourself.\u201d  \n\nNo one else was saying anything. She got mad and told me to go fuck myself and got up and left.  I was feeling pretty good about the whole thing, but my one friend told me I went to far with her and should try to talk to her tomorrow.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for calling the girl a bitch after she was being insulting. The situation is that the girl is part of their group but isn't really close friends. She's known for being insulting and uses \"just being honest\" as an excuse. The author snapped when she mocked a friend's appearance.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The girl has a history of being hurtful and not taking criticism well. The author's friend thinks they went too far, but others might agree with the author. The key points here are whether the author's response was justified given the girl's behavior.\n\nThe girl made a joke about a friend's body, which is sensitive. The author called her a bitch, which is harsh but maybe in line with how the group feels. The problem is that the author didn't address it calmly; instead, they escalated the situation. The girl got mad and left, which might have been expected. \n\nNow, considering if the author is in the wrong. The girl was being cruel, but the author's response was confrontational. The author might have a point in standing up for their friend, but using a derogatory term could have made the situation worse. The author's friend suggested talking to her the next day, implying that a more measured approach might have been better. \n\nAlso, the girl's comment about the friend's body touches on sensitive topics like body image and gender identity, which are serious. The author's response was direct but perhaps not the most constructive. It's possible that the author was right to stand up for their friend, but the method was inappropriate. \n\nAlternatively, if the group is tired of her behavior, the author's outburst might be seen as a justified release of frustration. However, in a public setting like the cafeteria, this kind of confrontation can lead to more tension. The girl's reaction was to leave, but it's unclear if that resolved anything or just caused more awkwardness.\n\nSo, the answer depends on whether the author's action was proportionate. The girl's constant insults and the group's frustration are factors. But the way the author responded might not be the best approach. They could have addressed it without being confrontational. Hence, the author might be in the wrong for the harsh response despite valid reasons.\n"
