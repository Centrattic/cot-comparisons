I\u2019d say at least 30lbs.  Probably more. She\u2019s always mentioning it and talks about how she needs to join a gym.  So on her birthday I got her a year at Gold\u2019s gym. \n\nIt didn\u2019t go over well.  She said that it\u2019s an insult.  That she know she\u2019s gained weight and doesn\u2019t need me to tell her about it.  I have been EXTREMELY careful not to mention her weight gain.  I wasn\u2019t trying to tell her she\u2019s fat, I got it for her because she\u2019s said multiple times that she really needs to join a gym.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author got their girlfriend a gym membership for her birthday because she mentioned needing to join a gym and had gained weight. The girlfriend felt it was an insult because she didn't need the author to point out her weight gain.\n\nFirst, the author's intention was to help, right? They say they didn't mention the weight gain and just wanted to support her since she talked about joining a gym. But the girlfriend interpreted it as a negative comment about her weight. So the key issue here is about perception versus intention. The author didn't mean it as an insult, but the girlfriend took it that way. \n\nNow, when someone gives a gift that's related to something sensitive, like weight, even if it's meant well, it can come off the wrong way. The girlfriend might feel that the gift is a reminder of her insecurity or that her partner is making a judgment without discussing it. The author tried to be careful not to mention it, but the gift itself might still be seen as pointing out the weight gain indirectly.\n\nI think in relationships, it's important to consider how the other person might perceive something, even if that's not the intention. The author might not be in the wrong in terms of intent, but actions can have unintended consequences. However, if the author was genuinely trying to help and the girlfriend is sensitive about her weight, maybe the author isn't at fault. But it's possible that even without direct comments, the gift was a mistake because it touched on a sensitive topic. \n\nHmm. So the answer depends on whether the author should have known that the gift would be hurtful despite not mentioning the weight. If the girlfriend had mentioned wanting to lose weight, maybe the membership is appropriate. But if the girlfriend didn't express that, and the author assumed, perhaps they should have discussed it first. However, the girlfriend did mention needing to join a gym, so maybe the author thought that was the right move. \n\nIt's a bit of a grey area. On one hand, the gift was given with good intentions and based on her own statements. On the other hand, it's a sensitive topic, and maybe the author should have been more aware of her feelings without her explicitly stating it. I'm leaning towards the author not being in the wrong because their intention was positive and they didn't make direct comments, but maybe the girlfriend is more at fault for feeling that way without the author bringing up the topic. But societal norms often expect people to be careful about such gifts. So maybe the author is somewhat at fault for not considering the emotional impact, even if unintended.\n"
