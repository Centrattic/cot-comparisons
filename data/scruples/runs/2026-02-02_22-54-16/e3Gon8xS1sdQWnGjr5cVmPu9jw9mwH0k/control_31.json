I\u2019d say at least 30lbs.  Probably more. She\u2019s always mentioning it and talks about how she needs to join a gym.  So on her birthday I got her a year at Gold\u2019s gym. \n\nIt didn\u2019t go over well.  She said that it\u2019s an insult.  That she know she\u2019s gained weight and doesn\u2019t need me to tell her about it.  I have been EXTREMELY careful not to mention her weight gain.  I wasn\u2019t trying to tell her she\u2019s fat, I got it for her because she\u2019s said multiple times that she really needs to join a gym.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this AITA scenario. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for getting his girlfriend a gym membership as a birthday gift after she gained weight.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend has mentioned gaining weight and wanting to join a gym. The author got the membership, thinking it's what she wanted. But she took it as an insult because he brought up her weight gain, even though he didn't mean to. \n\nHmm, the key points here are intent vs. perception. The author didn't mention her weight gain directly but gave the gym membership based on her own statements. However, the girlfriend felt it was a reminder of her weight gain that he made. Even if he didn't intend it that way, the gift still made her feel criticized. \n\nIn relationships, sometimes the receiver's feelings matter more than the giver's intent. The girlfriend might feel that the gift was a subtle way of pointing out her weight gain, which could hurt her feelings. The author tried to be careful not to mention it, but the action itself might have come across as judgmental. \n\nAlso, maybe the girlfriend was already sensitive about her weight and didn't want to be reminded, even if it's through a gift meant to help. The author might not have considered that she wanted support without the focus on her weight. \n\nSo, even if the author's intention was good, the girlfriend's reaction is valid. He might have overlooked her emotional state regarding her weight gain. Therefore, he could be in the wrong for not understanding that the gift, although well-intentioned, was hurtful.\n"
