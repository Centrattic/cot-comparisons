I\u2019d say at least 30lbs.  Probably more. She\u2019s always mentioning it and talks about how she needs to join a gym.  So on her birthday I got her a year at Gold\u2019s gym. \n\nIt didn\u2019t go over well.  She said that it\u2019s an insult.  That she know she\u2019s gained weight and doesn\u2019t need me to tell her about it.  I have been EXTREMELY careful not to mention her weight gain.  I wasn\u2019t trying to tell her she\u2019s fat, I got it for her because she\u2019s said multiple times that she really needs to join a gym.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who got their girlfriend a gym membership is in the wrong. The situation is that the girlfriend gained weight, mentioned it, and the boyfriend got her a gym membership as a birthday gift. She felt insulted, thinking he was commenting on her weight, even though he didn't mention it.\n\nHmm. The key points here are the motivations and the girlfriend's feelings. The author says he got the membership because she had expressed the need to join a gym, not to comment on her weight. However, the girlfriend interpreted it as an insult, feeling that he was implying she needed to lose weight. \n\nSo, the question is whether the author was wrong. On one hand, he didn't have bad intentions and followed her expressed desire to join a gym. On the other hand, the gift might have been insensitive to her current feelings about her weight. Even if he didn't mean to insult, the action still hurt her, which is important. \n\nBut the problem is whether the author is in the wrong. If he didn't have malicious intent and acted based on her own statements, maybe he's not wrong. However, the issue might be that he didn't consider that her desire to join a gym might be sensitive. Maybe he should have chosen a different gift to avoid triggering her insecurities. \n\nSo, is it his fault because he didn't consider her feelings, or is it her overreacting? The answer depends on whether the action was insensitive despite good intentions. In some cases, even with good intentions, actions can be wrong if they hurt someone unintentionally. But if the gift was based on her own expressed needs, then maybe it's not his fault. \n\nI think there's nuance here. He might not be in the wrong because he followed her lead, but he could have been more thoughtful. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Since he didn't mean to insult, but the gift was perceived that way, maybe he's not in the wrong (B). But some might argue that he should have anticipated her feelings (A). The answer likely depends on cultural or personal norms about gift-giving and body image sensitivity.\n"
