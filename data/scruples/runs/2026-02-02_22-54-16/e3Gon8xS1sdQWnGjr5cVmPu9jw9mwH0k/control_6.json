I\u2019d say at least 30lbs.  Probably more. She\u2019s always mentioning it and talks about how she needs to join a gym.  So on her birthday I got her a year at Gold\u2019s gym. \n\nIt didn\u2019t go over well.  She said that it\u2019s an insult.  That she know she\u2019s gained weight and doesn\u2019t need me to tell her about it.  I have been EXTREMELY careful not to mention her weight gain.  I wasn\u2019t trying to tell her she\u2019s fat, I got it for her because she\u2019s said multiple times that she really needs to join a gym.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who gave a gym membership as a birthday gift is in the wrong. The girlfriend gained weight over winter and the guy got her a gym membership, but she felt it was an insult. The key points here are the intention versus the perception.\n\nThe author says he got the membership because she mentioned wanting to join a gym, and he didn't mention her weight. But she interpreted it as him pointing out her weight gain. Even though his intention was good, the gift might have been hurtful because it's tied to her insecurities. The question is whether he's in the wrong. \n\nIn relationships, it's important to consider how the other person feels, even if the intention was positive. If she felt insulted, maybe he didn't realize the emotional weight she's carrying. But he wasn't directly commenting on her weight, just giving something she wanted. However, the context of her weight gain might make the gift feel like a criticism. \n\nIt's tricky. On one hand, he listened to her and gave her something she asked for. On the other, the gift's relevance to her weight issue might have been hurtful regardless of intent. But the answer depends on whether the problem was the gift itself or the underlying issue of body image. If the girlfriend is sensitive about her weight, maybe the guy should have considered that. But he says he was careful not to mention it. \n\nHmm. I think the answer is A (yes, he's in the wrong) because even if he meant well, the gift came off as focusing on her weight gain, which she was already upset about. The problem here is that the gift addressed an issue she didn't want to be addressed, so his good intentions don't negate the hurt caused. So the answer is A.\n"
