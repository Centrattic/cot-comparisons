We have an official statewide ranking and there's a core of us who travel to play in national tournaments. I get that some people will think it's super dorky but it's my passion and it keeps me outside, in shape and with my friends. \n\n\nWe have a very strict \"military-realistic\" policy on our team in that we don't allow anime, video game stuff, fake swords, bright colors, etc... And if you want to be on our competition team, there is about $400 worth of uniform gear we require everyone to buy so we look professional and coherent. Again, this is us and people don't have to join our team. \n\n\nSo to the point, last fall this girl Madison got in touch with me to say she had just moved to town and wanted to meet people and asked if she could come to our practice. Airsoft is like 95% guys so it's not unheard of to have girls play but it's rare. When she gave me her name I was just a little curious so I did a google search and came up with her Instagram and she was (is) gorgeous, she's a literal model and a Boutine girl with about 100k followers. I figured she was just screwing with us to come out and get more dude Instagram followers by showing she was \"tomboy\" who could play with the boys. I figured that one day and a few shots with airsoft pellets would snuff her out real quick. I'm not just mentioning her looks and Instagram to be gratuitous, it's important to the story. \n\n\nSo she came out and to my total surprise, she fucking rocked it. She's actually a really good player with a good sense for the game and in the last few months she hasn't mentioned airsoft once on her Instagram. But needless to say a girl that looks like her is going to get a ton of attention on the airsoft field. We had a team meeting before she arrived that we had to treat her the same as we treat the rest of us and that we should have a rule for team spirt that no one try to date her. And I wanted to reiterate that we had to treat her exactly as we would any other member of the team, no exceptions.  Everyone agreed with this but even my oldest airsoft friends bend over backwards to be just a little bit friendlier to her if that makes sense. There is no doubt that in a highly competitive  sport that is 95% men, a \"hot girl\" is going to change the dynamic. It's not that I mind this at all because she was really good. \n\n\nSo my first big problem came with her just after new years when she came to the field with dyed bright red hair all done up in these little pony tail things. I told her that because of team rules, she was going to have to cover up her hair with like a camouflage beanie under her helmet. She said it was uncomfortable and took it off in the middle of a game. I called her out on it reminding her of the rules and pretty much my whole team told me I was being too much of a hard ass and I should lighten up. Even other strays (people not on a team) and other teams at the field that day came up to me and told me to chill out. After two years of having these rules, everyone was all of the sudden mad at me because I was trying to enforce the rules we all agreed on. \n\nBecause she is such a good player, we invited her to an out of state tournament coming up in March but I reiterated that I needed proof that she was ordering all the uniform gear from the various airsoft websites and it would be here in time for March. But after the hair incident I think she thinks she can blow me off because everyone will support her and she keeps telling me \"I'm working on it\" when I ask her. I mean it's literally as easy as going on a website and ordering stuff. That's all there is too it. \n\nSo things just got worse with her clothing and she pays zero regard to our military realistic rule and this past weekend she wore a fucking belly shirt and then was showing off all the welts to the other guys that she had gotten from being shot. She literally looked like a queen holding court with all the guys around her. \n\nI was so annoyed that her that I needed to talk to her, I reminded her about the military realistic rule, she said she was just hot and that she was sorry. I then asked her again about her uniform purchases. She said that she was working on it but not to worry, it would all be here. I was so fed up at this point I just said \"look I'm really sorry, but you just aren't a good fit for our team and you have to leave.\" Instead of getting mad like maybe I thought she would, she just broke down crying. Which means to everyone that was looking at us from afar I was the mean asshole making the pretty girl cry instead of just enforcing the rules we all agreed on. \n\n\nWell in like less that 5 minutes she had invites to join to other teams, pretty much EVERYONE on the airsoft field came over to tell her how sorry they were for her and how I'd always been known to be a hard ass.  And then my fucking team started turning on me. Of the 19 guys on our team 5 quit that day saying they were sick of my shit and the other 13 said they at least wanted to have a meeting this week to see where we were headed as a team. Somehow a rumor got started that I had yelled at Madison and that's why she was crying so the owner of the airsoft field iced me for 3 weeks because I violated his \"no abusive language policy.\" I've known the guy for 10 freaking years and spent thousands of dollars at his field and he iced me because of rumor. This is how crazy this has gotten. \n\n\nI think everyone on my team wants to either kick me out of the leadership position or quit altogether and form a new a team. To me, I was just enforcing the rules we all agreed upon and we all agreed that we would treat her the same. I think everyone thinks I'm an asshole. Our team meeting is tomorrow night and I would love to at least get some outside opinion on whether or not I'm an asshole so I know how to go into the meeting. \n\n\nthank you for reading. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the Airsoft team story is in the wrong. The situation is that the team leader kicked a girl, Madison, off the team because she didn't follow their rules about uniforms and the military-realistic theme. The team leader had clear rules everyone was supposed to follow, but Madison repeatedly broke them, and when confronted, she didn't comply. The leader ended up removing her, which led to backlash from the team, other players, and even the field owner.\n\nHmm, so the main points here are about enforcing rules. The team leader had established rules that everyone agreed to. The key issue is whether Madison's expulsion was justified based on those rules. The leader mentions that they had a strict policy on uniforms and military realism, and that team members were expected to purchase specific gear. Madison's behavior, like wearing bright hair and a belly shirt, violated these rules. The leader tried to address this, but she kept ignoring the rules. \n\nNow, considering the leader's responsibility: as the team leader, he's in charge of maintaining team standards. If the rules are clear and agreed upon, then enforcing them should be fair. However, there's a nuance here. The leader admitted to having a preconceived notion about Madison because of her appearance and social media presence. He initially thought she was just there for attention, but later realized she was good at the sport. But when enforcing the rules, did his personal biases affect his judgment? \n\nAlso, when Madison was confronted, the team leader's response might have come off as harsh. When he told her to put the beanie on, she found it uncomfortable and removed it during the game. The leader called her out, but others on the team and even other teams advised him to be more lenient. This could mean that the rules are too rigid or that the enforcement was too strict in this case. \n\nAnother angle: the team leader faced backlash from his own team. Five members quit, and others wanted to have a meeting about his leadership. The rumor that he yelled at Madison, leading to the field owner penalizing him, suggests that the way he handled the situation might have been perceived as aggressive. Even if the rules were valid, the method of enforcement could have been a problem. \n\nBut the core question is whether the team leader was in the wrong for enforcing the rules. If the rules were clear and communicated, and the team agreed to follow them, then the leader isn't necessarily wrong for enforcing them. However, if the rules were not consistently applied or if the leader's approach was unnecessarily harsh, that could be a problem. \n\nMadison's behavior was a pattern of non-compliance. She didn't order the mandatory gear, wore prohibited clothing, and didn't take the rules seriously. The leader had warned her multiple times. So, from a rules enforcement perspective, removing her for not adhering to team standards seems justified. However, the public confrontation and the subsequent fallout might indicate that the leader's approach was too rigid or lacked empathy. \n\nIn terms of fairness, the team leader's initial bias towards Madison might have played a role. He admitted to thinking she was there for attention, but then she proved herself as a good player. However, when enforcing rules, personal biases shouldn't affect the outcome. If the rules are the same for everyone, then the leader's actions are based on team standards, not personal feelings. \n\nBut the situation also shows that the team's dynamic changed because of Madison's presence. The leader's team members were distracted, which affected the team's performance and morale. This could have contributed to the leader's frustration. \n\nIn conclusion, while the leader had clear rules and enforced them, the way he handled the confrontation might have been perceived as harsh, leading to negative consequences. However, the core issue of enforcing agreed-upon rules is not inherently wrong. The team's decision to enforce the rules as written, even if it led to conflict, could be seen as correct. However, the leader's approach in confronting Madison could have been more diplomatic. But the question is whether he's in the wrong for expelling her, not the method. So, if the rules were valid and he enforced them properly, then the answer is B (not in the wrong). If the enforcement was unreasonable, then A. Given that the rules were team-established and agreed upon, I think the answer is B.\n"
