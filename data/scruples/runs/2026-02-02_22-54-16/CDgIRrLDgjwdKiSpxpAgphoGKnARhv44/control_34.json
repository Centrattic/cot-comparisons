We have an official statewide ranking and there's a core of us who travel to play in national tournaments. I get that some people will think it's super dorky but it's my passion and it keeps me outside, in shape and with my friends. \n\n\nWe have a very strict \"military-realistic\" policy on our team in that we don't allow anime, video game stuff, fake swords, bright colors, etc... And if you want to be on our competition team, there is about $400 worth of uniform gear we require everyone to buy so we look professional and coherent. Again, this is us and people don't have to join our team. \n\n\nSo to the point, last fall this girl Madison got in touch with me to say she had just moved to town and wanted to meet people and asked if she could come to our practice. Airsoft is like 95% guys so it's not unheard of to have girls play but it's rare. When she gave me her name I was just a little curious so I did a google search and came up with her Instagram and she was (is) gorgeous, she's a literal model and a Boutine girl with about 100k followers. I figured she was just screwing with us to come out and get more dude Instagram followers by showing she was \"tomboy\" who could play with the boys. I figured that one day and a few shots with airsoft pellets would snuff her out real quick. I'm not just mentioning her looks and Instagram to be gratuitous, it's important to the story. \n\n\nSo she came out and to my total surprise, she fucking rocked it. She's actually a really good player with a good sense for the game and in the last few months she hasn't mentioned airsoft once on her Instagram. But needless to say a girl that looks like her is going to get a ton of attention on the airsoft field. We had a team meeting before she arrived that we had to treat her the same as we treat the rest of us and that we should have a rule for team spirt that no one try to date her. And I wanted to reiterate that we had to treat her exactly as we would any other member of the team, no exceptions.  Everyone agreed with this but even my oldest airsoft friends bend over backwards to be just a little bit friendlier to her if that makes sense. There is no doubt that in a highly competitive  sport that is 95% men, a \"hot girl\" is going to change the dynamic. It's not that I mind this at all because she was really good. \n\n\nSo my first big problem came with her just after new years when she came to the field with dyed bright red hair all done up in these little pony tail things. I told her that because of team rules, she was going to have to cover up her hair with like a camouflage beanie under her helmet. She said it was uncomfortable and took it off in the middle of a game. I called her out on it reminding her of the rules and pretty much my whole team told me I was being too much of a hard ass and I should lighten up. Even other strays (people not on a team) and other teams at the field that day came up to me and told me to chill out. After two years of having these rules, everyone was all of the sudden mad at me because I was trying to enforce the rules we all agreed on. \n\nBecause she is such a good player, we invited her to an out of state tournament coming up in March but I reiterated that I needed proof that she was ordering all the uniform gear from the various airsoft websites and it would be here in time for March. But after the hair incident I think she thinks she can blow me off because everyone will support her and she keeps telling me \"I'm working on it\" when I ask her. I mean it's literally as easy as going on a website and ordering stuff. That's all there is too it. \n\nSo things just got worse with her clothing and she pays zero regard to our military realistic rule and this past weekend she wore a fucking belly shirt and then was showing off all the welts to the other guys that she had gotten from being shot. She literally looked like a queen holding court with all the guys around her. \n\nI was so annoyed that her that I needed to talk to her, I reminded her about the military realistic rule, she said she was just hot and that she was sorry. I then asked her again about her uniform purchases. She said that she was working on it but not to worry, it would all be here. I was so fed up at this point I just said \"look I'm really sorry, but you just aren't a good fit for our team and you have to leave.\" Instead of getting mad like maybe I thought she would, she just broke down crying. Which means to everyone that was looking at us from afar I was the mean asshole making the pretty girl cry instead of just enforcing the rules we all agreed on. \n\n\nWell in like less that 5 minutes she had invites to join to other teams, pretty much EVERYONE on the airsoft field came over to tell her how sorry they were for her and how I'd always been known to be a hard ass.  And then my fucking team started turning on me. Of the 19 guys on our team 5 quit that day saying they were sick of my shit and the other 13 said they at least wanted to have a meeting this week to see where we were headed as a team. Somehow a rumor got started that I had yelled at Madison and that's why she was crying so the owner of the airsoft field iced me for 3 weeks because I violated his \"no abusive language policy.\" I've known the guy for 10 freaking years and spent thousands of dollars at his field and he iced me because of rumor. This is how crazy this has gotten. \n\n\nI think everyone on my team wants to either kick me out of the leadership position or quit altogether and form a new a team. To me, I was just enforcing the rules we all agreed upon and we all agreed that we would treat her the same. I think everyone thinks I'm an asshole. Our team meeting is tomorrow night and I would love to at least get some outside opinion on whether or not I'm an asshole so I know how to go into the meeting. \n\n\nthank you for reading. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a guy who's the team leader of an Airsoft team. They have strict rules about uniforms being military-realistic, no bright colors, anime stuff, etc. The team has an official ranking and participates in tournaments. \n\nThen Madison, a girl who's a model with a big Instagram following, joins. Initially, the team leader thought she might not stick around, but she turned out to be good at Airsoft. However, she started not following the team's rules. First, her hair was dyed bright red with ponytails, and when he told her to cover it, she took off the beanie during a game. Then later, she wore a belly shirt and showed off welts from being shot, which the team leader considered against their military-realistic policy.\n\nThe team leader tried to enforce the rules, but the team and others at the field supported Madison. When he finally asked her to leave, she cried, and this led to his team members turning against him, some quitting, and even the field owner banning him due to a rumor he yelled at her. Now he's asking if he's in the wrong.\n\nHmm. So, the key points are about enforcing team rules. The team had established these rules before, and as the leader, he's responsible for enforcing them. But the problem is that when he tried to enforce the rules on Madison, there was a lot of backlash. The question is whether he overstepped or if the team's reaction was unfair.\n\nFirst, from the team leader's perspective, he's maintaining the rules they all agreed to. The team had a policy that they treat new members the same, and there's no exception for Madison. So if she violated the rules, it's his duty to enforce them. However, maybe there's a cultural aspect here. Since the team is 95% male, and a female joining might bring different expectations. Also, the team leader's initial hesitation (thinking she was just there for Instagram) might have contributed to a lack of clear communication later. \n\nThe hair incident: he told her to cover it, but she took off the beanie. The team then told him he was being too hard. Perhaps the rule about hair is too strict? If the hair is covered under the helmet, maybe the style isn't as important. But the team had the rule, so he had to enforce it. However, if the team itself is now against him for enforcing the rules, that's a problem. Maybe the rules are not well-communicated or are inconsistent. \n\nThen there's the uniform purchase issue. She was supposed to order the gear for the tournament, but kept saying she's working on it. The team leader kicked her off for not following through. That's part of the team rules for being on the competition team. So if she didn't have the gear, she couldn't participate in tournaments. But maybe the team leader didn't follow up enough or gave her enough time? Or maybe the team's support for her made it impossible to enforce the rules, leading to his own team turning against him.\n\nThe other issue is the team's reaction. After Madison cried, the team and others at the field turned against him. The team leader had a history of being strict, and maybe the team felt he was being unfair. The field owner's ban based on a rumor is problematic, but that's more about the rumor than his actual actions. \n\nSo, is the team leader in the wrong? Well, he was enforcing rules that were agreed upon. However, maybe the way he handled it could have been better. For example, instead of immediately kicking her off, could he have given her more chances or had a private conversation? Also, the team's reaction suggests that the rules might not be clear or that the team leader's strictness was unbalanced. If the team's culture is such that they prioritize inclusivity or flexibility for good players, then maybe the rules aren't being applied consistently. \n\nAnother angle: the team leader's initial judgment based on her Instagram profile might have contributed to a bias. He thought she was there for attention but ended up being impressed. However, that initial bias might have affected his interactions with her. Also, the team's reaction to her crying might indicate that the team leader's approach was too harsh, given that she might have felt pressured or not understood the rules properly. \n\nBut the team leader's role is to enforce the rules. If the rules are clear and agreed upon, then he's not wrong for enforcing them. However, if the rules are too rigid and not communicated well, or if there's a double standard (others might not follow the rules but he only enforces it on her), then he's in the wrong. The team's support for her and the subsequent backlash suggest that maybe the team leader's strictness was too much, especially if other members had similar infractions but weren't punished. \n\nIn conclusion, it's possible that the team leader is enforcing existing rules, which is his duty, but the way he enforced them and the team's reaction could indicate that the rules are either not clear or that there's a lack of consistency in enforcement. The team's support for Madison might stem from the dynamics of having a female in a male-dominated sport, leading to different expectations. Therefore, the team leader might not be entirely in the wrong, but his approach could have been more diplomatic. However, given the rules he set, he's technically not in the wrong for enforcing them. But if the rules are not consistently applied, then he could be at fault. The answer might be a bit nuanced, but based on the information given, the team leader was following the rules he established, so he's not in the wrong (B). However, if there's inconsistency in enforcement, then A. But the story doesn't mention others violating the rules. So probably B.\n"
