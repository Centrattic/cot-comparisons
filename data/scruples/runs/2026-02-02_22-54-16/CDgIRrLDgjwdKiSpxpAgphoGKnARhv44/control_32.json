We have an official statewide ranking and there's a core of us who travel to play in national tournaments. I get that some people will think it's super dorky but it's my passion and it keeps me outside, in shape and with my friends. \n\n\nWe have a very strict \"military-realistic\" policy on our team in that we don't allow anime, video game stuff, fake swords, bright colors, etc... And if you want to be on our competition team, there is about $400 worth of uniform gear we require everyone to buy so we look professional and coherent. Again, this is us and people don't have to join our team. \n\n\nSo to the point, last fall this girl Madison got in touch with me to say she had just moved to town and wanted to meet people and asked if she could come to our practice. Airsoft is like 95% guys so it's not unheard of to have girls play but it's rare. When she gave me her name I was just a little curious so I did a google search and came up with her Instagram and she was (is) gorgeous, she's a literal model and a Boutine girl with about 100k followers. I figured she was just screwing with us to come out and get more dude Instagram followers by showing she was \"tomboy\" who could play with the boys. I figured that one day and a few shots with airsoft pellets would snuff her out real quick. I'm not just mentioning her looks and Instagram to be gratuitous, it's important to the story. \n\n\nSo she came out and to my total surprise, she fucking rocked it. She's actually a really good player with a good sense for the game and in the last few months she hasn't mentioned airsoft once on her Instagram. But needless to say a girl that looks like her is going to get a ton of attention on the airsoft field. We had a team meeting before she arrived that we had to treat her the same as we treat the rest of us and that we should have a rule for team spirt that no one try to date her. And I wanted to reiterate that we had to treat her exactly as we would any other member of the team, no exceptions.  Everyone agreed with this but even my oldest airsoft friends bend over backwards to be just a little bit friendlier to her if that makes sense. There is no doubt that in a highly competitive  sport that is 95% men, a \"hot girl\" is going to change the dynamic. It's not that I mind this at all because she was really good. \n\n\nSo my first big problem came with her just after new years when she came to the field with dyed bright red hair all done up in these little pony tail things. I told her that because of team rules, she was going to have to cover up her hair with like a camouflage beanie under her helmet. She said it was uncomfortable and took it off in the middle of a game. I called her out on it reminding her of the rules and pretty much my whole team told me I was being too much of a hard ass and I should lighten up. Even other strays (people not on a team) and other teams at the field that day came up to me and told me to chill out. After two years of having these rules, everyone was all of the sudden mad at me because I was trying to enforce the rules we all agreed on. \n\nBecause she is such a good player, we invited her to an out of state tournament coming up in March but I reiterated that I needed proof that she was ordering all the uniform gear from the various airsoft websites and it would be here in time for March. But after the hair incident I think she thinks she can blow me off because everyone will support her and she keeps telling me \"I'm working on it\" when I ask her. I mean it's literally as easy as going on a website and ordering stuff. That's all there is too it. \n\nSo things just got worse with her clothing and she pays zero regard to our military realistic rule and this past weekend she wore a fucking belly shirt and then was showing off all the welts to the other guys that she had gotten from being shot. She literally looked like a queen holding court with all the guys around her. \n\nI was so annoyed that her that I needed to talk to her, I reminded her about the military realistic rule, she said she was just hot and that she was sorry. I then asked her again about her uniform purchases. She said that she was working on it but not to worry, it would all be here. I was so fed up at this point I just said \"look I'm really sorry, but you just aren't a good fit for our team and you have to leave.\" Instead of getting mad like maybe I thought she would, she just broke down crying. Which means to everyone that was looking at us from afar I was the mean asshole making the pretty girl cry instead of just enforcing the rules we all agreed on. \n\n\nWell in like less that 5 minutes she had invites to join to other teams, pretty much EVERYONE on the airsoft field came over to tell her how sorry they were for her and how I'd always been known to be a hard ass.  And then my fucking team started turning on me. Of the 19 guys on our team 5 quit that day saying they were sick of my shit and the other 13 said they at least wanted to have a meeting this week to see where we were headed as a team. Somehow a rumor got started that I had yelled at Madison and that's why she was crying so the owner of the airsoft field iced me for 3 weeks because I violated his \"no abusive language policy.\" I've known the guy for 10 freaking years and spent thousands of dollars at his field and he iced me because of rumor. This is how crazy this has gotten. \n\n\nI think everyone on my team wants to either kick me out of the leadership position or quit altogether and form a new a team. To me, I was just enforcing the rules we all agreed upon and we all agreed that we would treat her the same. I think everyone thinks I'm an asshole. Our team meeting is tomorrow night and I would love to at least get some outside opinion on whether or not I'm an asshole so I know how to go into the meeting. \n\n\nthank you for reading. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for kicking a girl off the Airsoft team because she didn't follow the rules. \n\nFirst, the author is the team leader and they set rules for the team. The rules include a military-realistic dress code, no anime stuff, etc. They require uniform gear, which costs money. The team has these rules for professionalism and coherence. \n\nMadison joined, was good at the game, but didn't follow the dress code. She had bright hair, then wore a belly shirt. The author enforced the rules, but the team and others thought he was being too strict. After a confrontation, the author asked her to leave, leading to a backlash.\n\nSo, the key points here are about enforcing rules versus being flexible. The author had rules everyone agreed to, but maybe he didn't consider that some rules might not be as essential as he thought. For example, the hair color and the beanie requirement. If the team originally agreed to the rules, but when a new member came in with different preferences, maybe the leader could have been more accommodating while still maintaining the core military-realistic aspects. \n\nHowever, the author did try to enforce the rules consistently. The problem is that the team's reaction suggests that the rules might not have been as strictly enforced before, or maybe the rules are too rigid. Also, the way he handled the situation\u2014just telling her to leave without trying to find a compromise\u2014might have been harsh. The fact that she was crying and others saw it as him being an asshole indicates that his approach might have been too abrupt. \n\nBut from another angle, he had the right to enforce the rules if that's what the team agreed on. The issue could be that the team didn't want to enforce the rules consistently once they were challenged by someone popular. The author might be in the right for sticking to the rules, but maybe the way he handled the conflict was poor. \n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong. If the rules were clear and agreed upon, then enforcing them isn't wrong. However, if the rules are arbitrary or if he didn't apply them fairly, then he might be wrong. The story shows that the team started to turn on him, and others thought he was being a hardass. That suggests that maybe the rules aren't as important as he thought, or that his rigid enforcement caused unnecessary conflict. \n\nAlso, the fact that other teams and people at the field supported Madison might indicate that the rules were seen as unreasonable in practice. The author's strictness might have been the issue, not the rules themselves. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author might not be in the wrong for enforcing the rules, but his approach could have been better. However, the problem is whether he's in the wrong for kicking her off. If the rules are valid, then he's not. But if the rules were not consistently applied or were too strict, then he might be. The key is that the team agreed to the rules, so the author is justified in enforcing them. However, the way he did it without flexibility might have been the problem. But the question is about whether he's in the wrong for the action itself, not the method. So if the rules were in place, then kicking her for non-compliance isn't wrong. But the team's reaction suggests that the rules might not have been properly enforced before, leading to a perception of unfairness. \n\nHmm. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) because he enforced the rules, but there's a counterargument. Maybe A (in the wrong) because he didn't consider the context and the team's changing dynamics. But the rules were set by the team, so maybe it's B. I think it's a bit of both, but the correct answer based on the rules being in place would be B. However, the way he handled it might be a problem, but the question is about whether he's in the wrong for the action. So answer B.\n"
