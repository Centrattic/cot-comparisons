We have an official statewide ranking and there's a core of us who travel to play in national tournaments. I get that some people will think it's super dorky but it's my passion and it keeps me outside, in shape and with my friends. \n\n\nWe have a very strict \"military-realistic\" policy on our team in that we don't allow anime, video game stuff, fake swords, bright colors, etc... And if you want to be on our competition team, there is about $400 worth of uniform gear we require everyone to buy so we look professional and coherent. Again, this is us and people don't have to join our team. \n\n\nSo to the point, last fall this girl Madison got in touch with me to say she had just moved to town and wanted to meet people and asked if she could come to our practice. Airsoft is like 95% guys so it's not unheard of to have girls play but it's rare. When she gave me her name I was just a little curious so I did a google search and came up with her Instagram and she was (is) gorgeous, she's a literal model and a Boutine girl with about 100k followers. I figured she was just screwing with us to come out and get more dude Instagram followers by showing she was \"tomboy\" who could play with the boys. I figured that one day and a few shots with airsoft pellets would snuff her out real quick. I'm not just mentioning her looks and Instagram to be gratuitous, it's important to the story. \n\n\nSo she came out and to my total surprise, she fucking rocked it. She's actually a really good player with a good sense for the game and in the last few months she hasn't mentioned airsoft once on her Instagram. But needless to say a girl that looks like her is going to get a ton of attention on the airsoft field. We had a team meeting before she arrived that we had to treat her the same as we treat the rest of us and that we should have a rule for team spirt that no one try to date her. And I wanted to reiterate that we had to treat her exactly as we would any other member of the team, no exceptions.  Everyone agreed with this but even my oldest airsoft friends bend over backwards to be just a little bit friendlier to her if that makes sense. There is no doubt that in a highly competitive  sport that is 95% men, a \"hot girl\" is going to change the dynamic. It's not that I mind this at all because she was really good. \n\n\nSo my first big problem came with her just after new years when she came to the field with dyed bright red hair all done up in these little pony tail things. I told her that because of team rules, she was going to have to cover up her hair with like a camouflage beanie under her helmet. She said it was uncomfortable and took it off in the middle of a game. I called her out on it reminding her of the rules and pretty much my whole team told me I was being too much of a hard ass and I should lighten up. Even other strays (people not on a team) and other teams at the field that day came up to me and told me to chill out. After two years of having these rules, everyone was all of the sudden mad at me because I was trying to enforce the rules we all agreed on. \n\nBecause she is such a good player, we invited her to an out of state tournament coming up in March but I reiterated that I needed proof that she was ordering all the uniform gear from the various airsoft websites and it would be here in time for March. But after the hair incident I think she thinks she can blow me off because everyone will support her and she keeps telling me \"I'm working on it\" when I ask her. I mean it's literally as easy as going on a website and ordering stuff. That's all there is too it. \n\nSo things just got worse with her clothing and she pays zero regard to our military realistic rule and this past weekend she wore a fucking belly shirt and then was showing off all the welts to the other guys that she had gotten from being shot. She literally looked like a queen holding court with all the guys around her. \n\nI was so annoyed that her that I needed to talk to her, I reminded her about the military realistic rule, she said she was just hot and that she was sorry. I then asked her again about her uniform purchases. She said that she was working on it but not to worry, it would all be here. I was so fed up at this point I just said \"look I'm really sorry, but you just aren't a good fit for our team and you have to leave.\" Instead of getting mad like maybe I thought she would, she just broke down crying. Which means to everyone that was looking at us from afar I was the mean asshole making the pretty girl cry instead of just enforcing the rules we all agreed on. \n\n\nWell in like less that 5 minutes she had invites to join to other teams, pretty much EVERYONE on the airsoft field came over to tell her how sorry they were for her and how I'd always been known to be a hard ass.  And then my fucking team started turning on me. Of the 19 guys on our team 5 quit that day saying they were sick of my shit and the other 13 said they at least wanted to have a meeting this week to see where we were headed as a team. Somehow a rumor got started that I had yelled at Madison and that's why she was crying so the owner of the airsoft field iced me for 3 weeks because I violated his \"no abusive language policy.\" I've known the guy for 10 freaking years and spent thousands of dollars at his field and he iced me because of rumor. This is how crazy this has gotten. \n\n\nI think everyone on my team wants to either kick me out of the leadership position or quit altogether and form a new a team. To me, I was just enforcing the rules we all agreed upon and we all agreed that we would treat her the same. I think everyone thinks I'm an asshole. Our team meeting is tomorrow night and I would love to at least get some outside opinion on whether or not I'm an asshole so I know how to go into the meeting. \n\n\nthank you for reading. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the person who kicked the girl off the team is in the wrong. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe team has strict rules about uniforms and military realism. The girl, Madison, joined and showed talent, but didn't follow the rules, like her hair color and clothing. The team leader enforced the rules, leading to conflict. The team leader felt she wasn't compliant even after being reminded, so he asked her to leave. The team and others took her side, leading to backlash against him.\n\nFirst, the rules were set before she joined. As a team leader, enforcing the rules is part of the role. However, maybe the way he handled it could be questioned. For instance, the hair rule: he told her to wear a beanie, but she found it uncomfortable and took it off. The team leader might have been too rigid here. Maybe if he had offered an alternative solution, like a different covering that's comfortable, instead of insisting on the beanie.\n\nThen there's the issue of the uniform gear. She kept saying she was working on it but didn't follow through. The team leader needed proof that the gear would arrive in time for the tournament. If she didn't have it, he had a right to remove her from the team because the gear is essential for professionalism and competition standards. But maybe he should have given her another chance or checked in more frequently.\n\nThe problem comes when enforcing rules leads to such a strong negative reaction. The team leader mentions that others thought he was being too harsh, and even the owner of the field took action against him. This suggests that his approach might have been too strict or that the rules weren't communicated clearly. Also, the fact that the team turned against him and quit indicates that the enforcement might have been seen as unfair, especially if the rules were not consistently applied in the past.\n\nAnother factor is the team's dynamic. The team leader anticipated that the team would treat Madison differently, which they did. The leader tried to set guidelines to prevent favoritism, but the team still bent over backwards for her. This could mean that the rules aren't being followed consistently, leading to double standards. The leader might have been trying to enforce the rules to maintain fairness, but if the team isn't following them for others, then it's a team-wide issue.\n\nThe leader's response to her breaking the rules by asking her to leave is in line with the team's rules, but the way he communicated it could have been better. Making her cry in front of others might have contributed to the perception of being an asshole, even if he was following the rules. Public confrontations can escalate tensions, and a more private discussion might have been more effective.\n\nIn summary, the team leader had the right to enforce the rules, but his approach might have lacked flexibility and consideration for the situation. The team's reaction and the backlash suggest that the enforcement was too rigid, leading to a loss of team cohesion. However, the core issue is whether the rules were clear and consistently applied. If they were, then the leader isn't necessarily wrong, but the handling of the situation left room for improvement.\n"
