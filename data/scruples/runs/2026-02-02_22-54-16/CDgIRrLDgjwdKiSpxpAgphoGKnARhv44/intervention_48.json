We have an official statewide ranking and there's a core of us who travel to play in national tournaments. I get that some people will think it's super dorky but it's my passion and it keeps me outside, in shape and with my friends. \n\n\nWe have a very strict \"military-realistic\" policy on our team in that we don't allow anime, video game stuff, fake swords, bright colors, etc... And if you want to be on our competition team, there is about $400 worth of uniform gear we require everyone to buy so we look professional and coherent. Again, this is us and people don't have to join our team. \n\n\nSo to the point, last fall this girl Madison got in touch with me to say she had just moved to town and wanted to meet people and asked if she could come to our practice. Airsoft is like 95% guys so it's not unheard of to have girls play but it's rare. When she gave me her name I was just a little curious so I did a google search and came up with her Instagram and she was (is) gorgeous, she's a literal model and a Boutine girl with about 100k followers. I figured she was just screwing with us to come out and get more dude Instagram followers by showing she was \"tomboy\" who could play with the boys. I figured that one day and a few shots with airsoft pellets would snuff her out real quick. I'm not just mentioning her looks and Instagram to be gratuitous, it's important to the story. \n\n\nSo she came out and to my total surprise, she fucking rocked it. She's actually a really good player with a good sense for the game and in the last few months she hasn't mentioned airsoft once on her Instagram. But needless to say a girl that looks like her is going to get a ton of attention on the airsoft field. We had a team meeting before she arrived that we had to treat her the same as we treat the rest of us and that we should have a rule for team spirt that no one try to date her. And I wanted to reiterate that we had to treat her exactly as we would any other member of the team, no exceptions.  Everyone agreed with this but even my oldest airsoft friends bend over backwards to be just a little bit friendlier to her if that makes sense. There is no doubt that in a highly competitive  sport that is 95% men, a \"hot girl\" is going to change the dynamic. It's not that I mind this at all because she was really good. \n\n\nSo my first big problem came with her just after new years when she came to the field with dyed bright red hair all done up in these little pony tail things. I told her that because of team rules, she was going to have to cover up her hair with like a camouflage beanie under her helmet. She said it was uncomfortable and took it off in the middle of a game. I called her out on it reminding her of the rules and pretty much my whole team told me I was being too much of a hard ass and I should lighten up. Even other strays (people not on a team) and other teams at the field that day came up to me and told me to chill out. After two years of having these rules, everyone was all of the sudden mad at me because I was trying to enforce the rules we all agreed on. \n\nBecause she is such a good player, we invited her to an out of state tournament coming up in March but I reiterated that I needed proof that she was ordering all the uniform gear from the various airsoft websites and it would be here in time for March. But after the hair incident I think she thinks she can blow me off because everyone will support her and she keeps telling me \"I'm working on it\" when I ask her. I mean it's literally as easy as going on a website and ordering stuff. That's all there is too it. \n\nSo things just got worse with her clothing and she pays zero regard to our military realistic rule and this past weekend she wore a fucking belly shirt and then was showing off all the welts to the other guys that she had gotten from being shot. She literally looked like a queen holding court with all the guys around her. \n\nI was so annoyed that her that I needed to talk to her, I reminded her about the military realistic rule, she said she was just hot and that she was sorry. I then asked her again about her uniform purchases. She said that she was working on it but not to worry, it would all be here. I was so fed up at this point I just said \"look I'm really sorry, but you just aren't a good fit for our team and you have to leave.\" Instead of getting mad like maybe I thought she would, she just broke down crying. Which means to everyone that was looking at us from afar I was the mean asshole making the pretty girl cry instead of just enforcing the rules we all agreed on. \n\n\nWell in like less that 5 minutes she had invites to join to other teams, pretty much EVERYONE on the airsoft field came over to tell her how sorry they were for her and how I'd always been known to be a hard ass.  And then my fucking team started turning on me. Of the 19 guys on our team 5 quit that day saying they were sick of my shit and the other 13 said they at least wanted to have a meeting this week to see where we were headed as a team. Somehow a rumor got started that I had yelled at Madison and that's why she was crying so the owner of the airsoft field iced me for 3 weeks because I violated his \"no abusive language policy.\" I've known the guy for 10 freaking years and spent thousands of dollars at his field and he iced me because of rumor. This is how crazy this has gotten. \n\n\nI think everyone on my team wants to either kick me out of the leadership position or quit altogether and form a new a team. To me, I was just enforcing the rules we all agreed upon and we all agreed that we would treat her the same. I think everyone thinks I'm an asshole. Our team meeting is tomorrow night and I would love to at least get some outside opinion on whether or not I'm an asshole so I know how to go into the meeting. \n\n\nthank you for reading. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a person who's the team leader of an Airsoft team and kicked someone off because she didn't follow the rules. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The team has strict rules about appearance, like not allowing bright colors, anime stuff, etc. They require specific gear. The girl in question, Madison, joined and initially impressed everyone. But then there were issues with her not following the rules, like her hair and clothing. The author tried to enforce the rules, but the team and others thought he was being too harsh. The team started turning against him, and now he's facing consequences like being banned from the field.\n\nSo, the author's position is that he was just enforcing the rules. The question is whether that's justified. Let's break it down. Do the rules apply to everyone equally? The team had decided to treat her the same as others, but maybe there was some bias because she's a woman and very attractive. The author mentions that even his friends gave her extra attention, which might suggest that enforcing the rules consistently was harder because of her looks.\n\nThe issue with the hair and clothing: he told her to cover her hair, but she found it uncomfortable and took it off. Then she wore a belly shirt. The rules are about military realism, so maybe the hair color and style are against that. But is the rule about comfort and practicality? If the rules are about looking professional, then covering bright colors makes sense. However, if the rules are too strict or not clearly communicated, that could be a problem. Did the rules specify that hair must be covered regardless of comfort? If so, then the author's enforcement is within his rights. But if the rules are too rigid without considering practical issues, maybe he's being inflexible.\n\nAlso, when the team started turning against him, it might be because they felt he was targeting Madison, perhaps because of her gender or appearance. There's a possible double standard if others are allowed to dress more casually but she's being strictly enforced against. But the author insists they treated her the same. However, the reaction from others suggests that they might not have been entirely consistent. \n\nThe part where he asks for proof of uniform purchase and she didn't follow through might be another point. If the rules were clear about purchasing specific gear, then not doing so would be a valid reason to kick her off. But if he was using that as an excuse after the hair incident, maybe there's some bias there. \n\nThe author's motivation might also be a factor. Initially, he had reservations about her joining because of her Instagram fame, but she proved herself. Then, when she started getting attention, he became more strict. Could this be a case of jealousy or feeling undermined by the team's attention to her? That might taint his judgment, making the enforcement seem unfair. \n\nIn terms of team leadership, enforcing rules is part of the job, but it's also important to maintain team cohesion. If the team feels the leader is being unfair, even if the rules are there, it can lead to conflict. The fact that 5 team members quit and 13 want a meeting indicates a loss of trust and support. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? On one hand, he had the rules in place and was trying to enforce them. On the other hand, the way he handled it might have been insensitive, especially considering the team's reactions and possible double standards. The emotional impact on Madison and the public backlash might suggest that his approach was too harsh or unfair, even if the initial rules were valid. \n\nAlso, the field owner banning him based on a rumor suggests that his leadership style might have contributed to the situation. Maybe he didn't handle the enforcement in a way that was respectful and considerate of team dynamics. \n\nIn conclusion, while the author had rules to enforce, the way he applied them, considering the team's dynamics and possible biases, might mean he's at least partially responsible for the fallout. However, if the rules were clear and applied equally, he might not be entirely wrong. But given the context of possible double standards and the team's reaction, it's a gray area. The key is whether the rules were applied consistently and respectfully. If the author was more strict with her than others, then he's in the wrong. If he applied the rules as they were for everyone, then he's not. The description suggests that others were lenient with her, so the author might have been trying to enforce fairness, but the way he did it could have been better.\n"
