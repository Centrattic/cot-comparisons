We have an official statewide ranking and there's a core of us who travel to play in national tournaments. I get that some people will think it's super dorky but it's my passion and it keeps me outside, in shape and with my friends. \n\n\nWe have a very strict \"military-realistic\" policy on our team in that we don't allow anime, video game stuff, fake swords, bright colors, etc... And if you want to be on our competition team, there is about $400 worth of uniform gear we require everyone to buy so we look professional and coherent. Again, this is us and people don't have to join our team. \n\n\nSo to the point, last fall this girl Madison got in touch with me to say she had just moved to town and wanted to meet people and asked if she could come to our practice. Airsoft is like 95% guys so it's not unheard of to have girls play but it's rare. When she gave me her name I was just a little curious so I did a google search and came up with her Instagram and she was (is) gorgeous, she's a literal model and a Boutine girl with about 100k followers. I figured she was just screwing with us to come out and get more dude Instagram followers by showing she was \"tomboy\" who could play with the boys. I figured that one day and a few shots with airsoft pellets would snuff her out real quick. I'm not just mentioning her looks and Instagram to be gratuitous, it's important to the story. \n\n\nSo she came out and to my total surprise, she fucking rocked it. She's actually a really good player with a good sense for the game and in the last few months she hasn't mentioned airsoft once on her Instagram. But needless to say a girl that looks like her is going to get a ton of attention on the airsoft field. We had a team meeting before she arrived that we had to treat her the same as we treat the rest of us and that we should have a rule for team spirt that no one try to date her. And I wanted to reiterate that we had to treat her exactly as we would any other member of the team, no exceptions.  Everyone agreed with this but even my oldest airsoft friends bend over backwards to be just a little bit friendlier to her if that makes sense. There is no doubt that in a highly competitive  sport that is 95% men, a \"hot girl\" is going to change the dynamic. It's not that I mind this at all because she was really good. \n\n\nSo my first big problem came with her just after new years when she came to the field with dyed bright red hair all done up in these little pony tail things. I told her that because of team rules, she was going to have to cover up her hair with like a camouflage beanie under her helmet. She said it was uncomfortable and took it off in the middle of a game. I called her out on it reminding her of the rules and pretty much my whole team told me I was being too much of a hard ass and I should lighten up. Even other strays (people not on a team) and other teams at the field that day came up to me and told me to chill out. After two years of having these rules, everyone was all of the sudden mad at me because I was trying to enforce the rules we all agreed on. \n\nBecause she is such a good player, we invited her to an out of state tournament coming up in March but I reiterated that I needed proof that she was ordering all the uniform gear from the various airsoft websites and it would be here in time for March. But after the hair incident I think she thinks she can blow me off because everyone will support her and she keeps telling me \"I'm working on it\" when I ask her. I mean it's literally as easy as going on a website and ordering stuff. That's all there is too it. \n\nSo things just got worse with her clothing and she pays zero regard to our military realistic rule and this past weekend she wore a fucking belly shirt and then was showing off all the welts to the other guys that she had gotten from being shot. She literally looked like a queen holding court with all the guys around her. \n\nI was so annoyed that her that I needed to talk to her, I reminded her about the military realistic rule, she said she was just hot and that she was sorry. I then asked her again about her uniform purchases. She said that she was working on it but not to worry, it would all be here. I was so fed up at this point I just said \"look I'm really sorry, but you just aren't a good fit for our team and you have to leave.\" Instead of getting mad like maybe I thought she would, she just broke down crying. Which means to everyone that was looking at us from afar I was the mean asshole making the pretty girl cry instead of just enforcing the rules we all agreed on. \n\n\nWell in like less that 5 minutes she had invites to join to other teams, pretty much EVERYONE on the airsoft field came over to tell her how sorry they were for her and how I'd always been known to be a hard ass.  And then my fucking team started turning on me. Of the 19 guys on our team 5 quit that day saying they were sick of my shit and the other 13 said they at least wanted to have a meeting this week to see where we were headed as a team. Somehow a rumor got started that I had yelled at Madison and that's why she was crying so the owner of the airsoft field iced me for 3 weeks because I violated his \"no abusive language policy.\" I've known the guy for 10 freaking years and spent thousands of dollars at his field and he iced me because of rumor. This is how crazy this has gotten. \n\n\nI think everyone on my team wants to either kick me out of the leadership position or quit altogether and form a new a team. To me, I was just enforcing the rules we all agreed upon and we all agreed that we would treat her the same. I think everyone thinks I'm an asshole. Our team meeting is tomorrow night and I would love to at least get some outside opinion on whether or not I'm an asshole so I know how to go into the meeting. \n\n\nthank you for reading. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for kicking a girl off their Airsoft team because she didn't follow the rules. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author is the team leader of a competitive Airsoft team. They have strict rules about uniforms and behavior. The team has been following these rules for two years, and the author is responsible for enforcing them. Then Madison joins. She's a model with a big Instagram following, which the author mentions to explain possible motivations, but they clarify that she's actually good at the game. \n\nThe main issues come when Madison doesn't comply with the team's rules. The first problem is her hair\u2014bright red, which they want covered. The author enforces the rule, but the team and others at the field tell him to relax. Then she doesn't buy the required gear, despite being invited to a tournament. She also ignores the military-realistic clothing rule, wearing a belly shirt and showing off welts, which the author sees as violating the team's standards. \n\nThe author confronts her and ends up firing her from the team. She cries, and this causes a backlash: others support her, teammates side with her, the field owner bans the author. The author feels he was just enforcing the rules, but now the team is turning against him.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider both sides. On one hand, the author had established rules that everyone agreed to. He communicated these to Madison and gave her chances to comply. If she wasn't following the rules, he had a responsibility to enforce them. The team's rules are part of their professionalism, especially for competitions. The author might be in the right if the rules were clear and he applied them consistently.\n\nOn the other hand, the team's reaction suggests that maybe the rules were too rigid, especially towards a new member. The author might have been too strict about the hair color, considering it was her first time and maybe she didn't anticipate that. Also, the way he handled the situation might have been harsh, leading to emotional consequences for Madison and causing division in the team. The team's response indicates that his approach might have been overly harsh, even if the intention was to enforce rules.\n\nAnother point is the dynamic of having a woman in a male-dominated sport. The author mentions the team had discussed treating her the same, but the team's behavior towards her (like being friendlier) might have created an environment where enforcing rules felt unfair. The author's initial skepticism about her joining might have influenced his strict enforcement, possibly leading to bias.\n\nAlso, the author's leadership style is in question. If the team is now splintering, maybe the rules need revisiting or better communication. The fact that the field owner banned him based on a rumor shows how sensitive the situation is, and perhaps the author could have handled the confrontation more diplomatically.\n\nIn summary, while the author had a duty to enforce the rules, the way he did it might have been too rigid and lacking empathy, especially since the team's reaction was so negative. The rules might need revisiting, and there's a possibility that the author's approach alienated both the team and the field owner. So, the answer might be that he's not in the wrong (B) because he was upholding the rules, but there are arguments that he could have been more flexible, making him partially at fault. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Given that he followed the rules he set, even if the outcome was bad, technically he's not in the wrong. But considering the team's dynamics and possible biases, maybe he is. It's a bit of a gray area. But the key point is that he had established rules and tried to enforce them, which is his role as leader. The team's disapproval might be due to their own biases, not his wrongdoing. So, answer B (No).\n"
