We have an official statewide ranking and there's a core of us who travel to play in national tournaments. I get that some people will think it's super dorky but it's my passion and it keeps me outside, in shape and with my friends. \n\n\nWe have a very strict \"military-realistic\" policy on our team in that we don't allow anime, video game stuff, fake swords, bright colors, etc... And if you want to be on our competition team, there is about $400 worth of uniform gear we require everyone to buy so we look professional and coherent. Again, this is us and people don't have to join our team. \n\n\nSo to the point, last fall this girl Madison got in touch with me to say she had just moved to town and wanted to meet people and asked if she could come to our practice. Airsoft is like 95% guys so it's not unheard of to have girls play but it's rare. When she gave me her name I was just a little curious so I did a google search and came up with her Instagram and she was (is) gorgeous, she's a literal model and a Boutine girl with about 100k followers. I figured she was just screwing with us to come out and get more dude Instagram followers by showing she was \"tomboy\" who could play with the boys. I figured that one day and a few shots with airsoft pellets would snuff her out real quick. I'm not just mentioning her looks and Instagram to be gratuitous, it's important to the story. \n\n\nSo she came out and to my total surprise, she fucking rocked it. She's actually a really good player with a good sense for the game and in the last few months she hasn't mentioned airsoft once on her Instagram. But needless to say a girl that looks like her is going to get a ton of attention on the airsoft field. We had a team meeting before she arrived that we had to treat her the same as we treat the rest of us and that we should have a rule for team spirt that no one try to date her. And I wanted to reiterate that we had to treat her exactly as we would any other member of the team, no exceptions.  Everyone agreed with this but even my oldest airsoft friends bend over backwards to be just a little bit friendlier to her if that makes sense. There is no doubt that in a highly competitive  sport that is 95% men, a \"hot girl\" is going to change the dynamic. It's not that I mind this at all because she was really good. \n\n\nSo my first big problem came with her just after new years when she came to the field with dyed bright red hair all done up in these little pony tail things. I told her that because of team rules, she was going to have to cover up her hair with like a camouflage beanie under her helmet. She said it was uncomfortable and took it off in the middle of a game. I called her out on it reminding her of the rules and pretty much my whole team told me I was being too much of a hard ass and I should lighten up. Even other strays (people not on a team) and other teams at the field that day came up to me and told me to chill out. After two years of having these rules, everyone was all of the sudden mad at me because I was trying to enforce the rules we all agreed on. \n\nBecause she is such a good player, we invited her to an out of state tournament coming up in March but I reiterated that I needed proof that she was ordering all the uniform gear from the various airsoft websites and it would be here in time for March. But after the hair incident I think she thinks she can blow me off because everyone will support her and she keeps telling me \"I'm working on it\" when I ask her. I mean it's literally as easy as going on a website and ordering stuff. That's all there is too it. \n\nSo things just got worse with her clothing and she pays zero regard to our military realistic rule and this past weekend she wore a fucking belly shirt and then was showing off all the welts to the other guys that she had gotten from being shot. She literally looked like a queen holding court with all the guys around her. \n\nI was so annoyed that her that I needed to talk to her, I reminded her about the military realistic rule, she said she was just hot and that she was sorry. I then asked her again about her uniform purchases. She said that she was working on it but not to worry, it would all be here. I was so fed up at this point I just said \"look I'm really sorry, but you just aren't a good fit for our team and you have to leave.\" Instead of getting mad like maybe I thought she would, she just broke down crying. Which means to everyone that was looking at us from afar I was the mean asshole making the pretty girl cry instead of just enforcing the rules we all agreed on. \n\n\nWell in like less that 5 minutes she had invites to join to other teams, pretty much EVERYONE on the airsoft field came over to tell her how sorry they were for her and how I'd always been known to be a hard ass.  And then my fucking team started turning on me. Of the 19 guys on our team 5 quit that day saying they were sick of my shit and the other 13 said they at least wanted to have a meeting this week to see where we were headed as a team. Somehow a rumor got started that I had yelled at Madison and that's why she was crying so the owner of the airsoft field iced me for 3 weeks because I violated his \"no abusive language policy.\" I've known the guy for 10 freaking years and spent thousands of dollars at his field and he iced me because of rumor. This is how crazy this has gotten. \n\n\nI think everyone on my team wants to either kick me out of the leadership position or quit altogether and form a new a team. To me, I was just enforcing the rules we all agreed upon and we all agreed that we would treat her the same. I think everyone thinks I'm an asshole. Our team meeting is tomorrow night and I would love to at least get some outside opinion on whether or not I'm an asshole so I know how to go into the meeting. \n\n\nthank you for reading. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that they're the team leader of an Airsoft team with strict rules, and they kicked a girl off the team because she wasn't following the rules. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong (answer A) or not (answer B).\n\nFirst, the author mentions they have strict rules about military realism, like no anime stuff, bright colors, etc. They also require uniform gear costing $400. The girl, Madison, joined and was good at the game but didn't follow the dress code\u2014bright red hair, belly shirt, etc. The author tried to enforce the rules but faced backlash from the team and others. Eventually, the author removed her from the team, which caused a lot of conflict, including teammates quitting or wanting to replace the leadership.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down:\n\n1. **Rules and Enforcement**: The team has clear rules that everyone agreed to. The author was enforcing these rules. If the rules are part of the team's official policies, then enforcing them is their duty as a leader. However, the question is whether the rules were applied fairly and consistently.\n\n2. **Treatment of Madison**: The author admits that the team had a meeting to treat her the same as others. However, the author also acknowledges that some team members were friendlier towards her, which might have created an uneven dynamic. The author's actions were to correct this by enforcing the rules strictly.\n\n3. **Communication and Flexibility**: The author gave Madison chances to comply (like covering her hair, ordering the uniform). When she didn't follow through, the author took action. But maybe there was a lack of clear communication or understanding why she wasn't complying. Did the author offer alternatives or explanations for the rules?\n\n4. **Reaction to Backlash**: The author faced significant backlash from the team and others. The team members who quit might have felt the author was being too strict. However, if the rules are part of the team's identity and necessary for their competitive edge, the author has a right to enforce them.\n\n5. **Public Perception and Emotional Impact**: The author's actions led to Madison crying, which was misinterpreted by others as abuse. This might suggest that the author didn't handle the situation with enough empathy or could have approached the confrontation differently.\n\n6. **Consistency in Enforcement**: The author mentions that the team agreed to treat her the same as others. If the rules are applied consistently, then the author is within their rights. However, if there was prior leniency with others that wasn't extended to Madison, that could be a problem. The user mentions that other team members and even other teams advised the author to be more lenient, which might indicate that the rules weren't as strict as the author claimed, or there was inconsistency.\n\n7. **Uniform Purchase Issue**: The author required proof of purchasing the gear. If Madison kept saying \"I'm working on it\" without following through, the author's decision to remove her might be justified if the gear is essential for the team's cohesion and professionalism.\n\nConsidering all these points, the author might be in the right because they were enforcing established rules. However, there are areas where handling the situation with more empathy or flexibility could have helped. The team's reaction and the fallout suggest that the author's approach might have been too rigid, leading to unnecessary conflict. But from a strict rule-enforcement standpoint, they might not be in the wrong.\n\nOn the other hand, if the rules were not applied consistently before Madison joined, or if the author didn't communicate the rules clearly, then the author could be at fault. The fact that even the team members and others found the author too strict might indicate that the rules weren't as non-negotiable as they thought, or that the author's leadership style was overly harsh.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author had the right to enforce the rules, the way they handled the situation and the resulting fallout might make them seem inflexible or insensitive, leading others to believe they were in the wrong. But strictly speaking, if the rules were clear and applied consistently, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. However, the social context and team dynamics complicate this.\n"
