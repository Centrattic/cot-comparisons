We have an official statewide ranking and there's a core of us who travel to play in national tournaments. I get that some people will think it's super dorky but it's my passion and it keeps me outside, in shape and with my friends. \n\n\nWe have a very strict \"military-realistic\" policy on our team in that we don't allow anime, video game stuff, fake swords, bright colors, etc... And if you want to be on our competition team, there is about $400 worth of uniform gear we require everyone to buy so we look professional and coherent. Again, this is us and people don't have to join our team. \n\n\nSo to the point, last fall this girl Madison got in touch with me to say she had just moved to town and wanted to meet people and asked if she could come to our practice. Airsoft is like 95% guys so it's not unheard of to have girls play but it's rare. When she gave me her name I was just a little curious so I did a google search and came up with her Instagram and she was (is) gorgeous, she's a literal model and a Boutine girl with about 100k followers. I figured she was just screwing with us to come out and get more dude Instagram followers by showing she was \"tomboy\" who could play with the boys. I figured that one day and a few shots with airsoft pellets would snuff her out real quick. I'm not just mentioning her looks and Instagram to be gratuitous, it's important to the story. \n\n\nSo she came out and to my total surprise, she fucking rocked it. She's actually a really good player with a good sense for the game and in the last few months she hasn't mentioned airsoft once on her Instagram. But needless to say a girl that looks like her is going to get a ton of attention on the airsoft field. We had a team meeting before she arrived that we had to treat her the same as we treat the rest of us and that we should have a rule for team spirt that no one try to date her. And I wanted to reiterate that we had to treat her exactly as we would any other member of the team, no exceptions.  Everyone agreed with this but even my oldest airsoft friends bend over backwards to be just a little bit friendlier to her if that makes sense. There is no doubt that in a highly competitive  sport that is 95% men, a \"hot girl\" is going to change the dynamic. It's not that I mind this at all because she was really good. \n\n\nSo my first big problem came with her just after new years when she came to the field with dyed bright red hair all done up in these little pony tail things. I told her that because of team rules, she was going to have to cover up her hair with like a camouflage beanie under her helmet. She said it was uncomfortable and took it off in the middle of a game. I called her out on it reminding her of the rules and pretty much my whole team told me I was being too much of a hard ass and I should lighten up. Even other strays (people not on a team) and other teams at the field that day came up to me and told me to chill out. After two years of having these rules, everyone was all of the sudden mad at me because I was trying to enforce the rules we all agreed on. \n\nBecause she is such a good player, we invited her to an out of state tournament coming up in March but I reiterated that I needed proof that she was ordering all the uniform gear from the various airsoft websites and it would be here in time for March. But after the hair incident I think she thinks she can blow me off because everyone will support her and she keeps telling me \"I'm working on it\" when I ask her. I mean it's literally as easy as going on a website and ordering stuff. That's all there is too it. \n\nSo things just got worse with her clothing and she pays zero regard to our military realistic rule and this past weekend she wore a fucking belly shirt and then was showing off all the welts to the other guys that she had gotten from being shot. She literally looked like a queen holding court with all the guys around her. \n\nI was so annoyed that her that I needed to talk to her, I reminded her about the military realistic rule, she said she was just hot and that she was sorry. I then asked her again about her uniform purchases. She said that she was working on it but not to worry, it would all be here. I was so fed up at this point I just said \"look I'm really sorry, but you just aren't a good fit for our team and you have to leave.\" Instead of getting mad like maybe I thought she would, she just broke down crying. Which means to everyone that was looking at us from afar I was the mean asshole making the pretty girl cry instead of just enforcing the rules we all agreed on. \n\n\nWell in like less that 5 minutes she had invites to join to other teams, pretty much EVERYONE on the airsoft field came over to tell her how sorry they were for her and how I'd always been known to be a hard ass.  And then my fucking team started turning on me. Of the 19 guys on our team 5 quit that day saying they were sick of my shit and the other 13 said they at least wanted to have a meeting this week to see where we were headed as a team. Somehow a rumor got started that I had yelled at Madison and that's why she was crying so the owner of the airsoft field iced me for 3 weeks because I violated his \"no abusive language policy.\" I've known the guy for 10 freaking years and spent thousands of dollars at his field and he iced me because of rumor. This is how crazy this has gotten. \n\n\nI think everyone on my team wants to either kick me out of the leadership position or quit altogether and form a new a team. To me, I was just enforcing the rules we all agreed upon and we all agreed that we would treat her the same. I think everyone thinks I'm an asshole. Our team meeting is tomorrow night and I would love to at least get some outside opinion on whether or not I'm an asshole so I know how to go into the meeting. \n\n\nthank you for reading. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for kicking Madison off the Airsoft team. The story is a bit detailed, so I need to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the setup: The author is the team leader with strict rules about military realism, including uniform gear and dress code. They have a $400 uniform requirement for the competition team. Madison joins, initially thought by the author to be there for attention, but she turns out to be a good player. However, she starts violating the dress code by having bright hair, wearing a belly shirt, and not following the uniform rules. The author enforces the rules, leading to conflict, and eventually asks her to leave. This causes a backlash from the team, the field owner, and other players. The author now faces losing his leadership role and team members.\n\nNow, the key points to consider. The author's stance is that he was enforcing the pre-established rules. He mentions that the team had agreed to treat everyone the same, including the dress code. The issue is whether enforcing those rules was done correctly or if there were other factors that made it unfair.\n\nOne angle is that the author did follow the rules they had set up. If the team agreed to those rules, then enforcing them seems fair. However, there's a potential issue of inconsistency or leniency towards others. The author mentions that his team and others started to side with Madison, suggesting that maybe the rules weren't applied equally before. For example, if other team members were allowed to have more casual styles or didn't have to follow the same strict dress code, that could be a problem.\n\nAnother point is the reaction to Madison's presence. The author and team had a discussion about not dating her, indicating that her presence was causing some distraction. However, the main issue was her violating the uniform rules. The author's strict enforcement might have been necessary for team cohesion, but perhaps the way it was handled contributed to the backlash. For instance, was the author too quick to remove her instead of working with her to comply with the rules? Did he give her enough time to adjust?\n\nMadison's perspective is also important. She might have felt that the rules were being applied more strictly to her because of her gender or her status as a model. This could be a case of double standards if others weren't held to the same standards. The fact that others in the airsoft community and even the author's team members sided with her suggests that there might be a perception of unfair treatment, especially given the attention she received.\n\nThe author's decision to let her go led to significant consequences: losing team members, a 3-week suspension, and rumors of yelling. This indicates that the enforcement might have been perceived as harsh, especially if Madison was a good player and the rules weren't consistently applied. The author's team and others might feel that he was too rigid and didn't consider the social dynamics, leading to a breakdown in team morale.\n\nIn terms of whether the author is in the wrong, it depends on whether the rules were consistently enforced. If other team members were allowed to have different styles without repercussions, then the author might be at fault for applying the rules unevenly. Additionally, the way the conflict was handled\u2014possibly without addressing underlying issues or communication\u2014could have exacerbated the situation. The author's initial assumption that Madison was only there for attention might have influenced his strict enforcement, leading to bias.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author had the right to enforce rules, the perception of inconsistency in application and the resulting fallout suggest that there might be valid criticisms. However, if the rules were truly applied equally and the author followed the agreed-upon procedures, then he might not be entirely at fault. The key is whether the enforcement was fair and consistent with how other team members were treated.\n"
