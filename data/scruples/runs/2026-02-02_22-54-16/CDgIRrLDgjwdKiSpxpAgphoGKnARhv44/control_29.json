We have an official statewide ranking and there's a core of us who travel to play in national tournaments. I get that some people will think it's super dorky but it's my passion and it keeps me outside, in shape and with my friends. \n\n\nWe have a very strict \"military-realistic\" policy on our team in that we don't allow anime, video game stuff, fake swords, bright colors, etc... And if you want to be on our competition team, there is about $400 worth of uniform gear we require everyone to buy so we look professional and coherent. Again, this is us and people don't have to join our team. \n\n\nSo to the point, last fall this girl Madison got in touch with me to say she had just moved to town and wanted to meet people and asked if she could come to our practice. Airsoft is like 95% guys so it's not unheard of to have girls play but it's rare. When she gave me her name I was just a little curious so I did a google search and came up with her Instagram and she was (is) gorgeous, she's a literal model and a Boutine girl with about 100k followers. I figured she was just screwing with us to come out and get more dude Instagram followers by showing she was \"tomboy\" who could play with the boys. I figured that one day and a few shots with airsoft pellets would snuff her out real quick. I'm not just mentioning her looks and Instagram to be gratuitous, it's important to the story. \n\n\nSo she came out and to my total surprise, she fucking rocked it. She's actually a really good player with a good sense for the game and in the last few months she hasn't mentioned airsoft once on her Instagram. But needless to say a girl that looks like her is going to get a ton of attention on the airsoft field. We had a team meeting before she arrived that we had to treat her the same as we treat the rest of us and that we should have a rule for team spirt that no one try to date her. And I wanted to reiterate that we had to treat her exactly as we would any other member of the team, no exceptions.  Everyone agreed with this but even my oldest airsoft friends bend over backwards to be just a little bit friendlier to her if that makes sense. There is no doubt that in a highly competitive  sport that is 95% men, a \"hot girl\" is going to change the dynamic. It's not that I mind this at all because she was really good. \n\n\nSo my first big problem came with her just after new years when she came to the field with dyed bright red hair all done up in these little pony tail things. I told her that because of team rules, she was going to have to cover up her hair with like a camouflage beanie under her helmet. She said it was uncomfortable and took it off in the middle of a game. I called her out on it reminding her of the rules and pretty much my whole team told me I was being too much of a hard ass and I should lighten up. Even other strays (people not on a team) and other teams at the field that day came up to me and told me to chill out. After two years of having these rules, everyone was all of the sudden mad at me because I was trying to enforce the rules we all agreed on. \n\nBecause she is such a good player, we invited her to an out of state tournament coming up in March but I reiterated that I needed proof that she was ordering all the uniform gear from the various airsoft websites and it would be here in time for March. But after the hair incident I think she thinks she can blow me off because everyone will support her and she keeps telling me \"I'm working on it\" when I ask her. I mean it's literally as easy as going on a website and ordering stuff. That's all there is too it. \n\nSo things just got worse with her clothing and she pays zero regard to our military realistic rule and this past weekend she wore a fucking belly shirt and then was showing off all the welts to the other guys that she had gotten from being shot. She literally looked like a queen holding court with all the guys around her. \n\nI was so annoyed that her that I needed to talk to her, I reminded her about the military realistic rule, she said she was just hot and that she was sorry. I then asked her again about her uniform purchases. She said that she was working on it but not to worry, it would all be here. I was so fed up at this point I just said \"look I'm really sorry, but you just aren't a good fit for our team and you have to leave.\" Instead of getting mad like maybe I thought she would, she just broke down crying. Which means to everyone that was looking at us from afar I was the mean asshole making the pretty girl cry instead of just enforcing the rules we all agreed on. \n\n\nWell in like less that 5 minutes she had invites to join to other teams, pretty much EVERYONE on the airsoft field came over to tell her how sorry they were for her and how I'd always been known to be a hard ass.  And then my fucking team started turning on me. Of the 19 guys on our team 5 quit that day saying they were sick of my shit and the other 13 said they at least wanted to have a meeting this week to see where we were headed as a team. Somehow a rumor got started that I had yelled at Madison and that's why she was crying so the owner of the airsoft field iced me for 3 weeks because I violated his \"no abusive language policy.\" I've known the guy for 10 freaking years and spent thousands of dollars at his field and he iced me because of rumor. This is how crazy this has gotten. \n\n\nI think everyone on my team wants to either kick me out of the leadership position or quit altogether and form a new a team. To me, I was just enforcing the rules we all agreed upon and we all agreed that we would treat her the same. I think everyone thinks I'm an asshole. Our team meeting is tomorrow night and I would love to at least get some outside opinion on whether or not I'm an asshole so I know how to go into the meeting. \n\n\nthank you for reading. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the Airsoft team situation is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is the team leader of an Airsoft team with strict rules. They had a girl, Madison, join who was good at the game but didn't follow the uniform rules. The author enforced the rules, which led to her being kicked off. Now, the team is turning against the author, and he's feeling wronged.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the team had established rules that everyone agreed to. The author tried to enforce them when Madison violated them. However, the team members were lenient towards her, which made the author feel he was being a hard ass. The author's main argument is that he was following the rules he and the team set. \n\nBut there's more to it. The author mentions that Madison is a model with a large social media presence. He admits to being curious about her before she joined and had some initial assumptions about her. Maybe there's an element of bias here? Did his personal feelings about her affect his judgment? Also, when he kicked her off, she cried, and the team turned on him. The owner even iced him due to a rumor that he yelled at her. \n\nThe question is whether the author was in the wrong. The rules were clear, and he enforced them, but maybe he was too harsh? The team had already agreed to treat her the same as others. However, the author's team members were lenient, suggesting maybe the rules weren't as strictly enforced as he thought. If the team members were okay with bending the rules for her, maybe the author was being too rigid. \n\nAlso, the author's reasoning for enforcing the rules was based on maintaining a military-realistic look, which is important for their team's identity and professionalism. But if others were not following the rules as strictly, perhaps the author was inconsistent. \n\nAnother angle: Madison might have felt that the rules were unfair or that the author was being unnecessarily strict. If the rules were meant for everyone, but exceptions were made for others, that could be an issue. However, the author claims that the rules were clear and that everyone agreed. \n\nThe outcome was that the team turned against him, which he attributes to the team's reaction to Madison's crying. There's a possibility that the author's approach was too heavy-handed, leading to a poor group dynamic, even if he was technically following the rules. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, maybe the author was in the right to enforce the rules he and the team set. However, the way he handled the situation might have been harsh, especially if the team's culture allowed for some flexibility. Alternatively, if the rules were non-negotiable and he communicated them clearly, then he was just enforcing them. \n\nBut considering the team's reaction and the fact that his team members were lenient with her, perhaps the author's strict enforcement created a divide. He might have failed to manage the team's expectations or not communicated the rules effectively in the presence of exceptions. So, even if he wasn't technically wrong, his approach might have been.\n\nBut the core question is whether he was in the wrong. If the rules were agreed upon and he applied them without bias, then he's not in the wrong. However, if there was a lack of clear communication or if he was biased against her, then maybe he was. The initial assumption he had about her (thinking she was using them for social media) might have influenced his strict enforcement. \n\nIn conclusion, the author might not be in the wrong technically, but his handling could have been better. The answer would likely be B (No), because he was enforcing the rules he and the team agreed on. However, some might argue A (Yes) because of possible bias or poor communication. But given the information, the rules were clear, and he had the team's agreement. So the answer is B.\n"
