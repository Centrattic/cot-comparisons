We have an official statewide ranking and there's a core of us who travel to play in national tournaments. I get that some people will think it's super dorky but it's my passion and it keeps me outside, in shape and with my friends. \n\n\nWe have a very strict \"military-realistic\" policy on our team in that we don't allow anime, video game stuff, fake swords, bright colors, etc... And if you want to be on our competition team, there is about $400 worth of uniform gear we require everyone to buy so we look professional and coherent. Again, this is us and people don't have to join our team. \n\n\nSo to the point, last fall this girl Madison got in touch with me to say she had just moved to town and wanted to meet people and asked if she could come to our practice. Airsoft is like 95% guys so it's not unheard of to have girls play but it's rare. When she gave me her name I was just a little curious so I did a google search and came up with her Instagram and she was (is) gorgeous, she's a literal model and a Boutine girl with about 100k followers. I figured she was just screwing with us to come out and get more dude Instagram followers by showing she was \"tomboy\" who could play with the boys. I figured that one day and a few shots with airsoft pellets would snuff her out real quick. I'm not just mentioning her looks and Instagram to be gratuitous, it's important to the story. \n\n\nSo she came out and to my total surprise, she fucking rocked it. She's actually a really good player with a good sense for the game and in the last few months she hasn't mentioned airsoft once on her Instagram. But needless to say a girl that looks like her is going to get a ton of attention on the airsoft field. We had a team meeting before she arrived that we had to treat her the same as we treat the rest of us and that we should have a rule for team spirt that no one try to date her. And I wanted to reiterate that we had to treat her exactly as we would any other member of the team, no exceptions.  Everyone agreed with this but even my oldest airsoft friends bend over backwards to be just a little bit friendlier to her if that makes sense. There is no doubt that in a highly competitive  sport that is 95% men, a \"hot girl\" is going to change the dynamic. It's not that I mind this at all because she was really good. \n\n\nSo my first big problem came with her just after new years when she came to the field with dyed bright red hair all done up in these little pony tail things. I told her that because of team rules, she was going to have to cover up her hair with like a camouflage beanie under her helmet. She said it was uncomfortable and took it off in the middle of a game. I called her out on it reminding her of the rules and pretty much my whole team told me I was being too much of a hard ass and I should lighten up. Even other strays (people not on a team) and other teams at the field that day came up to me and told me to chill out. After two years of having these rules, everyone was all of the sudden mad at me because I was trying to enforce the rules we all agreed on. \n\nBecause she is such a good player, we invited her to an out of state tournament coming up in March but I reiterated that I needed proof that she was ordering all the uniform gear from the various airsoft websites and it would be here in time for March. But after the hair incident I think she thinks she can blow me off because everyone will support her and she keeps telling me \"I'm working on it\" when I ask her. I mean it's literally as easy as going on a website and ordering stuff. That's all there is too it. \n\nSo things just got worse with her clothing and she pays zero regard to our military realistic rule and this past weekend she wore a fucking belly shirt and then was showing off all the welts to the other guys that she had gotten from being shot. She literally looked like a queen holding court with all the guys around her. \n\nI was so annoyed that her that I needed to talk to her, I reminded her about the military realistic rule, she said she was just hot and that she was sorry. I then asked her again about her uniform purchases. She said that she was working on it but not to worry, it would all be here. I was so fed up at this point I just said \"look I'm really sorry, but you just aren't a good fit for our team and you have to leave.\" Instead of getting mad like maybe I thought she would, she just broke down crying. Which means to everyone that was looking at us from afar I was the mean asshole making the pretty girl cry instead of just enforcing the rules we all agreed on. \n\n\nWell in like less that 5 minutes she had invites to join to other teams, pretty much EVERYONE on the airsoft field came over to tell her how sorry they were for her and how I'd always been known to be a hard ass.  And then my fucking team started turning on me. Of the 19 guys on our team 5 quit that day saying they were sick of my shit and the other 13 said they at least wanted to have a meeting this week to see where we were headed as a team. Somehow a rumor got started that I had yelled at Madison and that's why she was crying so the owner of the airsoft field iced me for 3 weeks because I violated his \"no abusive language policy.\" I've known the guy for 10 freaking years and spent thousands of dollars at his field and he iced me because of rumor. This is how crazy this has gotten. \n\n\nI think everyone on my team wants to either kick me out of the leadership position or quit altogether and form a new a team. To me, I was just enforcing the rules we all agreed upon and we all agreed that we would treat her the same. I think everyone thinks I'm an asshole. Our team meeting is tomorrow night and I would love to at least get some outside opinion on whether or not I'm an asshole so I know how to go into the meeting. \n\n\nthank you for reading. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about an Airsoft team leader who kicked a girl off because she wasn't following the team's rules. The main question is whether he was right to do that or not.\n\nFirst, the team has strict rules about uniforms and military realism. They require expensive gear, and they don't allow bright colors or anime stuff. The girl, Madison, came in with dyed red hair in pigtails and later a belly shirt, which she didn't cover. The leader told her to follow the rules, but she kept ignoring them. When he finally asked her to leave, she cried, and this caused a backlash from the team and other teams at the field.\n\nSo the leader's side is that he was enforcing the rules he set. The team agreed to these rules when they joined, right? So he's saying, \"We all agreed on these rules. She didn't follow them, so she had to leave.\"\n\nBut on the other hand, there's the context of Madison being a model with a lot of social media presence. The leader admitted that he initially thought she was just there to get attention but later realized she was good at the game. The team members might have been more lenient towards her because she's a woman in a male-dominated sport. Also, when the leader enforced the rules, the team and others turned on him, even though they had agreed to follow the rules before.\n\nHmm, maybe the leader was too strict, but he did set the rules. However, if the rules were enforced inconsistently before, then he's right to enforce them now. But if he was being overly harsh, especially with a female player who's already in a minority, that could be a problem. Also, the fact that his team started to leave or question his leadership after this might indicate that his approach was too rigid. Maybe he should have communicated better or given her more chances instead of immediately kicking her out. \n\nAnother point: the leader mentioned that the team had agreed to treat her the same as everyone else. If the rules were clear from the start and he made sure everyone knew they had to follow them, then he's within his rights. But if the rules were flexible or if he hadn't clearly communicated them to Madison, that's an issue. Also, when she asked to join, maybe he should have made her aware of all the rules more thoroughly before letting her practice.\n\nThe emotional response from Madison and the subsequent backlash might suggest that the team's dynamic was more important than the rules. If the team started to side with her because of her gender or popularity, that could be a problem. But the leader's responsibility is to uphold the team's standards, not just popularity. However, how he handled the situation\u2014being strict without considering the social dynamics\u2014might have been a mistake.\n\nIn the end, it's about whether enforcing the rules was justified. If the rules were clear and agreed upon, then he's not in the wrong. But if he was overly strict or didn't consider the social aspects, maybe he is. It's a bit of a grey area. But based on the information given, he did set the rules, and she wasn't following them. So maybe he's not wrong, but how he handled it could have been better. But according to the question, we have to answer A or B. Since the rules are explicit and he was enforcing them, B (not in the wrong) might be the answer. However, if the rules weren't applied fairly, maybe A. But the story says the team had agreed to treat her the same. So B.\n"
