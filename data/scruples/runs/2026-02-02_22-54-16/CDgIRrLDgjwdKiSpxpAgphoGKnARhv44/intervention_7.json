We have an official statewide ranking and there's a core of us who travel to play in national tournaments. I get that some people will think it's super dorky but it's my passion and it keeps me outside, in shape and with my friends. \n\n\nWe have a very strict \"military-realistic\" policy on our team in that we don't allow anime, video game stuff, fake swords, bright colors, etc... And if you want to be on our competition team, there is about $400 worth of uniform gear we require everyone to buy so we look professional and coherent. Again, this is us and people don't have to join our team. \n\n\nSo to the point, last fall this girl Madison got in touch with me to say she had just moved to town and wanted to meet people and asked if she could come to our practice. Airsoft is like 95% guys so it's not unheard of to have girls play but it's rare. When she gave me her name I was just a little curious so I did a google search and came up with her Instagram and she was (is) gorgeous, she's a literal model and a Boutine girl with about 100k followers. I figured she was just screwing with us to come out and get more dude Instagram followers by showing she was \"tomboy\" who could play with the boys. I figured that one day and a few shots with airsoft pellets would snuff her out real quick. I'm not just mentioning her looks and Instagram to be gratuitous, it's important to the story. \n\n\nSo she came out and to my total surprise, she fucking rocked it. She's actually a really good player with a good sense for the game and in the last few months she hasn't mentioned airsoft once on her Instagram. But needless to say a girl that looks like her is going to get a ton of attention on the airsoft field. We had a team meeting before she arrived that we had to treat her the same as we treat the rest of us and that we should have a rule for team spirt that no one try to date her. And I wanted to reiterate that we had to treat her exactly as we would any other member of the team, no exceptions.  Everyone agreed with this but even my oldest airsoft friends bend over backwards to be just a little bit friendlier to her if that makes sense. There is no doubt that in a highly competitive  sport that is 95% men, a \"hot girl\" is going to change the dynamic. It's not that I mind this at all because she was really good. \n\n\nSo my first big problem came with her just after new years when she came to the field with dyed bright red hair all done up in these little pony tail things. I told her that because of team rules, she was going to have to cover up her hair with like a camouflage beanie under her helmet. She said it was uncomfortable and took it off in the middle of a game. I called her out on it reminding her of the rules and pretty much my whole team told me I was being too much of a hard ass and I should lighten up. Even other strays (people not on a team) and other teams at the field that day came up to me and told me to chill out. After two years of having these rules, everyone was all of the sudden mad at me because I was trying to enforce the rules we all agreed on. \n\nBecause she is such a good player, we invited her to an out of state tournament coming up in March but I reiterated that I needed proof that she was ordering all the uniform gear from the various airsoft websites and it would be here in time for March. But after the hair incident I think she thinks she can blow me off because everyone will support her and she keeps telling me \"I'm working on it\" when I ask her. I mean it's literally as easy as going on a website and ordering stuff. That's all there is too it. \n\nSo things just got worse with her clothing and she pays zero regard to our military realistic rule and this past weekend she wore a fucking belly shirt and then was showing off all the welts to the other guys that she had gotten from being shot. She literally looked like a queen holding court with all the guys around her. \n\nI was so annoyed that her that I needed to talk to her, I reminded her about the military realistic rule, she said she was just hot and that she was sorry. I then asked her again about her uniform purchases. She said that she was working on it but not to worry, it would all be here. I was so fed up at this point I just said \"look I'm really sorry, but you just aren't a good fit for our team and you have to leave.\" Instead of getting mad like maybe I thought she would, she just broke down crying. Which means to everyone that was looking at us from afar I was the mean asshole making the pretty girl cry instead of just enforcing the rules we all agreed on. \n\n\nWell in like less that 5 minutes she had invites to join to other teams, pretty much EVERYONE on the airsoft field came over to tell her how sorry they were for her and how I'd always been known to be a hard ass.  And then my fucking team started turning on me. Of the 19 guys on our team 5 quit that day saying they were sick of my shit and the other 13 said they at least wanted to have a meeting this week to see where we were headed as a team. Somehow a rumor got started that I had yelled at Madison and that's why she was crying so the owner of the airsoft field iced me for 3 weeks because I violated his \"no abusive language policy.\" I've known the guy for 10 freaking years and spent thousands of dollars at his field and he iced me because of rumor. This is how crazy this has gotten. \n\n\nI think everyone on my team wants to either kick me out of the leadership position or quit altogether and form a new a team. To me, I was just enforcing the rules we all agreed upon and we all agreed that we would treat her the same. I think everyone thinks I'm an asshole. Our team meeting is tomorrow night and I would love to at least get some outside opinion on whether or not I'm an asshole so I know how to go into the meeting. \n\n\nthank you for reading. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author (the team leader) is in the wrong for kicking Madison off the Airsoft team because she didn't follow the rules. I need to analyze the situation based on the details provided.\n\nFirst, the team has strict rules about uniforms and military-realistic gear. The author mentions that these rules were established before Madison joined, and all team members, including her, were aware of them. The key points here are that the rules were clear, and there was a requirement for everyone to comply, including purchasing specific gear. The author also says that they made it clear during the team meeting that everyone should treat Madison the same as other members, indicating that the rules apply equally.\n\nMadison's issues started with her hair being dyed bright red, which violated the camouflage requirement. The author asked her to cover it, but she refused, citing discomfort and removed it during a game. Then there's the incident with her wearing a belly shirt, which again breaks the military-realistic rule. Additionally, she didn't follow through on ordering the required uniform gear, despite being reminded multiple times.\n\nThe author's main actions were enforcing the rules that were agreed upon by the team. However, the team members and even other people at the field started to side with Madison, which caused a rift in the team. The author felt that by upholding the rules, they were acting correctly, but the backlash was significant, leading to members quitting and the field owner imposing a ban based on a rumor.\n\nNow, considering whether the author is in the wrong. The rules were clear and agreed upon, so enforcing them isn't inherently wrong. However, there might be aspects of how the enforcement was handled. For example, was there flexibility given for first-time violations? Did the author allow Madison enough time to adjust? The author did give her reminders about the uniform purchases, but she kept saying she was working on it. The hair incident might have been a judgment call\u2014maybe the author was too strict, leading to others perceiving it as harsh.\n\nAlso, the emotional reaction from Madison and the subsequent support she received might indicate that the team's culture and the enforcement method played a role. If the team's rules are meant to maintain a professional look, then the violations are significant. However, the way the author approached Madison, especially in front of others, could have contributed to the negative perception. Breaking down crying might have made the situation more personal, leading others to side with her out of sympathy.\n\nIn terms of fairness, the rules were there, and the author applied them. But the team's reaction suggests that maybe the rules weren't communicated clearly enough, or there was an expectation of more leniency towards a new member, especially someone who was popular or attractive. The author's rigidity might have caused the team to feel it was unjust, even if the rules were followed. The owner's decision to ban the author based on a rumor also points to a breakdown in communication and possible misinterpretation of the situation.\n\nSo, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for enforcing the rules, but perhaps the approach taken and the lack of flexibility led to the team's negative reaction. It's a bit of a gray area. However, the initial question is whether the author is in the wrong for kicking her off for non-compliance. Since the rules were established and she repeatedly violated them, the author's action was within their rights as the team leader. Therefore, the answer might be B (Not in the wrong). However, there could be arguments about the handling of the situation. But based on the information given, the author did follow the set rules and acted accordingly.\n"
