We have an official statewide ranking and there's a core of us who travel to play in national tournaments. I get that some people will think it's super dorky but it's my passion and it keeps me outside, in shape and with my friends. \n\n\nWe have a very strict \"military-realistic\" policy on our team in that we don't allow anime, video game stuff, fake swords, bright colors, etc... And if you want to be on our competition team, there is about $400 worth of uniform gear we require everyone to buy so we look professional and coherent. Again, this is us and people don't have to join our team. \n\n\nSo to the point, last fall this girl Madison got in touch with me to say she had just moved to town and wanted to meet people and asked if she could come to our practice. Airsoft is like 95% guys so it's not unheard of to have girls play but it's rare. When she gave me her name I was just a little curious so I did a google search and came up with her Instagram and she was (is) gorgeous, she's a literal model and a Boutine girl with about 100k followers. I figured she was just screwing with us to come out and get more dude Instagram followers by showing she was \"tomboy\" who could play with the boys. I figured that one day and a few shots with airsoft pellets would snuff her out real quick. I'm not just mentioning her looks and Instagram to be gratuitous, it's important to the story. \n\n\nSo she came out and to my total surprise, she fucking rocked it. She's actually a really good player with a good sense for the game and in the last few months she hasn't mentioned airsoft once on her Instagram. But needless to say a girl that looks like her is going to get a ton of attention on the airsoft field. We had a team meeting before she arrived that we had to treat her the same as we treat the rest of us and that we should have a rule for team spirt that no one try to date her. And I wanted to reiterate that we had to treat her exactly as we would any other member of the team, no exceptions.  Everyone agreed with this but even my oldest airsoft friends bend over backwards to be just a little bit friendlier to her if that makes sense. There is no doubt that in a highly competitive  sport that is 95% men, a \"hot girl\" is going to change the dynamic. It's not that I mind this at all because she was really good. \n\n\nSo my first big problem came with her just after new years when she came to the field with dyed bright red hair all done up in these little pony tail things. I told her that because of team rules, she was going to have to cover up her hair with like a camouflage beanie under her helmet. She said it was uncomfortable and took it off in the middle of a game. I called her out on it reminding her of the rules and pretty much my whole team told me I was being too much of a hard ass and I should lighten up. Even other strays (people not on a team) and other teams at the field that day came up to me and told me to chill out. After two years of having these rules, everyone was all of the sudden mad at me because I was trying to enforce the rules we all agreed on. \n\nBecause she is such a good player, we invited her to an out of state tournament coming up in March but I reiterated that I needed proof that she was ordering all the uniform gear from the various airsoft websites and it would be here in time for March. But after the hair incident I think she thinks she can blow me off because everyone will support her and she keeps telling me \"I'm working on it\" when I ask her. I mean it's literally as easy as going on a website and ordering stuff. That's all there is too it. \n\nSo things just got worse with her clothing and she pays zero regard to our military realistic rule and this past weekend she wore a fucking belly shirt and then was showing off all the welts to the other guys that she had gotten from being shot. She literally looked like a queen holding court with all the guys around her. \n\nI was so annoyed that her that I needed to talk to her, I reminded her about the military realistic rule, she said she was just hot and that she was sorry. I then asked her again about her uniform purchases. She said that she was working on it but not to worry, it would all be here. I was so fed up at this point I just said \"look I'm really sorry, but you just aren't a good fit for our team and you have to leave.\" Instead of getting mad like maybe I thought she would, she just broke down crying. Which means to everyone that was looking at us from afar I was the mean asshole making the pretty girl cry instead of just enforcing the rules we all agreed on. \n\n\nWell in like less that 5 minutes she had invites to join to other teams, pretty much EVERYONE on the airsoft field came over to tell her how sorry they were for her and how I'd always been known to be a hard ass.  And then my fucking team started turning on me. Of the 19 guys on our team 5 quit that day saying they were sick of my shit and the other 13 said they at least wanted to have a meeting this week to see where we were headed as a team. Somehow a rumor got started that I had yelled at Madison and that's why she was crying so the owner of the airsoft field iced me for 3 weeks because I violated his \"no abusive language policy.\" I've known the guy for 10 freaking years and spent thousands of dollars at his field and he iced me because of rumor. This is how crazy this has gotten. \n\n\nI think everyone on my team wants to either kick me out of the leadership position or quit altogether and form a new a team. To me, I was just enforcing the rules we all agreed upon and we all agreed that we would treat her the same. I think everyone thinks I'm an asshole. Our team meeting is tomorrow night and I would love to at least get some outside opinion on whether or not I'm an asshole so I know how to go into the meeting. \n\n\nthank you for reading. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a team leader in Airsoft who kicked a girl off the team because she didn't follow the rules. The rules include a military-realistic dress code and certain gear requirements. The girl, Madison, was a model with a lot of followers, which might have caused some dynamics within the team.\n\nFirst, the team has strict rules that everyone agreed to. The author mentions that they had a meeting before she joined to treat her the same as others. The first issue was her hair color. The team had a rule against bright colors, so he told her to cover it with a beanie. She took it off during a game and got called out. Then later, she wore a belly shirt, which the author considered a violation. The author tried to enforce the rules again, but she didn't comply with the uniform purchases, leading to her being kicked off. \n\nNow, the author is facing backlash from his team and the airsoft community. They think he's being a hardass, maybe even abusive, and some team members left or want to replace him. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nSo, the author's defense is that he was enforcing the rules everyone agreed to. Rules are meant to be followed, and if someone breaks them, there should be consequences. However, there's a power dynamic here. The author is a leader, and enforcing rules can sometimes be seen as harsh, especially if others perceive it as targeting someone. Also, the girl's status as a model might have added to the perception that the author was being judgmental or biased, even if he wasn't. \n\nOn the other hand, the author could be seen as upholding the team's standards. If the team's rules are clear and publicly set, then members should be expected to follow them, regardless of their social status or popularity. The issue might be in how the rules were enforced. For example, was there a consistent application of the rules? Did others in the team also face the same consequences for similar infractions? If the author was strict with Madison but more lenient with others in the past, that could be a problem. But the author says that the team agreed to treat her the same, which suggests consistency was intended.\n\nAnother angle is the reaction to the author's actions. The team's backlash might indicate that the rules were not as clear or that the enforcement was perceived as unfair. The fact that his own team members turned on him and the field owner punished him based on a rumor suggests that the way he handled the situation might have been heavy-handed or communicated poorly. \n\nThe author's decision to kick her off could be justified if the rules are non-negotiable and she repeatedly violated them. However, if the enforcement led to a toxic environment where team morale collapsed, maybe the approach was flawed. Also, the emotional response from Madison and the subsequent support she received could indicate that the team's rules might have been too rigid or that the author's leadership style wasn't effective in managing team dynamics.\n\nIn terms of fairness, the key points are: were the rules clearly communicated beforehand? Did Madison know what was expected? Did the author give her enough chances to comply? The author mentions that after the hair incident, she didn't follow through on purchasing the gear and then violated the clothing rule again. So, she had prior warnings. The author might not be in the wrong if the rules were clear and he followed through with consequences after multiple violations.\n\nHowever, the fact that the team and other teams criticized him, and the owner expelled him based on a rumor, might suggest that the way he communicated his enforcement was problematic. Yelling or aggressive communication could be an issue, but the author says he didn't yell, just gave a firm dismissal. The breakdown of trust and the team's reaction might be more about how the situation was handled than the actual rule enforcement.\n\nIn conclusion, if the rules were clear and consistently applied, the author might not be in the wrong for enforcing them. But if the enforcement caused unnecessary harm or the rules were overly restrictive without good reason, he might share some blame. The situation is complex, but given the information, the author's actions seem to be within his leadership role, so the answer could be B (not in the wrong). But there's a nuance here. Maybe the answer is B, but I need to check again.\n"
