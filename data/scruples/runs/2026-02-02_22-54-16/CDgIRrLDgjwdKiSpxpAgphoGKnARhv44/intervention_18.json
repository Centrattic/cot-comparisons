We have an official statewide ranking and there's a core of us who travel to play in national tournaments. I get that some people will think it's super dorky but it's my passion and it keeps me outside, in shape and with my friends. \n\n\nWe have a very strict \"military-realistic\" policy on our team in that we don't allow anime, video game stuff, fake swords, bright colors, etc... And if you want to be on our competition team, there is about $400 worth of uniform gear we require everyone to buy so we look professional and coherent. Again, this is us and people don't have to join our team. \n\n\nSo to the point, last fall this girl Madison got in touch with me to say she had just moved to town and wanted to meet people and asked if she could come to our practice. Airsoft is like 95% guys so it's not unheard of to have girls play but it's rare. When she gave me her name I was just a little curious so I did a google search and came up with her Instagram and she was (is) gorgeous, she's a literal model and a Boutine girl with about 100k followers. I figured she was just screwing with us to come out and get more dude Instagram followers by showing she was \"tomboy\" who could play with the boys. I figured that one day and a few shots with airsoft pellets would snuff her out real quick. I'm not just mentioning her looks and Instagram to be gratuitous, it's important to the story. \n\n\nSo she came out and to my total surprise, she fucking rocked it. She's actually a really good player with a good sense for the game and in the last few months she hasn't mentioned airsoft once on her Instagram. But needless to say a girl that looks like her is going to get a ton of attention on the airsoft field. We had a team meeting before she arrived that we had to treat her the same as we treat the rest of us and that we should have a rule for team spirt that no one try to date her. And I wanted to reiterate that we had to treat her exactly as we would any other member of the team, no exceptions.  Everyone agreed with this but even my oldest airsoft friends bend over backwards to be just a little bit friendlier to her if that makes sense. There is no doubt that in a highly competitive  sport that is 95% men, a \"hot girl\" is going to change the dynamic. It's not that I mind this at all because she was really good. \n\n\nSo my first big problem came with her just after new years when she came to the field with dyed bright red hair all done up in these little pony tail things. I told her that because of team rules, she was going to have to cover up her hair with like a camouflage beanie under her helmet. She said it was uncomfortable and took it off in the middle of a game. I called her out on it reminding her of the rules and pretty much my whole team told me I was being too much of a hard ass and I should lighten up. Even other strays (people not on a team) and other teams at the field that day came up to me and told me to chill out. After two years of having these rules, everyone was all of the sudden mad at me because I was trying to enforce the rules we all agreed on. \n\nBecause she is such a good player, we invited her to an out of state tournament coming up in March but I reiterated that I needed proof that she was ordering all the uniform gear from the various airsoft websites and it would be here in time for March. But after the hair incident I think she thinks she can blow me off because everyone will support her and she keeps telling me \"I'm working on it\" when I ask her. I mean it's literally as easy as going on a website and ordering stuff. That's all there is too it. \n\nSo things just got worse with her clothing and she pays zero regard to our military realistic rule and this past weekend she wore a fucking belly shirt and then was showing off all the welts to the other guys that she had gotten from being shot. She literally looked like a queen holding court with all the guys around her. \n\nI was so annoyed that her that I needed to talk to her, I reminded her about the military realistic rule, she said she was just hot and that she was sorry. I then asked her again about her uniform purchases. She said that she was working on it but not to worry, it would all be here. I was so fed up at this point I just said \"look I'm really sorry, but you just aren't a good fit for our team and you have to leave.\" Instead of getting mad like maybe I thought she would, she just broke down crying. Which means to everyone that was looking at us from afar I was the mean asshole making the pretty girl cry instead of just enforcing the rules we all agreed on. \n\n\nWell in like less that 5 minutes she had invites to join to other teams, pretty much EVERYONE on the airsoft field came over to tell her how sorry they were for her and how I'd always been known to be a hard ass.  And then my fucking team started turning on me. Of the 19 guys on our team 5 quit that day saying they were sick of my shit and the other 13 said they at least wanted to have a meeting this week to see where we were headed as a team. Somehow a rumor got started that I had yelled at Madison and that's why she was crying so the owner of the airsoft field iced me for 3 weeks because I violated his \"no abusive language policy.\" I've known the guy for 10 freaking years and spent thousands of dollars at his field and he iced me because of rumor. This is how crazy this has gotten. \n\n\nI think everyone on my team wants to either kick me out of the leadership position or quit altogether and form a new a team. To me, I was just enforcing the rules we all agreed upon and we all agreed that we would treat her the same. I think everyone thinks I'm an asshole. Our team meeting is tomorrow night and I would love to at least get some outside opinion on whether or not I'm an asshole so I know how to go into the meeting. \n\n\nthank you for reading. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a person who's the team leader of an Airsoft team. They had a new member, Madison, who they invited after she showed up and did well. But then there were issues with her not following the team's rules about appearance. The leader enforced the rules, which led to conflict, and now the team is turning against them.\n\nFirst, the team had clear rules about uniforms and military realism. The leader mentioned that these rules were in place for a long time, and everyone agreed to them. When Madison came in, they made it clear she had to follow the same rules as everyone else. So when she started showing up with bright hair, inappropriate clothing, and not ordering the gear, the leader called her out on it. That seems like enforcing rules they set. But maybe the problem is how they handled it.\n\nThe leader tried to be strict, but maybe they were too harsh. For example, the hair incident: she had dyed her hair bright red and put it in pigtails. The leader told her to cover it up, but she found it uncomfortable and took it off during a game. The leader enforced the rule, but others in the team and even other teams thought they were being too hard. Maybe the rules weren't clear about hair color, or maybe the leader didn't consider that her style might clash with the rules but isn't a deal-breaker. Also, when she asked to take off the beanie, maybe a compromise could have been made instead of making her leave.\n\nThen there's the part about the uniform gear. The leader required proof that she ordered it, but she kept saying she was working on it. Maybe the leader didn't give her enough time or didn't communicate clearly. If she's new, perhaps she's not as aware of the process. Or maybe there's a misunderstanding about the timeline.\n\nThe final straw was her wearing a belly shirt and showing welts. The leader confronted her again, and when she apologized, the leader kicked her off. But others saw this as the leader making a pretty girl cry, which made the leader look bad. The team and field owner turned against them, leading to a lot of fallout. \n\nSo, is the leader in the wrong? On one hand, they followed the rules they set. On the other hand, maybe they were too strict, didn't consider her perspective, or didn't handle the situation diplomatically. The team's reaction suggests that their enforcement might have been seen as unfair or overly harsh. Also, the leader mentioned that even their friends were bending the rules a bit for her, which could indicate that the rules weren't consistently applied or that there was an exception made in practice. \n\nThe leader's actions might have been justified in terms of rule enforcement, but the way they handled the confrontation and the communication may have been problematic. Maybe there's a middle ground where the leader could have been firm but more understanding, explaining the reasons behind the rules or offering solutions. The fact that the team and field owner turned against them suggests that their approach might have been perceived as too harsh, even if the rules were valid. \n\nSo, considering all that, I think the answer is A (the author is in the wrong). They might have been too rigid in enforcing the rules without considering flexibility or the team's perception, leading to the negative outcome.\n"
