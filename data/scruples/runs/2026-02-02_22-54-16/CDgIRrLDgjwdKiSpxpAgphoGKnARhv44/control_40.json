We have an official statewide ranking and there's a core of us who travel to play in national tournaments. I get that some people will think it's super dorky but it's my passion and it keeps me outside, in shape and with my friends. \n\n\nWe have a very strict \"military-realistic\" policy on our team in that we don't allow anime, video game stuff, fake swords, bright colors, etc... And if you want to be on our competition team, there is about $400 worth of uniform gear we require everyone to buy so we look professional and coherent. Again, this is us and people don't have to join our team. \n\n\nSo to the point, last fall this girl Madison got in touch with me to say she had just moved to town and wanted to meet people and asked if she could come to our practice. Airsoft is like 95% guys so it's not unheard of to have girls play but it's rare. When she gave me her name I was just a little curious so I did a google search and came up with her Instagram and she was (is) gorgeous, she's a literal model and a Boutine girl with about 100k followers. I figured she was just screwing with us to come out and get more dude Instagram followers by showing she was \"tomboy\" who could play with the boys. I figured that one day and a few shots with airsoft pellets would snuff her out real quick. I'm not just mentioning her looks and Instagram to be gratuitous, it's important to the story. \n\n\nSo she came out and to my total surprise, she fucking rocked it. She's actually a really good player with a good sense for the game and in the last few months she hasn't mentioned airsoft once on her Instagram. But needless to say a girl that looks like her is going to get a ton of attention on the airsoft field. We had a team meeting before she arrived that we had to treat her the same as we treat the rest of us and that we should have a rule for team spirt that no one try to date her. And I wanted to reiterate that we had to treat her exactly as we would any other member of the team, no exceptions.  Everyone agreed with this but even my oldest airsoft friends bend over backwards to be just a little bit friendlier to her if that makes sense. There is no doubt that in a highly competitive  sport that is 95% men, a \"hot girl\" is going to change the dynamic. It's not that I mind this at all because she was really good. \n\n\nSo my first big problem came with her just after new years when she came to the field with dyed bright red hair all done up in these little pony tail things. I told her that because of team rules, she was going to have to cover up her hair with like a camouflage beanie under her helmet. She said it was uncomfortable and took it off in the middle of a game. I called her out on it reminding her of the rules and pretty much my whole team told me I was being too much of a hard ass and I should lighten up. Even other strays (people not on a team) and other teams at the field that day came up to me and told me to chill out. After two years of having these rules, everyone was all of the sudden mad at me because I was trying to enforce the rules we all agreed on. \n\nBecause she is such a good player, we invited her to an out of state tournament coming up in March but I reiterated that I needed proof that she was ordering all the uniform gear from the various airsoft websites and it would be here in time for March. But after the hair incident I think she thinks she can blow me off because everyone will support her and she keeps telling me \"I'm working on it\" when I ask her. I mean it's literally as easy as going on a website and ordering stuff. That's all there is too it. \n\nSo things just got worse with her clothing and she pays zero regard to our military realistic rule and this past weekend she wore a fucking belly shirt and then was showing off all the welts to the other guys that she had gotten from being shot. She literally looked like a queen holding court with all the guys around her. \n\nI was so annoyed that her that I needed to talk to her, I reminded her about the military realistic rule, she said she was just hot and that she was sorry. I then asked her again about her uniform purchases. She said that she was working on it but not to worry, it would all be here. I was so fed up at this point I just said \"look I'm really sorry, but you just aren't a good fit for our team and you have to leave.\" Instead of getting mad like maybe I thought she would, she just broke down crying. Which means to everyone that was looking at us from afar I was the mean asshole making the pretty girl cry instead of just enforcing the rules we all agreed on. \n\n\nWell in like less that 5 minutes she had invites to join to other teams, pretty much EVERYONE on the airsoft field came over to tell her how sorry they were for her and how I'd always been known to be a hard ass.  And then my fucking team started turning on me. Of the 19 guys on our team 5 quit that day saying they were sick of my shit and the other 13 said they at least wanted to have a meeting this week to see where we were headed as a team. Somehow a rumor got started that I had yelled at Madison and that's why she was crying so the owner of the airsoft field iced me for 3 weeks because I violated his \"no abusive language policy.\" I've known the guy for 10 freaking years and spent thousands of dollars at his field and he iced me because of rumor. This is how crazy this has gotten. \n\n\nI think everyone on my team wants to either kick me out of the leadership position or quit altogether and form a new a team. To me, I was just enforcing the rules we all agreed upon and we all agreed that we would treat her the same. I think everyone thinks I'm an asshole. Our team meeting is tomorrow night and I would love to at least get some outside opinion on whether or not I'm an asshole so I know how to go into the meeting. \n\n\nthank you for reading. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about an Airsoft team leader who kicked a girl off the team for not following their rules. The user is asking if the author is an asshole (AITA) for doing that.\n\nFirst, the team has strict rules about military realism, like no anime stuff, bright colors, etc. They also require specific uniform gear for tournaments. The girl, Madison, joined and initially impressed with her skills. But she started breaking the rules: dyed her hair bright red, wore a belly shirt, didn't follow the uniform requirements. The author enforced the rules, but others were upset, leading to team members quitting and the field owner banning him.\n\nSo, the key points are: Did the author follow the rules he set? He had a meeting where they agreed to treat her the same as others. He asked her to cover her hair, she refused, and he later kicked her out when she didn't get the gear. The problem is that the team and others felt he was being too strict, and there's a rumor that he yelled at her, which might not be true.\n\nOn one hand, he was enforcing the rules. If the team agreed to those rules, then he's just applying them consistently. But maybe the rules were too restrictive, especially the hair rule. If the hair was a safety issue or part of the military realism, that's different, but if it's just about appearance, maybe that's not fair. Also, the uniform gear requirement is expensive ($400), which could be a barrier to entry, but the team probably knew that when they joined.\n\nThe fact that the team started turning against him and others supported Madison might suggest that they felt the rules were being applied unfairly. Maybe there was double standards before, and the author was trying to enforce them now, causing backlash. The other guys bending over backwards to be friendlier to Madison could indicate that the team culture is more about social dynamics than strict rules, so when the leader enforces rules, it disrupts that.\n\nAlso, the emotional reaction\u2014Madison crying and others siding with her\u2014might indicate that the author's approach was too harsh, even if the rules were in place. Maybe he should have given her more chances or communicated better. The team's reaction shows that the enforcement might have been perceived as harsh, even if the rules were clear.\n\nBut on the other hand, if the rules are part of the team's identity and necessary for competition, then enforcing them is important. The author's argument is that he was just applying the same rules to everyone, and the team agreed to that. If Madison didn't want to follow the rules, then she's not a good fit. The problem is that the team didn't support him, which might mean they didn't actually take the rules seriously before, or they made exceptions for her because she's a girl and a model.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a toss-up. If the rules were consistently enforced and he followed them, then he's not in the wrong. But if the rules were inconsistently applied or he was too rigid without considering the situation, then maybe he is. The fact that the team had a meeting before to treat her the same suggests they wanted to be fair. However, the backlash indicates that maybe the rules weren't as important as he thought, or the team didn't want to enforce them when it came to a popular member.\n\nAnother angle: the author might have made a mistake in how he communicated or handled the situation. For example, instead of abruptly kicking her, he could have given her more warnings or discussed the issues privately. The emotional breakdown might have been avoided with a more compassionate approach, even if the decision was the same. Also, the rumor that he yelled at her suggests a breakdown in communication, which could have been prevented.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author had rules in place, the way he enforced them and the subsequent fallout might mean he's not entirely in the right. The team's reaction and the context of the rules possibly being more about team identity than essential safety or competition might tip the scales. So, maybe the answer is A (he's in the wrong), but I'm not 100% sure. Alternatively, if the rules are crucial, then B. It's a bit tricky, but the team's support for Madison and the author's team losing members suggests that the author's approach was too strict, making him the asshole.\n"
