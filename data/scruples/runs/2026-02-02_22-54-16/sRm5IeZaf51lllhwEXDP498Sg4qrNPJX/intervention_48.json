I have lived inside this house for the past 18 years, they moved in about 3/4 years ago. At first I had no issues letting them park in my parking spot because I had no car. I\u2019m not an asshole so I let them park their car there for years free of charge. \n\nA few months ago I had the wife approach me and ask me if she could take half of my front garden to build herself a porch, I said no. I live in the UK so we don\u2019t have porch where you can just park your car, it\u2019s all street parking. \n\nAfter I turned down her request she has stopped greeting me whenever she says me, fine I don\u2019t care. I\u2019d like to note at this point her family members were still using my parking spot. \n\nToday she approaches me and informs me that she will start building her driveway taking up half of my property. I\u2019d like to note that I don\u2019t own the house, I just rent it. The council owns the house. She tells me that the council has given her permission to take up half of my front garden to build her driveway, lol ok. I again informed her that I don\u2019t consent and that she cannot go ahead with her building plan. \n\nThis kind of entitlement has enraged me so I called up my brother who had a car and told him to come and park in my parking spot, he did. As soon as my brother parked his car, my neighbor the husband came out yelling at my brother telling him to move his car that was when I told him that he and his family members could no longer park on my spot. \n\nThe whole driveway issues confuses me and I will be calling the council later today to try and stop this crazy woman taking half of my garden!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of this story is in the wrong for not letting their neighbors park in their free spot and confronting them about building a driveway.\n\nFirst, the author has been renting the house for 18 years. The neighbor moved in 3-4 years ago and started using their parking spot because the author didn't have a car. That seems okay, as the author was being kind by letting them use the space. \n\nThen the neighbor tried to take half the front garden for a porch, which the author refused. The neighbor then stopped greeting them, which is a bit petty, but maybe not the main issue. The author's brother was using the spot, but when the neighbor tried to build a driveway on the author's property, the author called their brother to park there, leading to a confrontation. \n\nNow, the key points here: the author doesn't own the house, it's council-owned. The neighbor claims the council gave her permission to take up half the garden. The author didn't consent. So, the author is trying to protect their right to their property, even though they're a tenant. \n\nIn the UK, if you're renting, you might not have the same rights as an owner. The council's permission is crucial here. If the neighbor has a valid council permit, the author might not have the authority to stop the construction. However, the author is the current tenant, so maybe they have some say, but it's unclear. \n\nThe author's action of having a car park in the spot to block the neighbor might be seen as a stand-up for their property, but since they're a tenant, it's possible the council's rules could affect this. The neighbor's entitlement in trying to build on the author's property without consent is a problem. \n\nThe author might be in the right about stopping the neighbor from building without their consent, especially if the council's permission is invalid. However, if the council did give permission, the author's options are limited. The confrontation could be justified as self-defense for their property, but the method (using a family member's car) might be seen as aggressive. \n\nOverall, the author is trying to protect their space, which is understandable, but the legal aspect depends on the council's stance. The neighbor's actions are problematic, but the author's response might be within their rights, especially if the council's approval isn't valid. So, the answer is probably B (not in the wrong).\n"
