I have lived inside this house for the past 18 years, they moved in about 3/4 years ago. At first I had no issues letting them park in my parking spot because I had no car. I\u2019m not an asshole so I let them park their car there for years free of charge. \n\nA few months ago I had the wife approach me and ask me if she could take half of my front garden to build herself a porch, I said no. I live in the UK so we don\u2019t have porch where you can just park your car, it\u2019s all street parking. \n\nAfter I turned down her request she has stopped greeting me whenever she says me, fine I don\u2019t care. I\u2019d like to note at this point her family members were still using my parking spot. \n\nToday she approaches me and informs me that she will start building her driveway taking up half of my property. I\u2019d like to note that I don\u2019t own the house, I just rent it. The council owns the house. She tells me that the council has given her permission to take up half of my front garden to build her driveway, lol ok. I again informed her that I don\u2019t consent and that she cannot go ahead with her building plan. \n\nThis kind of entitlement has enraged me so I called up my brother who had a car and told him to come and park in my parking spot, he did. As soon as my brother parked his car, my neighbor the husband came out yelling at my brother telling him to move his car that was when I told him that he and his family members could no longer park on my spot. \n\nThe whole driveway issues confuses me and I will be calling the council later today to try and stop this crazy woman taking half of my garden!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong for refusing their neighbor to park in their spot.\n\nFirst, the author has been letting the neighbors park in their spot for years, even though they didn't own the house and it was rented. So, there's a long-standing agreement. The key point here is that the author is a tenant, not the property owner. In the UK, tenants' rights regarding property use can be tricky. If the tenant is allowed to use the parking spot, then maybe the neighbors have been doing this with the tenant's permission, not the owner's.\n\nThen the neighbor's wife asked to take half the garden for a porch, which the author refused. After that, the neighbor tried to build a driveway on the author's property without consent. The author then had their brother park there to block the construction. \n\nLegally, if the author doesn't own the house, the council owns it, so the council would have the final say on what can be done with the property. The author's brother parking there might be a way to assert their right to use the spot, but if the council doesn't own the parking spot, maybe the author's use of it isn't legitimate. However, the neighbors were using it without council permission, so the author's refusal to let them park after the conflict might be their right.\n\nThe author's actions in blocking the driveway with a car could be seen as taking matters into their own hands. Legally, if the council hasn't given permission for the neighbor's construction, the author might have a point in stopping it. But using a personal car to block the site might not be the best approach. The correct step would be to involve the council or a legal authority, which the author mentions they will do later.\n\nIn terms of entitlement, the author might be within their rights to stop the unauthorized use of their rented space, especially if the council hasn't approved the neighbor's plans. However, the initial permission to park might be a gray area if the council didn't agree to it. \n\nSo, the author's actions could be seen as self-defense of their property rights as a tenant, even if the ownership is with the council. The key is whether the author had the right to allow or deny parking in the first place. If the council's rules allowed the author to use the spot, then they can control who parks there. Since the neighbor tried to take over the garden without consent, the author's response might be justified.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
