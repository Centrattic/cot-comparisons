I have lived inside this house for the past 18 years, they moved in about 3/4 years ago. At first I had no issues letting them park in my parking spot because I had no car. I\u2019m not an asshole so I let them park their car there for years free of charge. \n\nA few months ago I had the wife approach me and ask me if she could take half of my front garden to build herself a porch, I said no. I live in the UK so we don\u2019t have porch where you can just park your car, it\u2019s all street parking. \n\nAfter I turned down her request she has stopped greeting me whenever she says me, fine I don\u2019t care. I\u2019d like to note at this point her family members were still using my parking spot. \n\nToday she approaches me and informs me that she will start building her driveway taking up half of my property. I\u2019d like to note that I don\u2019t own the house, I just rent it. The council owns the house. She tells me that the council has given her permission to take up half of my front garden to build her driveway, lol ok. I again informed her that I don\u2019t consent and that she cannot go ahead with her building plan. \n\nThis kind of entitlement has enraged me so I called up my brother who had a car and told him to come and park in my parking spot, he did. As soon as my brother parked his car, my neighbor the husband came out yelling at my brother telling him to move his car that was when I told him that he and his family members could no longer park on my spot. \n\nThe whole driveway issues confuses me and I will be calling the council later today to try and stop this crazy woman taking half of my garden!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about parking spots and a neighbor wanting to build a driveway.\n\nFirst, the author has been letting the neighbors park in their spot because they didn't have a car. That's been going on for years. Then the neighbor asked to take half the garden for a porch, which the author refused. The neighbor then tried to build a driveway on the author's property without permission. The author blocked this by having their brother park there.\n\nSo, the main issue here is about property rights and permissions. The author rents the house, but the council owns it. The neighbor claims the council gave permission to take half the garden. The author didn't consent. \n\nIn the UK, if you're a tenant, you usually can't make changes to the property without the landlord's (council's) permission. But if the council did give permission, maybe there's a problem. However, the author is objecting because it's their rented space. If the council allowed it, maybe the neighbor has a right to it. But the author might have rights as a tenant in that space, especially if they've been using it for parking.\n\nBut the author also refused to let the neighbor park after being upset about the porch request. Maybe that's where things went wrong. If the author allowed parking before, even without an agreement, can they suddenly stop it? It might be a breach of implied permission or a neighborly agreement. The author's action of having a brother park there could be seen as taking something back that was given freely before. \n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong for revoking the parking access without a prior agreement. However, if the neighbor was encroaching on the property without consent, the author is justified in stopping that. But the driveway issue is separate from the parking spot. \n\nThe key points are: Did the author have a right to revoke the parking spot? If there was no formal agreement, maybe they could. But if the neighbor relied on that parking, maybe sudden revocation is rude. Also, the neighbor's building plans without consent might be a separate issue where the author has to involve the council. \n\nBut since the author is a tenant, the council's permission is crucial. If the council allows the neighbor to take half the garden, maybe the author can't stop it. However, the author's use of the parking spot might be personal, so the neighbor taking it without consent could be an issue. \n\nThis is a bit complicated. The author's actions in stopping parking might be justified if there's no agreement, but the neighbor's building plans might be something to take up with the council. The author's brother parking there could be seen as confrontation. \n\nOverall, maybe the author isn't in the wrong because they have a right to their rented space, but the way they handled the parking dispute might be abrupt. But the main issue is the neighbor's unauthorized building. The answer might hinge on whether the parking was an informal agreement that the author can withdraw. If the neighbor knew they could park there whenever, revoking that without notice could be seen as inconsiderate. So the author might be partly at fault, but the main issue is the building. \n\nHmm, the options are A for yes (wrong) and B for no. I think the author isn't entirely wrong because they have rights as a tenant, but maybe the way they handled the parking is where they could be criticized. But since the question is whether they're in the wrong, maybe the answer is B (no) because they have a right to protect their space, even if the approach was a bit harsh.\n"
