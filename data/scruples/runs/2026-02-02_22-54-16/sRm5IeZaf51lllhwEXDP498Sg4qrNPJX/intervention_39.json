I have lived inside this house for the past 18 years, they moved in about 3/4 years ago. At first I had no issues letting them park in my parking spot because I had no car. I\u2019m not an asshole so I let them park their car there for years free of charge. \n\nA few months ago I had the wife approach me and ask me if she could take half of my front garden to build herself a porch, I said no. I live in the UK so we don\u2019t have porch where you can just park your car, it\u2019s all street parking. \n\nAfter I turned down her request she has stopped greeting me whenever she says me, fine I don\u2019t care. I\u2019d like to note at this point her family members were still using my parking spot. \n\nToday she approaches me and informs me that she will start building her driveway taking up half of my property. I\u2019d like to note that I don\u2019t own the house, I just rent it. The council owns the house. She tells me that the council has given her permission to take up half of my front garden to build her driveway, lol ok. I again informed her that I don\u2019t consent and that she cannot go ahead with her building plan. \n\nThis kind of entitlement has enraged me so I called up my brother who had a car and told him to come and park in my parking spot, he did. As soon as my brother parked his car, my neighbor the husband came out yelling at my brother telling him to move his car that was when I told him that he and his family members could no longer park on my spot. \n\nThe whole driveway issues confuses me and I will be calling the council later today to try and stop this crazy woman taking half of my garden!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the main issue is about a parking spot and a neighbor wanting to build a driveway on the author's garden. The author has been letting the neighbors park in their spot for years because they didn't have a car. Then the neighbor asked for half the garden to build a porch, which was refused. Now the neighbor is claiming the council gave her permission to take half the garden for a driveway. The author then told their brother to park there to block the neighbors, leading to a confrontation.\n\nFirst, the parking spot. If the author's parking spot is on their own property (even if it's a rented house), they have the right to control it. Since they allowed the neighbors to use it for years, maybe there was an informal agreement. But the author isn't obligated to let them park if they change their mind, especially if they now need the space. But the key point is whether the spot is actually part of the author's property. If it's the council's property, maybe the author doesn't have the authority to let others park there. But the author says they rent the house, so maybe the front garden is part of the property they have access to.\n\nThen the driveway issue. The neighbor claims council permission, but if the author is a tenant, the council (as the landlord) might have to approve any changes to the garden. The author might not have consented, so even if the council gave permission, maybe the author needs to confirm that. The author's action of parking their brother's car could be a way to assert their rights, but if the neighbor is permitted by the council, maybe the author is overstepping.\n\nSo, the author might be in the right to stop others from parking in their spot, especially after being asked to stop. However, if the council's permission is valid, the author might need to address that through the proper channels instead of using a family member to block the spot. The confrontation might be understandable, but maybe the author should have handled it by contacting the council first. Still, the main issue is the parking spot, which is their property, so they can decide who parks there. The driveway issue is separate, and the author might be justified in opposing it without consent.\n"
