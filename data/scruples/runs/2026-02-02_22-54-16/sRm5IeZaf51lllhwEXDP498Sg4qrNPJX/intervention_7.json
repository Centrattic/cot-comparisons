I have lived inside this house for the past 18 years, they moved in about 3/4 years ago. At first I had no issues letting them park in my parking spot because I had no car. I\u2019m not an asshole so I let them park their car there for years free of charge. \n\nA few months ago I had the wife approach me and ask me if she could take half of my front garden to build herself a porch, I said no. I live in the UK so we don\u2019t have porch where you can just park your car, it\u2019s all street parking. \n\nAfter I turned down her request she has stopped greeting me whenever she says me, fine I don\u2019t care. I\u2019d like to note at this point her family members were still using my parking spot. \n\nToday she approaches me and informs me that she will start building her driveway taking up half of my property. I\u2019d like to note that I don\u2019t own the house, I just rent it. The council owns the house. She tells me that the council has given her permission to take up half of my front garden to build her driveway, lol ok. I again informed her that I don\u2019t consent and that she cannot go ahead with her building plan. \n\nThis kind of entitlement has enraged me so I called up my brother who had a car and told him to come and park in my parking spot, he did. As soon as my brother parked his car, my neighbor the husband came out yelling at my brother telling him to move his car that was when I told him that he and his family members could no longer park on my spot. \n\nThe whole driveway issues confuses me and I will be calling the council later today to try and stop this crazy woman taking half of my garden!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for refusing their neighbors to park in their spot. The situation has a few layers.\n\nFirst, the author has been letting the neighbors park in their spot for years when they didn't have a car. Now that they have a car, they're asking the neighbors to stop. That seems reasonable because the spot is now needed for them. But then there's the issue of the neighbor trying to build a driveway on half the author's garden. The author doesn't own the house, it's rented from the council. The neighbor claims the council gave permission, but the author hasn't consented. \n\nThe author's actions here include calling their brother to park there to prevent the neighbor's family from using it. The husband then yells at the brother. The author is asserting their right to their own property, even if they don't own it. In the UK, even rented properties have some rights. The council owning the house might mean the neighbor's actions infringing on the rented space would require the council's approval. \n\nThe neighbor's request to take half the garden for a driveway without the tenant's consent could be problematic. The author is trying to stop that by asserting control over the parking spot. The brother parking there is a way to physically prevent the neighbor's use, which might be seen as a bit of a conflict, but the author is trying to protect their property. \n\nSo, considering the neighbor's entitlement and the author's need to reclaim their spot, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They're standing up for their rights as a tenant. The answer is probably B.\n"
