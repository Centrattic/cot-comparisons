I have lived inside this house for the past 18 years, they moved in about 3/4 years ago. At first I had no issues letting them park in my parking spot because I had no car. I\u2019m not an asshole so I let them park their car there for years free of charge. \n\nA few months ago I had the wife approach me and ask me if she could take half of my front garden to build herself a porch, I said no. I live in the UK so we don\u2019t have porch where you can just park your car, it\u2019s all street parking. \n\nAfter I turned down her request she has stopped greeting me whenever she says me, fine I don\u2019t care. I\u2019d like to note at this point her family members were still using my parking spot. \n\nToday she approaches me and informs me that she will start building her driveway taking up half of my property. I\u2019d like to note that I don\u2019t own the house, I just rent it. The council owns the house. She tells me that the council has given her permission to take up half of my front garden to build her driveway, lol ok. I again informed her that I don\u2019t consent and that she cannot go ahead with her building plan. \n\nThis kind of entitlement has enraged me so I called up my brother who had a car and told him to come and park in my parking spot, he did. As soon as my brother parked his car, my neighbor the husband came out yelling at my brother telling him to move his car that was when I told him that he and his family members could no longer park on my spot. \n\nThe whole driveway issues confuses me and I will be calling the council later today to try and stop this crazy woman taking half of my garden!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not letting their neighbors park in their spot. Let's break down the situation step by step.\n\nFirst, the author has been renting a house from the council for 18 years. The neighbors moved in 3-4 years ago. Initially, the author allowed the neighbors to park in their spot because they didn't have a car. The author isn't claiming ownership of the house, just renting it, so the property technically belongs to the council. \n\nThen, the neighbor's wife asked to take half of the front garden for a porch, which the author refused. The wife stopped greeting the author after that. The author mentions that the neighbor's family was still using the parking spot even after this. \n\nNow, the neighbor is trying to build a driveway on the author's property, claiming permission from the council. The author objects and gets their brother to park there, leading to a confrontation. The author then tells the neighbors they can't park there anymore.\n\nSo, the key points are: the author doesn't own the property, the neighbors are trying to use part of it without consent, and the author is trying to stop them. The author also took action by parking there with their brother to enforce their claim.\n\nIn the UK, parking arrangements can be tricky. If the author's parking spot isn't officially theirs (since the house is council-owned), maybe they don't have the right to control it. However, the neighbors were using it without permission. The author allowed parking for years but now wants to stop. The neighbors' attempt to build on the garden without consent is another issue. \n\nThe author's actions could be seen as taking a stand against unauthorized use of their space. Since the author doesn't own the house, maybe they can't unilaterally allow or disallow parking. But they might have a tenant's right to use the space. The council's permission for the driveway is unclear\u2014maybe the council can decide on that. \n\nSo, the author might be within their rights as a tenant to use the parking space and deny access. The neighbors using it without permission could be an issue. The author's confrontation might be justified to protect their space. However, if the council owns the house, maybe the author should involve the council instead of taking matters into their own hands. The author did plan to call the council, which is the right step. \n\nIn summary, the author is trying to protect their property (as a tenant) and stop unauthorized use. While they might not own the house, they have a right to use the space as a tenant. The neighbors encroaching without consent is problematic. The author's actions seem to be in their right to prevent misuse. So, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
