I have lived inside this house for the past 18 years, they moved in about 3/4 years ago. At first I had no issues letting them park in my parking spot because I had no car. I\u2019m not an asshole so I let them park their car there for years free of charge. \n\nA few months ago I had the wife approach me and ask me if she could take half of my front garden to build herself a porch, I said no. I live in the UK so we don\u2019t have porch where you can just park your car, it\u2019s all street parking. \n\nAfter I turned down her request she has stopped greeting me whenever she says me, fine I don\u2019t care. I\u2019d like to note at this point her family members were still using my parking spot. \n\nToday she approaches me and informs me that she will start building her driveway taking up half of my property. I\u2019d like to note that I don\u2019t own the house, I just rent it. The council owns the house. She tells me that the council has given her permission to take up half of my front garden to build her driveway, lol ok. I again informed her that I don\u2019t consent and that she cannot go ahead with her building plan. \n\nThis kind of entitlement has enraged me so I called up my brother who had a car and told him to come and park in my parking spot, he did. As soon as my brother parked his car, my neighbor the husband came out yelling at my brother telling him to move his car that was when I told him that he and his family members could no longer park on my spot. \n\nThe whole driveway issues confuses me and I will be calling the council later today to try and stop this crazy woman taking half of my garden!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the neighbor is trying to take half of the author's garden to build a driveway. The author has been letting the neighbor's family park in their spot for years, especially since they have four cars and the author didn't have one. Now, after the neighbor's request for the garden is denied, the author stops allowing parking.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that the house is rented, so the council owns it. The neighbor claims the council gave her permission to take half the garden. The author refuses to consent. The author then parks their brother's car in the spot to block the neighbor's family from parking there. The neighbor's husband yells at the brother, and the author tells the family they can't park there anymore.\n\nSo, in the UK, property rights are important. Even if it's rented, the tenant usually has rights to the property. If the council is the owner, they would have control over the structure and land. If the neighbor got permission from the council, that might be valid. However, the author's front garden is their space, not the neighbor's. The neighbor's claim to take half of it without the tenant's consent would be an issue. The author isn't in the wrong for stopping that. Also, the neighbor was using the parking spot without permission for years, so the author has the right to change that. The author's actions to park their brother's car to block the spot seem reasonable to enforce their right to the space. The neighbor's entitlement and the sudden permission claim are problematic. So, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
