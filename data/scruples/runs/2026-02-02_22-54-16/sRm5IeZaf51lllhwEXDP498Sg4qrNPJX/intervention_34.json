I have lived inside this house for the past 18 years, they moved in about 3/4 years ago. At first I had no issues letting them park in my parking spot because I had no car. I\u2019m not an asshole so I let them park their car there for years free of charge. \n\nA few months ago I had the wife approach me and ask me if she could take half of my front garden to build herself a porch, I said no. I live in the UK so we don\u2019t have porch where you can just park your car, it\u2019s all street parking. \n\nAfter I turned down her request she has stopped greeting me whenever she says me, fine I don\u2019t care. I\u2019d like to note at this point her family members were still using my parking spot. \n\nToday she approaches me and informs me that she will start building her driveway taking up half of my property. I\u2019d like to note that I don\u2019t own the house, I just rent it. The council owns the house. She tells me that the council has given her permission to take up half of my front garden to build her driveway, lol ok. I again informed her that I don\u2019t consent and that she cannot go ahead with her building plan. \n\nThis kind of entitlement has enraged me so I called up my brother who had a car and told him to come and park in my parking spot, he did. As soon as my brother parked his car, my neighbor the husband came out yelling at my brother telling him to move his car that was when I told him that he and his family members could no longer park on my spot. \n\nThe whole driveway issues confuses me and I will be calling the council later today to try and stop this crazy woman taking half of my garden!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The context is about a neighbor using their parking spot and then trying to build a driveway on their garden.\n\nFirst, the author has been letting the neighbor park there for years when they didn't have a car. That's generous, and maybe even neighborly. But now, when the author gets a car and needs the spot, they're saying no. The neighbor then tried to build a driveway on the garden, which the author is against. \n\nThe key points here are ownership and permissions. The author rents the house, so the garden technically belongs to the council. The neighbor claims the council gave her permission to build a driveway, but the author might not have been informed. The author's main action is refusing the parking and then parking their brother there to block the neighbor.\n\nIn the UK, parking spaces can be a bit tricky. If the parking spot is part of the property the author rents, even if it's not owned, they might have the right to use it. However, if the neighbor has been using it under some agreement, maybe it's a shared space? The author's brother parking there could be seen as using the spot for his own purposes, but if the author is the one who told him to park there, that might be a problem. \n\nAlso, the neighbor building a driveway might require a formal agreement or planning permission that affects the property. If the council allowed it, the author's rights might be limited. But if the neighbor hasn't actually obtained the necessary permissions yet, the author could be justified in stopping it temporarily by parking there. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? They were kind before but are now asserting their rights after a boundary issue. The neighbor's entitlement to build a driveway could be a separate legal matter. The author's actions seem like a reasonable response to protect their space and address the neighbor's perceived overreach. But maybe there's a misunderstanding about the ownership of the garden. If the council owns the garden, the neighbor might not need the author's consent, but the author's refusal to park and the use of their brother's car might be a bit confrontational. However, the main issue is the neighbor's unauthorized or possibly unauthorized construction. \n\nI think the author is not in the wrong because they're standing up for their space and the neighbor's actions might be the issue. The answer is B.\n"
