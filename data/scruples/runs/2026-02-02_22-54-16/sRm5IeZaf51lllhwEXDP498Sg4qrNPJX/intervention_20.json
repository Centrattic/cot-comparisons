I have lived inside this house for the past 18 years, they moved in about 3/4 years ago. At first I had no issues letting them park in my parking spot because I had no car. I\u2019m not an asshole so I let them park their car there for years free of charge. \n\nA few months ago I had the wife approach me and ask me if she could take half of my front garden to build herself a porch, I said no. I live in the UK so we don\u2019t have porch where you can just park your car, it\u2019s all street parking. \n\nAfter I turned down her request she has stopped greeting me whenever she says me, fine I don\u2019t care. I\u2019d like to note at this point her family members were still using my parking spot. \n\nToday she approaches me and informs me that she will start building her driveway taking up half of my property. I\u2019d like to note that I don\u2019t own the house, I just rent it. The council owns the house. She tells me that the council has given her permission to take up half of my front garden to build her driveway, lol ok. I again informed her that I don\u2019t consent and that she cannot go ahead with her building plan. \n\nThis kind of entitlement has enraged me so I called up my brother who had a car and told him to come and park in my parking spot, he did. As soon as my brother parked his car, my neighbor the husband came out yelling at my brother telling him to move his car that was when I told him that he and his family members could no longer park on my spot. \n\nThe whole driveway issues confuses me and I will be calling the council later today to try and stop this crazy woman taking half of my garden!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. Let me read through the details again.\n\nThe author has been letting their neighbors park in their parking spot for years because they didn't have a car. The neighbor family has four cars. Then the neighbor's wife asked to take half the front garden for a porch, which the author refused. The wife stopped greeting the author. The family kept using the parking spot. Now, the wife is trying to build a driveway taking up half of the author's property. The author doesn't own the house\u2014it's rented from the council. The neighbor says the council gave permission, but the author disagrees. The author then tells their brother to park there, leading to a confrontation.\n\nSo the key points here are about property rights. The author rents the house, so maybe the council owns the front garden. If the neighbor is told by the council they can take half, but the author hasn't given consent, there's a conflict. The author's action of parking their brother's car to block the spot is contentious.\n\nIn the UK, when you rent a house, the front garden is usually part of the property the council owns, but the tenant might have rights to use it. If the neighbor is trying to take over part of the garden without the council's actual permission, that's a problem. But if the council did give permission, the author might not be able to stop them. However, the author's action of blocking the spot by parking there could be seen as asserting their right to use the space, even if they don't own it. But since they're a tenant, the council might have the final say.\n\nThe author's refusal to let the neighbors park is a bit tricky. They had been allowing it for years, but now that they have a car, they're using their own spot. If the parking spot is part of the rented property, the author might have the right to use it. But the neighbor's use might be based on prior agreement or implied permission. The author's brother parking there could be seen as a conflict, especially if the neighbors were using it under some prior understanding.\n\nSo, the author might be justified in using their spot now that they have a car, but the way they enforced it by having someone park there could be seen as confrontational. However, given the neighbor's attempt to take over the garden without consent, the author's actions might be a reasonable stand. The main issue is whether the author's actions are in line with their rights as a tenant. If the council is involved, maybe the author should go through proper channels first. But since the neighbors are acting unilaterally and disrespectfully, the author might not be in the wrong. I think the answer is B.\n"
