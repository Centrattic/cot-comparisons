I have lived inside this house for the past 18 years, they moved in about 3/4 years ago. At first I had no issues letting them park in my parking spot because I had no car. I\u2019m not an asshole so I let them park their car there for years free of charge. \n\nA few months ago I had the wife approach me and ask me if she could take half of my front garden to build herself a porch, I said no. I live in the UK so we don\u2019t have porch where you can just park your car, it\u2019s all street parking. \n\nAfter I turned down her request she has stopped greeting me whenever she says me, fine I don\u2019t care. I\u2019d like to note at this point her family members were still using my parking spot. \n\nToday she approaches me and informs me that she will start building her driveway taking up half of my property. I\u2019d like to note that I don\u2019t own the house, I just rent it. The council owns the house. She tells me that the council has given her permission to take up half of my front garden to build her driveway, lol ok. I again informed her that I don\u2019t consent and that she cannot go ahead with her building plan. \n\nThis kind of entitlement has enraged me so I called up my brother who had a car and told him to come and park in my parking spot, he did. As soon as my brother parked his car, my neighbor the husband came out yelling at my brother telling him to move his car that was when I told him that he and his family members could no longer park on my spot. \n\nThe whole driveway issues confuses me and I will be calling the council later today to try and stop this crazy woman taking half of my garden!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" scenario is in the wrong. The author lives in the UK, rents a council-owned house, and for years allowed their neighbor to park in their spot because they didn't have a car. Now that the author has a car, they're preventing the neighbor from taking up the parking spot. \n\nFirst, the author didn't own the house, so the land might be owned by the council. If the council owns the property, then technically the neighbor can't build on it without permission. The author did the right thing by not letting the neighbor build without their consent, even if the council gave permission. Wait, the neighbor claims the council gave permission, but the author says they don't own the house. Maybe the council's permission is valid, but the author's consent is still needed if the land is part of their rental.\n\nRegarding the parking spot: the author allowed parking for years when they had no car. Now that they have a car, they're reclaiming their spot. The neighbor's family has been using the spot even after the author refused the porch request. The author's brother parked there to enforce the rule, leading to conflict. \n\nIn the UK, parking spots can be a gray area. If the spot is part of the rental agreement, the council might have control. But if the author is the tenant, they might have a right to use the spot. However, allowing others to park for years could imply an informal agreement. Now changing the rules might be seen as breaking that trust. But the neighbor hasn't asked for permission recently, and the author is now using the spot themselves.\n\nThe building issue is separate. The neighbor wants to build a driveway on half the garden. The author didn't consent, which is their right. The council's permission might not override the tenant's rights if the council is the landlord. The author is protecting their property rights.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. They're asserting their rights after a change in circumstances. The neighbor's entitlement is the issue. Answer B.\n"
