I have lived inside this house for the past 18 years, they moved in about 3/4 years ago. At first I had no issues letting them park in my parking spot because I had no car. I\u2019m not an asshole so I let them park their car there for years free of charge. \n\nA few months ago I had the wife approach me and ask me if she could take half of my front garden to build herself a porch, I said no. I live in the UK so we don\u2019t have porch where you can just park your car, it\u2019s all street parking. \n\nAfter I turned down her request she has stopped greeting me whenever she says me, fine I don\u2019t care. I\u2019d like to note at this point her family members were still using my parking spot. \n\nToday she approaches me and informs me that she will start building her driveway taking up half of my property. I\u2019d like to note that I don\u2019t own the house, I just rent it. The council owns the house. She tells me that the council has given her permission to take up half of my front garden to build her driveway, lol ok. I again informed her that I don\u2019t consent and that she cannot go ahead with her building plan. \n\nThis kind of entitlement has enraged me so I called up my brother who had a car and told him to come and park in my parking spot, he did. As soon as my brother parked his car, my neighbor the husband came out yelling at my brother telling him to move his car that was when I told him that he and his family members could no longer park on my spot. \n\nThe whole driveway issues confuses me and I will be calling the council later today to try and stop this crazy woman taking half of my garden!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for refusing their neighbor to park in their spot and confronting them about building a driveway.\n\nFirst, the author has been letting the neighbors park in their spot for years when they had no car. Now that they have a brother with a car, they want to use the spot. The neighbors want to build a driveway on half the author's garden, but the author doesn't own the house; it's a rental. The council supposedly gave the neighbor permission, but the author is opposing it.\n\nIn the UK, if the property is council-owned, the garden is likely part of the tenancy agreement. The author doesn't own the garden, so the neighbor building a driveway there would need permission from the council, not the tenant. The author's refusal to let them park is about their own parking spot, which they might have a right to use now. The confrontation seems like a defense of their rights, especially if the council's permission is questionable.\n\nThe author called their brother to park there to assert their claim, which might be a bit aggressive, but given the neighbor's entitlement and the council's involvement, it's a reaction to protect their space. The neighbor's actions of building without proper consent could be the real issue here. The author isn't in the wrong for standing up for their space, especially since they're tenants and the council's approval is needed for alterations. So, the answer is B.\n"
