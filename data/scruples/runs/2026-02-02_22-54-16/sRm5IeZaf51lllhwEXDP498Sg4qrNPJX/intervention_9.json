I have lived inside this house for the past 18 years, they moved in about 3/4 years ago. At first I had no issues letting them park in my parking spot because I had no car. I\u2019m not an asshole so I let them park their car there for years free of charge. \n\nA few months ago I had the wife approach me and ask me if she could take half of my front garden to build herself a porch, I said no. I live in the UK so we don\u2019t have porch where you can just park your car, it\u2019s all street parking. \n\nAfter I turned down her request she has stopped greeting me whenever she says me, fine I don\u2019t care. I\u2019d like to note at this point her family members were still using my parking spot. \n\nToday she approaches me and informs me that she will start building her driveway taking up half of my property. I\u2019d like to note that I don\u2019t own the house, I just rent it. The council owns the house. She tells me that the council has given her permission to take up half of my front garden to build her driveway, lol ok. I again informed her that I don\u2019t consent and that she cannot go ahead with her building plan. \n\nThis kind of entitlement has enraged me so I called up my brother who had a car and told him to come and park in my parking spot, he did. As soon as my brother parked his car, my neighbor the husband came out yelling at my brother telling him to move his car that was when I told him that he and his family members could no longer park on my spot. \n\nThe whole driveway issues confuses me and I will be calling the council later today to try and stop this crazy woman taking half of my garden!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. They provided a detailed story about a neighbor trying to park in their spot and build a driveway on their garden.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author has been letting the neighbor park in their spot for years because they didn't have a car. Now that the author has a car (via their brother), they're refusing to let the neighbor park there anymore. The neighbor also tried to build a driveway on the author's garden, which the author is against.\n\nIn the UK, property boundaries and permissions are important. The author mentions they rent the house from the council. So, the garden is part of their rented property. If the neighbor is trying to build on someone else's property, that's a problem. The author is right to object to that and contact the council.\n\nThe parking spot is part of the author's property. Even though they allowed the neighbor to park there before, that doesn't mean the neighbor has a right to it. The author can change their mind, especially since they now need the space. The neighbor's entitlement in trying to take over the garden and the parking spot seems like the main issue here.\n\nThe author's actions\u2014parking their own car there to prevent the neighbor from using it\u2014seems like a reasonable way to enforce their right to the space. The neighbor was using it without permission, so the author is within their rights to stop them.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. They're protecting their property and rights. The neighbor's actions are the questionable ones here. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
