I have lived inside this house for the past 18 years, they moved in about 3/4 years ago. At first I had no issues letting them park in my parking spot because I had no car. I\u2019m not an asshole so I let them park their car there for years free of charge. \n\nA few months ago I had the wife approach me and ask me if she could take half of my front garden to build herself a porch, I said no. I live in the UK so we don\u2019t have porch where you can just park your car, it\u2019s all street parking. \n\nAfter I turned down her request she has stopped greeting me whenever she says me, fine I don\u2019t care. I\u2019d like to note at this point her family members were still using my parking spot. \n\nToday she approaches me and informs me that she will start building her driveway taking up half of my property. I\u2019d like to note that I don\u2019t own the house, I just rent it. The council owns the house. She tells me that the council has given her permission to take up half of my front garden to build her driveway, lol ok. I again informed her that I don\u2019t consent and that she cannot go ahead with her building plan. \n\nThis kind of entitlement has enraged me so I called up my brother who had a car and told him to come and park in my parking spot, he did. As soon as my brother parked his car, my neighbor the husband came out yelling at my brother telling him to move his car that was when I told him that he and his family members could no longer park on my spot. \n\nThe whole driveway issues confuses me and I will be calling the council later today to try and stop this crazy woman taking half of my garden!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for refusing to let their neighbors park in their spot. The situation involves a neighbor wanting to build a driveway on half the author's garden, which the author doesn't consent to. The author then tells their brother to park in the spot, leading to conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to consider UK property laws. Since the author rents the house from the council, they don't own the property. Typically, in such cases, the landlord (the council) would have more authority over the property. If the neighbor claims the council gave permission, but the author hasn't consented, there's a conflict here. The author might have a valid point if they didn't agree to the use of their garden. However, since the council owns the property, maybe the neighbor's permission from the council is valid. \n\nNext, parking on the front garden. The author allowed the neighbors to park in their spot for years when they didn't have a car. Now that they have a car, they're changing the policy. The neighbor might argue that they've relied on the previous arrangement. But the author is within their rights to change their mind since it's their property. The brother parking there could be seen as a bit confrontational. Maybe a better approach would be to communicate with the council first. \n\nThe neighbor's attempt to build a driveway on half the garden without the author's consent is problematic. Even if the council approved it, if the author didn't agree, there might be an issue. The author should involve the council to resolve this properly. \n\nSo, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for refusing to let the neighbors park after changing circumstances. However, using a family member to park there might escalate the situation. The main issue is the driveway. The author's actions are more about protecting their property rights, even though they're a tenant. The neighbor's entitlement is the bigger problem here. I think the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong), but there's room for nuance. The key points are the lack of consent for the driveway and the author's right to change parking arrangements.\n"
