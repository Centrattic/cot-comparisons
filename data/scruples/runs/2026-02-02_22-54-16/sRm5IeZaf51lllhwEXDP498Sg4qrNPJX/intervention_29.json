I have lived inside this house for the past 18 years, they moved in about 3/4 years ago. At first I had no issues letting them park in my parking spot because I had no car. I\u2019m not an asshole so I let them park their car there for years free of charge. \n\nA few months ago I had the wife approach me and ask me if she could take half of my front garden to build herself a porch, I said no. I live in the UK so we don\u2019t have porch where you can just park your car, it\u2019s all street parking. \n\nAfter I turned down her request she has stopped greeting me whenever she says me, fine I don\u2019t care. I\u2019d like to note at this point her family members were still using my parking spot. \n\nToday she approaches me and informs me that she will start building her driveway taking up half of my property. I\u2019d like to note that I don\u2019t own the house, I just rent it. The council owns the house. She tells me that the council has given her permission to take up half of my front garden to build her driveway, lol ok. I again informed her that I don\u2019t consent and that she cannot go ahead with her building plan. \n\nThis kind of entitlement has enraged me so I called up my brother who had a car and told him to come and park in my parking spot, he did. As soon as my brother parked his car, my neighbor the husband came out yelling at my brother telling him to move his car that was when I told him that he and his family members could no longer park on my spot. \n\nThe whole driveway issues confuses me and I will be calling the council later today to try and stop this crazy woman taking half of my garden!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about parking and garden space. The author is renting a house from the council in the UK. They've been letting the neighbors park in their free spot for years because they didn't have a car. Now, the neighbor wants to build a driveway on half of the author's front garden, which the author refuses. The neighbor says the council allowed it, but the author doesn't consent. The author then tells their brother to park there, leading to conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to recall UK property laws. In the UK, if you're a tenant, you don't own the land. The council owns the house. So, any changes to the property, like building a driveway, would require the council's permission. The neighbor can't just take part of the garden without the council's approval, especially since the author is the tenant. Even if the neighbor got permission, the author as the tenant would still have some rights, maybe not full ownership but the ability to object if it affects their living space.\n\nThe author allowed the neighbors to park there for years when they didn't have a car. That might be seen as a mutual agreement, but since the author is a tenant, the council might have rules about that. However, the author now has a car and needs the parking spot. The neighbor's request to take half the garden is a significant change. The author is within their rights to refuse, even if the neighbor claims council approval. If the neighbor built without proper authorization, that's their problem.\n\nWhen the author told their brother to park there, that's reclaiming their spot. The neighbor's family had been using it without permission, so the author is just stopping them. The neighbor's entitlement to take over the garden is questionable. The author is protecting their own space and rights as a tenant. Even though they don't own the house, they have rights to the property as per their tenancy agreement.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. They're standing up for their space and challenging the neighbor's unauthorized construction. The neighbor's actions seem overreaching, and the author is taking appropriate steps to address it. The answer should be B.\n"
