I have lived inside this house for the past 18 years, they moved in about 3/4 years ago. At first I had no issues letting them park in my parking spot because I had no car. I\u2019m not an asshole so I let them park their car there for years free of charge. \n\nA few months ago I had the wife approach me and ask me if she could take half of my front garden to build herself a porch, I said no. I live in the UK so we don\u2019t have porch where you can just park your car, it\u2019s all street parking. \n\nAfter I turned down her request she has stopped greeting me whenever she says me, fine I don\u2019t care. I\u2019d like to note at this point her family members were still using my parking spot. \n\nToday she approaches me and informs me that she will start building her driveway taking up half of my property. I\u2019d like to note that I don\u2019t own the house, I just rent it. The council owns the house. She tells me that the council has given her permission to take up half of my front garden to build her driveway, lol ok. I again informed her that I don\u2019t consent and that she cannot go ahead with her building plan. \n\nThis kind of entitlement has enraged me so I called up my brother who had a car and told him to come and park in my parking spot, he did. As soon as my brother parked his car, my neighbor the husband came out yelling at my brother telling him to move his car that was when I told him that he and his family members could no longer park on my spot. \n\nThe whole driveway issues confuses me and I will be calling the council later today to try and stop this crazy woman taking half of my garden!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that they've been letting their neighbors park in their parking spot for years because they didn't have a car. Now they do have a car, and the neighbor tried to take half their garden for a driveway without their permission. The author then told their brother to park there, leading to a confrontation.\n\nFirst, the parking spot: if it's the author's property, even if they're renting, they might have the right to control who parks there. But in the UK, sometimes things like shared driveways or parking can be complicated, especially if it's a rented property. The council owning the house might mean that the garden (front garden) is considered part of the council's property. So if the neighbor got permission from the council to build a driveway on what the author considers their garden, there might be a conflict. But the author says they don't own the house, just rent it, so maybe the garden's ownership is unclear. If the garden is part of the council's property, then the neighbor might have some right to request changes, but the author might need to involve the council to dispute that.\n\nRegarding the parking spot, if the author has been letting the neighbors park there informally, maybe there's an implied agreement. But since the author now has a car, they might need to reclaim the spot. However, the neighbor's family might have relied on that spot for years. The author's response was to have their brother park there, which could be seen as asserting their right, but might also be seen as abrupt if the neighbors had been using it without issues.\n\nThe part where the neighbor tried to take half the garden for a driveway is more serious. If the council approved it without the author's consent, that might not be legal if the garden is the author's. But if the council owns the garden, the author might have limited rights. The author contacting the council is a good step to resolve that.\n\nSo, in terms of the parking spot, the author might not be in the wrong if they own the spot. But if the parking spot is part of a shared area or the council's property, maybe not. The author's actions in parking their brother's car could be seen as asserting their right, but if the neighbors had been using it under an assumption of shared use, it's a bit of a gray area. The driveway issue is more about property rights and needing the council's involvement.\n\nOverall, it seems like the author is trying to protect their property and rights, but there might be some nuances depending on the exact ownership of the garden and parking spot. The neighbor's entitlement to build a driveway without consent is problematic, but the author's response to the parking might be justified if they have the right to the spot. So maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong), but with the caveat that they need to clarify ownership with the council.\n"
