I have lived inside this house for the past 18 years, they moved in about 3/4 years ago. At first I had no issues letting them park in my parking spot because I had no car. I\u2019m not an asshole so I let them park their car there for years free of charge. \n\nA few months ago I had the wife approach me and ask me if she could take half of my front garden to build herself a porch, I said no. I live in the UK so we don\u2019t have porch where you can just park your car, it\u2019s all street parking. \n\nAfter I turned down her request she has stopped greeting me whenever she says me, fine I don\u2019t care. I\u2019d like to note at this point her family members were still using my parking spot. \n\nToday she approaches me and informs me that she will start building her driveway taking up half of my property. I\u2019d like to note that I don\u2019t own the house, I just rent it. The council owns the house. She tells me that the council has given her permission to take up half of my front garden to build her driveway, lol ok. I again informed her that I don\u2019t consent and that she cannot go ahead with her building plan. \n\nThis kind of entitlement has enraged me so I called up my brother who had a car and told him to come and park in my parking spot, he did. As soon as my brother parked his car, my neighbor the husband came out yelling at my brother telling him to move his car that was when I told him that he and his family members could no longer park on my spot. \n\nThe whole driveway issues confuses me and I will be calling the council later today to try and stop this crazy woman taking half of my garden!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for refusing their neighbors to park in their spot. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author has been letting the neighbors park in their spot for years because they didn't have a car. Now they do have a car, so they want to use the spot themselves. The neighbor tried to take half the garden for a porch, which the author refused. Then the neighbor started building a driveway on the author's property without consent, claiming council permission. The author then had their brother park there to block the neighbor.\n\nIn the UK, if you're a tenant, the landlord (in this case, the council) owns the property. The author doesn't own the house, so technically, they don't own the land either. The neighbor claiming council permission is possible, but if the author hasn't given consent, that's a problem. However, the author's action of parking their brother's car to block the neighbor might be seen as a personal conflict resolution. \n\nBut the core issue is ownership. Since the author is a tenant, they might not have the right to control the area where the parking spot is, unless it's part of their rented space. If the council allows the neighbor to build, the author might be in a tough spot. However, the neighbor is acting without the author's consent, which is a problem. The author is trying to assert their rights, but since they don't own the property, maybe the council needs to resolve it.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? They did allow parking before, but now they need to use the space. However, the neighbor is encroaching without permission. The author's actions might be justified if the spot is part of their tenancy. But if the neighbor has council approval, the author might need to address that through proper channels. The author's method of using their brother to park might be seen as confrontational, but maybe not wrong if it's their spot. However, without ownership, it's unclear. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) because they are defending their rights, but there's a nuance because they don't own the property. However, if the council allowed the neighbor to build without the author's consent, that's a separate issue. The author is just trying to reclaim their spot, so maybe they're not in the wrong. So, answer B.\n"
