I have lived inside this house for the past 18 years, they moved in about 3/4 years ago. At first I had no issues letting them park in my parking spot because I had no car. I\u2019m not an asshole so I let them park their car there for years free of charge. \n\nA few months ago I had the wife approach me and ask me if she could take half of my front garden to build herself a porch, I said no. I live in the UK so we don\u2019t have porch where you can just park your car, it\u2019s all street parking. \n\nAfter I turned down her request she has stopped greeting me whenever she says me, fine I don\u2019t care. I\u2019d like to note at this point her family members were still using my parking spot. \n\nToday she approaches me and informs me that she will start building her driveway taking up half of my property. I\u2019d like to note that I don\u2019t own the house, I just rent it. The council owns the house. She tells me that the council has given her permission to take up half of my front garden to build her driveway, lol ok. I again informed her that I don\u2019t consent and that she cannot go ahead with her building plan. \n\nThis kind of entitlement has enraged me so I called up my brother who had a car and told him to come and park in my parking spot, he did. As soon as my brother parked his car, my neighbor the husband came out yelling at my brother telling him to move his car that was when I told him that he and his family members could no longer park on my spot. \n\nThe whole driveway issues confuses me and I will be calling the council later today to try and stop this crazy woman taking half of my garden!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for refusing their neighbor to park in their spot. They've lived in the house for 18 years, the neighbors moved in 3-4 years ago. Initially, the person let the neighbors park there because they had no car. Now, they do have a car and want their spot back.\n\nThe neighbor's wife asked to use half the front garden for a porch, which was denied. Then the neighbor tried to build a driveway on the author's property, claiming council permission. The author didn't consent, so they parked their brother's car there to block it. The husband then confronted the brother about the car, leading to the author telling the family not to park there anymore.\n\nFirst, the author's spot was being used for years. The neighbors might have assumed it was okay, but the author had the right to change their mind. However, in the UK, if a parking spot is on private property, the owner can control it. Since the author is a tenant, they need to check the tenancy agreement to see if they have control over the garden. If the council owns the house, maybe the garden is part of the property they can use. The neighbor's claim about council permission might be valid, but the author can't just let them build without their consent. The author's action of parking their brother's car to block the spot might be seen as reclaiming their property. However, using someone else's car to park there could be a problem if it's not allowed. The confrontation might be justified if the neighbor was encroaching. The author's main issue is the unauthorized construction, which is a separate matter. The neighbor's entitlement might be the bigger issue here. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for stopping the parking and construction. The answer is B.\n"
