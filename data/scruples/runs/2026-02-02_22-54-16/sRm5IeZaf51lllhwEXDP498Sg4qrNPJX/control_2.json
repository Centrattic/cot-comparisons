I have lived inside this house for the past 18 years, they moved in about 3/4 years ago. At first I had no issues letting them park in my parking spot because I had no car. I\u2019m not an asshole so I let them park their car there for years free of charge. \n\nA few months ago I had the wife approach me and ask me if she could take half of my front garden to build herself a porch, I said no. I live in the UK so we don\u2019t have porch where you can just park your car, it\u2019s all street parking. \n\nAfter I turned down her request she has stopped greeting me whenever she says me, fine I don\u2019t care. I\u2019d like to note at this point her family members were still using my parking spot. \n\nToday she approaches me and informs me that she will start building her driveway taking up half of my property. I\u2019d like to note that I don\u2019t own the house, I just rent it. The council owns the house. She tells me that the council has given her permission to take up half of my front garden to build her driveway, lol ok. I again informed her that I don\u2019t consent and that she cannot go ahead with her building plan. \n\nThis kind of entitlement has enraged me so I called up my brother who had a car and told him to come and park in my parking spot, he did. As soon as my brother parked his car, my neighbor the husband came out yelling at my brother telling him to move his car that was when I told him that he and his family members could no longer park on my spot. \n\nThe whole driveway issues confuses me and I will be calling the council later today to try and stop this crazy woman taking half of my garden!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for refusing their neighbor to park in their spot. The situation involves a neighbor trying to take half the author's garden for a driveway, and the author had previously allowed parking. \n\nFirst, the author has been living in the house for 18 years, and the neighbor moved in 3-4 years ago. Initially, since the author had no car, they let the neighbor park there. Now, the author has a car (brought by their brother) and wants to use the spot themselves. The neighbor is claiming the council gave permission to take half the garden for a driveway, but the author refuses.\n\nIn the UK, council-owned properties might have different rules. If the house is rented, the tenant might have certain rights, but the council as the landowner could have the final say. However, the neighbor can't just take someone else's property without consent. The author's refusal to let the neighbor park now could be justified if they've established a usage right, but that's not clear here.\n\nThe key points: The author allowed parking out of goodwill when they didn't have a car. Now, they want to park there. The neighbor's claim about the council's permission might be a red herring, but the author is asserting their right to the spot. The author's brother parking there could be seen as asserting ownership, but if the spot is indeed the author's, that's their right. However, if the parking spot is part of the shared property or the neighbor was under a previous agreement, the author might be overstepping. But given the info, the author seems to be defending their space after a change in circumstances. The neighbor's entitlement in taking half the garden without consent is questionable. So, the author isn't in the wrong here.\n"
