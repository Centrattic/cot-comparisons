I have lived inside this house for the past 18 years, they moved in about 3/4 years ago. At first I had no issues letting them park in my parking spot because I had no car. I\u2019m not an asshole so I let them park their car there for years free of charge. \n\nA few months ago I had the wife approach me and ask me if she could take half of my front garden to build herself a porch, I said no. I live in the UK so we don\u2019t have porch where you can just park your car, it\u2019s all street parking. \n\nAfter I turned down her request she has stopped greeting me whenever she says me, fine I don\u2019t care. I\u2019d like to note at this point her family members were still using my parking spot. \n\nToday she approaches me and informs me that she will start building her driveway taking up half of my property. I\u2019d like to note that I don\u2019t own the house, I just rent it. The council owns the house. She tells me that the council has given her permission to take up half of my front garden to build her driveway, lol ok. I again informed her that I don\u2019t consent and that she cannot go ahead with her building plan. \n\nThis kind of entitlement has enraged me so I called up my brother who had a car and told him to come and park in my parking spot, he did. As soon as my brother parked his car, my neighbor the husband came out yelling at my brother telling him to move his car that was when I told him that he and his family members could no longer park on my spot. \n\nThe whole driveway issues confuses me and I will be calling the council later today to try and stop this crazy woman taking half of my garden!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about parking spots and a neighbor wanting to build a driveway on the author's front garden.\n\nFirst, the author has been letting the neighbors park in their parking spot for years. The author mentions they have no car, so maybe they were being generous. Then, the neighbor's wife asked to take half of the front garden for a porch, which was denied. After that, the wife stopped greeting the author. Then, the neighbor tried to build a driveway on the author's property without permission, claiming the council approved it. The author then told their brother to park there, which led to a confrontation.\n\nThe key points here are about property rights. Since the author rents the house, they don't own it, but they might still have rights to the front garden. In the UK, if it's a council property, the council might have specific rules about alterations. The neighbor saying the council approved the driveway is a red flag. If the council didn't actually give permission, that's a problem. But even if they did, the author might have a say over their garden space, unless the council transferred those rights to the neighbor.\n\nThe author's action of parking their brother's car to block the spot could be seen as taking matters into their own hands. Legally, if the parking spot is part of the property the author rents, they might have the right to use it, but allowing others to park there for so long might create an implied permission. However, the neighbor didn't own the house either, so they shouldn't be altering the property without consent.\n\nThe author's response to stop the parking by parking there might be justified if the neighbor was using it without permission, but using a family member's car to block it could be seen as a bit of a confrontational tactic. The main issue is whether the author had the right to refuse parking after allowing it for years. If the parking spot is communal or shared, the rules might be different. But if it's part of the author's rented property, they might have the right to control access.\n\nThe neighbor's attempt to build on the author's garden without permission is definitely a problem. The author is right to inform the council. So, the author's actions in stopping the parking and confronting the neighbor might be within their rights. However, using a family member to park there could be seen as a bit extreme, but if the neighbor was using it without permission, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for stopping them. The main issue is the neighbor's entitlement to alter the property without consent. \n\nI think the author is not in the wrong here. They were being generous before, but once the neighbor overstepped by trying to take over the garden, the author was within their rights to stop the parking.\n"
