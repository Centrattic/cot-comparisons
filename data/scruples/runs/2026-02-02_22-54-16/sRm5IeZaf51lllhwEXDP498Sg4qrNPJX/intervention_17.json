I have lived inside this house for the past 18 years, they moved in about 3/4 years ago. At first I had no issues letting them park in my parking spot because I had no car. I\u2019m not an asshole so I let them park their car there for years free of charge. \n\nA few months ago I had the wife approach me and ask me if she could take half of my front garden to build herself a porch, I said no. I live in the UK so we don\u2019t have porch where you can just park your car, it\u2019s all street parking. \n\nAfter I turned down her request she has stopped greeting me whenever she says me, fine I don\u2019t care. I\u2019d like to note at this point her family members were still using my parking spot. \n\nToday she approaches me and informs me that she will start building her driveway taking up half of my property. I\u2019d like to note that I don\u2019t own the house, I just rent it. The council owns the house. She tells me that the council has given her permission to take up half of my front garden to build her driveway, lol ok. I again informed her that I don\u2019t consent and that she cannot go ahead with her building plan. \n\nThis kind of entitlement has enraged me so I called up my brother who had a car and told him to come and park in my parking spot, he did. As soon as my brother parked his car, my neighbor the husband came out yelling at my brother telling him to move his car that was when I told him that he and his family members could no longer park on my spot. \n\nThe whole driveway issues confuses me and I will be calling the council later today to try and stop this crazy woman taking half of my garden!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person in the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a neighbor using their parking spot and then trying to build a driveway on the author's property.\n\nFirst, the author has been letting the neighbor park in their spot for years because they didn't have a car. That seems like a generous gesture. Now that the author has a car, they want to use the spot. The neighbor, however, is trying to take over half the garden for a driveway, which the author refuses. The author then tells their brother to park there to prevent the neighbors from using it.\n\nThe key points here are about property rights and agreements. Since the author rents the house, the front garden is part of the rented property. The neighbor can't claim that the author has given permission for that space. The author isn't obligated to let the neighbors park there, even if they had done so before. The neighbor's attempt to build a driveway without consent is a problem because it's the author's property. The author's response, while maybe a bit confrontational by having someone park there, is a way to enforce their right to use the spot. \n\nThe neighbor's entitlement seems to be the bigger issue. They shouldn't be able to take over the author's space without permission. The council's involvement could clarify ownership and permissions, but the author is justified in protecting their property. So, the author isn't in the wrong here.\n"
