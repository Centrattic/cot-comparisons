I have lived inside this house for the past 18 years, they moved in about 3/4 years ago. At first I had no issues letting them park in my parking spot because I had no car. I\u2019m not an asshole so I let them park their car there for years free of charge. \n\nA few months ago I had the wife approach me and ask me if she could take half of my front garden to build herself a porch, I said no. I live in the UK so we don\u2019t have porch where you can just park your car, it\u2019s all street parking. \n\nAfter I turned down her request she has stopped greeting me whenever she says me, fine I don\u2019t care. I\u2019d like to note at this point her family members were still using my parking spot. \n\nToday she approaches me and informs me that she will start building her driveway taking up half of my property. I\u2019d like to note that I don\u2019t own the house, I just rent it. The council owns the house. She tells me that the council has given her permission to take up half of my front garden to build her driveway, lol ok. I again informed her that I don\u2019t consent and that she cannot go ahead with her building plan. \n\nThis kind of entitlement has enraged me so I called up my brother who had a car and told him to come and park in my parking spot, he did. As soon as my brother parked his car, my neighbor the husband came out yelling at my brother telling him to move his car that was when I told him that he and his family members could no longer park on my spot. \n\nThe whole driveway issues confuses me and I will be calling the council later today to try and stop this crazy woman taking half of my garden!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for refusing to let their neighbors park in their spot. They've lived in the house for 18 years, and the neighbors moved in 3-4 years ago. Initially, the author allowed the neighbors to park there when they didn't have a car themselves. Now, they do have a car, so they're taking back their spot. The neighbors, especially the wife, asked to take half the garden for a porch, which was refused. Then the wife tried to build a driveway on the author's property, claiming council permission. The author called their brother to park there, leading to the neighbor's husband confronting them.\n\nFirst, the author isn't at fault for reclaiming their parking spot. They had allowed it before when they didn't need it, but it's their property now. The neighbors don't have legal rights to the spot unless it's a shared driveway, which doesn't seem to be the case. The council owning the house complicates things, but the author is a tenant. However, if the garden is part of the property, the council would handle permissions. The author didn't know about the council's approval until now, so their refusal to consent is valid. The author's action of parking their brother's car was to assert their claim, which is reasonable. The neighbor's actions, especially taking half the garden without consent, are problematic. So, the author isn't in the wrong here.\n"
