I have lived inside this house for the past 18 years, they moved in about 3/4 years ago. At first I had no issues letting them park in my parking spot because I had no car. I\u2019m not an asshole so I let them park their car there for years free of charge. \n\nA few months ago I had the wife approach me and ask me if she could take half of my front garden to build herself a porch, I said no. I live in the UK so we don\u2019t have porch where you can just park your car, it\u2019s all street parking. \n\nAfter I turned down her request she has stopped greeting me whenever she says me, fine I don\u2019t care. I\u2019d like to note at this point her family members were still using my parking spot. \n\nToday she approaches me and informs me that she will start building her driveway taking up half of my property. I\u2019d like to note that I don\u2019t own the house, I just rent it. The council owns the house. She tells me that the council has given her permission to take up half of my front garden to build her driveway, lol ok. I again informed her that I don\u2019t consent and that she cannot go ahead with her building plan. \n\nThis kind of entitlement has enraged me so I called up my brother who had a car and told him to come and park in my parking spot, he did. As soon as my brother parked his car, my neighbor the husband came out yelling at my brother telling him to move his car that was when I told him that he and his family members could no longer park on my spot. \n\nThe whole driveway issues confuses me and I will be calling the council later today to try and stop this crazy woman taking half of my garden!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for refusing to let their neighbors park in their spot. Let me read through the scenario again.\n\nSo, the author has lived in the house for 18 years. The neighbors moved in 3-4 years ago. The author had no car initially, so they let the neighbors park in their spot for years. Then, the neighbor's wife asked to take half the garden for a porch, which the author refused. The wife stopped greeting them. The family still used the parking spot. Later, the wife claims the council allowed her to build a driveway on half the author's garden. The author didn't consent and told their brother to park there, leading to confrontation.\n\nFirst, the author is a renter, so they don't own the house. The council owns it. The neighbor is claiming permission from the council to take half the garden. The author is now blocking them from parking, which they had allowed before. The key points here are about property rights and permissions.\n\nIn the UK, if someone is renting, they might have rights to use the property as per the lease. If the neighbor has council permission to build on the garden, that could be an issue. But the author's spot was free, and they had allowed parking. However, when the neighbor is now taking up the author's garden, that's a different matter. The author might not have the legal right to allow parking there if it's part of the council property. \n\nThe author's action of parking their brother's car to block the neighbor could be problematic. They had allowed parking before, so suddenly denying access might be seen as a change in terms without prior agreement. Also, if the council gave permission for the driveway, the author might not have the authority to stop that. \n\nBut since the author is a tenant, they can't make structural changes. The neighbor's construction on the garden would need proper permits. If the council approved it, maybe the author has no say. However, if the neighbor didn't have proper consent, the author could object. \n\nThe main issue is whether the author had the right to allow parking. If the parking spot is council property, the author can't unilaterally decide who parks there. So previous permission might not be valid. The author's refusal now could be justified if the neighbor is infringing on their garden, but the initial parking might have been a grey area. \n\nThe author's confrontation by parking their brother's car might be seen as aggressive. The neighbor's family had been using it, so blocking them now could be a breach of implicit agreement. The author might be in the wrong for changing the terms without prior discussion. Also, the author's threat to call the council about the driveway is their right, but their action of parking there could be seen as overstepping.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author might be in the wrong for denying parking without a clear legal basis, especially if the spot is not their property to control. Their action could be considered retaliatory after the neighbor's request for the garden. Also, the neighbor's building permission from the council might give them more legal standing, but the author should address that through proper channels instead of taking matters into their own hands.\n"
