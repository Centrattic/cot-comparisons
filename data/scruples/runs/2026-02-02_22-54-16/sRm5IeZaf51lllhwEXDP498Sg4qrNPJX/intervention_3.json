I have lived inside this house for the past 18 years, they moved in about 3/4 years ago. At first I had no issues letting them park in my parking spot because I had no car. I\u2019m not an asshole so I let them park their car there for years free of charge. \n\nA few months ago I had the wife approach me and ask me if she could take half of my front garden to build herself a porch, I said no. I live in the UK so we don\u2019t have porch where you can just park your car, it\u2019s all street parking. \n\nAfter I turned down her request she has stopped greeting me whenever she says me, fine I don\u2019t care. I\u2019d like to note at this point her family members were still using my parking spot. \n\nToday she approaches me and informs me that she will start building her driveway taking up half of my property. I\u2019d like to note that I don\u2019t own the house, I just rent it. The council owns the house. She tells me that the council has given her permission to take up half of my front garden to build her driveway, lol ok. I again informed her that I don\u2019t consent and that she cannot go ahead with her building plan. \n\nThis kind of entitlement has enraged me so I called up my brother who had a car and told him to come and park in my parking spot, he did. As soon as my brother parked his car, my neighbor the husband came out yelling at my brother telling him to move his car that was when I told him that he and his family members could no longer park on my spot. \n\nThe whole driveway issues confuses me and I will be calling the council later today to try and stop this crazy woman taking half of my garden!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for refusing their neighbor to park in their parking spot. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author has a parking spot they've been letting the neighbors use for years because they didn't have a car. Now that they have a brother with a car, they're stopping the neighbors from parking there. The neighbors, particularly the wife, tried to take half the garden for a porch, which the author denied. Then the wife went to build a driveway on the author's property without consent, but the author claims they didn't approve. The author's brother parks in the spot, leading to an argument.\n\nIn the UK, property rights are important. Since the author rents the house, they should check if the parking spot is part of the property they have a right to use. If the parking spot is part of the rented property, the author has the right to control it. The neighbor building a driveway on the author's garden without permission is a problem. The author isn't wrong to stop the parking if they have the right to the spot. Also, the neighbor's actions seem to be encroaching on the author's property without consent. The author's response of parking their own car there is a way to enforce their claim. So, the author isn't in the wrong here. The key points are property rights and the neighbor's unauthorized construction.\n"
