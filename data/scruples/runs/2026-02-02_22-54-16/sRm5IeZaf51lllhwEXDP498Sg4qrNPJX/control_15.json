I have lived inside this house for the past 18 years, they moved in about 3/4 years ago. At first I had no issues letting them park in my parking spot because I had no car. I\u2019m not an asshole so I let them park their car there for years free of charge. \n\nA few months ago I had the wife approach me and ask me if she could take half of my front garden to build herself a porch, I said no. I live in the UK so we don\u2019t have porch where you can just park your car, it\u2019s all street parking. \n\nAfter I turned down her request she has stopped greeting me whenever she says me, fine I don\u2019t care. I\u2019d like to note at this point her family members were still using my parking spot. \n\nToday she approaches me and informs me that she will start building her driveway taking up half of my property. I\u2019d like to note that I don\u2019t own the house, I just rent it. The council owns the house. She tells me that the council has given her permission to take up half of my front garden to build her driveway, lol ok. I again informed her that I don\u2019t consent and that she cannot go ahead with her building plan. \n\nThis kind of entitlement has enraged me so I called up my brother who had a car and told him to come and park in my parking spot, he did. As soon as my brother parked his car, my neighbor the husband came out yelling at my brother telling him to move his car that was when I told him that he and his family members could no longer park on my spot. \n\nThe whole driveway issues confuses me and I will be calling the council later today to try and stop this crazy woman taking half of my garden!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person in the story is in the wrong. Let's look at the details.\n\nFirst, the author has been letting their neighbors park in their parking spot for years. The neighbor family has four cars, which is a lot, but the author had no car initially, so that's why they allowed it. Then the neighbor's wife asked to take half of the front garden for a porch, which the author refused. After that, the wife stopped greeting the author. But the family kept using the parking spot. \n\nNow, the wife says the council gave her permission to build a driveway on half of the author's front garden. The author refuses, maybe because they don't own the house (it's a council property) and they don't consent. So the author gets their brother to park in the spot, leading to conflict.\n\nSo, the main issues here are parking rights and the council's permission. If the front garden is part of the author's rented property, even if the house is council-owned, the author might have a right to control access. However, if the neighbor has council permission, maybe there's an official agreement. The author's brother parking there might be a way to prevent construction, but it could also be seen as a provocation if the council hasn't approved. \n\nIn the UK, council property can have specific rules. If the council allows the neighbor to build on the garden, the author might be overstepping by blocking it. But the author might not want to lose their garden space. Also, the neighbor family using the parking spot without the owner's consent could be an issue. \n\nThe author's actions in sending their brother to park there might be seen as a necessary defense of their property, but maybe there's a better way through the council. However, since the author is a tenant, they might not have full rights to the garden. If the council has approved the neighbor's project, the author might be in the wrong by interfering. \n\nBut the neighbor might not have followed proper procedures. The author is trying to stop unauthorized construction. So it's a bit of a gray area. The key points are property rights, tenant vs. owner, and council permissions. If the council didn't actually give permission, the author is right to oppose it. If they did, maybe the author is in the wrong. The answer would depend on the actual council's stance, which isn't clear here. But based on the info given, the author is trying to protect their property from unauthorized use, so they might be in the right. Answer B.\n"
