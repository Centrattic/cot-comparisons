I have lived inside this house for the past 18 years, they moved in about 3/4 years ago. At first I had no issues letting them park in my parking spot because I had no car. I\u2019m not an asshole so I let them park their car there for years free of charge. \n\nA few months ago I had the wife approach me and ask me if she could take half of my front garden to build herself a porch, I said no. I live in the UK so we don\u2019t have porch where you can just park your car, it\u2019s all street parking. \n\nAfter I turned down her request she has stopped greeting me whenever she says me, fine I don\u2019t care. I\u2019d like to note at this point her family members were still using my parking spot. \n\nToday she approaches me and informs me that she will start building her driveway taking up half of my property. I\u2019d like to note that I don\u2019t own the house, I just rent it. The council owns the house. She tells me that the council has given her permission to take up half of my front garden to build her driveway, lol ok. I again informed her that I don\u2019t consent and that she cannot go ahead with her building plan. \n\nThis kind of entitlement has enraged me so I called up my brother who had a car and told him to come and park in my parking spot, he did. As soon as my brother parked his car, my neighbor the husband came out yelling at my brother telling him to move his car that was when I told him that he and his family members could no longer park on my spot. \n\nThe whole driveway issues confuses me and I will be calling the council later today to try and stop this crazy woman taking half of my garden!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. So, the situation is about parking spots and a neighbor trying to build a driveway on their garden. The user is in the UK, renting a house from the council.\n\nFirst, the neighbor family has four cars. The user has allowed them to park in their spot for years when they didn't have a car. Now, the neighbor asked to take half the garden for a porch, which the user refused. Then the neighbor tried to build a driveway on the user's property, claiming council permission, but the user didn't consent. The user then had their brother park there to block the neighbor, leading to a confrontation.\n\nSo, the main issues here are property rights and permissions. Since the user is a tenant, they don't own the house. The council owns it, so any changes to the property would need the council's approval. The user's neighbor claims permission from the council, but the user hasn't given consent. However, as a tenant, the user might not have the authority to prevent the council from making changes, unless the council didn't follow proper procedure. \n\nThe user's action of parking their brother's car to block the neighbor could be seen as asserting their right to the parking spot, which they've been using. But since the neighbor's family has been parking there for years, maybe there's some informal agreement. However, the user is the one who allowed it initially, so they can withdraw permission. \n\nBut the bigger issue is the neighbor building on the user's garden. If the council approved it without the user's consent, there might be a problem. The user is correct in objecting since they are the tenant and might have rights against unauthorized changes. \n\nSo, the user's actions in blocking the parking spot could be justified as reclaiming their spot, especially since they were the ones who allowed the parking in the first place. The neighbor's attempt to build without the tenant's consent might be invalid if the council didn't properly consult the tenant. \n\nTherefore, the user isn't necessarily in the wrong for stopping the neighbor from parking and confronting the driveway issue. Their actions are protecting their property rights as a tenant. The answer is B.\n"
