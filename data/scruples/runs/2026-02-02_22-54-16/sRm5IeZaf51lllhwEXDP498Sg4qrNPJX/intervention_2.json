I have lived inside this house for the past 18 years, they moved in about 3/4 years ago. At first I had no issues letting them park in my parking spot because I had no car. I\u2019m not an asshole so I let them park their car there for years free of charge. \n\nA few months ago I had the wife approach me and ask me if she could take half of my front garden to build herself a porch, I said no. I live in the UK so we don\u2019t have porch where you can just park your car, it\u2019s all street parking. \n\nAfter I turned down her request she has stopped greeting me whenever she says me, fine I don\u2019t care. I\u2019d like to note at this point her family members were still using my parking spot. \n\nToday she approaches me and informs me that she will start building her driveway taking up half of my property. I\u2019d like to note that I don\u2019t own the house, I just rent it. The council owns the house. She tells me that the council has given her permission to take up half of my front garden to build her driveway, lol ok. I again informed her that I don\u2019t consent and that she cannot go ahead with her building plan. \n\nThis kind of entitlement has enraged me so I called up my brother who had a car and told him to come and park in my parking spot, he did. As soon as my brother parked his car, my neighbor the husband came out yelling at my brother telling him to move his car that was when I told him that he and his family members could no longer park on my spot. \n\nThe whole driveway issues confuses me and I will be calling the council later today to try and stop this crazy woman taking half of my garden!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about parking and a neighbor wanting to take part of the front garden for a driveway.\n\nFirst, the author lived in the house for 18 years, and the neighbors moved in 3-4 years ago. The author didn't have a car at first, so they let the neighbors park in their spot for a long time. Then the neighbor asked to take half the garden for a porch, which the author refused. The neighbor then tried to build a driveway on the author's property without permission, claiming the council approved it. The author then had a brother park there to stop them.\n\nIn the UK, property ownership matters. Since the author is a tenant renting from the council, the council owns the house and possibly the garden. If the neighbor is told by the council that they can build there, but the author hasn't given consent, there might be a legal dispute. However, the author isn't the owner, so any changes to the property might need the council's approval. The neighbor's actions might be based on council permission, but the author is a tenant, so they might have some rights if the garden is part of their rented property. \n\nThe author's action of parking their brother's car to prevent the neighbor from parking could be seen as asserting their right to the space, especially if it's part of the rented property. However, if the neighbor has council approval, the author might need to address that through the proper channels. The author's refusal to let the neighbor park after years might be sudden, but they might be protecting their own property. \n\nOn the other hand, the neighbor might have a claim if the council says it's allowed. The author could be in the wrong if the council actually approved the driveway, and the author is blocking a legitimate construction. But the author isn't the owner, so the council's decision might take precedence. \n\nI think the key points are whether the council's permission is valid and if the garden is part of the tenant's property. If the council allows it, the author might not have the right to block it. However, the neighbor using the parking spot for years without permission might not be legal either. The author's action to park their brother's car is a way to assert control over their space, but if the council is involved, they should handle it through them. \n\nSo, the author might not be in the wrong for trying to protect their property, but they should follow the proper procedures. The answer might be B (No), as the author is defending their property rights as a tenant, but they need to involve the council to resolve the dispute properly.\n"
