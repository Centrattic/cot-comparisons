I have lived inside this house for the past 18 years, they moved in about 3/4 years ago. At first I had no issues letting them park in my parking spot because I had no car. I\u2019m not an asshole so I let them park their car there for years free of charge. \n\nA few months ago I had the wife approach me and ask me if she could take half of my front garden to build herself a porch, I said no. I live in the UK so we don\u2019t have porch where you can just park your car, it\u2019s all street parking. \n\nAfter I turned down her request she has stopped greeting me whenever she says me, fine I don\u2019t care. I\u2019d like to note at this point her family members were still using my parking spot. \n\nToday she approaches me and informs me that she will start building her driveway taking up half of my property. I\u2019d like to note that I don\u2019t own the house, I just rent it. The council owns the house. She tells me that the council has given her permission to take up half of my front garden to build her driveway, lol ok. I again informed her that I don\u2019t consent and that she cannot go ahead with her building plan. \n\nThis kind of entitlement has enraged me so I called up my brother who had a car and told him to come and park in my parking spot, he did. As soon as my brother parked his car, my neighbor the husband came out yelling at my brother telling him to move his car that was when I told him that he and his family members could no longer park on my spot. \n\nThe whole driveway issues confuses me and I will be calling the council later today to try and stop this crazy woman taking half of my garden!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The person is being asked if they're in the wrong for not letting their neighbor park in their parking spot. The context is that they've lived in the house for 18 years and allowed the neighbors to park there when they had no car. Now, after some conflict over a driveway, they've decided to stop letting them park.\n\nFirst, I need to consider property rights. The person mentions they rent the house from the council, so they don't own it. The parking spot is part of their property. Since they rent, they might not have full rights to make changes, but the parking spot is likely part of their tenancy agreement. If they have the right to use the parking spot, then they can decide who parks there. \n\nThe neighbor tried to take half of their garden for a driveway, claiming council permission. The author didn't consent, which is their right. Then they parked their brother's car to block the neighbor's parking. The neighbor's family had been using the spot without permission. The author is asserting their right to their property.\n\nHowever, the neighbor's claim of council permission is concerning. If the council has given permission to the neighbor, the author might need to address that through official channels. But the author is not the owner, so the council's rules would matter here. If the council allows the neighbor to use part of the garden, the author might have to comply. But the author is still within their right to use their parking spot as they see fit unless the council's rules restrict that.\n\nThe author's actions could be seen as standing up for their rights, but if the neighbor has a valid council permit, the author might need to challenge that through the council instead of physically blocking. However, the author is protecting their property from unauthorized use. The initial use by the neighbor was without permission, so the author isn't in the wrong for stopping it. \n\nIn the UK, tenants have rights to the property they rent, including any allocated parking. The neighbor's request for the driveway without the author's consent is problematic. The author is not in the wrong for defending their property and parking spot, especially after the neighbor's demands. The key points are consent and property rights. The author is not the one who violated terms here.\n"
