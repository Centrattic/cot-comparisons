I have lived inside this house for the past 18 years, they moved in about 3/4 years ago. At first I had no issues letting them park in my parking spot because I had no car. I\u2019m not an asshole so I let them park their car there for years free of charge. \n\nA few months ago I had the wife approach me and ask me if she could take half of my front garden to build herself a porch, I said no. I live in the UK so we don\u2019t have porch where you can just park your car, it\u2019s all street parking. \n\nAfter I turned down her request she has stopped greeting me whenever she says me, fine I don\u2019t care. I\u2019d like to note at this point her family members were still using my parking spot. \n\nToday she approaches me and informs me that she will start building her driveway taking up half of my property. I\u2019d like to note that I don\u2019t own the house, I just rent it. The council owns the house. She tells me that the council has given her permission to take up half of my front garden to build her driveway, lol ok. I again informed her that I don\u2019t consent and that she cannot go ahead with her building plan. \n\nThis kind of entitlement has enraged me so I called up my brother who had a car and told him to come and park in my parking spot, he did. As soon as my brother parked his car, my neighbor the husband came out yelling at my brother telling him to move his car that was when I told him that he and his family members could no longer park on my spot. \n\nThe whole driveway issues confuses me and I will be calling the council later today to try and stop this crazy woman taking half of my garden!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about parking spots and a neighbor trying to build a driveway. Let me break this down.\n\nThe author has a parking spot that they've been letting their neighbors park in for a few years. The neighbors have four cars, so maybe they needed the space. The author didn't have a car at first, so it made sense. But now, the neighbor (the wife) asked to take half the garden for a porch, which the author refused. Then the wife stopped greeting them. The author mentions they rent the house, so it's a council property. The wife claims the council gave her permission to take half the garden for a driveway. The author objects, then calls their brother to park there, leading to a confrontation.\n\nFirst, the parking spot: if it's a free spot in the UK, does the author actually own it or just have a right to use it? Since they're renting, the ownership is with the council. Maybe the parking spot is part of the property, but the council might have rules. The author allowed the neighbors to park there for years, which created a sort of informal agreement. But when the author decided to stop, maybe they're within their rights if the spot is part of their rented space. But the council's involvement here is key. If the council owns the house and the garden, then the neighbor claiming the council gave permission might have some weight. The author's brother parking there could be seen as asserting control, but if the spot isn't legally the author's to control, that might be an issue.\n\nThe neighbor's request to build a driveway on half the garden complicates things. If the council approved it, the author might have to follow that, unless the council's approval was incorrect. The author's refusal to consent might not matter if the council has given permission. However, the author could argue that the council didn't properly consult them. \n\nIn terms of the parking spot, the author let the neighbors park there for years. That could be seen as a tacit agreement. The neighbors might have relied on that, so suddenly stopping could be seen as a breach. But since it's a free spot and not a legal right, the author can change their mind. However, in the UK, even if it's a free spot, there might be rules about shared spaces or council regulations. If the neighbors were parking there without permission, maybe the author's initial allowing was a kindness, not a legal right. \n\nThe author's brother parking there to assert control could be seen as a bit of a power move. If the neighbors were using the spot with the author's prior consent, then the author's sudden change might not be fair, but if the spot is part of the author's rented property, they can decide who parks there. \n\nThe key points are: ownership of the parking spot and garden, council permissions, and the nature of the initial agreement. If the author's spot is part of their rented property, they can control it. But if the neighbor has valid council permission for the driveway, the author might need to address that through official channels. \n\nSo, the author might not be in the wrong if they have the right to the parking spot and garden. But if the council has given the neighbor permission, then the author's actions might be interfering. Also, the brother parking there could be seen as aggressive. However, since the author was the one who initially allowed parking, they can revoke that. The neighbor's entitlement in trying to build the driveway without the author's consent could be the bigger issue here. \n\nConsidering all that, the answer might be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong for stopping the neighbors from parking and addressing the driveway issue. But there's a nuance. If the council's permission is valid, the author should handle that through the council. The confrontation with the brother parking might not be the best approach, but the core issue of the parking spot is the author's to manage.\n"
