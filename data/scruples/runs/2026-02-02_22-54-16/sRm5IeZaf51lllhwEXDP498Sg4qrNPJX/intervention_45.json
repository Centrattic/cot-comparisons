I have lived inside this house for the past 18 years, they moved in about 3/4 years ago. At first I had no issues letting them park in my parking spot because I had no car. I\u2019m not an asshole so I let them park their car there for years free of charge. \n\nA few months ago I had the wife approach me and ask me if she could take half of my front garden to build herself a porch, I said no. I live in the UK so we don\u2019t have porch where you can just park your car, it\u2019s all street parking. \n\nAfter I turned down her request she has stopped greeting me whenever she says me, fine I don\u2019t care. I\u2019d like to note at this point her family members were still using my parking spot. \n\nToday she approaches me and informs me that she will start building her driveway taking up half of my property. I\u2019d like to note that I don\u2019t own the house, I just rent it. The council owns the house. She tells me that the council has given her permission to take up half of my front garden to build her driveway, lol ok. I again informed her that I don\u2019t consent and that she cannot go ahead with her building plan. \n\nThis kind of entitlement has enraged me so I called up my brother who had a car and told him to come and park in my parking spot, he did. As soon as my brother parked his car, my neighbor the husband came out yelling at my brother telling him to move his car that was when I told him that he and his family members could no longer park on my spot. \n\nThe whole driveway issues confuses me and I will be calling the council later today to try and stop this crazy woman taking half of my garden!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for refusing to let their neighbors park in their spot. The situation is in the UK, and the author has rented the house for 18 years. The neighbors have four cars and have been using the author's parking spot for years. The author didn't have a car initially, so they allowed it.\n\nThen the neighbor's wife asked to take half the garden for a porch, which the author refused. After that, the neighbor started acting hostile and now the wife is trying to build a driveway on the author's property. The author's response was to have their brother park there, leading to a confrontation.\n\nFirst, the legal aspect. Since the author rents the house, the council owns it. The council's permission for the neighbor to build a driveway on the author's garden would matter. If the council's rules don't allow that, the author might have a point. But if the council approves, the author's rights might be limited.\n\nThe parking spot was used by the neighbors without the author's consent. Even if it was allowed informally, the author can revoke that right. The author isn't obligated to let others park there indefinitely. The neighbor's entitlement to build on the garden is another issue. If the author's refusal to let them park is after the initial agreement, but the neighbor is now making demands, the author's actions could be justified.\n\nThe author's method of enforcing the parking by having their brother park there might be a bit confrontational, but they're standing up for their property. The neighbor's actions (building without consent) are also problematic. The author is protecting their space, which they have the right to do, even as a tenant. The answer likely leans towards the author not being in the wrong (B), as they're asserting their rights and the neighbors overstepped.\n"
