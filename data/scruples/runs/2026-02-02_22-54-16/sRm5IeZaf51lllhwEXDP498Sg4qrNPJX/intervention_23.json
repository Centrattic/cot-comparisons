I have lived inside this house for the past 18 years, they moved in about 3/4 years ago. At first I had no issues letting them park in my parking spot because I had no car. I\u2019m not an asshole so I let them park their car there for years free of charge. \n\nA few months ago I had the wife approach me and ask me if she could take half of my front garden to build herself a porch, I said no. I live in the UK so we don\u2019t have porch where you can just park your car, it\u2019s all street parking. \n\nAfter I turned down her request she has stopped greeting me whenever she says me, fine I don\u2019t care. I\u2019d like to note at this point her family members were still using my parking spot. \n\nToday she approaches me and informs me that she will start building her driveway taking up half of my property. I\u2019d like to note that I don\u2019t own the house, I just rent it. The council owns the house. She tells me that the council has given her permission to take up half of my front garden to build her driveway, lol ok. I again informed her that I don\u2019t consent and that she cannot go ahead with her building plan. \n\nThis kind of entitlement has enraged me so I called up my brother who had a car and told him to come and park in my parking spot, he did. As soon as my brother parked his car, my neighbor the husband came out yelling at my brother telling him to move his car that was when I told him that he and his family members could no longer park on my spot. \n\nThe whole driveway issues confuses me and I will be calling the council later today to try and stop this crazy woman taking half of my garden!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author did something wrong by refusing their neighbor to park in their spot. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author has been letting the neighbor park in their spot for years, especially since they didn't have a car. That's pretty generous. Now, the neighbor family has four cars, which makes sense but also might explain their need for parking. The author mentions that the neighbor asked to build a porch using half of the author's garden, which was refused. Then the neighbor tried to build a driveway on the same area, claiming council permission. The author didn't consent, and when the neighbor's husband started yelling, the author had their brother park there to take the spot.\n\nThe key points here are ownership and consent. The author renters the house, so the garden technically isn't theirs to give permission for. The council owns the house, so the neighbor shouldn't be allowed to take the garden without proper authorization. However, the author allowed parking for years, which might have created an implied permission or tolerance. But since the neighbor tried to take more (the porch), the author might have felt justified in stopping them.\n\nThe author's action of parking their brother's car to prevent the neighbor from using the spot could be seen as standing up for their property. However, since the property isn't owned by the author, maybe the council's rules apply. But the neighbor was trying to encroach without proper consent. The author's response might be a way to assert their rights even as a renter. They're not allowing the neighbor to take over their space, especially after the neighbor's entitlement. \n\nSo, is the author wrong? They were protecting their property and the council's ownership. The neighbor's actions were aggressive, and the author's response was to stop them. The author isn't in the wrong here. Answer B.\n"
