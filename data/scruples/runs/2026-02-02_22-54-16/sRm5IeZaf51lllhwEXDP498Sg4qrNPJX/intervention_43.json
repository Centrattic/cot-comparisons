I have lived inside this house for the past 18 years, they moved in about 3/4 years ago. At first I had no issues letting them park in my parking spot because I had no car. I\u2019m not an asshole so I let them park their car there for years free of charge. \n\nA few months ago I had the wife approach me and ask me if she could take half of my front garden to build herself a porch, I said no. I live in the UK so we don\u2019t have porch where you can just park your car, it\u2019s all street parking. \n\nAfter I turned down her request she has stopped greeting me whenever she says me, fine I don\u2019t care. I\u2019d like to note at this point her family members were still using my parking spot. \n\nToday she approaches me and informs me that she will start building her driveway taking up half of my property. I\u2019d like to note that I don\u2019t own the house, I just rent it. The council owns the house. She tells me that the council has given her permission to take up half of my front garden to build her driveway, lol ok. I again informed her that I don\u2019t consent and that she cannot go ahead with her building plan. \n\nThis kind of entitlement has enraged me so I called up my brother who had a car and told him to come and park in my parking spot, he did. As soon as my brother parked his car, my neighbor the husband came out yelling at my brother telling him to move his car that was when I told him that he and his family members could no longer park on my spot. \n\nThe whole driveway issues confuses me and I will be calling the council later today to try and stop this crazy woman taking half of my garden!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for refusing to let their neighbors park in their spot. The situation is a bit complex, so I need to consider a few factors.\n\nFirst, the author has been allowing the neighbors to park in their spot for years because they didn't have a car. Now that they do have a car, they're asserting their right to use the spot. That seems reasonable. The neighbor tried to take half the garden for a porch, which the author refused. Then the neighbor tried to get the council's permission, but the author is a renter, so maybe they have a say in how their rented space is used.\n\nIn the UK, the council owns the house, so the garden might be part of the rental property. If the neighbor is trying to build on the author's rented garden, the author would need to check with the council. The author's action of having a car parked there to prevent the neighbors from using it could be seen as asserting ownership, but since it's a rented property, does the author have the right to control that space? Also, the neighbor's claim that the council gave permission might not be valid if the author hasn't consented, as the council might need the tenant's agreement.\n\nThe author's brother parking there might be a bit of a confrontational move, but it's a way to reclaim the spot. The neighbors using the spot without consent could be a separate issue. The author isn't in the wrong for taking back their space, especially after the neighbor's aggressive actions. However, the legal aspect depends on the council's rules and the rental agreement. The author should contact the council to clarify, but their immediate action to prevent parking isn't wrong. So, the answer is B.\n"
