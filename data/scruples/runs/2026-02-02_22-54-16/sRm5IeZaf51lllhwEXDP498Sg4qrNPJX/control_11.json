I have lived inside this house for the past 18 years, they moved in about 3/4 years ago. At first I had no issues letting them park in my parking spot because I had no car. I\u2019m not an asshole so I let them park their car there for years free of charge. \n\nA few months ago I had the wife approach me and ask me if she could take half of my front garden to build herself a porch, I said no. I live in the UK so we don\u2019t have porch where you can just park your car, it\u2019s all street parking. \n\nAfter I turned down her request she has stopped greeting me whenever she says me, fine I don\u2019t care. I\u2019d like to note at this point her family members were still using my parking spot. \n\nToday she approaches me and informs me that she will start building her driveway taking up half of my property. I\u2019d like to note that I don\u2019t own the house, I just rent it. The council owns the house. She tells me that the council has given her permission to take up half of my front garden to build her driveway, lol ok. I again informed her that I don\u2019t consent and that she cannot go ahead with her building plan. \n\nThis kind of entitlement has enraged me so I called up my brother who had a car and told him to come and park in my parking spot, he did. As soon as my brother parked his car, my neighbor the husband came out yelling at my brother telling him to move his car that was when I told him that he and his family members could no longer park on my spot. \n\nThe whole driveway issues confuses me and I will be calling the council later today to try and stop this crazy woman taking half of my garden!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for refusing their neighbors to park in their spot and confronting them. \n\nFirst, the author has a parking spot that they've allowed the neighbors to use for years while they had no car. Now that they have a car, they're stopping the neighbors. But the neighbors are also trying to build a driveway on half of the author's garden, which the council supposedly approved. The author is upset and took action by having their brother park there, leading to a confrontation.\n\nIn the UK, property rights can be complex. Since the house is rented, the author might not have legal ownership over the front garden. The neighbor claiming council permission is a key point. If the council has given approval, the neighbor might have legal rights to build there, even if the author disagrees. \n\nRegarding the parking spot, if the spot is part of the rented property, the author might have the right to use it now. However, allowing others to park there for years could imply a tacit agreement. If the neighbors were using it without formal permission, the author could revoke it, but there might be expectations of continued use if it's been ongoing.\n\nThe author's action of parking their brother's car to block the neighbors might be seen as a reasonable response to reclaim their spot, but if the neighbors have been using it regularly, there could be issues of mutual understanding. The neighbor's attempt to build a driveway without the author's consent is a separate issue. The author's anger is justified, but they should address the council's decision to resolve that.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong by refusing parking and confronting the neighbors. The answer hinges on property rights and prior agreements. Since the author is a tenant, they can't make unilateral decisions about the property. The council's approval for the driveway is crucial; if valid, the author's refusal to let the neighbor build might not hold. However, the parking spot refusal might be within their rights as a tenant if the spot is part of their tenancy agreement. The confrontation via parking their brother's car is a matter of dispute resolution, but the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for defending their property. So, the answer is B (No).\n"
