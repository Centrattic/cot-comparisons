I have lived inside this house for the past 18 years, they moved in about 3/4 years ago. At first I had no issues letting them park in my parking spot because I had no car. I\u2019m not an asshole so I let them park their car there for years free of charge. \n\nA few months ago I had the wife approach me and ask me if she could take half of my front garden to build herself a porch, I said no. I live in the UK so we don\u2019t have porch where you can just park your car, it\u2019s all street parking. \n\nAfter I turned down her request she has stopped greeting me whenever she says me, fine I don\u2019t care. I\u2019d like to note at this point her family members were still using my parking spot. \n\nToday she approaches me and informs me that she will start building her driveway taking up half of my property. I\u2019d like to note that I don\u2019t own the house, I just rent it. The council owns the house. She tells me that the council has given her permission to take up half of my front garden to build her driveway, lol ok. I again informed her that I don\u2019t consent and that she cannot go ahead with her building plan. \n\nThis kind of entitlement has enraged me so I called up my brother who had a car and told him to come and park in my parking spot, he did. As soon as my brother parked his car, my neighbor the husband came out yelling at my brother telling him to move his car that was when I told him that he and his family members could no longer park on my spot. \n\nThe whole driveway issues confuses me and I will be calling the council later today to try and stop this crazy woman taking half of my garden!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a neighbor wanting to park in their parking spot and then trying to take half the garden for a driveway.\n\nFirst, the author has lived there for 18 years, the neighbors moved in 3-4 years ago. The author allowed the neighbors to park in their spot because they didn't have a car. That seems okay because they were being considerate. But now that the author has a car (since their brother parked there), they're refusing to let the neighbors park anymore. Is that fair? Well, the spot is their own, so they have the right to use it as they see fit. The neighbors were using it without permission before, so the author isn't wrong to stop them.\n\nThen there's the driveway issue. The neighbor wants to take half the garden, which the author doesn't own because it's a rented house. But the neighbor claims the council allowed it. The author is objecting, which makes sense because they don't want their space taken. The author's action of having their brother park there to stop the neighbors is a bit confrontational, but they're reclaiming their own spot. The neighbors were using it without consent, so the author is within their rights to stop that. \n\nThe author's anger at the neighbor's entitlement is understandable. The neighbor tried to take the garden without the author's consent, which is a big deal. The author is taking steps to address this by contacting the council. So, overall, the author is defending their property and rights. The answer should be B, they're not in the wrong.\n"
