I have lived inside this house for the past 18 years, they moved in about 3/4 years ago. At first I had no issues letting them park in my parking spot because I had no car. I\u2019m not an asshole so I let them park their car there for years free of charge. \n\nA few months ago I had the wife approach me and ask me if she could take half of my front garden to build herself a porch, I said no. I live in the UK so we don\u2019t have porch where you can just park your car, it\u2019s all street parking. \n\nAfter I turned down her request she has stopped greeting me whenever she says me, fine I don\u2019t care. I\u2019d like to note at this point her family members were still using my parking spot. \n\nToday she approaches me and informs me that she will start building her driveway taking up half of my property. I\u2019d like to note that I don\u2019t own the house, I just rent it. The council owns the house. She tells me that the council has given her permission to take up half of my front garden to build her driveway, lol ok. I again informed her that I don\u2019t consent and that she cannot go ahead with her building plan. \n\nThis kind of entitlement has enraged me so I called up my brother who had a car and told him to come and park in my parking spot, he did. As soon as my brother parked his car, my neighbor the husband came out yelling at my brother telling him to move his car that was when I told him that he and his family members could no longer park on my spot. \n\nThe whole driveway issues confuses me and I will be calling the council later today to try and stop this crazy woman taking half of my garden!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person in the AITA (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong. The situation involves a neighbor trying to park in their spot and now building a driveway on their property.\n\nFirst, the author lived in the house for 18 years, rented from the council. The neighbor moved in 3-4 years ago. Initially, the author let them park because they had no car. Now, the author has a car and their brother parked there. The neighbor's family used the spot for years, but after the author refused a request to take part of the garden for a porch, the neighbor is now trying to build a driveway on the author's garden without permission.\n\nKey points here: The author owns the house? No, they rent it from the council. The garden is part of the rented property, so the author's landlord (council) owns it. The neighbor claims the council gave permission to take half the garden for her driveway. The author says they didn't consent, so they took action by parking their brother's car there to prevent it.\n\nNow, the question is: Is the author in the wrong?\n\nWell, the author allowed the neighbor to park for years when they had no car. Now that they have a car and a brother's car, they're asserting their space. The neighbor's request for the garden was denied, and now the neighbor is trying to build a driveway. The author is trying to stop it by using their own car to block the space.\n\nBut here's the issue: the author does not own the house or the garden. The council does. So any changes to the garden, like building a driveway, would require the council's permission. If the neighbor got permission from the council, the author's refusal might not matter. However, the author is a tenant, so they can't just allow someone else to take part of their rented property. But since the council owns it, the author's ability to consent is moot. The correct action would be to contact the council to resolve it.\n\nThe author took matters into their own hands by having their brother park there, which could be seen as aggressive. Even if the author is in the right in wanting to use their spot, using a personal car to block it might not be the best approach, especially if the council's permission is already given. The author should have gone through the proper channels (like talking to the council) instead of confronting the neighbor directly, which could lead to conflict.\n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong for not addressing the issue through the council first and instead using their brother's car to block the parking spot, especially if the council had already granted the neighbor's request. The neighbor's entitlement is questionable if the council approved the driveway, but the author's method of handling it (aggressive confrontation) could be seen as wrong.\n"
