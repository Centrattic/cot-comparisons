I have lived inside this house for the past 18 years, they moved in about 3/4 years ago. At first I had no issues letting them park in my parking spot because I had no car. I\u2019m not an asshole so I let them park their car there for years free of charge. \n\nA few months ago I had the wife approach me and ask me if she could take half of my front garden to build herself a porch, I said no. I live in the UK so we don\u2019t have porch where you can just park your car, it\u2019s all street parking. \n\nAfter I turned down her request she has stopped greeting me whenever she says me, fine I don\u2019t care. I\u2019d like to note at this point her family members were still using my parking spot. \n\nToday she approaches me and informs me that she will start building her driveway taking up half of my property. I\u2019d like to note that I don\u2019t own the house, I just rent it. The council owns the house. She tells me that the council has given her permission to take up half of my front garden to build her driveway, lol ok. I again informed her that I don\u2019t consent and that she cannot go ahead with her building plan. \n\nThis kind of entitlement has enraged me so I called up my brother who had a car and told him to come and park in my parking spot, he did. As soon as my brother parked his car, my neighbor the husband came out yelling at my brother telling him to move his car that was when I told him that he and his family members could no longer park on my spot. \n\nThe whole driveway issues confuses me and I will be calling the council later today to try and stop this crazy woman taking half of my garden!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation is about parking spots and a neighbor trying to take over part of their garden.\n\nFirst, the author has been letting the neighbor park in their spot for years when they didn't have a car. Now, the neighbor wants to build a driveway on part of the author's garden. The author says no, and then when the neighbor tries to proceed, the author has their brother park there to block them.\n\nIn the UK, council-owned properties: does that mean the garden is part of the property? If the author rents, they probably don't own the garden. But the neighbor can't just take someone else's property, right? Even if it's council-owned, the garden is part of the rental agreement. The neighbor would need permission from the council, not the tenant. The author has the right to object if the council is making changes to their property without the tenant's consent.\n\nAlso, the author was being nice before by letting the neighbor park. Now that they have a car, they can't be forced to let others park there. The neighbor's entitlement to take half the garden without consent is wrong. The author stopping their family from parking in the spot is a reaction to the neighbor's actions. But maybe the author could handle it more politely, but not necessarily wrong. The main issue is the neighbor's actions without proper permission. So the author isn't in the wrong here. Answer B.\n"
