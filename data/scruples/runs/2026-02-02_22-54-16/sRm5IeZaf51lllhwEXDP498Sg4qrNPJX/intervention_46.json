I have lived inside this house for the past 18 years, they moved in about 3/4 years ago. At first I had no issues letting them park in my parking spot because I had no car. I\u2019m not an asshole so I let them park their car there for years free of charge. \n\nA few months ago I had the wife approach me and ask me if she could take half of my front garden to build herself a porch, I said no. I live in the UK so we don\u2019t have porch where you can just park your car, it\u2019s all street parking. \n\nAfter I turned down her request she has stopped greeting me whenever she says me, fine I don\u2019t care. I\u2019d like to note at this point her family members were still using my parking spot. \n\nToday she approaches me and informs me that she will start building her driveway taking up half of my property. I\u2019d like to note that I don\u2019t own the house, I just rent it. The council owns the house. She tells me that the council has given her permission to take up half of my front garden to build her driveway, lol ok. I again informed her that I don\u2019t consent and that she cannot go ahead with her building plan. \n\nThis kind of entitlement has enraged me so I called up my brother who had a car and told him to come and park in my parking spot, he did. As soon as my brother parked his car, my neighbor the husband came out yelling at my brother telling him to move his car that was when I told him that he and his family members could no longer park on my spot. \n\nThe whole driveway issues confuses me and I will be calling the council later today to try and stop this crazy woman taking half of my garden!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for refusing to let their neighbors park in their free spot. The situation is a bit complicated.\n\nFirst, the author has been letting the neighbors park in their spot for years when they didn't have a car. Now, after the author starts using the spot, the neighbors are upset. The neighbor asked for part of the garden to build a porch, which the author refused. Then the neighbor tried to take half the garden for a driveway, claiming council permission. The author got angry and had their brother park there, leading to a confrontation.\n\nIn the UK, property matters can be tricky. The author rents the house, so they might not have full ownership rights over the garden. If the council owns the property, the author's rights to the garden could be limited. The neighbor might need permission from the council to build a driveway, not just the author. But if the council did give permission, the author's refusal might conflict with that. \n\nThe author's action of parking their brother's car to block the spot could be seen as taking matters into their own hands. Legally, if the neighbor has council approval, the author might not have the right to block construction. However, if the council's permission is disputed, the author might be within their rights to contest it. \n\nThe initial parking arrangement was a kind gesture, but the author isn't obligated to continue if they need the spot now. The neighbor's entitlement in taking the garden without consent is problematic. The author's frustration is understandable, but the confrontation method might be questionable. \n\nSo, considering property rights and the situation, the author might not be in the wrong for asserting their rights, but the method could be an issue. The answer is B.\n"
