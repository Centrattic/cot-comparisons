I have lived inside this house for the past 18 years, they moved in about 3/4 years ago. At first I had no issues letting them park in my parking spot because I had no car. I\u2019m not an asshole so I let them park their car there for years free of charge. \n\nA few months ago I had the wife approach me and ask me if she could take half of my front garden to build herself a porch, I said no. I live in the UK so we don\u2019t have porch where you can just park your car, it\u2019s all street parking. \n\nAfter I turned down her request she has stopped greeting me whenever she says me, fine I don\u2019t care. I\u2019d like to note at this point her family members were still using my parking spot. \n\nToday she approaches me and informs me that she will start building her driveway taking up half of my property. I\u2019d like to note that I don\u2019t own the house, I just rent it. The council owns the house. She tells me that the council has given her permission to take up half of my front garden to build her driveway, lol ok. I again informed her that I don\u2019t consent and that she cannot go ahead with her building plan. \n\nThis kind of entitlement has enraged me so I called up my brother who had a car and told him to come and park in my parking spot, he did. As soon as my brother parked his car, my neighbor the husband came out yelling at my brother telling him to move his car that was when I told him that he and his family members could no longer park on my spot. \n\nThe whole driveway issues confuses me and I will be calling the council later today to try and stop this crazy woman taking half of my garden!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about parking and property disputes. The user is in the UK, which might affect the legal context.\n\nFirst, the author has been letting the neighbors park in their space for years because they didn't have a car. Now that they do have a car, they're refusing the neighbors parking. But the neighbors are also trying to take half of the author's garden for a driveway, which the author didn't consent to. The author then tells their brother to park there, causing the neighbor to confront them.\n\nI need to consider property rights. Since the author is a tenant, the council owns the house. The front garden might be part of the property, so the council's permission would be required for any alterations. The author says the neighbor claims the council allowed them to take the garden, but the author hasn't consented. So, the neighbor building without permission could be an issue.\n\nThe author's action of having someone park there is a form of asserting ownership. But if the parking spot is actually part of the public space or belongs to the council, the author might not have the right to restrict it. However, if the spot is part of the tenant's property (like a private driveway), then maybe the author can set boundaries. The UK's parking laws might be different. For example, in some areas, you can't claim private parking unless it's clearly marked or legally assigned.\n\nAlso, the neighbor's entitlement to take part of the garden could be a separate legal matter. The author should contact the council to resolve that. The act of parking the brother's car might be seen as a defensive measure but could be considered confrontational. However, the author is trying to protect their own rights.\n\nSo, whether the author is in the wrong depends on the property ownership and local regulations. If the parking spot isn't legally the author's to restrict, then they might be wrong. But if the spot is part of their rented property, then they have a right to control it. The council's role here is crucial. The answer would hinge on whether the author had the legal right to prevent parking there. If the spot is private, then B (not in the wrong). If not, A. Given that the author was using it as their own, and the neighbor's actions are aggressive, maybe the author is protecting their rights. So likely answer is B.\n"
