I have lived inside this house for the past 18 years, they moved in about 3/4 years ago. At first I had no issues letting them park in my parking spot because I had no car. I\u2019m not an asshole so I let them park their car there for years free of charge. \n\nA few months ago I had the wife approach me and ask me if she could take half of my front garden to build herself a porch, I said no. I live in the UK so we don\u2019t have porch where you can just park your car, it\u2019s all street parking. \n\nAfter I turned down her request she has stopped greeting me whenever she says me, fine I don\u2019t care. I\u2019d like to note at this point her family members were still using my parking spot. \n\nToday she approaches me and informs me that she will start building her driveway taking up half of my property. I\u2019d like to note that I don\u2019t own the house, I just rent it. The council owns the house. She tells me that the council has given her permission to take up half of my front garden to build her driveway, lol ok. I again informed her that I don\u2019t consent and that she cannot go ahead with her building plan. \n\nThis kind of entitlement has enraged me so I called up my brother who had a car and told him to come and park in my parking spot, he did. As soon as my brother parked his car, my neighbor the husband came out yelling at my brother telling him to move his car that was when I told him that he and his family members could no longer park on my spot. \n\nThe whole driveway issues confuses me and I will be calling the council later today to try and stop this crazy woman taking half of my garden!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation again to make sure I understand.\n\nThe author has been letting their neighbor park in their parking spot for years. The neighbor has four cars, and the author didn't have a car, so they were okay with it. Now, the neighbor's wife approached them first about taking half the front garden to build a porch, which the author refused. Then the neighbor tried to build a driveway on the author's property, claiming council permission, but the author doesn't own the house\u2014so does the council own the land? The author then told their brother to park there, leading to conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out ownership. Since the author rents the house and the council owns it, does that mean the front garden is the council's property as well? If the neighbor is trying to build on the author's property, but the author doesn't own it, the council's permission might be relevant. However, the author hasn't consented, and if the council gave permission, maybe the neighbor is within their rights. But the author's brother parking there might be an issue if the space is council property.\n\nAlso, the neighbor's family parking there for years\u2014was the author allowed to let them park there? If the land is council-owned, maybe the author had no right to let them park there in the first place. So when the author told their brother to park there, maybe that's interfering with council property. The neighbor might have a valid claim if the council approved the driveway, but the author is now blocking them by parking there. \n\nThe author's actions could be seen as causing a dispute by using their brother to block the spot. Even if the author feels wronged, using a friend to park there might be escalatory. Also, the council's permission might mean the neighbor can proceed, so the author's refusal doesn't matter. But the author is a tenant, so they might not have the authority to object if the council approved it.\n\nSo, considering all that, maybe the author is in the wrong because they used a friend to park there to prevent the neighbor from using the space, which might be on council property, and the neighbor has council permission. The author didn't own the property, so maybe they had no right to let others park there, and now they're blocking the neighbor's lawful use. Therefore, the answer might be A (author is in the wrong).\n"
