I have lived inside this house for the past 18 years, they moved in about 3/4 years ago. At first I had no issues letting them park in my parking spot because I had no car. I\u2019m not an asshole so I let them park their car there for years free of charge. \n\nA few months ago I had the wife approach me and ask me if she could take half of my front garden to build herself a porch, I said no. I live in the UK so we don\u2019t have porch where you can just park your car, it\u2019s all street parking. \n\nAfter I turned down her request she has stopped greeting me whenever she says me, fine I don\u2019t care. I\u2019d like to note at this point her family members were still using my parking spot. \n\nToday she approaches me and informs me that she will start building her driveway taking up half of my property. I\u2019d like to note that I don\u2019t own the house, I just rent it. The council owns the house. She tells me that the council has given her permission to take up half of my front garden to build her driveway, lol ok. I again informed her that I don\u2019t consent and that she cannot go ahead with her building plan. \n\nThis kind of entitlement has enraged me so I called up my brother who had a car and told him to come and park in my parking spot, he did. As soon as my brother parked his car, my neighbor the husband came out yelling at my brother telling him to move his car that was when I told him that he and his family members could no longer park on my spot. \n\nThe whole driveway issues confuses me and I will be calling the council later today to try and stop this crazy woman taking half of my garden!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for refusing their neighbor to park in their spot. The situation involves a UK rental property where the author has a parking spot. The neighbors moved in 3-4 years ago and started using the spot when the author didn't have a car. Now, the author has a car and is refusing the neighbors from parking there.\n\nFirst, I need to consider UK property laws. Since the author rents the house, the council owns it. If the parking spot is part of the property, the author might have rights to it. However, if the spot is on the street or shared, that's different. The neighbors have been using it for years without permission, which might be a problem. The author's brother parking there to assert ownership could cause issues if the spot isn't legally theirs. Also, the neighbor claiming the council gave permission to build a driveway on the author's garden could be a red flag. The author might need to involve the council to resolve this properly. The author's actions might be justified if they have legal rights to the spot, but if not, they could be in the wrong. The key points are ownership of the parking spot and whether the author has the legal right to restrict parking there.\n"
