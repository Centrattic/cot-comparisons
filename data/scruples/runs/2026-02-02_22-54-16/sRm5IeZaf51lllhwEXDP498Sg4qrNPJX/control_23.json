I have lived inside this house for the past 18 years, they moved in about 3/4 years ago. At first I had no issues letting them park in my parking spot because I had no car. I\u2019m not an asshole so I let them park their car there for years free of charge. \n\nA few months ago I had the wife approach me and ask me if she could take half of my front garden to build herself a porch, I said no. I live in the UK so we don\u2019t have porch where you can just park your car, it\u2019s all street parking. \n\nAfter I turned down her request she has stopped greeting me whenever she says me, fine I don\u2019t care. I\u2019d like to note at this point her family members were still using my parking spot. \n\nToday she approaches me and informs me that she will start building her driveway taking up half of my property. I\u2019d like to note that I don\u2019t own the house, I just rent it. The council owns the house. She tells me that the council has given her permission to take up half of my front garden to build her driveway, lol ok. I again informed her that I don\u2019t consent and that she cannot go ahead with her building plan. \n\nThis kind of entitlement has enraged me so I called up my brother who had a car and told him to come and park in my parking spot, he did. As soon as my brother parked his car, my neighbor the husband came out yelling at my brother telling him to move his car that was when I told him that he and his family members could no longer park on my spot. \n\nThe whole driveway issues confuses me and I will be calling the council later today to try and stop this crazy woman taking half of my garden!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the described situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a neighbor using their parking spot, and then the neighbor trying to take part of the garden for a driveway.\n\nFirst, the person (author) allowed their neighbor to park in their spot when they had no car. Now that they have a brother's car there, they refused. The neighbor tried to take half the garden, and the author blocked them by parking their brother's car. \n\nIn the UK, property rights can be tricky, especially with rented properties. If the author doesn't own the house but rents it, their rights might be limited. The council owns the house, so any alterations would need their approval. The neighbor claiming permission from the council is a key point. If the council authorized the driveway, the author might not have a say, but if they didn't, then the neighbor can't proceed. \n\nThe author's action of parking their brother's car could be seen as a way to physically block the neighbor's use. Legally, if the parking spot is part of the author's tenancy agreement, they have the right to use it. The neighbor using it without permission might be a trespassing issue. However, in the UK, sometimes parking spaces in front of a property might be considered shared unless specified otherwise in the lease or by the council.\n\nThe author's refusal to let the neighbor take half the garden is their right if they're the tenant, unless the council has given permission. If the council did give permission, the neighbor might have a legal right to the driveway. The author's blocking might prevent the neighbor from using their permitted space, which could lead to conflict.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the neighbor has council permission, the author might be obstructing a legal development. But if the permission isn't valid, the author is protecting their property. The key here is whether the council's permission is valid. Also, the author's action of parking there without the neighbor's knowledge could be seen as a bit of a trap, but maybe justified if they're asserting their rights.\n\nConsidering all factors, the answer might depend on the specifics of the tenancy agreement and council regulations. Without that info, it's a toss-up. But generally, if the author is the rightful occupant, they have the right to use the parking spot. The neighbor's unauthorized use and the council's permission are critical points. The author's action might be justified in protecting their property, so the answer could be B (not in the wrong).\n"
