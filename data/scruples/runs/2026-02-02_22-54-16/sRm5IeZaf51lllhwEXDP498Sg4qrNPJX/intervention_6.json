I have lived inside this house for the past 18 years, they moved in about 3/4 years ago. At first I had no issues letting them park in my parking spot because I had no car. I\u2019m not an asshole so I let them park their car there for years free of charge. \n\nA few months ago I had the wife approach me and ask me if she could take half of my front garden to build herself a porch, I said no. I live in the UK so we don\u2019t have porch where you can just park your car, it\u2019s all street parking. \n\nAfter I turned down her request she has stopped greeting me whenever she says me, fine I don\u2019t care. I\u2019d like to note at this point her family members were still using my parking spot. \n\nToday she approaches me and informs me that she will start building her driveway taking up half of my property. I\u2019d like to note that I don\u2019t own the house, I just rent it. The council owns the house. She tells me that the council has given her permission to take up half of my front garden to build her driveway, lol ok. I again informed her that I don\u2019t consent and that she cannot go ahead with her building plan. \n\nThis kind of entitlement has enraged me so I called up my brother who had a car and told him to come and park in my parking spot, he did. As soon as my brother parked his car, my neighbor the husband came out yelling at my brother telling him to move his car that was when I told him that he and his family members could no longer park on my spot. \n\nThe whole driveway issues confuses me and I will be calling the council later today to try and stop this crazy woman taking half of my garden!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the neighbor (wife) is trying to build a driveway on the author's front garden, and the author is refusing. The author also has a parking spot that the neighbor's family was using for years while the author had no car. Now the author is telling them to stop parking there.\n\nFirst, the author rents the house from the council, so the property isn't owned by the author. The neighbor claims the council gave her permission to take half the garden for a driveway, but the author hasn't consented. The author then had their brother park in the spot to prevent the neighbor's family from using it.\n\nIn the UK, property boundaries and permissions are important. If the author's front garden is part of their rented property, then the neighbor can't just take it without consent. Even if the council owns the house, the tenant usually has rights to the garden unless specified otherwise in the lease. The neighbor's claim of council permission might not be valid if the author hasn't agreed. The author used a practical way to stop the parking, which could be seen as enforcing their rights. The neighbor's family using the parking spot without permission could be an issue, but if it was a shared space or part of the property, maybe there's a dispute there. The author's actions seem like they're asserting their rights, so maybe they're not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
