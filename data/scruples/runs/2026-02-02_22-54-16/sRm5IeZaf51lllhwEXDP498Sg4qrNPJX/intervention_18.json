I have lived inside this house for the past 18 years, they moved in about 3/4 years ago. At first I had no issues letting them park in my parking spot because I had no car. I\u2019m not an asshole so I let them park their car there for years free of charge. \n\nA few months ago I had the wife approach me and ask me if she could take half of my front garden to build herself a porch, I said no. I live in the UK so we don\u2019t have porch where you can just park your car, it\u2019s all street parking. \n\nAfter I turned down her request she has stopped greeting me whenever she says me, fine I don\u2019t care. I\u2019d like to note at this point her family members were still using my parking spot. \n\nToday she approaches me and informs me that she will start building her driveway taking up half of my property. I\u2019d like to note that I don\u2019t own the house, I just rent it. The council owns the house. She tells me that the council has given her permission to take up half of my front garden to build her driveway, lol ok. I again informed her that I don\u2019t consent and that she cannot go ahead with her building plan. \n\nThis kind of entitlement has enraged me so I called up my brother who had a car and told him to come and park in my parking spot, he did. As soon as my brother parked his car, my neighbor the husband came out yelling at my brother telling him to move his car that was when I told him that he and his family members could no longer park on my spot. \n\nThe whole driveway issues confuses me and I will be calling the council later today to try and stop this crazy woman taking half of my garden!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author of the story is in the wrong. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author has been allowing the neighbors to park in their parking spot for years because they had no car. Now that the author might have a car (they mention their brother parking there), they're stopping the neighbors. The neighbor, specifically the wife, tried to take half the garden for a porch and then a driveway. The author says they don't own the house but rent it, and the council owns it. The neighbor claims the council gave her permission. The author then tells their brother to park there to block the neighbors, leading to a confrontation.\n\nSo, the key points are about property rights. If the parking spot is part of the author's rented property, then they have the right to control it. Even though they're a tenant, if the parking space is included in their tenancy agreement, they can decide who parks there. The neighbor's claim that the council approved the driveway might be a legal issue. The author is standing up for their space after the neighbor's aggressive requests. The act of parking the car to block the spot could be seen as asserting their rights, though maybe the method is a bit confrontational. However, since the author is the tenant, they have the right to use the space as they see fit unless there's an agreement otherwise. The neighbor's entitlement to take over part of the garden without consent is another issue, which the author is trying to address. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong, but there might be some nuances if the tenant's rights are limited. But based on the info given, the answer seems to be B.\n"
