I have lived inside this house for the past 18 years, they moved in about 3/4 years ago. At first I had no issues letting them park in my parking spot because I had no car. I\u2019m not an asshole so I let them park their car there for years free of charge. \n\nA few months ago I had the wife approach me and ask me if she could take half of my front garden to build herself a porch, I said no. I live in the UK so we don\u2019t have porch where you can just park your car, it\u2019s all street parking. \n\nAfter I turned down her request she has stopped greeting me whenever she says me, fine I don\u2019t care. I\u2019d like to note at this point her family members were still using my parking spot. \n\nToday she approaches me and informs me that she will start building her driveway taking up half of my property. I\u2019d like to note that I don\u2019t own the house, I just rent it. The council owns the house. She tells me that the council has given her permission to take up half of my front garden to build her driveway, lol ok. I again informed her that I don\u2019t consent and that she cannot go ahead with her building plan. \n\nThis kind of entitlement has enraged me so I called up my brother who had a car and told him to come and park in my parking spot, he did. As soon as my brother parked his car, my neighbor the husband came out yelling at my brother telling him to move his car that was when I told him that he and his family members could no longer park on my spot. \n\nThe whole driveway issues confuses me and I will be calling the council later today to try and stop this crazy woman taking half of my garden!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person in this situation is in the wrong. Let's start by breaking down the story.\n\nThe author has been living in their house for 18 years and allowed their neighbors to park in their parking spot for years because they didn't have a car. Now, the neighbor's wife asked to take half of the front garden to build a porch, which the author refused. The neighbor stopped greeting them, but the family kept using the parking spot. Then the wife claims the council (which owns the house) gave her permission to take half the garden for a driveway. The author tells her they don't consent, and then when the neighbor's husband yells at the author's brother for parking there, the author revokes their parking access. The author is planning to call the council to stop the driveway.\n\nFirst, let's consider the legal aspects. In the UK, if the house is rented from the council, the garden is likely part of the property the tenant has a right to use. The council's permission would matter here. But the author mentions that the neighbor says the council has given permission to take half the garden. If that's true, the author might not have the legal right to object. However, the author is now disputing that and is going to call the council, implying they might think the permission is invalid or not properly communicated.\n\nThen there's the parking spot. The author allowed the neighbors to park there for years when they had no car. Now that the author's brother has a car, they're parking there. The neighbor used the spot out of habit, but the author is now stopping them. But if the parking spot is part of the property the council owns, the author might not have the right to dictate who parks there, especially if there's no formal agreement. However, the author might have an implied agreement based on the neighbors using it for years. The UK has some rules about implied permission or adverse possession, but since it's a council property, the council's rules would take precedence.\n\nThe author's actions of revoking parking and calling the council could be justified if the neighbor's use was unauthorized. But if the council allowed the driveway, that might change things. The author might be overstepping by taking matters into their own hands, like having their brother park there to assert control, which could be seen as a bit of a provocation. The neighbor's husband yelling at the brother might be an overreaction, but the author's response to stop allowing parking could be their way of asserting boundaries. However, the author should probably handle it through the proper channels (council) rather than personal enforcement, which might make them in the wrong in terms of how they handled the dispute.\n\nAlso, the neighbor's request to modify the garden for a driveway is a separate issue. The author's refusal to let them park might be related to the garden dispute, but the key is whether the author has the legal right to control that parking spot. If the garden is part of the council-owned property, the author might not own the right to the parking spot, so allowing or denying parking is up to the council, not the tenant. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong if they are not the legal owner. The neighbor claiming council permission could be valid, but the author's response to use the spot by parking their brother's car could be seen as a way to assert control, which might not be the correct approach.\n\nSo, the main points are about legal ownership of the property and proper procedures for disputes. The author might not have the authority to deny parking if the spot is part of the shared or council-owned area. The neighbor's actions might be legitimate if the council approved the driveway, but the author's method of enforcing their refusal (using their brother) could be problematic. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for assuming control without proper legal standing and for using a confrontational approach.\n"
