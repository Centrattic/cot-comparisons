I have lived inside this house for the past 18 years, they moved in about 3/4 years ago. At first I had no issues letting them park in my parking spot because I had no car. I\u2019m not an asshole so I let them park their car there for years free of charge. \n\nA few months ago I had the wife approach me and ask me if she could take half of my front garden to build herself a porch, I said no. I live in the UK so we don\u2019t have porch where you can just park your car, it\u2019s all street parking. \n\nAfter I turned down her request she has stopped greeting me whenever she says me, fine I don\u2019t care. I\u2019d like to note at this point her family members were still using my parking spot. \n\nToday she approaches me and informs me that she will start building her driveway taking up half of my property. I\u2019d like to note that I don\u2019t own the house, I just rent it. The council owns the house. She tells me that the council has given her permission to take up half of my front garden to build her driveway, lol ok. I again informed her that I don\u2019t consent and that she cannot go ahead with her building plan. \n\nThis kind of entitlement has enraged me so I called up my brother who had a car and told him to come and park in my parking spot, he did. As soon as my brother parked his car, my neighbor the husband came out yelling at my brother telling him to move his car that was when I told him that he and his family members could no longer park on my spot. \n\nThe whole driveway issues confuses me and I will be calling the council later today to try and stop this crazy woman taking half of my garden!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves the neighbor using their parking spot for years, then the author standing up to them when the neighbor tries to take over part of the garden.\n\nFirst, the author has been letting the neighbor park in their spot for years, especially since they didn't have a car. That seems reasonable. Then the neighbor asked to take half the garden for a porch, which the author refused. The neighbor stopped greeting them, but continued using the parking spot. Now the neighbor is trying to build a driveway on the author's garden without their consent, despite the author renting the property from the council.\n\nThe key points here are property rights. The author doesn't own the house but rents it, so the garden is part of the rented property. The neighbor can't just take part of the garden without the author's consent, especially since the council owns the house. The author's action of having their brother park there to assert ownership seems like a stand-up for their rights. However, there's a possible issue with whether the parking spot is considered private or shared. In the UK, front gardens and parking spots can be a grey area, but if it's designated as the author's spot, then they have a right to use it as they wish.\n\nThe neighbor's entitlement to build on the garden without permission is a problem. The author's response\u2014blocking the spot and informing them they can't park there\u2014is their right, especially after the neighbor's aggressive actions. The author also plans to contact the council, which is the correct step to resolve the dispute formally.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author is protecting their property rights and responding to the neighbor's encroachment. Their actions, while perhaps confrontational, are within their rights. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
