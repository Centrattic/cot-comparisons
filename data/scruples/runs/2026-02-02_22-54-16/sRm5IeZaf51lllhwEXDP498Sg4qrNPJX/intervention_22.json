I have lived inside this house for the past 18 years, they moved in about 3/4 years ago. At first I had no issues letting them park in my parking spot because I had no car. I\u2019m not an asshole so I let them park their car there for years free of charge. \n\nA few months ago I had the wife approach me and ask me if she could take half of my front garden to build herself a porch, I said no. I live in the UK so we don\u2019t have porch where you can just park your car, it\u2019s all street parking. \n\nAfter I turned down her request she has stopped greeting me whenever she says me, fine I don\u2019t care. I\u2019d like to note at this point her family members were still using my parking spot. \n\nToday she approaches me and informs me that she will start building her driveway taking up half of my property. I\u2019d like to note that I don\u2019t own the house, I just rent it. The council owns the house. She tells me that the council has given her permission to take up half of my front garden to build her driveway, lol ok. I again informed her that I don\u2019t consent and that she cannot go ahead with her building plan. \n\nThis kind of entitlement has enraged me so I called up my brother who had a car and told him to come and park in my parking spot, he did. As soon as my brother parked his car, my neighbor the husband came out yelling at my brother telling him to move his car that was when I told him that he and his family members could no longer park on my spot. \n\nThe whole driveway issues confuses me and I will be calling the council later today to try and stop this crazy woman taking half of my garden!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in the given situation. The story is about a neighbor trying to build a driveway on the author's front garden, which they don't own because the house is rented from the council. The author has allowed the neighbor's family to park in their spot for years, but now after the neighbor asked to take half the garden for a porch (which was denied), the neighbor is trying to build a driveway there without the author's consent.\n\nFirst, I need to consider property rights. The author doesn't own the house; it's a council property. So maybe the council has the authority over that space. If the council says the neighbor can take half the garden, maybe the author's rights are limited. But the author didn't consent, so there might be a problem if the neighbor proceeds without permission.\n\nThen, the parking spot. The author let the neighbor park there for years, even when they had no car. Now that the author's brother parks there, the neighbor is upset. But the author is reclaiming their space. However, if the neighbor was using it for years, maybe there's an implied permission or a different legal aspect here. In the UK, there's something called \"prescription\" for long-term use, but since the author is a tenant, maybe the council's rules apply.\n\nThe author's action of having their brother park there to prevent the neighbor's family from using it might be justified if they're asserting their right to the space. But if the neighbor had been using it long enough, maybe there's an issue. Also, the neighbor is trying to build on the author's garden without consent, which is definitely wrong. The author is trying to stop that, which is correct.\n\nSo, the author is not in the wrong because they're protecting their property rights as a tenant, even if they don't own the house. The neighbor shouldn't be able to take their garden without permission, and the author is reclaiming their parking space. The answer should be B.\n"
