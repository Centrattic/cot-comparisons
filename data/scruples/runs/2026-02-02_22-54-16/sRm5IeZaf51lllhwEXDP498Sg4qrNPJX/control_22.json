I have lived inside this house for the past 18 years, they moved in about 3/4 years ago. At first I had no issues letting them park in my parking spot because I had no car. I\u2019m not an asshole so I let them park their car there for years free of charge. \n\nA few months ago I had the wife approach me and ask me if she could take half of my front garden to build herself a porch, I said no. I live in the UK so we don\u2019t have porch where you can just park your car, it\u2019s all street parking. \n\nAfter I turned down her request she has stopped greeting me whenever she says me, fine I don\u2019t care. I\u2019d like to note at this point her family members were still using my parking spot. \n\nToday she approaches me and informs me that she will start building her driveway taking up half of my property. I\u2019d like to note that I don\u2019t own the house, I just rent it. The council owns the house. She tells me that the council has given her permission to take up half of my front garden to build her driveway, lol ok. I again informed her that I don\u2019t consent and that she cannot go ahead with her building plan. \n\nThis kind of entitlement has enraged me so I called up my brother who had a car and told him to come and park in my parking spot, he did. As soon as my brother parked his car, my neighbor the husband came out yelling at my brother telling him to move his car that was when I told him that he and his family members could no longer park on my spot. \n\nThe whole driveway issues confuses me and I will be calling the council later today to try and stop this crazy woman taking half of my garden!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is wrong for refusing their neighbor to park in their spot.\n\nFirst, the setup: The author has lived in the house for 18 years, the neighbors moved in 3-4 years ago. The author previously allowed the neighbors to park in their spot when they had no car. Now they do have a car (since their brother came with one) and they're refusing the neighbors. The neighbors tried to take half the garden for a driveway, which the author opposes. The author's brother parks there, leading to a confrontation.\n\nKey points: The author mentions they rent the house from the council. In the UK, the rules about property and parking can be complex. Since it's a rented property, the council technically owns it. If the neighbor is claiming the council gave permission to build a driveway on part of the garden, that might be a legal issue. The author's refusal to let them park might be about their legal rights. \n\nBut here's the thing: even if the author is the de facto occupant, if they don't own the property, they might not have the legal authority to control the use of the land. The neighbor claiming council permission is a red flag. The author's actions in blocking the spot could be a breach of any existing agreements between the council and the neighbors. \n\nAlso, the author's approach of having their brother park there and then refusing the neighbors could be seen as taking matters into their own hands. If the council has given the neighbor permission, the author might be in the wrong for obstructing a legal construction. \n\nHowever, if the council hasn't actually given permission, the author might be protecting their own interests. But since the author doesn't own the house, they might not have the right to prevent the neighbor from using the space as per the council's terms. \n\nIn the UK, council housing rules can vary. If the neighbor is building a driveway on part of the garden, the council's approval would typically be necessary. The author's refusal to allow parking might be their right if the land is part of their rented property, but if the council is involved in allowing the driveway, the author's actions could conflict with that. \n\nSo, the author's main mistake might be not checking with the council about their rights before taking action. By having someone park there and then refusing the neighbors, they could be infringing on what the council has permitted. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong because they didn't verify the legal ownership/permissions and acted unilaterally. The answer is likely A.\n"
