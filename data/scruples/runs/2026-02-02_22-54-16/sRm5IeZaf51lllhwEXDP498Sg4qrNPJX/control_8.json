I have lived inside this house for the past 18 years, they moved in about 3/4 years ago. At first I had no issues letting them park in my parking spot because I had no car. I\u2019m not an asshole so I let them park their car there for years free of charge. \n\nA few months ago I had the wife approach me and ask me if she could take half of my front garden to build herself a porch, I said no. I live in the UK so we don\u2019t have porch where you can just park your car, it\u2019s all street parking. \n\nAfter I turned down her request she has stopped greeting me whenever she says me, fine I don\u2019t care. I\u2019d like to note at this point her family members were still using my parking spot. \n\nToday she approaches me and informs me that she will start building her driveway taking up half of my property. I\u2019d like to note that I don\u2019t own the house, I just rent it. The council owns the house. She tells me that the council has given her permission to take up half of my front garden to build her driveway, lol ok. I again informed her that I don\u2019t consent and that she cannot go ahead with her building plan. \n\nThis kind of entitlement has enraged me so I called up my brother who had a car and told him to come and park in my parking spot, he did. As soon as my brother parked his car, my neighbor the husband came out yelling at my brother telling him to move his car that was when I told him that he and his family members could no longer park on my spot. \n\nThe whole driveway issues confuses me and I will be calling the council later today to try and stop this crazy woman taking half of my garden!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for refusing their neighbors to park in their spot. Let me read through the details again to make sure I understand the situation.\n\nSo, the author has been living in the house for 18 years, and the neighbors moved in 3-4 years ago. Initially, the author let the neighbors park in their spot because they had no car. But now, the author has a car, maybe? Or perhaps the neighbor is trying to take over the space. The neighbor's family has four cars, which might mean they don't have enough parking themselves. \n\nThe author mentions that the neighbor asked to take over half the front garden to build a porch, which was denied. Then the neighbor tried to start building a driveway on the author's property without consent. The author is renting from the council, not owning the house. The neighbor claims the council gave permission, but the author doesn't agree. \n\nIn response, the author had their brother park the car there, which led to a confrontation. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, parking spot ownership: If the author has a designated parking spot that's part of their rented property, then they have the right to control who parks there. Even though they're renting, if the spot is assigned to them, they can refuse others. But if the parking spot is communal or not owned by them, maybe the situation is different. However, the author says it's their spot, so they might have the right. \n\nThen there's the neighbor's attempt to take half the garden. Since the author doesn't own the house, they should be the one to object, but the neighbor claims council permission. The author is correct to inform the council about this, as they can't just take someone else's garden without proper consent from the rightful owner (even if it's the council). \n\nThe author's action of parking their brother's car to prevent the neighbor from using the spot could be seen as taking matters into their own hands. However, if the spot is legally theirs, then it's their choice. But using a family member to park might be a bit confrontational. Still, the main issue is the unauthorized use of property. \n\nThe neighbor's family had been using the spot for years without permission, which the author allowed out of kindness. Now that the author wants to use it themselves, they have the right to refuse. The neighbor's entitlement in trying to take over the garden is problematic, and the author is within their rights to stop that by contacting the council. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. They're protecting their property and rights, even if the method of using a brother's car was a bit aggressive. The answer should be B, No.\n"
