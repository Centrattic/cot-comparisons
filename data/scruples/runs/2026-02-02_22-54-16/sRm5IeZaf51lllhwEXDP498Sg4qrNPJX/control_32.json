I have lived inside this house for the past 18 years, they moved in about 3/4 years ago. At first I had no issues letting them park in my parking spot because I had no car. I\u2019m not an asshole so I let them park their car there for years free of charge. \n\nA few months ago I had the wife approach me and ask me if she could take half of my front garden to build herself a porch, I said no. I live in the UK so we don\u2019t have porch where you can just park your car, it\u2019s all street parking. \n\nAfter I turned down her request she has stopped greeting me whenever she says me, fine I don\u2019t care. I\u2019d like to note at this point her family members were still using my parking spot. \n\nToday she approaches me and informs me that she will start building her driveway taking up half of my property. I\u2019d like to note that I don\u2019t own the house, I just rent it. The council owns the house. She tells me that the council has given her permission to take up half of my front garden to build her driveway, lol ok. I again informed her that I don\u2019t consent and that she cannot go ahead with her building plan. \n\nThis kind of entitlement has enraged me so I called up my brother who had a car and told him to come and park in my parking spot, he did. As soon as my brother parked his car, my neighbor the husband came out yelling at my brother telling him to move his car that was when I told him that he and his family members could no longer park on my spot. \n\nThe whole driveway issues confuses me and I will be calling the council later today to try and stop this crazy woman taking half of my garden!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for not letting their neighbor park in their parking spot.\n\nFirst, they've lived there 18 years, the neighbors moved in 3-4 years ago. The person allowed the neighbors to use their spot when they had no car. Now that they have a car, they're using their own spot. That makes sense. They aren't obligated to let others use their property just because they've allowed it before.\n\nThen the neighbor asked to take half the front garden for a porch, which was denied. The neighbor's family kept using the parking spot even after that. The neighbor then claimed the council approved taking half of the garden. The person refused, which is their right since they don't own the house and it's the council's property. \n\nWhen the neighbor tried to proceed, the person had their brother park there to block it. The neighbor's husband yelled at the brother. The person stopped allowing them to park after that. \n\nThe key points are that the person didn't own the house, so the council's approval might be a factor. But the person's action to reclaim their spot when they can was reasonable. The neighbor's entitlement and lack of consent from the council might make them the one at fault. So the answer leans towards B, the person isn't in the wrong.\n"
