I have lived inside this house for the past 18 years, they moved in about 3/4 years ago. At first I had no issues letting them park in my parking spot because I had no car. I\u2019m not an asshole so I let them park their car there for years free of charge. \n\nA few months ago I had the wife approach me and ask me if she could take half of my front garden to build herself a porch, I said no. I live in the UK so we don\u2019t have porch where you can just park your car, it\u2019s all street parking. \n\nAfter I turned down her request she has stopped greeting me whenever she says me, fine I don\u2019t care. I\u2019d like to note at this point her family members were still using my parking spot. \n\nToday she approaches me and informs me that she will start building her driveway taking up half of my property. I\u2019d like to note that I don\u2019t own the house, I just rent it. The council owns the house. She tells me that the council has given her permission to take up half of my front garden to build her driveway, lol ok. I again informed her that I don\u2019t consent and that she cannot go ahead with her building plan. \n\nThis kind of entitlement has enraged me so I called up my brother who had a car and told him to come and park in my parking spot, he did. As soon as my brother parked his car, my neighbor the husband came out yelling at my brother telling him to move his car that was when I told him that he and his family members could no longer park on my spot. \n\nThe whole driveway issues confuses me and I will be calling the council later today to try and stop this crazy woman taking half of my garden!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for refusing to let their neighbors park in their free spot. The situation involves a neighbor (the wife) trying to take half the front garden for a driveway, which the author refused. The author then had their brother park in the spot, leading to a confrontation.\n\nFirst, the author has been renting the house, so ownership isn't theirs. The council owns the house. The neighbor claims the council gave permission to build a driveway on half the author's garden. The author denies consent. The author had allowed the neighbors to park there for years when they didn't have a car, but now the brother parks there, leading to conflict.\n\nLegally, if the front garden is part of the rented property, the tenant (author) might have rights to it unless the landlord (council) allows others to use it. The neighbor's claim of council permission needs verification. If the council did approve, the author might have no standing to stop it. But if the council didn't, the neighbor can't just take it without consent. The author's action of parking their brother there could be seen as asserting ownership, but if the council's rules allow the neighbor to use the garden, the author might be overstepping.\n\nHowever, the neighbor's entitlement to take half the garden without consent could be problematic. The author's response, while confrontational, might be a reaction to protect their property. But since the author is a tenant, the council's policies matter. The author should probably contact the council to clarify their rights and the neighbor's claims. The initial refusal to let park might be justified if the garden isn't the neighbor's, but the author's method of enforcing it by parking their brother could be seen as aggressive. The neighbor's entitlement to the driveway without the author's consent is questionable legally, especially if the council didn't authorize it. So the author might not be in the wrong for protecting their property, but the approach could be better handled through proper channels.\n"
