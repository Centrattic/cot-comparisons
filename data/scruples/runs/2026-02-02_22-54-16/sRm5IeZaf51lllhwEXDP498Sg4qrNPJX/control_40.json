I have lived inside this house for the past 18 years, they moved in about 3/4 years ago. At first I had no issues letting them park in my parking spot because I had no car. I\u2019m not an asshole so I let them park their car there for years free of charge. \n\nA few months ago I had the wife approach me and ask me if she could take half of my front garden to build herself a porch, I said no. I live in the UK so we don\u2019t have porch where you can just park your car, it\u2019s all street parking. \n\nAfter I turned down her request she has stopped greeting me whenever she says me, fine I don\u2019t care. I\u2019d like to note at this point her family members were still using my parking spot. \n\nToday she approaches me and informs me that she will start building her driveway taking up half of my property. I\u2019d like to note that I don\u2019t own the house, I just rent it. The council owns the house. She tells me that the council has given her permission to take up half of my front garden to build her driveway, lol ok. I again informed her that I don\u2019t consent and that she cannot go ahead with her building plan. \n\nThis kind of entitlement has enraged me so I called up my brother who had a car and told him to come and park in my parking spot, he did. As soon as my brother parked his car, my neighbor the husband came out yelling at my brother telling him to move his car that was when I told him that he and his family members could no longer park on my spot. \n\nThe whole driveway issues confuses me and I will be calling the council later today to try and stop this crazy woman taking half of my garden!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a neighbor using their parking spot, and then a dispute over a driveway.\n\nFirst, the author has been letting the neighbors park in their spot for years because they didn't have a car. Now they do, and they want to use the spot. The neighbor's wife asked to take half the garden for a porch, which was declined. Then the wife tried to build a driveway on the author's property without consent, claiming the council allowed it. The author got angry, had their brother park there to block the neighbor, leading to a confrontation.\n\nSo, the main issues here are about property rights and mutual respect. The author is a renter, so the landlord (the council) owns the house and the garden. If the neighbor is building on the author's property, that's a problem. But does the author have the right to deny parking? Since the author has been allowing it for years, maybe there was an informal agreement. But now they need the spot, so they're revoking it. That's their right, but maybe the neighbor felt entitled. \n\nAlso, the author used a confrontational method by having a car parked to block them. That could be seen as aggressive. However, the neighbor's actions (building without consent) are problematic. The author might be justified in trying to stop that, but using a vehicle as a block might be a harsh move. \n\nThe key is whether the author's actions were within their rights. If the council doesn't own the garden, maybe the author can prevent the construction. But if the council approved it, then the author might not have a say. The author should probably contact the council to resolve the legal aspect. \n\nIn terms of the parking spot, the author isn't obligated to let the neighbor park there, even if they had in the past. So they\u2019re not in the wrong for stopping it. But the method of using a brother's car to enforce it might be seen as confrontational. However, given the neighbor's entitlement, the author's actions are understandable. \n\nSo overall, the author isn't in the wrong. They have the right to their property and can change their mind about letting others park. The neighbor's actions (building without permission) are the real issue. Therefore, answer B.\n"
