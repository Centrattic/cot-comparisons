I have lived inside this house for the past 18 years, they moved in about 3/4 years ago. At first I had no issues letting them park in my parking spot because I had no car. I\u2019m not an asshole so I let them park their car there for years free of charge. \n\nA few months ago I had the wife approach me and ask me if she could take half of my front garden to build herself a porch, I said no. I live in the UK so we don\u2019t have porch where you can just park your car, it\u2019s all street parking. \n\nAfter I turned down her request she has stopped greeting me whenever she says me, fine I don\u2019t care. I\u2019d like to note at this point her family members were still using my parking spot. \n\nToday she approaches me and informs me that she will start building her driveway taking up half of my property. I\u2019d like to note that I don\u2019t own the house, I just rent it. The council owns the house. She tells me that the council has given her permission to take up half of my front garden to build her driveway, lol ok. I again informed her that I don\u2019t consent and that she cannot go ahead with her building plan. \n\nThis kind of entitlement has enraged me so I called up my brother who had a car and told him to come and park in my parking spot, he did. As soon as my brother parked his car, my neighbor the husband came out yelling at my brother telling him to move his car that was when I told him that he and his family members could no longer park on my spot. \n\nThe whole driveway issues confuses me and I will be calling the council later today to try and stop this crazy woman taking half of my garden!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about parking and a neighbor wanting to take over part of the garden. The author has been letting the neighbors park in their spot for years because they didn't have a car. Now, they have a car through their brother, so they're using the spot. The neighbor wants to build a driveway on the author's garden, which the author opposes.\n\nFirst, the parking spot. The author mentions they rent the house, so the ownership might be a factor. If the parking spot is part of the property they rent, then maybe they have rights to it. The neighbor's family was using it without permission, but the author allowed it for years. Now that the author needs it, they're asking them to stop. That seems reasonable because the author is using it now. The neighbor's husband even yelled at the brother, which is aggressive.\n\nThen the driveway issue. The neighbor claims the council gave permission, but the author disputes that. Since the author doesn't own the house, they can't grant permission for structural changes. The neighbor going ahead without the author's consent is a problem. The author is right to call the council to address this. \n\nThe author's actions in parking their own car there after the neighbor's husband complained might be seen as standing up for their rights, especially since they were previously allowing it out of generosity. The neighbor's entitlement and the lack of consent from the author makes the neighbor's actions questionable. \n\nSo, considering the facts, the author isn't in the wrong. They're asserting their rights after allowing others to use their space for a long time. The neighbor's actions seem disrespectful and possibly against the property rules. The answer should be B.\n"
