I have lived inside this house for the past 18 years, they moved in about 3/4 years ago. At first I had no issues letting them park in my parking spot because I had no car. I\u2019m not an asshole so I let them park their car there for years free of charge. \n\nA few months ago I had the wife approach me and ask me if she could take half of my front garden to build herself a porch, I said no. I live in the UK so we don\u2019t have porch where you can just park your car, it\u2019s all street parking. \n\nAfter I turned down her request she has stopped greeting me whenever she says me, fine I don\u2019t care. I\u2019d like to note at this point her family members were still using my parking spot. \n\nToday she approaches me and informs me that she will start building her driveway taking up half of my property. I\u2019d like to note that I don\u2019t own the house, I just rent it. The council owns the house. She tells me that the council has given her permission to take up half of my front garden to build her driveway, lol ok. I again informed her that I don\u2019t consent and that she cannot go ahead with her building plan. \n\nThis kind of entitlement has enraged me so I called up my brother who had a car and told him to come and park in my parking spot, he did. As soon as my brother parked his car, my neighbor the husband came out yelling at my brother telling him to move his car that was when I told him that he and his family members could no longer park on my spot. \n\nThe whole driveway issues confuses me and I will be calling the council later today to try and stop this crazy woman taking half of my garden!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for refusing their neighbor to park in their spot.\n\nFirst, the author mentions they've lived in the house for 18 years and the neighbors moved in 3-4 years ago. Initially, the author allowed the neighbors to park in their spot because they didn't have a car. Now they do, so they're taking back the spot. The neighbor had previously asked to take half the garden for a porch, which was denied. Now the neighbor is trying to build a driveway on the author's property without consent. \n\nThe author called their brother to park the car to prevent the neighbor from parking there. The neighbor claims the council allowed it, but the author rents the house from the council. \n\nIn the UK, property boundaries and permissions are important. If the author's parking spot is their own property, they can control who parks there. The neighbor building on the author's garden without permission is a problem, especially since the council owns the house. The author might need to check the property ownership and any rights the neighbor has. \n\nThe key points: The author's action of using their own spot is their right, and the neighbor's actions might be unauthorized. The author's response to park their brother's car might be a way to enforce their right, but if the neighbor has a valid council permission, things could be different. However, since the author is a renter, they should involve the council to resolve the dispute. \n\nSo, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because they're protecting their own property. The neighbor's entitlement is questionable. The answer should be B.\n"
