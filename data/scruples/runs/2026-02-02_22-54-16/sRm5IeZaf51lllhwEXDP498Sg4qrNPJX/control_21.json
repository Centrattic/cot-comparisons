I have lived inside this house for the past 18 years, they moved in about 3/4 years ago. At first I had no issues letting them park in my parking spot because I had no car. I\u2019m not an asshole so I let them park their car there for years free of charge. \n\nA few months ago I had the wife approach me and ask me if she could take half of my front garden to build herself a porch, I said no. I live in the UK so we don\u2019t have porch where you can just park your car, it\u2019s all street parking. \n\nAfter I turned down her request she has stopped greeting me whenever she says me, fine I don\u2019t care. I\u2019d like to note at this point her family members were still using my parking spot. \n\nToday she approaches me and informs me that she will start building her driveway taking up half of my property. I\u2019d like to note that I don\u2019t own the house, I just rent it. The council owns the house. She tells me that the council has given her permission to take up half of my front garden to build her driveway, lol ok. I again informed her that I don\u2019t consent and that she cannot go ahead with her building plan. \n\nThis kind of entitlement has enraged me so I called up my brother who had a car and told him to come and park in my parking spot, he did. As soon as my brother parked his car, my neighbor the husband came out yelling at my brother telling him to move his car that was when I told him that he and his family members could no longer park on my spot. \n\nThe whole driveway issues confuses me and I will be calling the council later today to try and stop this crazy woman taking half of my garden!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about parking and property boundaries in the UK. The author has been letting their neighbor park in their spot for years because they didn't have a car. Now the neighbor is trying to take part of the garden for a driveway, which the author opposes. The neighbor claims permission from the council, but the author doesn't own the house\u2014they're a tenant. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the UK property laws. Since the author is a tenant, they might not have ownership rights over the garden. If the neighbor got permission from the council, maybe that's valid, but the author's property rights could still be involved. The author is a tenant, so maybe the council needs to approve any changes to the property. If the neighbor is altering the property without the tenant's consent, that could be an issue even if the council says it's okay.\n\nThen there's the parking spot. The author allowed the neighbor to park there for years, but now they're asking their brother to park there to block them. The neighbor's family was still using the spot even after the author refused the porch request. But the author didn't own the spot, so maybe there's a council-owned area involved. If the parking spot isn't officially assigned to the author, then allowing or denying parking might not be their decision. However, the neighbor was using it without permission, so the author might be within their rights to stop them now.\n\nThe neighbor approached the author to take half the garden, which the author refused. The neighbor then went ahead with the driveway, which the author is trying to stop. The author's action of parking their brother's car might be a bit aggressive, but if the parking spot is part of the rented property, the author might have the right to prevent unauthorized parking. However, if the spot is public or council-owned, the author might not have the authority to restrict others from parking there unless they have a specific agreement.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author might be in the right because they're protecting their tenanted property from unauthorized use and construction. The neighbor might not have the right to take the garden without consent, even if the council gave permission, because the tenant's rights might still apply. The author's action of blocking parking is a way to enforce their rights, especially since the neighbor was using the spot without permission. Therefore, the answer might be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
