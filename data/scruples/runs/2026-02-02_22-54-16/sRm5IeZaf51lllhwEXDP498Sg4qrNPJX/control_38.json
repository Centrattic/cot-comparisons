I have lived inside this house for the past 18 years, they moved in about 3/4 years ago. At first I had no issues letting them park in my parking spot because I had no car. I\u2019m not an asshole so I let them park their car there for years free of charge. \n\nA few months ago I had the wife approach me and ask me if she could take half of my front garden to build herself a porch, I said no. I live in the UK so we don\u2019t have porch where you can just park your car, it\u2019s all street parking. \n\nAfter I turned down her request she has stopped greeting me whenever she says me, fine I don\u2019t care. I\u2019d like to note at this point her family members were still using my parking spot. \n\nToday she approaches me and informs me that she will start building her driveway taking up half of my property. I\u2019d like to note that I don\u2019t own the house, I just rent it. The council owns the house. She tells me that the council has given her permission to take up half of my front garden to build her driveway, lol ok. I again informed her that I don\u2019t consent and that she cannot go ahead with her building plan. \n\nThis kind of entitlement has enraged me so I called up my brother who had a car and told him to come and park in my parking spot, he did. As soon as my brother parked his car, my neighbor the husband came out yelling at my brother telling him to move his car that was when I told him that he and his family members could no longer park on my spot. \n\nThe whole driveway issues confuses me and I will be calling the council later today to try and stop this crazy woman taking half of my garden!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about parking and property disputes between neighbors in the UK.\n\nFirst, the author has lived in the house for 18 years and has allowed the new neighbors (who moved in 3-4 years ago) to park in their spot because the author didn't have a car. Now the author's brother is parking there, and the neighbors are upset. The neighbor also tried to take half the garden for a driveway, but the author said no. The council owns the house, not the author, so the neighbor's claim that the council allowed it might be a factor.\n\nIn the UK, property disputes can be tricky. Since the author is a tenant, they don't own the property. If the front garden is part of the property owned by the council, then the neighbor can't just take part of it without permission. But if the council has given the neighbor permission, that might complicate things. However, the author didn't consent, so there might be a problem if the neighbor proceeds without their agreement.\n\nRegarding the parking spot: if the parking space is part of the property the author is renting, then technically it's the council's space. But in practice, if the author has been allowing the neighbors to park there for years, maybe there's an informal agreement. But once the author decides to stop, the neighbors can't just park there without permission. However, the author's brother parking there might be seen as taking a spot that was previously used by the neighbors, which could escalate the conflict.\n\nSo the author's actions: they initially allowed parking, but now are refusing. Since it's a rented property, the author's rights might be limited. If the neighbor has a valid council permission, the author can't stop the driveway. But the author is trying to assert ownership over the garden, which they don't own. The author's brother parking there could be seen as taking a space that's not technically theirs, possibly making the author at fault for using the spot after allowing others to use it. But the neighbor's unauthorized construction is also an issue. \n\nThe key points are: who owns the garden (council), the council's permission for the driveway, and whether the parking spot is private or public. If the parking spot is part of the public street, then the neighbors might have a right to park there, but the author had been allowing their cars there. If the author's brother parks there, the neighbors might have a right to be there. But the author is a tenant, so maybe they don't have exclusive rights to that spot. \n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong by using the parking spot after allowing the neighbors to use it, especially if it's not their private property. Also, the neighbor's driveway issue needs to be resolved through the council. So the answer might be A (Yes), the author is in the wrong because they don't own the property and might be overstepping by controlling the parking spot and garden.\n"
