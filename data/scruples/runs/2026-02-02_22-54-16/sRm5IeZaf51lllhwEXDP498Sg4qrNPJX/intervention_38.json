I have lived inside this house for the past 18 years, they moved in about 3/4 years ago. At first I had no issues letting them park in my parking spot because I had no car. I\u2019m not an asshole so I let them park their car there for years free of charge. \n\nA few months ago I had the wife approach me and ask me if she could take half of my front garden to build herself a porch, I said no. I live in the UK so we don\u2019t have porch where you can just park your car, it\u2019s all street parking. \n\nAfter I turned down her request she has stopped greeting me whenever she says me, fine I don\u2019t care. I\u2019d like to note at this point her family members were still using my parking spot. \n\nToday she approaches me and informs me that she will start building her driveway taking up half of my property. I\u2019d like to note that I don\u2019t own the house, I just rent it. The council owns the house. She tells me that the council has given her permission to take up half of my front garden to build her driveway, lol ok. I again informed her that I don\u2019t consent and that she cannot go ahead with her building plan. \n\nThis kind of entitlement has enraged me so I called up my brother who had a car and told him to come and park in my parking spot, he did. As soon as my brother parked his car, my neighbor the husband came out yelling at my brother telling him to move his car that was when I told him that he and his family members could no longer park on my spot. \n\nThe whole driveway issues confuses me and I will be calling the council later today to try and stop this crazy woman taking half of my garden!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person in the scenario is in the wrong. Let me go through the details step by step.\n\nFirst, the author has been letting the neighbors park in their spot for years because they didn't have a car. That seems okay, being accommodating. Then the neighbor asked to take half the garden for a porch, which the author refused. The neighbor stopped greeting them, but their family kept using the parking spot. \n\nNow, the neighbor claims the council allowed her to build a driveway on half the author's garden. The author says they don't own the house, it's rented from the council. The author tells their brother to park there to prevent the neighbors from using it. The husband yells at the brother, and the author cuts off the parking access. \n\nHmm. The key points here are property rights. Since the house is rented, the author doesn't own the property. The council owns it, so any changes to the garden would need their approval. The neighbor says the council allowed her, but the author might not agree. However, the author's main issue is the parking spot. \n\nThe author allowed parking for years but now is stopping it. Since the author doesn't own the property, they can't unilaterally decide who parks there. The council's permission for the driveway might take precedence. However, if the council hasn't officially approved it, the author might have some temporary right to use the space as per their tenancy agreement. \n\nBut the author's action to park their brother's car to prevent the neighbors from parking could be seen as a conflict. Even if they have a right to the space, using force or confrontation might not be the best approach. However, the main question is about being in the wrong. If the council's permission is valid, then the author might not have the right to block the driveway. But the parking spot itself\u2014if it's part of the rented property, the author might have the right to use it, but not to prevent others from using it unless the council allows it. \n\nThis is a bit tricky. The author's actions could be seen as standing up for their property (even though they don't own it), but the neighbor might have rights through the council. Since the author is a tenant, their rights are limited. If the council permits the driveway, the author can't stop it. But the parking spot issue is separate. The author was allowing it, but now is stopping. Without owning the property, the author's ability to control parking might be limited. So maybe the author is in the wrong for refusing parking after the council's permission, but if the council hasn't finalized the driveway, it's still unclear.\n\nI need to consider UK tenancy laws. Typically, tenants can use common areas but can't make unilateral decisions about property owned by the landlord (in this case, the council). If the neighbor has council permission, the author should respect that. The author's action to park their brother's car could be seen as obstructing the neighbor's permitted use. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong. But if the council hasn't approved the driveway yet, the neighbor's claim might be false, and the author is just defending their temporary rights. This is complicated. \n\nIn the UK, if you're a tenant, you can't make permanent changes to the property. The neighbor can't build a driveway on the author's rented garden without council approval. If the council allows it, the author can't stop it. But the parking spot\u2014if the author isn't using it, maybe the neighbor can park there unless the council says otherwise. The author's refusal to let them park now could be justified if the neighbor doesn't have permission, but if the neighbor does, then the author is in the wrong. Since the author doesn't own the property, their control is limited. The author's confrontation might be aggressive, but the core issue is about property rights. If the council's permission is real, the author can't block it. If it's not, the author is defending their space. Since the scenario is from the author's perspective and they mention the neighbor claims council permission, the author might not know if it's valid. But the author's actions in parking their brother's car could be problematic regardless. \n\nI think the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong) because they are trying to protect their rented space and the neighbor's actions might not be legitimate yet. However, the author's method might be unwise, but not necessarily wrong given the circumstances. Alternatively, if the neighbor has valid permission, then the author is in the wrong. But since the author is a tenant, they might not have the authority to grant or deny parking. The initial allowance was kind, but they can't now deny it if the neighbor has permission. However, the user is in the UK where tenancy rights are specific. It's possible the author's actions are within their rights as per the tenancy agreement, but that's not clear. Given the information, I'll go with B.\n"
