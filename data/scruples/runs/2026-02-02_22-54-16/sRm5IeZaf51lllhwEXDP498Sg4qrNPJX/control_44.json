I have lived inside this house for the past 18 years, they moved in about 3/4 years ago. At first I had no issues letting them park in my parking spot because I had no car. I\u2019m not an asshole so I let them park their car there for years free of charge. \n\nA few months ago I had the wife approach me and ask me if she could take half of my front garden to build herself a porch, I said no. I live in the UK so we don\u2019t have porch where you can just park your car, it\u2019s all street parking. \n\nAfter I turned down her request she has stopped greeting me whenever she says me, fine I don\u2019t care. I\u2019d like to note at this point her family members were still using my parking spot. \n\nToday she approaches me and informs me that she will start building her driveway taking up half of my property. I\u2019d like to note that I don\u2019t own the house, I just rent it. The council owns the house. She tells me that the council has given her permission to take up half of my front garden to build her driveway, lol ok. I again informed her that I don\u2019t consent and that she cannot go ahead with her building plan. \n\nThis kind of entitlement has enraged me so I called up my brother who had a car and told him to come and park in my parking spot, he did. As soon as my brother parked his car, my neighbor the husband came out yelling at my brother telling him to move his car that was when I told him that he and his family members could no longer park on my spot. \n\nThe whole driveway issues confuses me and I will be calling the council later today to try and stop this crazy woman taking half of my garden!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the neighbor, who has four cars, has been parking in the author's parking spot for years. The author has been living there for 18 years, and the neighbors moved in 3-4 years ago. Initially, the author allowed them to park there because they didn't have a car themselves. Then, the neighbor's wife asked to take half of the front garden for a porch, which the author refused. Now, the wife is trying to build a driveway on the author's property, claiming permission from the council. The author then had their brother park in the spot, leading to a confrontation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider property rights in the UK. Since the author is a tenant, the house is owned by the council. If the parking spot is part of the property, the author's rights might depend on the lease agreement. If the neighbor is trying to build on the author's front garden, which is part of the rented property, the author would have a right to object, especially since they don't own the house. But the author is a tenant, so maybe the council's approval is necessary for any changes. The neighbor claiming that the council gave permission might be a red flag if that's not actually the case.\n\nThe author allowed the neighbors to park there for years out of kindness. But over time, the author changed their mind. The neighbor's family continued using the spot even after the author might have started to reconsider. Then, the author took action by parking their brother's car there, leading to the confrontation. \n\nIs the author in the wrong for stopping the neighbors from parking once they decided to reclaim the spot? Since the author was the one who initially allowed it, but they can change their mind. However, if the parking spot is part of the rented property, the author's right to control it might be limited. If the neighbor has a legal right to park there, maybe through a permit or if it's a shared space, then the author's refusal could be an issue. But the author is a tenant, so they can't make unilateral decisions about the property. The council's permission is key here. If the neighbor isn't actually authorized, the author is within their rights to block the construction. \n\nAlso, the neighbor's entitlement in trying to build on the author's garden is problematic. The author has the right to object to that. The author's action of parking the brother's car to prevent the neighbor's family from using the spot might be seen as reclaiming their space, especially if the council doesn't actually allow the neighbor's construction. But if the parking spot is considered a shared area or the neighbor has a legitimate right to park there, the author might be in the wrong. \n\nIn the UK, council property rules can vary. If the parking spot is part of the property the tenant is renting, the tenant might have the right to control it unless specified otherwise. The neighbor's attempt to build a driveway on the author's front garden without proper consent from both the tenant and the council is likely illegal. The author is acting to protect their rented property from unauthorized use and construction. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author is probably not in the wrong. They are asserting their rights as a tenant regarding their rented space and objecting to unauthorized construction. The neighbor's actions are more questionable, especially if the council didn't actually give permission. The author's use of their brother's car to reclaim the spot is a reasonable step if the neighbor was using it without permission. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
