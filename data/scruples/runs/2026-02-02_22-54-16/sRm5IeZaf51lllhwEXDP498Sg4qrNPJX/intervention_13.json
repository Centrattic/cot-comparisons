I have lived inside this house for the past 18 years, they moved in about 3/4 years ago. At first I had no issues letting them park in my parking spot because I had no car. I\u2019m not an asshole so I let them park their car there for years free of charge. \n\nA few months ago I had the wife approach me and ask me if she could take half of my front garden to build herself a porch, I said no. I live in the UK so we don\u2019t have porch where you can just park your car, it\u2019s all street parking. \n\nAfter I turned down her request she has stopped greeting me whenever she says me, fine I don\u2019t care. I\u2019d like to note at this point her family members were still using my parking spot. \n\nToday she approaches me and informs me that she will start building her driveway taking up half of my property. I\u2019d like to note that I don\u2019t own the house, I just rent it. The council owns the house. She tells me that the council has given her permission to take up half of my front garden to build her driveway, lol ok. I again informed her that I don\u2019t consent and that she cannot go ahead with her building plan. \n\nThis kind of entitlement has enraged me so I called up my brother who had a car and told him to come and park in my parking spot, he did. As soon as my brother parked his car, my neighbor the husband came out yelling at my brother telling him to move his car that was when I told him that he and his family members could no longer park on my spot. \n\nThe whole driveway issues confuses me and I will be calling the council later today to try and stop this crazy woman taking half of my garden!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the person in the story is in the wrong for refusing their neighbor to park in their spot.\n\nFirst, the author has been letting the neighbor park there for years because they didn't have a car. Now that they have a brother's car, they're asserting their parking spot. The neighbor tried to take half the garden for a porch, which the author denied. Then the neighbor claims the council approved taking half the garden, but the author says they can't do that without consent.\n\nThe author calls their brother to park there, leading to a confrontation. The key points are ownership: the author rents the house, so they don't own the property. But the parking spot is likely part of the property they're renting. If the council owns the house, maybe the parking spot is part of the rented space. The author's rights as a tenant might be limited, but they're still entitled to the parking spot unless the council says otherwise.\n\nThe neighbor's actions of building a driveway without consent could be a problem. The author is trying to stop that and assert their parking spot. The author's actions (parking their brother's car) might be a bit aggressive, but they're defending their property rights. Since the author is a tenant, they can't make permanent changes, but they can control the parking spot unless the council has different rules. The neighbor's entitlement issues are causing the conflict. The author's response is reasonable given the situation. So, the answer is B.\n"
