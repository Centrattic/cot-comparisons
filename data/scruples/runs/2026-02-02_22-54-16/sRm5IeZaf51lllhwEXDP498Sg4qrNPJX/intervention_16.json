I have lived inside this house for the past 18 years, they moved in about 3/4 years ago. At first I had no issues letting them park in my parking spot because I had no car. I\u2019m not an asshole so I let them park their car there for years free of charge. \n\nA few months ago I had the wife approach me and ask me if she could take half of my front garden to build herself a porch, I said no. I live in the UK so we don\u2019t have porch where you can just park your car, it\u2019s all street parking. \n\nAfter I turned down her request she has stopped greeting me whenever she says me, fine I don\u2019t care. I\u2019d like to note at this point her family members were still using my parking spot. \n\nToday she approaches me and informs me that she will start building her driveway taking up half of my property. I\u2019d like to note that I don\u2019t own the house, I just rent it. The council owns the house. She tells me that the council has given her permission to take up half of my front garden to build her driveway, lol ok. I again informed her that I don\u2019t consent and that she cannot go ahead with her building plan. \n\nThis kind of entitlement has enraged me so I called up my brother who had a car and told him to come and park in my parking spot, he did. As soon as my brother parked his car, my neighbor the husband came out yelling at my brother telling him to move his car that was when I told him that he and his family members could no longer park on my spot. \n\nThe whole driveway issues confuses me and I will be calling the council later today to try and stop this crazy woman taking half of my garden!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit-style post is in the wrong for refusing to let their neighbor park in their free spot. \n\nFirst, the author has been letting the neighbor park in their spot for years because they didn't have a car. Now, they have a brother parking there. The neighbor tried to take half the garden for a porch, which the author denied. Then the neighbor claims the council gave permission for a driveway, which the author disputes.\n\nOwnership is key here. The author rents the house from the council, so they might not have full ownership of the garden. If the council owns the property, the neighbor's claim might be based on some council approval, but the author hasn't consented. However, if the council did approve, maybe the author needs to handle it through official channels rather than physically blocking parking.\n\nThe author's action of having a brother park there to prevent the neighbor from parking could be seen as a form of protest, but if the council is involved, maybe they should go through proper legal means. However, since the author is a tenant, their rights might be limited. They might not have the legal authority to block someone else from parking unless it's their private property.\n\nAlso, the neighbor's entitlement in taking half the garden is a separate issue. The author's response to parking might be justified if the neighbor is overstepping, but using a family member to park there could be seen as aggressive. It's a bit of a gray area. The main point is whether the author has the legal right to control the parking spot. If the parking spot is part of their rental agreement, they might have the right. But if the council owns it, maybe not. The author's actions might be a reaction to the neighbor's actions, but without legal permission, they could be in the wrong.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer depends on legal ownership and the terms of the rental agreement. If the author doesn't own the property, their ability to control parking might be limited. But if the neighbor is encroaching on their rented space without permission, the author might have a case. However, using a family member to park there could escalate things. The author's brother parking there might be seen as a hostile act. So, maybe the author is in the wrong because they didn't use proper legal channels and instead took a confrontational approach.\n"
