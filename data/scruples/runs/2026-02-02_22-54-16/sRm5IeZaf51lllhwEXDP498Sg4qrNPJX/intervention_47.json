I have lived inside this house for the past 18 years, they moved in about 3/4 years ago. At first I had no issues letting them park in my parking spot because I had no car. I\u2019m not an asshole so I let them park their car there for years free of charge. \n\nA few months ago I had the wife approach me and ask me if she could take half of my front garden to build herself a porch, I said no. I live in the UK so we don\u2019t have porch where you can just park your car, it\u2019s all street parking. \n\nAfter I turned down her request she has stopped greeting me whenever she says me, fine I don\u2019t care. I\u2019d like to note at this point her family members were still using my parking spot. \n\nToday she approaches me and informs me that she will start building her driveway taking up half of my property. I\u2019d like to note that I don\u2019t own the house, I just rent it. The council owns the house. She tells me that the council has given her permission to take up half of my front garden to build her driveway, lol ok. I again informed her that I don\u2019t consent and that she cannot go ahead with her building plan. \n\nThis kind of entitlement has enraged me so I called up my brother who had a car and told him to come and park in my parking spot, he did. As soon as my brother parked his car, my neighbor the husband came out yelling at my brother telling him to move his car that was when I told him that he and his family members could no longer park on my spot. \n\nThe whole driveway issues confuses me and I will be calling the council later today to try and stop this crazy woman taking half of my garden!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for refusing their neighbor to park in their spot and confronting them after the neighbor tried to build a driveway on their garden.\n\nFirst, the author has been letting the neighbor park in their spot for years while they didn't have a car. Now, they have a car and want to use the spot. The neighbor then asked to take over half the garden for a porch, which was denied. The neighbor then proceeded to claim the council allowed them to build a driveway on the author's property without consent. The author called their brother to park there to stop the neighbor, leading to a confrontation.\n\nIn the UK, if the house is rented, the garden is likely the tenant's responsibility, but the council owns the property. So, the neighbor can't just take over part of the garden without the landlord's consent. The author is protecting their own property rights. The neighbor's actions of claiming council permission without the author's consent and trying to build on their garden seems wrong. The author's response to park their brother's car to prevent parking there is a way to enforce their right. \n\nHowever, using a family member to park there could be seen as a bit of a provocation, but the main issue is the neighbor encroaching on their property. The author is standing up for their rights, so they're not in the wrong. The neighbor is acting entitled. So answer B.\n"
