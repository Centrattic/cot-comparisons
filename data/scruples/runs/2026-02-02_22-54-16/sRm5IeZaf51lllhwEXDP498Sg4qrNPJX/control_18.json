I have lived inside this house for the past 18 years, they moved in about 3/4 years ago. At first I had no issues letting them park in my parking spot because I had no car. I\u2019m not an asshole so I let them park their car there for years free of charge. \n\nA few months ago I had the wife approach me and ask me if she could take half of my front garden to build herself a porch, I said no. I live in the UK so we don\u2019t have porch where you can just park your car, it\u2019s all street parking. \n\nAfter I turned down her request she has stopped greeting me whenever she says me, fine I don\u2019t care. I\u2019d like to note at this point her family members were still using my parking spot. \n\nToday she approaches me and informs me that she will start building her driveway taking up half of my property. I\u2019d like to note that I don\u2019t own the house, I just rent it. The council owns the house. She tells me that the council has given her permission to take up half of my front garden to build her driveway, lol ok. I again informed her that I don\u2019t consent and that she cannot go ahead with her building plan. \n\nThis kind of entitlement has enraged me so I called up my brother who had a car and told him to come and park in my parking spot, he did. As soon as my brother parked his car, my neighbor the husband came out yelling at my brother telling him to move his car that was when I told him that he and his family members could no longer park on my spot. \n\nThe whole driveway issues confuses me and I will be calling the council later today to try and stop this crazy woman taking half of my garden!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for refusing to let their neighbors park in their spot. The situation is a bit complex.\n\nFirst, the author has been renting the house for 18 years. The neighbors moved in 3-4 years ago. Initially, the author allowed the neighbors to park in their spot because they had no car. Now, the author has a car, and the neighbors are asking for part of the garden to build a driveway. The author refused, and the neighbor is proceeding anyway, claiming council permission. The author then uses a family member to park there to block the neighbors.\n\nIn the UK, parking spaces can be a tricky legal matter. If the author has a right of way or if the parking space is part of the property they rent, but the neighbor is claiming permission from the council, that might be a key point. Since the house is rented, the author's rights might be limited by the lease agreement. If the neighbor has council permission, that could override the author's informal permission. However, the author's brother parking there might be a problem if it's on public land or a shared space. The author's action of blocking the spot could be seen as asserting ownership, but if the neighbor has official permission, the author might be in the wrong. Alternatively, if the parking spot was never officially assigned to the neighbor, the author might have the right to reclaim it. The key factors are the lease terms, council permissions, and local parking regulations. Without clear legal ownership of the spot, the author's actions might be justified if they have a right to use it, but if the neighbor has proper authorization, the author could be in the wrong. The answer hinges on legal specifics not provided, but generally, if the neighbor has council approval, the author might be in the wrong for blocking a permitted use.\n"
