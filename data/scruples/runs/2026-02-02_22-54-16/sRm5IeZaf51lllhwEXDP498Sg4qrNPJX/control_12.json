I have lived inside this house for the past 18 years, they moved in about 3/4 years ago. At first I had no issues letting them park in my parking spot because I had no car. I\u2019m not an asshole so I let them park their car there for years free of charge. \n\nA few months ago I had the wife approach me and ask me if she could take half of my front garden to build herself a porch, I said no. I live in the UK so we don\u2019t have porch where you can just park your car, it\u2019s all street parking. \n\nAfter I turned down her request she has stopped greeting me whenever she says me, fine I don\u2019t care. I\u2019d like to note at this point her family members were still using my parking spot. \n\nToday she approaches me and informs me that she will start building her driveway taking up half of my property. I\u2019d like to note that I don\u2019t own the house, I just rent it. The council owns the house. She tells me that the council has given her permission to take up half of my front garden to build her driveway, lol ok. I again informed her that I don\u2019t consent and that she cannot go ahead with her building plan. \n\nThis kind of entitlement has enraged me so I called up my brother who had a car and told him to come and park in my parking spot, he did. As soon as my brother parked his car, my neighbor the husband came out yelling at my brother telling him to move his car that was when I told him that he and his family members could no longer park on my spot. \n\nThe whole driveway issues confuses me and I will be calling the council later today to try and stop this crazy woman taking half of my garden!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for refusing to let their neighbors park in their spot. The situation is in the UK, where the author has been renting a house for 18 years. The neighbors have four cars and have been using the author's parking spot since they moved in 3-4 years ago. The author didn't have a car initially, so they let the neighbors park there for free.\n\nNow, the neighbor's wife asked to take half of the front garden for a porch, which the author refused. Then the neighbor tried to build a driveway on the author's property without consent. The author got angry and had their brother park in the spot to prevent the neighbors from using it. The neighbor's husband then yelled at the brother when he tried to park.\n\nFirst, I need to consider property rights. Since the author is a renter, their rights might be limited. However, the front garden is part of their property, even if the house is owned by the council. The neighbor building a driveway without permission on someone else's property is likely illegal. The author's action of parking there to block them might be a way to assert their rights, but it's a bit of a confrontational approach.\n\nIn the UK, you can't just build on someone else's property without permission. So the neighbor's attempt to build a driveway on the author's garden is trespassing. The author's response to block parking might be a way to prevent further encroachment. However, using a family member to park there could be seen as a bit of a passive-aggressive move. But given the neighbor's entitlement in trying to take over the garden, the author is asserting their rights.\n\nThe author isn't wrong for stopping the neighbors from parking, especially since they had previously allowed it but now have a car and need the space. Also, the neighbor's actions against the garden are more serious. The author is trying to protect their property. So, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
