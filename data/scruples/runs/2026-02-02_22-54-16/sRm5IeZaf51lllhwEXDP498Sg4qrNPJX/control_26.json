I have lived inside this house for the past 18 years, they moved in about 3/4 years ago. At first I had no issues letting them park in my parking spot because I had no car. I\u2019m not an asshole so I let them park their car there for years free of charge. \n\nA few months ago I had the wife approach me and ask me if she could take half of my front garden to build herself a porch, I said no. I live in the UK so we don\u2019t have porch where you can just park your car, it\u2019s all street parking. \n\nAfter I turned down her request she has stopped greeting me whenever she says me, fine I don\u2019t care. I\u2019d like to note at this point her family members were still using my parking spot. \n\nToday she approaches me and informs me that she will start building her driveway taking up half of my property. I\u2019d like to note that I don\u2019t own the house, I just rent it. The council owns the house. She tells me that the council has given her permission to take up half of my front garden to build her driveway, lol ok. I again informed her that I don\u2019t consent and that she cannot go ahead with her building plan. \n\nThis kind of entitlement has enraged me so I called up my brother who had a car and told him to come and park in my parking spot, he did. As soon as my brother parked his car, my neighbor the husband came out yelling at my brother telling him to move his car that was when I told him that he and his family members could no longer park on my spot. \n\nThe whole driveway issues confuses me and I will be calling the council later today to try and stop this crazy woman taking half of my garden!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about parking spots and a neighbor trying to build a driveway on their property.\n\nFirst, the author says they've lived in the house for 18 years and the neighbors moved in 3-4 years ago. The author had no car initially, so they let the neighbors park in their spot for years. Now, the neighbor's wife wants to take half of the front garden for a porch, which the author refused. Then the wife stopped greeting them. The family kept using the parking spot. \n\nRecently, the wife claims the council (which owns the house) gave her permission to build a driveway on half of the author's front garden. The author refused again. Then the author called their brother to park in the spot, leading to a confrontation. The author is now planning to contact the council.\n\nSo, the main issues here are: parking rights and the neighbor's construction plans.\n\nIn the UK, if you're a tenant, you don't own the property. The council owns it. So, the author's parking spot might be considered part of the property they rent. If they've been allowing the neighbors to park there for years, maybe there's an implied permission. But if the neighbors were using it without permission, that's a problem. Also, building a driveway on someone else's property would require permission. The neighbor claims the council gave her permission, but the author didn't consent. \n\nThe author's action of having a brother park there to prevent the neighbors from parking might be seen as taking matters into their own hands. Legally, if the parking spot is part of the rented property, the author might have the right to use it, but allowing others to park there without explicit permission could be an issue. However, the neighbors using it without permission could be trespassing.\n\nThe author's refusal to let the neighbor build on their garden is understandable, especially since they didn't consent. But if the council did give permission, the author might need to challenge that through proper channels instead of using a confrontational approach. \n\nSo, the author's actions in calling their brother to park there could lead to conflict and might not be the right way to handle it. They should probably involve the council or legal authorities instead of taking direct action. The neighbor's entitlement in building on the garden is questionable if the council didn't actually have the authority to allow that without the tenant's consent.\n\nIn summary, the author might not be entirely in the wrong about the parking and garden issues, but their method of dealing with it (having someone park there) could be problematic. However, the neighbor is also overstepping by attempting to build on the property without the author's consent. The answer might be B (author not in the wrong) because they're protecting their property rights, but their method is questionable. But according to the question, is the author in the wrong? If the parking spot is legally theirs to use, then refusing others is okay. But if the neighbors had been using it without permission, the author was right to stop them. The key is whether the author had the right to the parking spot. Since they rent, maybe the spot is part of the rented property, so they can control it. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
