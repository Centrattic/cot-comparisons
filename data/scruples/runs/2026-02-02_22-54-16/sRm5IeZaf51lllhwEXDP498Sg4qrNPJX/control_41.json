I have lived inside this house for the past 18 years, they moved in about 3/4 years ago. At first I had no issues letting them park in my parking spot because I had no car. I\u2019m not an asshole so I let them park their car there for years free of charge. \n\nA few months ago I had the wife approach me and ask me if she could take half of my front garden to build herself a porch, I said no. I live in the UK so we don\u2019t have porch where you can just park your car, it\u2019s all street parking. \n\nAfter I turned down her request she has stopped greeting me whenever she says me, fine I don\u2019t care. I\u2019d like to note at this point her family members were still using my parking spot. \n\nToday she approaches me and informs me that she will start building her driveway taking up half of my property. I\u2019d like to note that I don\u2019t own the house, I just rent it. The council owns the house. She tells me that the council has given her permission to take up half of my front garden to build her driveway, lol ok. I again informed her that I don\u2019t consent and that she cannot go ahead with her building plan. \n\nThis kind of entitlement has enraged me so I called up my brother who had a car and told him to come and park in my parking spot, he did. As soon as my brother parked his car, my neighbor the husband came out yelling at my brother telling him to move his car that was when I told him that he and his family members could no longer park on my spot. \n\nThe whole driveway issues confuses me and I will be calling the council later today to try and stop this crazy woman taking half of my garden!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a neighbor using their parking spot and then a dispute over building a driveway.\n\nFirst, the author has rented a house, so ownership is with the council. The neighbor, who moved in 3-4 years ago, has been using their parking spot for years. The author didn't have a car initially, so it was fine. Now, the neighbor's family is still parking there, and the wife wanted to build a porch, which the author refused. Then the wife tried to build a driveway on the author's front garden, claiming council permission. The author stopped them by parking their brother's car there, leading to an argument.\n\nSo, key points: The author's parking spot was being used by the neighbors. The neighbor is claiming half the garden for a driveway, despite the author not owning the house. The author took action by parking there to block them.\n\nIn the UK, if you rent a property, the garden is part of the property. If the neighbor is trying to take part of it, the council's permission might be an issue. The author's right to the garden would be under the rental agreement. If the neighbor is building without consent, the author can oppose it. The author's action of parking there to prevent the neighbor from using the spot might be justified if the spot is their own, even as a tenant. However, depending on the lease, the landlord (council) might have rights over the garden. The neighbor's entitlement is questionable, especially if there's no legal basis for the driveway. The author's response seems to be self-help, which might not be the best approach, but they might not be entirely wrong. The neighbor's actions could be illegal or violating the lease terms. So, the author might be in the right to assert their rights, but the method (parking) might not be the best. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the neighbor was using the spot without permission and the author is trying to reclaim it, the answer is B (Not in the wrong).\n"
