I have lived inside this house for the past 18 years, they moved in about 3/4 years ago. At first I had no issues letting them park in my parking spot because I had no car. I\u2019m not an asshole so I let them park their car there for years free of charge. \n\nA few months ago I had the wife approach me and ask me if she could take half of my front garden to build herself a porch, I said no. I live in the UK so we don\u2019t have porch where you can just park your car, it\u2019s all street parking. \n\nAfter I turned down her request she has stopped greeting me whenever she says me, fine I don\u2019t care. I\u2019d like to note at this point her family members were still using my parking spot. \n\nToday she approaches me and informs me that she will start building her driveway taking up half of my property. I\u2019d like to note that I don\u2019t own the house, I just rent it. The council owns the house. She tells me that the council has given her permission to take up half of my front garden to build her driveway, lol ok. I again informed her that I don\u2019t consent and that she cannot go ahead with her building plan. \n\nThis kind of entitlement has enraged me so I called up my brother who had a car and told him to come and park in my parking spot, he did. As soon as my brother parked his car, my neighbor the husband came out yelling at my brother telling him to move his car that was when I told him that he and his family members could no longer park on my spot. \n\nThe whole driveway issues confuses me and I will be calling the council later today to try and stop this crazy woman taking half of my garden!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this step by step. The user is asking whether the author of the situation described is in the wrong. Let me break down the key points.\n\nFirst, the author has lived in the house for 18 years and the neighbors moved in 3-4 years ago. The author didn't have a car initially, so they let the neighbors park in their spot for years. That seems okay; they were being considerate.\n\nThen, the neighbor's wife asked to take half the front garden for a porch, which the author refused. The neighbors stopped greeting the author, but continued using the parking spot. Now, the wife is trying to build a driveway on the author's property, claiming the council approved it. The author didn't consent and got their brother to park there to block it. The neighbors are upset.\n\nSo, the main issues here are property rights and unauthorized construction. The author rents the house from the council, which means they might not have the authority to consent to changes. The neighbor is claiming permission from the council, but the author isn't sure. \n\nThe author's action of making their brother park there could be seen as a stand to prevent the unauthorized construction. But since it's a rental property, the actual ownership is the council's. If the council approved the driveway, maybe the author doesn't have the right to block it. However, the author's own property (front garden) shouldn't be taken without their consent, even if the council owns the house. Wait, no\u2014if the house is council-owned, the garden might be part of the property they own, so the neighbor's attempt to take half of it would need council approval. The author might have a right to object if the council hasn't properly authorized it. \n\nBut the author isn't the legal owner, so maybe they don't have the authority to decide on the garden's use. However, they might have a lease agreement that allows them to use the garden, and the neighbor can't just take it without consent. The key here is whether the council's approval is valid and if the author has a right to object. \n\nThe author's refusal to let the neighbors park after their entitlement is a reaction to the neighbor's behavior. But the initial act of allowing parking was a neighborly gesture, and now the author is asserting their space. However, the way they blocked the parking by having a brother park there might be seen as a confrontation. \n\nIn terms of the law, if the council approved the driveway, the author might not have a legal standing to block it. But if the author's lease allows them to use the garden and the council didn't properly consult them, that's a different matter. The author's actions might be justified if the council didn't follow proper procedures. \n\nSo, the author's actions are a mix of standing up for their property and reacting to perceived entitlement. The main issue is whether the author has the legal right to object. If the council approved it, maybe the author is in the wrong for not allowing the driveway. But if the council didn't actually approve it, the author is protecting their space. \n\nThe user's question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer depends on the legal standing. Since the author is a tenant, they might not own the property, but they have rights under their lease. The neighbor's claim of council permission needs verification. The author might be in the right if the council didn't properly approve the driveway. However, if the council did approve it, the author might be in the wrong for obstructing it. \n\nBut the author's brother parking there could be a problem if it blocks access for the neighbors, even if the author feels wronged. The method of protest might be considered aggressive. \n\nConsidering all that, the author is trying to protect their property and rights as a tenant. While the method might be questionable, the core issue of unauthorized construction is valid. So the answer is likely B (not in the wrong).\n"
