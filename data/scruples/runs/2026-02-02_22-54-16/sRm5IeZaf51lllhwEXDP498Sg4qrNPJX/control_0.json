I have lived inside this house for the past 18 years, they moved in about 3/4 years ago. At first I had no issues letting them park in my parking spot because I had no car. I\u2019m not an asshole so I let them park their car there for years free of charge. \n\nA few months ago I had the wife approach me and ask me if she could take half of my front garden to build herself a porch, I said no. I live in the UK so we don\u2019t have porch where you can just park your car, it\u2019s all street parking. \n\nAfter I turned down her request she has stopped greeting me whenever she says me, fine I don\u2019t care. I\u2019d like to note at this point her family members were still using my parking spot. \n\nToday she approaches me and informs me that she will start building her driveway taking up half of my property. I\u2019d like to note that I don\u2019t own the house, I just rent it. The council owns the house. She tells me that the council has given her permission to take up half of my front garden to build her driveway, lol ok. I again informed her that I don\u2019t consent and that she cannot go ahead with her building plan. \n\nThis kind of entitlement has enraged me so I called up my brother who had a car and told him to come and park in my parking spot, he did. As soon as my brother parked his car, my neighbor the husband came out yelling at my brother telling him to move his car that was when I told him that he and his family members could no longer park on my spot. \n\nThe whole driveway issues confuses me and I will be calling the council later today to try and stop this crazy woman taking half of my garden!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation again to make sure I understand.\n\nThe person has lived in their house for 18 years, and their neighbor moved in 3-4 years ago. The neighbor has four cars. The writer didn't have a car initially, so they let the neighbor park in their spot for years. Then the neighbor's wife asked to take half of the front garden for a porch, and the writer said no. The wife stopped greeting them, but the family kept using the parking spot. Now, the neighbor claims the council gave her permission to build a driveway on the writer's property. The writer confronts them, gets angry, and has their brother park there to stop the neighbor from continuing to park. The neighbor's husband then yells at the brother.\n\nThe key points here are about property rights. The writer rents the house from the council, so they don't own it. The neighbor is trying to take up part of the writer's property (the front garden) without the owner's consent. The council is involved here because they own the property. \n\nIn the UK, if you're a tenant, you generally can't give permission for permanent alterations to the property without the council's approval. The neighbor might think they have permission, but if the council didn't consult the current tenant (the writer), that could be an issue. The writer is within their rights to object to unauthorized construction on their leased property. \n\nRegarding the parking spot, even though the writer allowed the neighbor to park there for years, that doesn't necessarily grant the neighbor a legal right to do so indefinitely. Since the writer is the tenant, they control the use of the property unless there's an agreement otherwise. However, if the parking spot is part of the public street or shared, things might be different. But in this case, it's a private front garden area, and the neighbor was using it without permission. The writer revoking that access isn't necessarily wrong.\n\nThe writer's brother parking there could be a bit of a gray area. If the parking spot is part of the leased property, the writer can use it as they see fit, so having a family member park there is their right. The neighbor's husband yelling at them might be aggressive behavior, but the writer's action in blocking the parking spot is their prerogative as the tenant.\n\nSo, considering all that, the writer isn't in the wrong. They're protecting their leased property from unauthorized changes and reclaiming their parking spot. The neighbor's actions in building a driveway without proper consent are the issue here. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
