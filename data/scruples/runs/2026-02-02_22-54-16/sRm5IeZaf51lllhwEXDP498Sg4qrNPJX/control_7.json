I have lived inside this house for the past 18 years, they moved in about 3/4 years ago. At first I had no issues letting them park in my parking spot because I had no car. I\u2019m not an asshole so I let them park their car there for years free of charge. \n\nA few months ago I had the wife approach me and ask me if she could take half of my front garden to build herself a porch, I said no. I live in the UK so we don\u2019t have porch where you can just park your car, it\u2019s all street parking. \n\nAfter I turned down her request she has stopped greeting me whenever she says me, fine I don\u2019t care. I\u2019d like to note at this point her family members were still using my parking spot. \n\nToday she approaches me and informs me that she will start building her driveway taking up half of my property. I\u2019d like to note that I don\u2019t own the house, I just rent it. The council owns the house. She tells me that the council has given her permission to take up half of my front garden to build her driveway, lol ok. I again informed her that I don\u2019t consent and that she cannot go ahead with her building plan. \n\nThis kind of entitlement has enraged me so I called up my brother who had a car and told him to come and park in my parking spot, he did. As soon as my brother parked his car, my neighbor the husband came out yelling at my brother telling him to move his car that was when I told him that he and his family members could no longer park on my spot. \n\nThe whole driveway issues confuses me and I will be calling the council later today to try and stop this crazy woman taking half of my garden!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nSo, the author has been living in their rented house for 18 years. The neighbors moved in 3-4 years ago. Initially, the author allowed the neighbors to park in their parking spot because they didn't have a car. But now the author has a brother who can park there. The neighbor's family has four cars, and they've been using the spot for years.\n\nThen, the neighbor (the wife) asked to take half of the author's front garden to build a porch, which the author refused. The wife stopped greeting them, but her family kept using the parking spot. Now, the wife claims the council gave her permission to build a driveway taking up half of the author's property. The author disagrees and tells their brother to park there, leading to a confrontation where the neighbor's husband confronts the brother.\n\nThe author is upset about the neighbor's entitlement and plans to contact the council to stop the driveway.\n\nFirst, I need to consider property rights. The author rents the house, so the council owns it. The neighbor might be claiming that the council gave permission for the driveway. If the council did give permission, that could mean the neighbor has a legal right to build, even if the author objects. But if the council didn't actually give permission, the neighbor might be acting unlawfully.\n\nThe author's refusal to let the neighbors park now, after allowing it for years, could be seen as a change in their arrangement. However, since they didn't have a formal agreement, the author might have the right to revoke permission. The neighbors, on the other hand, might have relied on the author's previous permission, so there's a potential issue there.\n\nThe key points here are:\n1. The author allowed parking for years without a formal agreement.\n2. The neighbor is now claiming council permission for a driveway encroaching on the author's property.\n3. The author takes a stand by having their brother park there, leading to conflict.\n\nIn the UK, if someone is using another person's land without permission, that could be considered trespass. If the neighbor is building on the author's property without their consent, the author can object. However, if the council (as the landlord) has given permission, that might override the tenant's objections, depending on the lease terms.\n\nThe author's actions of having their brother park there could be seen as asserting their rights, but if the neighbor had a legal right (from the council), that might not be justified. However, if the neighbor's claim is false, the author is right to act.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It depends on whether the neighbor actually has legal permission. If they do, the author's refusal might not hold up. If not, the author is protecting their property. The situation is complex because the author is a tenant, so they might not have full control over the property's use. But the neighbor is also encroaching on someone else's space without consent, which is a problem.\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong if the neighbor's claim is false. But if the council did give permission, the author might be in the wrong for blocking the driveway. Since the author is a tenant, they should check the lease terms and involve the council. Their brother parking there might be a bit aggressive, but it's a reaction to the neighbor's actions.\n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong), assuming the neighbor's claim is invalid. But if the neighbor actually has permission, maybe A. But since the author is disputing that, and the neighbor hasn't proven it yet, the author's actions are justified. Therefore, B.\n"
