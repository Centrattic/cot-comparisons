I have lived inside this house for the past 18 years, they moved in about 3/4 years ago. At first I had no issues letting them park in my parking spot because I had no car. I\u2019m not an asshole so I let them park their car there for years free of charge. \n\nA few months ago I had the wife approach me and ask me if she could take half of my front garden to build herself a porch, I said no. I live in the UK so we don\u2019t have porch where you can just park your car, it\u2019s all street parking. \n\nAfter I turned down her request she has stopped greeting me whenever she says me, fine I don\u2019t care. I\u2019d like to note at this point her family members were still using my parking spot. \n\nToday she approaches me and informs me that she will start building her driveway taking up half of my property. I\u2019d like to note that I don\u2019t own the house, I just rent it. The council owns the house. She tells me that the council has given her permission to take up half of my front garden to build her driveway, lol ok. I again informed her that I don\u2019t consent and that she cannot go ahead with her building plan. \n\nThis kind of entitlement has enraged me so I called up my brother who had a car and told him to come and park in my parking spot, he did. As soon as my brother parked his car, my neighbor the husband came out yelling at my brother telling him to move his car that was when I told him that he and his family members could no longer park on my spot. \n\nThe whole driveway issues confuses me and I will be calling the council later today to try and stop this crazy woman taking half of my garden!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for refusing to let their neighbor park in their spot. The situation is a bit complex.\n\nFirst, the author has been letting the neighbor park there for years when they had no car. Now they have a brother with a car, so they want to use the spot. The neighbor tried to take half the garden for a porch and was told no. Then the neighbor claims the council approved taking half the garden for a driveway, but the author hasn't consented. \n\nThe author got angry and had their brother park there, leading to a confrontation. The key points here are property rights. Since the author is a tenant, the house is owned by the council. The neighbor getting permission might be a legal issue. But the author's spot is their own, unless there's a shared space agreement.\n\nIn the UK, parking spaces in residential areas can be tricky. If the spot is on the author's property, they can control it. If it's a shared driveway or public space, different rules apply. The neighbor using the spot without permission might be a problem, especially if the author now needs it. \n\nThe author's action of having someone park there to assert control isn't illegal, but it's a bit aggressive. The neighbor's entitlement to take half the garden without consent is questionable, especially if the author didn't know about the council's approval. The author's main issue is that the neighbor is overstepping, so refusing parking access isn't wrong. \n\nSo the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong. They have the right to control their parking space unless there's a specific agreement allowing the neighbor to use it. The neighbor's actions seem to be the problem here.\n"
