I have lived inside this house for the past 18 years, they moved in about 3/4 years ago. At first I had no issues letting them park in my parking spot because I had no car. I\u2019m not an asshole so I let them park their car there for years free of charge. \n\nA few months ago I had the wife approach me and ask me if she could take half of my front garden to build herself a porch, I said no. I live in the UK so we don\u2019t have porch where you can just park your car, it\u2019s all street parking. \n\nAfter I turned down her request she has stopped greeting me whenever she says me, fine I don\u2019t care. I\u2019d like to note at this point her family members were still using my parking spot. \n\nToday she approaches me and informs me that she will start building her driveway taking up half of my property. I\u2019d like to note that I don\u2019t own the house, I just rent it. The council owns the house. She tells me that the council has given her permission to take up half of my front garden to build her driveway, lol ok. I again informed her that I don\u2019t consent and that she cannot go ahead with her building plan. \n\nThis kind of entitlement has enraged me so I called up my brother who had a car and told him to come and park in my parking spot, he did. As soon as my brother parked his car, my neighbor the husband came out yelling at my brother telling him to move his car that was when I told him that he and his family members could no longer park on my spot. \n\nThe whole driveway issues confuses me and I will be calling the council later today to try and stop this crazy woman taking half of my garden!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong. Let me break down the scenario step by step.\n\nFirst, the author has been allowing the neighbor to park in their spot for years when they didn't have a car. Now, the author has a brother's car parked there. The neighbor, who moved in 3-4 years ago, has four cars. The author has rented the house from the council for 18 years. The neighbor approached the author to take half the garden for a porch, which was refused. Then the neighbor tried to build a driveway on the author's property, claiming council permission, which the author contested. The author then called their brother to park in the spot, leading to a confrontation.\n\nKey points here: The author didn't own the house but was renting, so the land is council-owned. The neighbor's claim of permission from the council is a point to consider. The author's refusal to let the neighbor park might be justified if the parking spot is part of the property they have a right to use. However, if the spot isn't officially theirs (since council-owned), maybe the neighbor's use was informal. The author's action of parking their brother's car could be seen as reclaiming their space, but since they rent, maybe they can't make such decisions. Also, the neighbor's attempt to build on the author's garden without consent is another issue. The council's role here is important\u2014if the neighbor has permission, the author might need to dispute that through proper channels. \n\nSo, the author might not be in the wrong for stopping the neighbor from parking if they have the right to the spot as part of their rented property. But if the parking spot isn't officially theirs, maybe they shouldn't have allowed others to park there in the first place. However, since they've been allowing it for years, maybe it's a de facto agreement. The confrontation about the driveway is separate. The author's actions in parking their own car again could be self-defense of their property rights. But since the house is rented, maybe the council's input is needed. The neighbor's entitlement in building without consent is definitely wrong, but the parking issue's legality depends on property rights. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because they're protecting their rented property's space, especially after the neighbor's aggressive requests. The neighbor's actions (building without consent) are problematic. The author's response to stop parking is reasonable. So answer B.\n"
