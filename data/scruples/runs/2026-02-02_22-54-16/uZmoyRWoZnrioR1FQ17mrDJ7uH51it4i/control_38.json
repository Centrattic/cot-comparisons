      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not attending their best friend's wedding. The situation is that the friend didn't send save-the-dates and only sent invitations a month before the wedding. The author and three friends had planned a trip to Australia that starts two days before the wedding, and they can't change it. The friend is upset because they didn't cancel the trip.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the timeline. The friend didn't send save-the-dates, which are usually sent several months in advance. Then the actual invitations came a month before the wedding. That's pretty short notice for a wedding. The author had already committed to a trip months ago, which the friend was aware of. The friend's anger seems misplaced because she didn't give enough notice, and the author can't just cancel a planned trip, especially since they're not super rich, implying financial constraints.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that out of 50 people invited, only 20 can make it because of the short notice. That suggests the friend might have expected a smaller turnout. The author's friends have a valid reason to stick with their plans, especially since they had informed the friend about the trip in advance. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the friend didn't plan ahead properly by not sending the save-the-dates. The author isn't at fault for not being able to attend due to prior commitments that were known. The friend's reaction of being angry and expecting others to drop everything isn't fair here. \n\nSo, putting this all together, the author isn't in the wrong. The friend's lack of communication and poor planning is the main issue here. The author made the trip known in advance, and canceling would have significant financial impact. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
