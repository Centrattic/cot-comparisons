      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not attending their best friend's wedding. So, the scenario is that the friend, G, didn't send a save-the-date and only sent the actual invites a month before the wedding. The author and three friends had already planned a trip to Australia, which was supposed to start two days before the wedding. They had invited G to the trip, but G forgot about it. Now, G is upset and wants them to cancel the trip.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the timeline. If the wedding is a month away and the invitation came last week, that's a very short notice. Typically, save-the-dates are sent out several months in advance, and invitations a few weeks before. Not sending a save-the-date means G didn't plan well, which might be her fault. The author mentions that G invited 50 people but only expects 20 to show up because of the short notice. That suggests she didn't plan adequately.\n\nThe author and their friends had a trip planned that they can't afford to cancel. Financial constraints are a real issue here, so it's not like they can just drop everything and pay for a last-minute flight home. They had also invited G to the trip, so maybe they expected her to know about it. However, the user is in the U.S., and the trip is to Australia, so maybe the time zones or communication were an issue.\n\nG is upset and acting like they should drop everything. The author is arguing that they're not in the wrong because of the short notice and financial reasons. The key points here are the lack of save-the-date, the short notice, and the existing commitment that's costly to cancel. \n\nI think the author is not in the wrong. G's failure to send a save-the-date and the short notice make it difficult for the author to attend. Also, the trip was planned in advance and is a significant financial commitment. The friends aren't being selfish; they have valid reasons. So the answer is B.\n"
