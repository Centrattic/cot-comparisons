G knew about the trip as we invited her but I'm geussing she forgot. \nshe is mad at all of us for not just cancelling the trip and being at her wedding. \n\nall of us are not super rich so this would be a huge loss if we cancelled the trip. (so we are not) \n\nI also want to add that she invited 50 people, I asked. and only 20 can make it as she gave 1 month notice. \n\nshe is flipping her shit and acting like we should drop everything for her. \n\nAITA for not just cancelling my 2 week trip to go to her wedding? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me think through this situation. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not attending their best friend's wedding due to an existing trip to Australia.\n\nFirst, the timeline: The wedding is in one month, but the friend only sent invitations last week. That's a very short notice. Typically, save-the-dates are sent out months in advance, so the lack of one here is a problem. The author and their friends had planned a trip to Australia months ago, which starts two days before the wedding. The friend, G, knew about the trip but didn't send a save-the-date, leading to the conflict.\n\nThe author mentions that they're not wealthy, so canceling the trip would cause a significant financial loss. The friend is upset and expects them to drop everything, but the author is standing by their plan. The friend only invited 50 people, and only 20 can attend because of the short notice. This seems like poor planning on G's part.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, they had prior commitments that they planned with others. The friend's failure to send a save-the-date led to the last-minute invitation. The author isn't at fault for not changing their plans, especially since they informed G of their trip. The friend's reaction seems unreasonable given her own planning oversight.\n\nI think the key points are the lack of early communication from G and the fact that the trip was planned before the wedding date. The author isn't in the wrong because the responsibility for not sending a save-the-date lies with the friend. So the answer should be B.\n"
