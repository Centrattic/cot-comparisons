(so we are not) \n\nI also want to add that she invited 50 people, I asked. and only 20 can make it as she gave 1 month notice. \n\nshe is flipping her shit and acting like we should drop everything for her. \n\nAITA for not just cancelling my 2 week trip to go to her wedding? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not attending their best friend's wedding. The situation is that the friend sent the invitations only a month in advance, and the author had already planned a trip to Australia with friends, which is starting two days before the wedding. The trip was planned a few months earlier, and the friend was invited but maybe forgot or didn't prioritize the invitations. The author argues that the short notice and the financial implications of canceling make it impossible to attend. The friend is upset and expects them to drop everything.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the expectations in friendships. Best friends usually expect certain milestones like weddings to be attended, but the author has a valid reason in terms of prior commitments and the short notice given by the friend. The friend didn't send a save-the-date, which is a common courtesy to allow guests to plan. The author and their friends had already made plans, and changing that would be a significant sacrifice. The financial aspect is also a factor here\u2014canceling a trip to Australia after planning it for a few months would be costly for people who aren't super rich.\n\nOn the other hand, the friend might feel hurt because they considered the author their best friend and expected them to be there. Weddings are big events, and the author's absence could be seen as a slight. However, the short notice complicates things. The author did invite the friend to their trip, which shows they considered including her, but she missed the opportunity to plan around the trip.\n\nI think the key points are the lack of save-the-date, the prior commitment made by the author, and the financial reasons. The friend's responsibility to give adequate notice is important. Without a save-the-date, the author might not have been able to adjust their plans. The author isn't in the wrong because they had a pre-existing obligation that couldn't be changed without financial loss, and the friend's short notice made it impossible to accommodate. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
