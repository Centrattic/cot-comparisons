      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for not attending their best friend's wedding. The friend, G, didn't send a save-the-date and only sent invitations a month before the wedding. The author and friends had planned a trip to Australia, starting two days before the wedding, which they couldn't cancel due to financial reasons. G is upset that they didn't cancel their trip.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the norms around weddings. Typically, save-the-dates are sent out several months in advance, sometimes up to a year, so that guests can plan their schedules. G sent the invites just a month out, which is pretty short notice. The author and their friends had already planned a significant trip months ago, which they couldn't just drop without financial loss. \n\nThe key points here are the timing of the invitations and the prior commitments. Since the author had informed G about the trip and she still sent the invites too late, it's a bit on G for not being considerate enough. Also, the fact that only 20 out of 50 invited guests can make it suggests that the notice period was indeed too short. \n\nThe author isn't obligated to cancel a planned trip, especially one that's been organized with friends and involves financial commitment. It's understandable that they can't just drop everything last-minute. The author's friends are also in the same boat, which shows it's a collective decision, not just the author's. \n\nG's reaction seems disproportionate. While it's natural to be disappointed, expecting others to cancel a major trip at short notice isn't reasonable, especially when the notice wasn't given in a timely manner. The author isn't in the wrong here because they made their plans known and G didn't provide enough time to adjust. \n\nSo, the answer should be B (No, the author isn't in the wrong) because the responsibility lies with G for not giving adequate notice and not considering the guests' prior commitments.\n"
