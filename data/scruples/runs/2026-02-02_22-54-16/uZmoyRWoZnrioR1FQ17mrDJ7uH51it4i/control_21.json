G knew about the trip as we invited her but I'm geussing she forgot. \nshe is mad at all of us for not just cancelling the trip and being at her wedding. \n\nall of us are not super rich so this would be a huge loss if we cancelled the trip. (so we are not) \n\nI also want to add that she invited 50 people, I asked. and only 20 can make it as she gave 1 month notice. \n\nshe is flipping her shit and acting like we should drop everything for her. \n\nAITA for not just cancelling my 2 week trip to go to her wedding? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA scenario is in the wrong for not attending their best friend's wedding. The key points here are the timeline and notice given. The friend didn't send a save the date, so the wedding invites came in just a month before the event. The author had already planned a trip to Australia with three friends, which starts two days before the wedding. They mention that they invited the friend to the trip, and she might have forgotten about it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if the friend gave proper notice for the wedding. Save the dates are usually sent several months in advance, maybe 6-8 months before the wedding. If the friend didn't send those and just sent actual invitations a month before, that's a short notice. The author had planned the Australia trip months ago, so it's a conflict they can't easily resolve. The cost is a factor too, as they mention they're not super rich, so cancelling the trip would be a huge loss. \n\nAnother point is the number of guests invited. The friend invited 50 people, but only 20 can make it due to the short notice. That suggests maybe the friend is used to people being able to adjust, but others are struggling. The author is part of a group that tried to communicate their plans (invited the friend to the trip), but the friend didn't remember. \n\nIs the author at fault? Well, the short notice from the friend is a key issue here. If the wedding was planned without proper timelines, the friend might bear some responsibility. The author made their plans early and communicated them, but the friend didn't coordinate. The author isn't obligated to drop a long-planned and expensive trip, especially when it's a group effort. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the friendship should have prioritized the wedding. But given the circumstances, the author's decision seems reasonable. The friend's reaction of flipping out might be excessive, especially since she knew about the trip but didn't plan accordingly. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. They had a legitimate plan that couldn't be adjusted due to the short notice and financial implications. The friend's responsibility was to send proper notice. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
