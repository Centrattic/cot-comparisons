G knew about the trip as we invited her but I'm geussing she forgot. \nshe is mad at all of us for not just cancelling the trip and being at her wedding. \n\nall of us are not super rich so this would be a huge loss if we cancelled the trip. (so we are not) \n\nI also want to add that she invited 50 people, I asked. and only 20 can make it as she gave 1 month notice. \n\nshe is flipping her shit and acting like we should drop everything for her. \n\nAITA for not just cancelling my 2 week trip to go to her wedding? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. So the user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA scenario is in the wrong for not attending their best friend's wedding. Let me break down the details.\n\nFirst, the friend (G) didn't send a save-the-date, only the actual invitation a month before the wedding. The author and three friends had already planned a trip to Australia, which starts two days before the wedding. They had invited G to the trip, but she might have forgotten. The author mentions that the trip is a big financial commitment and they can't afford to cancel. G is upset and expects them to drop everything for her wedding, even though she only invited 50 people and only 20 can make it because of the short notice.\n\nHmm. The key points here are the timing of the invitation and the pre-existing plans. The author didn't know about the wedding until a month before, which is too late to adjust their trip. They had already shared their travel plans with G, so maybe she should have checked with them if they were available. But she didn't, which is on her. Also, the author is a best friend, so maybe there's an expectation of being there, but the friend didn't plan ahead. Financial constraints are a real issue, and canceling would be a huge loss. Plus, the author is pointing out that even G's own wedding isn't fully attended because of the short notice. That seems like a valid point. So the author isn't in the wrong because the friend didn't communicate properly, and they had prior commitments they can't afford to break. The answer should be B.\n"
