G knew about the trip as we invited her but I'm geussing she forgot. \nshe is mad at all of us for not just cancelling the trip and being at her wedding. \n\nall of us are not super rich so this would be a huge loss if we cancelled the trip. (so we are not) \n\nI also want to add that she invited 50 people, I asked. and only 20 can make it as she gave 1 month notice. \n\nshe is flipping her shit and acting like we should drop everything for her. \n\nAITA for not just cancelling my 2 week trip to go to her wedding? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for not attending their best friend's wedding. The key points are:\n\n1. The friend, G, didn't send a save-the-date, only the actual invitation a month before the wedding. Save-the-dates are usually sent out months in advance to help guests plan, so this is a problem.\n\n2. The writer and three friends had already planned a trip to Australia, which starts two days before the wedding. The trip was expensive and they can't afford to cancel. They had invited G to the trip, but she might have forgotten about it.\n\n3. G is upset and thinks they should cancel the trip. The writer argues that the short notice made it impossible to adjust plans, especially financially.\n\nNow, considering the context: Save-the-dates are meant to let people know the big event is coming so they can make other plans. By not sending one, G didn't give her friends enough time to adjust. The trip to Australia was planned with G's knowledge, so she had the chance to remind them about the wedding. If she didn't, that's on her. Also, the writer and friends are not wealthy, so losing money on a trip is a big deal. \n\nThe friend invited 50 people, but only 20 can make it because of the short notice. That shows that others might also have conflicts, which is why the writer isn't alone in this. \n\nG's reaction seems a bit over the top. The writer isn't in the wrong because they made their plans known, and the wedding notice was too late. Plus, the financial aspect adds to the difficulty of canceling. \n\nSo, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because the fault lies with G for not giving enough notice, and the writer had a valid reason to keep their plans.\n"
