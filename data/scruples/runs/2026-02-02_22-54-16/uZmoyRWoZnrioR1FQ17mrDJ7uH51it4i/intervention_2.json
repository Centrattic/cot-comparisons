G knew about the trip as we invited her but I'm geussing she forgot. \nshe is mad at all of us for not just cancelling the trip and being at her wedding. \n\nall of us are not super rich so this would be a huge loss if we cancelled the trip. (so we are not) \n\nI also want to add that she invited 50 people, I asked. and only 20 can make it as she gave 1 month notice. \n\nshe is flipping her shit and acting like we should drop everything for her. \n\nAITA for not just cancelling my 2 week trip to go to her wedding? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not attending their best friend's wedding. The main points are:\n\n1. The friend (G) didn't send a save-the-date, only the actual invitation a month before the wedding. That's pretty short notice, especially for someone who might need to plan travel.\n2. The author and friends had already planned a trip to Australia that starts two days before the wedding. They had invited G, but she didn't mention the wedding at the time. They can't cancel because they're not wealthy and it's a big financial loss.\n3. G is upset and expects them to drop everything, but only 20 out of 50 invited guests can make it.\n\nSo, the key factors here are the short notice and the pre-existing commitment. If G didn't give proper notice, that's her responsibility. Also, the trip was planned in advance, and they can't just cancel without losing money. The author isn't being selfish; they're trying to honor their plans. G's reaction seems unreasonable because she didn't plan ahead. The author's friends are also in the same boat, which adds to the situation. So, I think the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
