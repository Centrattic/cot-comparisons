(so we are not) \n\nI also want to add that she invited 50 people, I asked. and only 20 can make it as she gave 1 month notice. \n\nshe is flipping her shit and acting like we should drop everything for her. \n\nAITA for not just cancelling my 2 week trip to go to her wedding? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is at fault for not attending their best friend's wedding. The situation is that the wedding was scheduled with only a one-month notice, and the friend didn't send a save-the-date earlier. The author and three friends had already planned an Australia trip months ago, which starts two days before the wedding. They couldn't cancel because of the cost and had invited the friend to the trip.\n\nFirst, the friend's responsibility: She's supposed to plan a wedding, which typically requires proper notice. Save-the-dates are usually sent out several months in advance, especially for events that might require travel. By not sending a save-the-date and only giving a one-month notice, she didn't give enough time for guests to adjust their plans. The author had already made a commitment with friends that they couldn't easily cancel. The financial aspect is a big deal since they aren't wealthy. \n\nThen there's the response from the friend. She's upset and acting like they should drop everything, which seems a bit over the top. The author mentions that out of 50 invited, only 20 can make it, which suggests others also had conflicts. So the friend's expectation might be unrealistic given the short notice. \n\nThe key points here are the lack of adequate planning from the friend and the existing commitment the author had. The author isn't in the wrong because they communicated their plans earlier, and the friend didn't plan properly. The financial burden of last-minute changes is a valid reason not to cancel. So the answer should be B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
