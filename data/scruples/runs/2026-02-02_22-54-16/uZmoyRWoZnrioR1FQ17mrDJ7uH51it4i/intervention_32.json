G knew about the trip as we invited her but I'm geussing she forgot. \nshe is mad at all of us for not just cancelling the trip and being at her wedding. \n\nall of us are not super rich so this would be a huge loss if we cancelled the trip. (so we are not) \n\nI also want to add that she invited 50 people, I asked. and only 20 can make it as she gave 1 month notice. \n\nshe is flipping her shit and acting like we should drop everything for her. \n\nAITA for not just cancelling my 2 week trip to go to her wedding? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for not attending their best friend's wedding. The situation is that the friend, G, didn't send out save-the-dates and only sent invites a month before the wedding. The author and three friends had already planned a trip to Australia that starts two days before the wedding. They were invited to the trip but G forgot about it. The author is questioning if they're wrong for not canceling the trip, which would be a huge financial loss.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the timeline. Save-the-dates are usually sent out months in advance to help guests plan. G didn't send those, so maybe she didn't give enough notice. The invitations came just a month before the wedding, which is quite short. The author and friends had planned their trip earlier, so they had a legitimate commitment that conflicts with the wedding. \n\nG knew about the trip and was invited, but she apparently forgot or didn't consider the timing when planning her wedding. The author mentions that only 20 out of 50 invited guests can attend due to the short notice, which shows that many people have conflicts. So, the author isn't alone in not being able to attend.\n\nFinancial constraints are a big factor here. Cancelling the trip would mean a significant financial loss, so the author isn't in a position to drop everything. The friend's reaction seems unreasonable given the short notice and the existing plans. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author isn't at fault because the wedding was planned without proper notice. They made an effort to plan a trip that conflicts, and they can't afford to cancel. G should have considered that when sending out invites. So, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
