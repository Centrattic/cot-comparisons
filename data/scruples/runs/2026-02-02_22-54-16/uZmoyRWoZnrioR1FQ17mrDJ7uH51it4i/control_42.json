      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author's best friend, G, is getting married, but the wedding was announced with only a month's notice. The author and three friends had already planned a trip to Australia that starts two days before the wedding. They can't cancel because they're not super rich, and it would be a huge financial loss. The friend is upset and thinks they should drop everything for her wedding.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the friend's perspective. She's the one getting married, so she might feel that her close friends would make an effort to attend. But she sent out invitations with very short notice\u2014save the dates weren't sent out, and the actual invites came last week for a month later. That's pretty short notice, even for a wedding. Normally, save the dates are sent out like 6-8 months in advance, and formal invitations a few months before. So G's timing is definitely questionable here. If she didn't send save the dates, she probably should have sent invitations earlier. \n\nThe author mentions that they had invited G to the Australia trip and she knew about it. So G was aware that they had plans. If she had sent a save the date earlier, maybe they could have adjusted their schedule. But she didn't. Now, the trip is already planned, and they can't afford to cancel. That seems like a big commitment they've made, and they can't just drop it without financial loss. \n\nOn the other hand, G is upset because the author and friends are not attending. But given the short notice, maybe the author isn't at fault here. The friend could have planned better. The author is trying to attend a significant trip with friends, which is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, especially if they're not rich. Financial loss is a real factor here. \n\nAlso, the author points out that G invited 50 people, but only 20 can make it. So maybe the wedding isn't as big an event as G thinks, and others aren't able to come either. If the author had known that the wedding was going to be a big deal, they might have planned differently. \n\nSo, putting it all together: the friend is at fault for not giving proper notice, the author had already informed the friend about their plans, and the financial loss of canceling is a legitimate reason to not attend. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
