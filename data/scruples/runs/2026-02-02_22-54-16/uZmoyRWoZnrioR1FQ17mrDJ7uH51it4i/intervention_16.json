G knew about the trip as we invited her but I'm geussing she forgot. \nshe is mad at all of us for not just cancelling the trip and being at her wedding. \n\nall of us are not super rich so this would be a huge loss if we cancelled the trip. (so we are not) \n\nI also want to add that she invited 50 people, I asked. and only 20 can make it as she gave 1 month notice. \n\nshe is flipping her shit and acting like we should drop everything for her. \n\nAITA for not just cancelling my 2 week trip to go to her wedding? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is at fault for not attending their best friend's wedding. The main points are:\n\n1. The best friend (G) didn't send save-the-dates, only the actual invitations a month before the wedding. The ranch venue is mentioned as nice, but the short notice is key here.\n\n2. The author and three friends had planned a trip to Australia that starts two days before the wedding. They couldn't cancel because it's a big financial hit for them. G knew about the trip but apparently forgot or didn't plan accordingly.\n\n3. G is upset and feels they should drop everything to attend. The author notes that 50 were invited, but only 20 can make it due to the short notice.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for not cancelling the trip. \n\nFirst, the short notice is definitely on G. Save-the-dates are typically sent out months in advance to avoid such conflicts. Without that, guests might have scheduling conflicts they can't adjust. The author and friends had already planned something and couldn't change because of financial reasons. That's a valid reason not to cancel. Also, if G invited 50 people but only expects 20, maybe she's used to people not being able to attend, so the author's situation isn't unique. \n\nHowever, close friends might expect more flexibility. But the author tried inviting G to the trip, which shows consideration, but G still scheduled the wedding too close. The author can't be blamed for G's oversight. Plus, the trip is already planned and costly to cancel. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because the responsibility for the short notice is on G. The author made a decision based on prior commitments and financial constraints, which are reasonable. So the answer should be B.\n"
