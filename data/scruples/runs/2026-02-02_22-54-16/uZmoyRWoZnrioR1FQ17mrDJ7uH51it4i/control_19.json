      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author's best friend, G, is getting married, but she didn't send out save-the-dates. The author and three friends had planned a trip to Australia that starts two days before the wedding, and they can't change it. The friends are upset because they think the author should have canceled the trip to attend the wedding. The author is asking if they're the asshole (AITA) for not doing that.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the standard practices around weddings. Typically, save-the-dates are sent out several months in advance, sometimes up to a year, so that guests can make plans. The actual invitations usually come closer to the date. In this case, G sent the invitations just a month before the wedding, which is a bit short notice. That's a red flag because it's not giving guests enough time to adjust their schedules, especially for those who might have pre-planned events.\n\nNow, the author and their friends had already planned a trip months ago and invited G to it. G didn't remember or forgot about their trip when she sent the invitations. The author is now in a tough spot because the trip is already booked, and canceling would be costly. They can't afford the loss, so they're not going to the wedding. \n\nOn one hand, the author's best friend is upset because she expected them to drop everything for the wedding. But on the other hand, the author had prior commitments that were planned with G's knowledge. Also, the short notice from G is a significant factor here. If G had sent a save-the-date earlier, the author could have adjusted the trip or communicated that they couldn't attend. But since G didn't, it's not entirely the author's fault.\n\nAnother point is the number of guests invited. G invited 50 people, but only 20 can make it because of the short notice. That suggests that maybe G didn't consider the logistical challenges for her guests. If the wedding is at her grandmother's ranch, it's possible that some guests might have to travel, which adds to the difficulty.\n\nThe author's stance is that they can't just cancel a planned and expensive trip for a wedding that was scheduled with insufficient notice. They're prioritizing their own commitments, which they had made with G's knowledge. While it's understandable that G is upset, the author isn't entirely at fault here because the problem was on G's side for not sending the save-the-date in time. \n\nHowever, maybe the author could have communicated more if they realized the date conflict earlier. But given that the invitation came only a month before, there wasn't enough time to adjust. The friends who planned the trip might have expected a save-the-date to know about the wedding date earlier. Since G didn't send that, the author couldn't make other arrangements.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. The main issue is G's failure to send save-the-dates, which led to the conflict. The author had already planned the trip and couldn't afford to cancel. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
