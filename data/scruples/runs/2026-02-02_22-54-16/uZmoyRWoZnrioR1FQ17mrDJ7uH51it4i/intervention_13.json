G knew about the trip as we invited her but I'm geussing she forgot. \nshe is mad at all of us for not just cancelling the trip and being at her wedding. \n\nall of us are not super rich so this would be a huge loss if we cancelled the trip. (so we are not) \n\nI also want to add that she invited 50 people, I asked. and only 20 can make it as she gave 1 month notice. \n\nshe is flipping her shit and acting like we should drop everything for her. \n\nAITA for not just cancelling my 2 week trip to go to her wedding? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is at fault for not attending their best friend's wedding. The key points are:\n\n1. The friend (G) didn't send a save-the-date, only the actual invitation a month before the wedding. That's pretty short notice, especially for international travel. Usually, save-the-dates are sent out months in advance so people can plan.\n\n2. The author and friends had already planned a trip to Australia that starts two days before the wedding. They had invited G to the trip, but she didn't remember and scheduled the wedding around that? Or maybe she forgot about their plans when sending the invites. The timing conflict is real here.\n\n3. The author mentions that G invited 50 people but only 20 can attend because of the short notice. That suggests G might have overestimated attendance, which could be her mistake. Also, the author and friends can't afford to cancel the Australia trip, so financially, it's a big hit for them. That's a valid concern.\n\n4. G is upset and acting like they should drop everything. The author is standing their ground, thinking they're not wrong because the notice was too short and the trip was already planned with their knowledge.\n\nFrom a fairness perspective, the author isn't in the wrong. G didn't give proper notice, and the trip was already planned. The friends had no control over G's scheduling. It's not reasonable to expect them to cancel a significant trip that they've saved for, especially when the wedding was announced so late. The fact that G invited a lot of people but expects everyone to adjust their lives shows a lack of consideration on her part. The author's position seems justified here. So the answer should be B.\n"
