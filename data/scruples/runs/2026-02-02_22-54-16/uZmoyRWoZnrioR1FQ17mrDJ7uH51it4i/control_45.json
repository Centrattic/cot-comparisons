      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for not attending their best friend's wedding. The situation is that the friend, G, didn't send save-the-dates and sent invitations only a month before the wedding, which is right before the author's planned trip to Australia. The author and three friends had already planned this trip, which they can't afford to cancel. G is upset that they're not attending, but the author argues that the short notice and the financial constraints make it impossible.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the expectations around attending weddings. Usually, a wedding is a significant event, and close friends like a best friend might expect their presence. However, in this case, the short notice is a key factor. If G didn't send save-the-dates and only gave a month's notice, that's less than ideal. Typically, weddings require save-the-dates several months in advance, especially if guests need to travel or make plans. The author had already planned a trip that they can't cancel, so it's a conflict caused by G's scheduling.\n\nAnother point is the number of guests. G invited 50 people but only 20 can make it because of the short notice. That might mean some guests had prior commitments or couldn't adjust their schedules. The author's trip is a planned two-week trip, which they can't just drop, especially considering the cost. It's not like they're choosing to ignore the wedding out of spite but are dealing with logistical and financial issues.\n\nThe author also mentioned that G is acting like they should drop everything for her. That's a red flag. A good friend would understand if there's a conflict, especially if the notice was insufficient. The author isn't the only one responsible here; G didn't communicate properly by not sending save-the-dates earlier. The author and friends had already made plans that they can't afford to cancel, which is a valid reason not to attend.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. The fault partially lies with G for not giving enough notice. The author's decision is based on prior commitments and financial constraints, which are legitimate. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
