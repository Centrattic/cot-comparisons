G knew about the trip as we invited her but I'm geussing she forgot. \nshe is mad at all of us for not just cancelling the trip and being at her wedding. \n\nall of us are not super rich so this would be a huge loss if we cancelled the trip. (so we are not) \n\nI also want to add that she invited 50 people, I asked. and only 20 can make it as she gave 1 month notice. \n\nshe is flipping her shit and acting like we should drop everything for her. \n\nAITA for not just cancelling my 2 week trip to go to her wedding? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not attending their best friend's wedding. The key points here are the timeline of events and the reasons given for not attending.\n\nFirst, the friend G didn't send save-the-dates and only sent invitations a month before the wedding. The author and three friends had already planned a trip to Australia, which starts two days before the wedding. They had invited G to the trip, but she might have forgotten about it when planning the wedding. Now, G is upset that they didn't cancel their trip to attend the wedding.\n\nThe author's arguments are that they can't just cancel a planned trip, especially since they're not wealthy, and that G only invited 50 people, with only 20 expected due to the short notice. The user wants to know if they're at fault.\n\nFrom what I know about social norms, save-the-dates are usually sent several months in advance to allow guests to plan. Since G didn't send one, she might have contributed to the situation. The trip was planned in advance, and the author had already invited G to join, so there's some reciprocity here. Plus, the financial aspect is a real consideration\u2014cancelling a trip could be a big loss.\n\nOn the other hand, weddings are typically a big deal, especially for close friends. But the short notice complicates things. The author isn't refusing to attend out of spite; it's because of prior commitments they can't easily change. Also, only 20 out of 50 are attending, which might mean G should have anticipated that some people might have conflicts.\n\nI think the main point is that G's failure to send a save-the-date led to this conflict. The author isn't in the wrong because they made the trip in good faith and had already discussed it with G. The answer should be B.\n"
