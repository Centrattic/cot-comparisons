      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is wrong for not attending their best friend's wedding. The key points from the situation are:\n\n1. The best friend, G, didn't send save-the-dates and only sent invitations a month before the wedding.\n2. The author and three friends had planned a trip to Australia that starts two days before the wedding. They had invited G to the trip, but she might have forgotten about it.\n3. The trip is a significant financial commitment, and they can't afford to cancel.\n4. The wedding is at G's grandmother's ranch, and she invited 50 people, but only 20 can attend due to the short notice.\n\nFirst, the author's responsibility. Best friends usually expect each other to be there for major events like weddings. However, the timing here is crucial. If G didn't send save-the-dates and only gave a month's notice, that's her oversight. The author had planned the trip months in advance and had invited G, which shows they were trying to be considerate. The trip starts two days before the wedding, so even if they tried to adjust, they might not make it on time. Plus, the financial aspect is a big factor\u2014they can't just drop everything and lose money on a trip.\n\nOn the other hand, G is upset because she expected the author to prioritize her wedding. But with the short notice, it's understandable that the author couldn't rearrange their plans. The fact that only 20 out of 50 invited guests can attend shows that the short notice affected others too. The author isn't the only one in that situation. \n\nSo, considering both sides, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. G's failure to send save-the-dates and the short notice contributed to the problem. The author made their plans in good faith, and the trip is a significant investment. They can't be blamed for not cancelling when the wedding was announced so late. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
