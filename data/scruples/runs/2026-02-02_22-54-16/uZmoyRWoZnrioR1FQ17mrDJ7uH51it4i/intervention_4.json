      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person in the given situation is at fault for not attending their best friend's wedding. The context is that the friend didn't send out save the dates and only sent invitations a month before the wedding. The author had planned a trip to Australia with three friends, which starts two days before the wedding, and they can't change it. The author's friend is upset because she invited 50 people, and only 20 are coming due to the short notice.\n\nHmm, so the main points here are the timing of the invitation, the pre-planned trip, and the friend's reaction. The author mentions that they invited the friend to the trip, but she might have forgotten. The friend is now angry and expects them to cancel the trip. \n\nFirst, the short notice is a key factor. Typically, save the dates are sent out months in advance, especially for events that require travel. By only giving a month's notice, the friend (G) may have made it difficult for people to adjust their plans. If the author had a non-refundable or expensive trip already booked, that's a significant commitment. Cancelling last minute could lead to financial loss, which they can't afford. \n\nAlso, the friend is inviting 50 people but only 20 can make it. That suggests that maybe the event isn't as big as she expected. If she had sent out save the dates earlier, more people might be able to attend. The fact that she's upset about only 20 people coming when she invited 50 shows that she might not have considered the logistics properly. \n\nThe author is saying they're not in the wrong because they had a trip planned and the friend was aware. The friend's anger seems misplaced here. However, maybe the author could have done something to make amends, like sending a gift or a video message. But the question is about being in the wrong for not attending. \n\nIn relationships, especially with close friends, it's important to communicate. The author did invite G to their trip, which is a responsible step. G's forgetfulness isn't the author's fault. The author is making a choice based on their own commitments and financial constraints, which are valid. \n\nSo, considering all factors, the author isn't in the wrong. The responsibility lies more on G for not providing enough notice. The answer should be B.\n"
