      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not attending their best friend's wedding. The situation is that the friend sent the invitations just a month before the wedding, which is pretty short notice. The author and their friends had a trip to Australia planned for two weeks, starting two days before the wedding. They couldn't cancel because it's a big financial hit. The friend is upset and acting like they should drop everything.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the norms around weddings. Traditionally, people expect a save-the-date and then invitations a few months in advance. The friend didn't send a save-the-date, so maybe that's on her. If she had given more notice, the author might have been able to adjust their plans. The author did invite her to the trip, so she was aware of the plans. But maybe she still expected them to attend regardless.\n\nThe author's friends also can't afford to cancel. The trip is a significant expense, so losing that would be a big deal. The friend is inviting 50 people but only 20 can make it, which shows that maybe others also have conflicts or couldn't get time off. So the author isn't alone in not being able to attend.\n\nIs it reasonable to expect friends to cancel a planned trip? That's a big ask. The trip was planned with three friends, so it's a group commitment. The author is trying to balance their commitment to their friend versus their own plans and financial situation. The friend's reaction seems excessive, given the short notice and the financial constraints.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They tried to inform the friend about the trip, but the friend didn't plan properly. The author's responsibility to attend might not outweigh their own commitments and financial limitations. The answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
