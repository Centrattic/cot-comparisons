      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for not attending their best friend's wedding. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the friend (G) didn't send save-the-dates and only sent invitations a month before the wedding. That's pretty short notice. The author and three friends had already planned a trip to Australia that starts two days before the wedding. They had invited G to the trip, and she might have forgotten because of that. The author mentions that G is getting angry and expects them to cancel the trip, which would be a big financial loss for everyone involved. Also, G is inviting 50 people, but only 20 can make it because of the short notice. The author is frustrated because G seems to think they should drop everything for her.\n\nSo, who's at fault here? Well, the key points are the short notice from G and the pre-existing commitment the author and friends have. If someone doesn't send save-the-dates and only gives a month's notice, that's on them. The travelers had planned the trip before the wedding date, which makes sense. They can't just cancel now, especially since it's a significant financial hit. Friends are supposed to respect each other's plans, especially if they've been communicated. G invited the author to the trip, so maybe she knew about it and still scheduled the wedding without considering. \n\nOn the other hand, weddings are important events, and maybe the author should have made an effort. But given the circumstances\u2014short notice and existing plans\u2014it's understandable they can't just drop everything. The fact that G is inviting a lot of people but expects others to rearrange their lives is a bit hypocritical. \n\nSo, the author isn't wrong for sticking to their plans, especially since they communicated the trip earlier. The responsibility here might lie more with G for not planning properly. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author isn't in the wrong).\n"
