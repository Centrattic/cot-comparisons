      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story (the author) is in the wrong for not attending their best friend's wedding.\n\nFirst, the main points: The author's best friend, G, didn't send out save-the-dates and only mailed invitations a month before the wedding. The author and three friends had already planned a trip to Australia, which starts two days before the wedding. They had invited G to the trip, but she either forgot or didn't consider that when she scheduled the wedding. Now, G is upset and expects them to cancel their trip and attend.\n\nThe author argues that the trip is expensive, especially since they aren't wealthy, and that G's short notice (only a month) meant many people couldn't come. They're being asked if they're at fault for not canceling the trip.\n\nI need to consider both sides. On one hand, weddings are significant events, and close friends usually expect to be informed early. G didn't send a save-the-date, which is a common courtesy. The author had planned the trip months in advance and had included G, implying they wanted her to be part of the planning. If G forgot, maybe the onus is on her for poor communication.\n\nOn the other hand, friendships involve mutual support. If G is upset, the author might feel pressure to attend. However, the trip was planned with others and is a financial burden. The author's right to prioritize their plans, especially if they were communicated earlier, could be valid.\n\nAlso, the fact that G invited 50 people but only 20 can make it in a month suggests logistical issues. The author's decision not to attend might not be entirely their fault if the notice was too short. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often looks at who had the opportunity to act. The author had informed G about the trip, so G should have known the dates and adjusted accordingly. The author isn't necessarily wrong in not canceling, especially with financial constraints. \n\nSo, the answer would be B\u2014No, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
