      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for not attending their best friend's wedding. The situation is that the friend, G, didn't send a save-the-date and only sent the actual invitations a month before the wedding. The author and three friends had already planned a trip to Australia, which starts two days before the wedding, so they can't attend. G is upset and acting like they should cancel the trip, but the trip is a big financial commitment.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the timeline. The author mentions that G didn't send a save-the-date, which is typically done several months in advance. Instead, they only got the formal invitations a week before the wedding, which is only a month before the event. That's a very short notice, especially for someone who might be planning international travel. The author and friends had already made their Australia trip plans before the wedding date was set, and they had even invited G to join them, but she might have forgotten.\n\nNow, the author is being blamed by G for not canceling the trip. The key points here are the lack of proper notice and the financial aspect. The trip is a significant expense, and canceling would mean a huge loss. Also, G only invited 50 people, and only 20 can attend because of the short notice. That suggests that maybe G didn't prioritize giving enough time for guests to make plans.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is a close friend, and weddings are important events. But the fault here might lie with G for not sending a save-the-date. Save-the-dates are meant to help guests plan their schedules and finances. By not sending one, G contributed to the problem. The author had no way of knowing the wedding date until a month in advance, which is too late for an international trip.\n\nThe friends had already made alternative plans, and they can't just cancel without significant financial loss. The author is trying to explain that they can't just drop everything, especially since G's planning was disorganized. The fact that G is upset and acting entitled might indicate that she's not considering the efforts and constraints of her friends.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong because the responsibility for proper planning and communication lies with the host, G. The author did invite her to the trip and had no way to adjust their plans in time. Therefore, the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
