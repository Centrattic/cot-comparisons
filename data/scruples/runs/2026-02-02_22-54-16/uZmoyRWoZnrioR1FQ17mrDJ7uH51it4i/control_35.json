G knew about the trip as we invited her but I'm geussing she forgot. \nshe is mad at all of us for not just cancelling the trip and being at her wedding. \n\nall of us are not super rich so this would be a huge loss if we cancelled the trip. (so we are not) \n\nI also want to add that she invited 50 people, I asked. and only 20 can make it as she gave 1 month notice. \n\nshe is flipping her shit and acting like we should drop everything for her. \n\nAITA for not just cancelling my 2 week trip to go to her wedding? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for not attending their best friend's wedding.\n\nFirst, the facts: The friend, G, didn't send save-the-dates and only sent invitations a month before the wedding. The person and their friends had already planned a trip to Australia that starts two days before the wedding. They couldn't cancel because it's a big financial loss. G is upset and expects them to drop everything.\n\nSo, was the writer wrong? Well, G didn't give much notice. A month is pretty short for a wedding, especially if you're expecting people to travel. The writer and friends had planned the trip months ago and invited G, who presumably forgot or didn't consider the timing. The writer isn't at fault for not being able to cancel last minute, especially with the financial aspect. Also, G invited 50 people but only 20 can make it, which shows maybe she didn't plan well. The writer's reasoning seems valid. The answer should be B.\n"
