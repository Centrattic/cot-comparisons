G knew about the trip as we invited her but I'm geussing she forgot. \nshe is mad at all of us for not just cancelling the trip and being at her wedding. \n\nall of us are not super rich so this would be a huge loss if we cancelled the trip. (so we are not) \n\nI also want to add that she invited 50 people, I asked. and only 20 can make it as she gave 1 month notice. \n\nshe is flipping her shit and acting like we should drop everything for her. \n\nAITA for not just cancelling my 2 week trip to go to her wedding? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is wrong for not attending their best friend's wedding. The main points here are the timing of the invitations and the existing trip.\n\nFirst, the wedding invitations came a month before the event, and there were no save-the-dates. The author and friends had already planned an Australia trip that starts two days before the wedding. They mention that all four friends aren't super rich, so canceling the trip would be a huge financial loss. The friend G is upset and wants them to drop everything, but she only invited 50 people and only 20 can make it because of the short notice.\n\nI need to consider if the author is in the wrong. On one hand, the author was invited to plan the trip with friends, and G knew about it but still sent the invitations too late. The author is in a bind because they can't afford to cancel. On the other hand, the wedding is a significant event, and the author is a best friend, so maybe there's an expectation to attend. But the short notice and the financial impact are factors. Also, G invited a lot of people, and only a fraction can attend, which might mean she's aware of the challenges. \n\nSave-the-dates are typically sent months in advance, so not sending them was a misstep. The author's friends had prior commitments, which they informed G about. It's possible G forgot or didn't realize the trip was planned. The author's decision to prioritize the trip isn't necessarily wrong because they were informed late and can't afford to cancel. So, the answer might be B (No).\n"
