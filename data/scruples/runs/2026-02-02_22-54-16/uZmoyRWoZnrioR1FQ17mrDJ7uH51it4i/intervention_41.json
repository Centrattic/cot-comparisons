G knew about the trip as we invited her but I'm geussing she forgot. \nshe is mad at all of us for not just cancelling the trip and being at her wedding. \n\nall of us are not super rich so this would be a huge loss if we cancelled the trip. (so we are not) \n\nI also want to add that she invited 50 people, I asked. and only 20 can make it as she gave 1 month notice. \n\nshe is flipping her shit and acting like we should drop everything for her. \n\nAITA for not just cancelling my 2 week trip to go to her wedding? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person in the AITA scenario is in the wrong for not attending their best friend's wedding. Let me consider all the factors.\n\nFirst, the friend (G) didn't send a save-the-date and only sent the actual invitation a month before the wedding. That's a pretty short notice, especially for a wedding that's supposed to be a big event. The author and friends had planned a trip to Australia months ago, which they had already invited G to. Now, G is upset they can't cancel the trip because of the short notice. \n\nThe author mentions that the trip is financially significant\u2014since they're not super rich, canceling would be a big hit. Plus, G is inviting 50 people but only 20 can attend because of the one-month notice. So, G's expectations might be unrealistic given the timing.\n\nI think the key points here are the lack of early communication from G and the fact that the trip was already planned before the wedding details were set. The author isn't being inconsiderate; they had prior commitments that were made with the knowledge that G was planning a wedding, but without proper timing. G's anger seems to stem from not providing enough notice, not the author's lack of willingness to attend. \n\nAlso, it's mentioned that the author is happy for G's marriage, which shows they have good intentions. The friends involved are in a similar situation, and the cost is a factor, which adds to the justification of not canceling. \n\nSo, I don't see the author as being in the wrong here. The responsibility lies more on G for not managing the timeline properly.\n"
