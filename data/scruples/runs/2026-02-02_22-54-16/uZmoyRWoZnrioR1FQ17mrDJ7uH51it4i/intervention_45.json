G knew about the trip as we invited her but I'm geussing she forgot. \nshe is mad at all of us for not just cancelling the trip and being at her wedding. \n\nall of us are not super rich so this would be a huge loss if we cancelled the trip. (so we are not) \n\nI also want to add that she invited 50 people, I asked. and only 20 can make it as she gave 1 month notice. \n\nshe is flipping her shit and acting like we should drop everything for her. \n\nAITA for not just cancelling my 2 week trip to go to her wedding? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is at fault for not attending their best friend's wedding. The main points are:\n\n1. The friend (G) didn't send a save-the-date and only sent the actual invitation a week before the wedding, giving a month's notice. That's pretty short, but maybe not super short? Usually, save-the-dates are sent out 6-8 months in advance, and invitations 4-6 months. So if the wedding is in a month and the invites came a week before, that's only a month notice. That's on the short side, but not unheard of, especially for a smaller wedding.\n\n2. The author and three friends had planned an Australia trip for two weeks, which starts two days before the wedding. They couldn't reschedule. They told G about the trip, but she forgot or didn't consider it. Now she's upset and wants them to cancel the trip. The author is defending their decision because the trip is expensive and they can't afford to cancel. Also, the wedding has a low attendance rate with 50 invited and only 20 coming.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider the factors. The author had a prior commitment that was planned in advance and informed the friend about it. The friend didn't send a save-the-date, which is the norm, so maybe she didn't expect people to make long-term plans. However, the author did tell her about the trip, so maybe the friend should have checked the date earlier. The author is not in the wrong because they made the friend aware of their plans, the wedding notice was short, and the trip is a significant financial commitment they can't just drop. The friend's reaction seems excessive. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
