G knew about the trip as we invited her but I'm geussing she forgot. \nshe is mad at all of us for not just cancelling the trip and being at her wedding. \n\nall of us are not super rich so this would be a huge loss if we cancelled the trip. (so we are not) \n\nI also want to add that she invited 50 people, I asked. and only 20 can make it as she gave 1 month notice. \n\nshe is flipping her shit and acting like we should drop everything for her. \n\nAITA for not just cancelling my 2 week trip to go to her wedding? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The main question is whether the author is at fault for not attending their best friend's wedding. The user thinks the author isn't wrong, but they want my opinion.\n\nFirst, looking at the facts: The friend (G) didn't send save-the-dates and only sent actual invitations a month before the wedding. The author and friends had planned a trip to Australia, which was scheduled to start two days before the wedding. They had invited G to the trip, but she either forgot or didn't prioritize the wedding date. The author mentions that G is upset and acting like they should cancel their trip, but the trip is a big expense and they can't afford to lose that.\n\nNow, considering etiquette. Typically, weddings are major events, and guests are expected to make an effort to attend, especially close friends. However, the friend didn't give proper notice. Save-the-dates are usually sent out several months in advance, and actual invitations a couple of months before. Here, G sent the invitations just a month before, which is shorter than the standard. The author had already planned a trip, which started two days after the wedding. If the trip was planned before the wedding date, and G knew about it, maybe she should have adjusted her plans. Also, if they had invited G to the trip, she might be aware of their commitment.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that canceling the trip would be a huge financial loss, and since only 20 out of 50 invited guests can make it, maybe the trip planning was a priority. The friend's reaction seems unreasonable because she didn't give enough notice and is now expecting last-minute changes.\n\nBut wait, is the author's responsibility to check the dates? If they knew about the trip when G planned the wedding, maybe they should have communicated better. But the user says they invited G to the trip, so G had the chance to mention the wedding before the trip was set. If G didn't, then it's on her.\n\nAlso, the fact that only a third of the guests can attend due to the short notice shows that the wedding planning was disorganized. The author isn't the one who messed up the timing. They had a prior commitment that they made, and it's not feasible to cancel. \n\nIn terms of being a best friend, perhaps there's an expectation to attend, but if the wedding was poorly planned by G, the author isn't at fault. The key points are the lack of save-the-date, the short notice, and the prior commitment with financial implications. The author isn't in the wrong here. So the answer should be B.\n"
