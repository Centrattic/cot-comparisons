      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for not attending their best friend's wedding. The key points here are the timing of the invitation, the prior commitment, and the friend's reaction.\n\nFirst, the friend (G) didn't send out save-the-date notices, so the invitations came a month before the wedding. The author and three friends had already planned a trip to Australia that starts two days before the wedding. They invited G to the trip, but it seems she forgot or didn't consider the timing. Now, G is upset and expects them to cancel their trip and attend the wedding, even though she gave only a month's notice and only 20 out of 50 invitees can make it.\n\nThe author's defense is that canceling the trip would be a huge financial loss, and they're not super rich. They also mention that G is overreacting by expecting everyone to drop their plans. The main issue here is whether the author is obligated to cancel their trip despite the short notice from the friend.\n\nIn terms of social norms, save-the-date notices are important because they give guests time to plan. Not sending one and then getting upset when people can't attend because of prior commitments might be seen as unreasonable. The author had a pre-existing plan that they had already arranged, and the friend's lack of proper notice contributed to the conflict. The fact that only a third of the invitees can attend also suggests that the short notice is a problem on G's part. The author isn't in the wrong here because they had a valid reason for not attending, and the friend's responsibility to communicate properly isn't being met. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
