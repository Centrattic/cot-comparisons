      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not attending their best friend's wedding. Let's break down the details.\n\nFirst, the friend (G) didn't send save-the-dates and only sent invitations a month before the wedding. The author and three friends had planned a trip to Australia that starts two days before the wedding. They had invited G to the trip, but she forgot about it. The author is now being criticized by G for not canceling the trip. The author mentions that the trip is expensive, so canceling would be a big loss. Also, G invited 50 people, but only 20 can make it due to the short notice.\n\nSo, the main points are: G gave short notice, the trip was planned in advance and involves money, and the author had already informed G about the trip. The author is being accused of not prioritizing the wedding, but G's lack of planning seems to be a factor here. \n\nIs the author at fault? Well, friends usually expect some level of presence at big events like weddings, but if the planning was done responsibly and the friend didn't communicate properly, maybe the fault isn't entirely on the author. The author tried to include G in their plans and had to make a choice based on financial constraints. G's reaction seems harsh given her own role in the short notice. So I think the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong here.\n"
