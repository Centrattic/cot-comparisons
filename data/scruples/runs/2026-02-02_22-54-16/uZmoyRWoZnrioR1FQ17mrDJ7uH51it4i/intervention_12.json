G knew about the trip as we invited her but I'm geussing she forgot. \nshe is mad at all of us for not just cancelling the trip and being at her wedding. \n\nall of us are not super rich so this would be a huge loss if we cancelled the trip. (so we are not) \n\nI also want to add that she invited 50 people, I asked. and only 20 can make it as she gave 1 month notice. \n\nshe is flipping her shit and acting like we should drop everything for her. \n\nAITA for not just cancelling my 2 week trip to go to her wedding? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the person in the AITA scenario) is in the wrong for not attending their best friend's wedding. The key points here are the timeline of events and the financial implications.\n\nFirst, the friend G didn't send a save-the-date, only the actual invitations a month before the wedding. That's pretty short notice, especially for something as important as a wedding. Usually, save-the-dates are sent out several months in advance to allow guests to make travel plans. The author and their friends had already planned a trip to Australia, which starts two days before the wedding. They couldn't just cancel because it's a big financial hit for them. \n\nThe user's reasoning is that the author isn't in the wrong, and I agree. G, as the wedding planner, should have given more notice. Also, the author had informed G about the trip, so it's possible G forgot or didn't prioritize the dates properly. The fact that only 20 out of 50 invited guests can make it in a month suggests that the short notice affected attendance, which isn't ideal but not uncommon. \n\nThe main issue here is the lack of communication from G's side. The author and friends made plans in good faith, and it's unreasonable to expect them to drop everything, especially with financial commitments. So, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
