G knew about the trip as we invited her but I'm geussing she forgot. \nshe is mad at all of us for not just cancelling the trip and being at her wedding. \n\nall of us are not super rich so this would be a huge loss if we cancelled the trip. (so we are not) \n\nI also want to add that she invited 50 people, I asked. and only 20 can make it as she gave 1 month notice. \n\nshe is flipping her shit and acting like we should drop everything for her. \n\nAITA for not just cancelling my 2 week trip to go to her wedding? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not attending their best friend's wedding. The main points are that the friend didn't send a save-the-date, only an invitation a month before the wedding. The author had a planned trip to Australia that conflicts, which they had invited the friend to, but she forgot. The friend is upset and thinks they should drop everything.\n\nFirst, the author didn't know about the wedding until a month before, so they couldn't adjust plans. That's a short notice. Also, the trip was planned in advance with others, and it's a big financial commitment they can't afford to cancel. The friend invited 50 people, but only 20 can make it, implying maybe the notice was too short for many to adjust.\n\nIs the author wrong? Well, the friend didn't give proper notice. Save-the-dates are usually sent out months ahead so guests can plan. By not sending one, the friend might have contributed to the problem. The author had a pre-existing commitment they were invited to, so the friend might have been aware but still didn't adjust the date. The author's trip is a significant financial loss, which adds to the difficulty.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong because the friend didn't give enough notice, and the trip was planned before the wedding was set. The answer should be B.\n"
