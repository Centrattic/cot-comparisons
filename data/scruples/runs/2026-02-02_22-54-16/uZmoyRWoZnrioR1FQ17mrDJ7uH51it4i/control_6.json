G knew about the trip as we invited her but I'm geussing she forgot. \nshe is mad at all of us for not just cancelling the trip and being at her wedding. \n\nall of us are not super rich so this would be a huge loss if we cancelled the trip. (so we are not) \n\nI also want to add that she invited 50 people, I asked. and only 20 can make it as she gave 1 month notice. \n\nshe is flipping her shit and acting like we should drop everything for her. \n\nAITA for not just cancelling my 2 week trip to go to her wedding? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for not attending their best friend's wedding. The friend didn't send out save-the-dates and only sent invitations a month before the wedding, which is right when the writer and their friends had planned a trip to Australia. The trip starts two days before the wedding, so attending the wedding would require canceling the trip. The writer mentions that the friend is upset and acting like they should drop everything for her. \n\nFirst, the writer was invited to the trip and knew about it, but didn't send a save-the-date. That's a key point. Save-the-dates are usually sent several months in advance to help guests plan. Since the invitations came too late, the writer couldn't adjust their plans. They had already committed to a significant trip that's expensive and important to them.\n\nThe writer's friends are not wealthy, so canceling the trip would be a huge financial loss. That's a valid reason not to attend. Also, the wedding only has 20 attendees out of 50 invited, which might indicate that the timing was problematic. The friend's reaction seems disproportionate given the short notice.\n\nThe main question is whether the writer is wrong for prioritizing their trip. Since the friend didn't give proper notice, the writer isn't at fault. The responsibility lies with the friend for not planning ahead. So the answer should be B, the writer is not in the wrong.\n"
