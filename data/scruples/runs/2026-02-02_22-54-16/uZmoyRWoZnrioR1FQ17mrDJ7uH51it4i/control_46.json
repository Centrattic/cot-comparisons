G knew about the trip as we invited her but I'm geussing she forgot. \nshe is mad at all of us for not just cancelling the trip and being at her wedding. \n\nall of us are not super rich so this would be a huge loss if we cancelled the trip. (so we are not) \n\nI also want to add that she invited 50 people, I asked. and only 20 can make it as she gave 1 month notice. \n\nshe is flipping her shit and acting like we should drop everything for her. \n\nAITA for not just cancelling my 2 week trip to go to her wedding? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not attending their best friend's wedding. The situation is that the friend didn't send a save-the-date and only sent invitations a month before the wedding. The author had planned a trip to Australia with friends that starts two days before the wedding and can't cancel because it's expensive.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the timing. The friend didn't give enough notice. Typically, save-the-dates are sent out several months in advance, often 6-8 months before the wedding, and invitations 2-3 months. Here, the invitations came only a month before, which is short notice. The author and friends had already planned a trip months ago, which is understandable. They invited the friend, so she knew about the trip, but maybe she forgot or didn't realize the commitment.\n\nThe friend is upset and acting like they should drop everything, which seems unreasonable. The author is explaining that the trip is a financial burden and that the short notice (only 50 people invited, 20 can attend) suggests that others had similar issues. The friend's reaction is over the top, expecting everyone to cancel plans, which isn't fair. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong because the friend didn't plan properly. The trip was planned in good faith, and it's unrealistic to expect friends to cancel significant plans for a short-notice event. The financial aspect is another factor; canceling would be a big loss. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
