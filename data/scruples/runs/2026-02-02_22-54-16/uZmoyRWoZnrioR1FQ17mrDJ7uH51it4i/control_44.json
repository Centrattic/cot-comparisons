G knew about the trip as we invited her but I'm geussing she forgot. \nshe is mad at all of us for not just cancelling the trip and being at her wedding. \n\nall of us are not super rich so this would be a huge loss if we cancelled the trip. (so we are not) \n\nI also want to add that she invited 50 people, I asked. and only 20 can make it as she gave 1 month notice. \n\nshe is flipping her shit and acting like we should drop everything for her. \n\nAITA for not just cancelling my 2 week trip to go to her wedding? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for not attending their best friend's wedding. The key points are that the friend didn't send a save-the-date, only the actual invitation a month before the wedding. The author had planned a trip to Australia with friends, which starts two days before the wedding. They couldn't cancel because it's a big financial hit. The friend is upset and expects them to drop everything.\n\nFirst, the author's side: They had a planned trip that they and their friends are paying for. They informed the friend about the trip. The friend didn't send a save-the-date, leading to a short notice. The author's friends couldn't attend, and the friend is upset. The trip is a significant expense, so canceling would be a huge loss. \n\nFrom the friend's perspective, she's expecting her best friend to attend her wedding, which is a major event. She might feel hurt or neglected. However, she didn't give proper notice. Save-the-dates usually go out several months in advance, allowing guests to plan. Receiving an invitation a month before is short notice, especially for an international trip. The author couldn't realistically cancel the trip without incurring a loss. \n\nThe author's friends also couldn't attend, which suggests the issue isn't just about the author. The friend invited 50 people, but only 20 can make it. That might indicate the wedding isn't getting much support from the guest list. \n\nThe main factors here are the short notice and financial constraints. The author had planned the trip and communicated it, so they're not at fault for not being able to drop everything. The friend's responsibility was to send a save-the-date earlier. The author's decision to prioritize their trip is understandable given the circumstances. \n\nSo, the answer is B (No, the author isn't in the wrong). The friend's mistake in not giving proper notice and the financial aspect of the trip make the author's decision reasonable.\n"
