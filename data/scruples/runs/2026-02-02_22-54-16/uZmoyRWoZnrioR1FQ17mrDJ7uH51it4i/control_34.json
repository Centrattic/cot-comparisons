      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the story) is in the wrong for not attending their best friend's wedding. The situation is that the author and three friends planned a trip to Australia, which starts two days before the wedding. The friend, G, sent invitations with only a month's notice and didn't send save-the-dates. The author and friends can't cancel the trip because it's expensive, and G is upset they're not coming.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author had a trip planned that they and their friends probably worked hard to save for. G didn't send out save-the-dates, so the notice was short. The wedding is in a month, but with a month's notice, only 20 out of 50 invited guests can make it. The author didn't know about the wedding until the invitation arrived, which was last week, and the trip was already planned months ago with G being aware of it. \n\nSo, was the author in the wrong? Well, typically, you'd expect close friends to prioritize major life events like weddings. But in this case, the notice was very short. If the author had known earlier, they might have adjusted their plans. However, G didn't send save-the-dates, which are customary for such events. That's a mistake on G's part. The author's friends also had to plan the trip, and cancelling would be a huge financial loss. They might not have the means to do so. \n\nThe author is trying to balance their commitment to the trip with their friendship. Since the trip was planned before the wedding was even a possibility (since G didn't send save-the-dates) and the short notice made it impossible to adjust, it's understandable. The author isn't being inconsiderate if they had no prior notice. G's reaction might be unreasonable because she didn't plan ahead properly. \n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. The fault could lie with G for not sending out save-the-dates and the short notice, which made it impossible for the author to attend. The trip was already a significant commitment, and the author isn't obligated to drop everything, especially when the financial loss would be substantial. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
