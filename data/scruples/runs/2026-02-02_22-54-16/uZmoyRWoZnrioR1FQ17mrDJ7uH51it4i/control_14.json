G knew about the trip as we invited her but I'm geussing she forgot. \nshe is mad at all of us for not just cancelling the trip and being at her wedding. \n\nall of us are not super rich so this would be a huge loss if we cancelled the trip. (so we are not) \n\nI also want to add that she invited 50 people, I asked. and only 20 can make it as she gave 1 month notice. \n\nshe is flipping her shit and acting like we should drop everything for her. \n\nAITA for not just cancelling my 2 week trip to go to her wedding? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not attending their best friend's wedding. The situation is that the wedding was only announced a month in advance, and the author had already planned a trip to Australia with three friends. The trip starts two days before the wedding, and they can't reschedule. The friend invited 50 people, but only 20 can make it because of the short notice. The friend is upset and wants them to cancel the trip.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author didn't get a save-the-date and the invitation was last week, so they had almost no time to plan. The trip was planned months ago, and the friend was invited but didn't remember. The author mentions they aren't wealthy, and canceling the trip would be a big financial loss. Also, the friend is acting like they should drop everything, which might be unreasonable.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, weddings are significant events, and not attending could be seen as disrespectful, especially for a best friend. But on the other hand, the invitations were sent too late, and the trip was already planned with others who might not be able to change their schedules. The fault here might lie with the friend for not sending save-the-dates and the short notice. The author tried to inform them about the trip earlier but it was forgotten. \n\nI think the main issue is the short notice and the friend's responsibility. If the author had been invited earlier, maybe they could have adjusted their plans. Since the friend knew about the trip but still didn't send the save-the-date, she might be at fault for not ensuring the author was available. The author isn't to blame for not being able to cancel a trip that was set months in advance because of someone else's oversight. Also, the fact that only 20 out of 50 are attending due to the timing suggests it's a common issue. So the answer should be B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
