G knew about the trip as we invited her but I'm geussing she forgot. \nshe is mad at all of us for not just cancelling the trip and being at her wedding. \n\nall of us are not super rich so this would be a huge loss if we cancelled the trip. (so we are not) \n\nI also want to add that she invited 50 people, I asked. and only 20 can make it as she gave 1 month notice. \n\nshe is flipping her shit and acting like we should drop everything for her. \n\nAITA for not just cancelling my 2 week trip to go to her wedding? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for not attending their best friend's wedding. The friend, G, didn't send save-the-dates and only sent invitations a month before the wedding. The author had planned a trip to Australia with friends, which starts two days before the wedding. They couldn't cancel because of the trip and the financial aspect. G is upset and expects them to drop everything.\n\nFirst, the timeline is an issue. A month's notice for a wedding is short, especially if someone is planning an international trip. Save-the-dates are usually sent out 6-8 months in advance. G didn't do that, so she's partly responsible for the lack of planning. The author informed her about the trip, so she knew. Now, G is upset, but she didn't plan ahead. The author and friends aren't wealthy, so cancelling would mean losing money and missing out on the trip. \n\nAlso, G invited 50 people, but only 20 can attend. That shows maybe others had similar conflicts. The author isn't the only one skipping because of planning. The friends might have other commitments or trips planned. \n\nThe author isn't in the wrong because they communicated their plans upfront, G didn't plan properly, and the trip was financially significant. The anger from G seems misplaced. So, the answer should be B.\n"
