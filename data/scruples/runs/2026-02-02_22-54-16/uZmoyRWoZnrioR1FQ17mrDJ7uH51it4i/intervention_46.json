G knew about the trip as we invited her but I'm geussing she forgot. \nshe is mad at all of us for not just cancelling the trip and being at her wedding. \n\nall of us are not super rich so this would be a huge loss if we cancelled the trip. (so we are not) \n\nI also want to add that she invited 50 people, I asked. and only 20 can make it as she gave 1 month notice. \n\nshe is flipping her shit and acting like we should drop everything for her. \n\nAITA for not just cancelling my 2 week trip to go to her wedding? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the person who wrote the AITA post) is in the wrong for not attending their best friend's wedding. The situation is that the friend, G, didn't send save-the-dates and only sent invitations a month before the wedding. The author and three friends had already planned a trip to Australia, which conflicts with the wedding, and they can't afford to cancel. G is upset they didn't cancel the trip.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if the author made any promises they broke. The author mentions they invited G to the trip, and G knew about it. But G didn't send a save-the-date, which usually is a social norm. The save-the-date is meant to help people plan around the event, so not sending one is on G. The invitations came with only a month's notice, which is short but maybe not unheard of, especially for a destination wedding. However, if the wedding is at a remote location like a grandmother's ranch, maybe the guest list is more personal. \n\nThe author's friends are going on an expensive trip, and they can't afford to cancel. Financial hardship is a real issue here. Also, the author points out that G invited 50 people but only 20 can attend because of the short notice. That suggests maybe G didn't expect everyone to come, but she's upset now. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because G didn't give proper notice. The save-the-date is a key part of planning, and without it, guests can't adjust their schedules. The author and friends made their plans known to G, so they can't be blamed for going through with them. G's reaction seems unreasonable given the short notice and the fact that others couldn't attend as well. The author isn't responsible for G's poor planning. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
