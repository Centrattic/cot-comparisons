      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for not attending their best friend's wedding. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the friend G didn't send a save-the-date, only the actual invitations a month before the wedding. The author and three friends had already planned a trip to Australia that starts two days before the wedding. They mention that G knew about the trip because they invited her, but she might have forgotten. The author is now being criticized by G for not canceling the trip. The author argues that the trip is costly and they can't afford to cancel. Also, G invited 50 people, but only 20 are attending because of the short notice.\n\nFrom what I understand, the key points here are the timing of the invitations and the prior commitments. Normally, save-the-dates are sent out several months in advance to help guests plan. G didn't do that, which put the author in a tough spot. If the author had known about the wedding earlier, they might have adjusted their travel plans. But since the invitation came only a month before, which is a very short notice, it's understandable that the author couldn't change their plans, especially since the trip was already planned and financially significant.\n\nAlso, G is upset because she expected the author to drop everything, but the author has other commitments and the trip isn't something they can afford to lose. The fact that only 20 out of 50 invitees are attending suggests that the short notice affected more people, not just the author. So, it's not just their issue but a broader problem with G's planning.\n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because the fault lies with G for not giving proper notice. The author couldn't change their plans last minute, especially considering the financial aspect. The friends had already invited G to the trip, so she should have remembered or at least coordinated better. So, the answer should be B (No, the author isn't in the wrong).\n"
