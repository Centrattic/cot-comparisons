G knew about the trip as we invited her but I'm geussing she forgot. \nshe is mad at all of us for not just cancelling the trip and being at her wedding. \n\nall of us are not super rich so this would be a huge loss if we cancelled the trip. (so we are not) \n\nI also want to add that she invited 50 people, I asked. and only 20 can make it as she gave 1 month notice. \n\nshe is flipping her shit and acting like we should drop everything for her. \n\nAITA for not just cancelling my 2 week trip to go to her wedding? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not attending their best friend's wedding. The key points here are the timing of the invitation and the existing trip.\n\nFirst, the friend G didn't send save-the-dates, only the actual invitations a month before the wedding. That's pretty last-minute. Usually, save-the-dates are supposed to go out 6-12 months in advance, and invitations 2-3 months before. By not sending a save-the-date, G left her friends with very little notice, which complicates planning for events like this.\n\nThe author had already planned a trip to Australia with three friends, which starts two days before the wedding. They had invited G to the trip, but she didn't remember. The trip is a significant expense, and canceling it would be a huge financial loss. Plus, they mention that only 20 out of 50 invitees can attend, which shows that the short notice affected turnout.\n\nThe author isn't going because of a conflicting commitment they've already made, which is understandable. Friends often have other plans, especially ones they've been planning for a while. The fact that G is upset because she thinks she should drop everything for her is a bit unfair, especially since she didn't give proper notice. \n\nAlso, the author is trying to explain that they're not in a position to just cancel a trip that's already paid for and planned. The trip being a financial burden adds weight to their decision. It's reasonable to prioritize commitments you've made, especially when they're non-refundable and involve group plans.\n\nSo considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. The main issues here are G's poor planning with the save-the-date and the short notice, which makes it hard for others to adjust their schedules. The author's decision is justified given the circumstances.\n"
