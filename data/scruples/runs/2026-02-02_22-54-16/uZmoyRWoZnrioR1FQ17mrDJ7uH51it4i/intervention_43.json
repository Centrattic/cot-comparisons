G knew about the trip as we invited her but I'm geussing she forgot. \nshe is mad at all of us for not just cancelling the trip and being at her wedding. \n\nall of us are not super rich so this would be a huge loss if we cancelled the trip. (so we are not) \n\nI also want to add that she invited 50 people, I asked. and only 20 can make it as she gave 1 month notice. \n\nshe is flipping her shit and acting like we should drop everything for her. \n\nAITA for not just cancelling my 2 week trip to go to her wedding? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not attending their best friend's wedding. The situation is that the best friend, G, sent invitations only a month before the wedding, which is after the author and friends had already planned a trip to Australia. The author mentions that G knew about the trip but didn't send a save-the-date earlier. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the timeline. Save-the-dates are usually sent several months in advance, so not sending one until a month before is a problem. The author and friends had already committed to the Australia trip, which starts two days before the wedding. That's a tight schedule, making it impossible to attend.\n\nThe author argues that the trip is a significant expense and they aren't wealthy, so canceling would be a huge loss. Also, G invited 50 people but only 20 can attend because of the short notice. That suggests that G might have been aware that many people might not be able to come, maybe including the author.\n\nThe key points here are: G didn't send a save-the-date, the trip was planned in advance and known to G, and the financial aspect. The author is not in the wrong because they communicated their plans beforehand, and the wedding was announced too late. G's anger seems misplaced since she had the opportunity to send a save-the-date earlier. However, the author is a close friend, so there might be emotional aspects to consider, but legally or morally, they're not wrong for not canceling a trip they had planned and communicated.\n\nSo, the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
