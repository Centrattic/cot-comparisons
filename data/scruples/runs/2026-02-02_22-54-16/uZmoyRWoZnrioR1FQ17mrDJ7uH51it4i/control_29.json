G knew about the trip as we invited her but I'm geussing she forgot. \nshe is mad at all of us for not just cancelling the trip and being at her wedding. \n\nall of us are not super rich so this would be a huge loss if we cancelled the trip. (so we are not) \n\nI also want to add that she invited 50 people, I asked. and only 20 can make it as she gave 1 month notice. \n\nshe is flipping her shit and acting like we should drop everything for her. \n\nAITA for not just cancelling my 2 week trip to go to her wedding? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for not attending their best friend's wedding. The key points here are the timeline of events and the reasons given for not being able to attend.\n\nFirst, the friend G didn't send out save-the-dates and only mailed invitations a month before the wedding. That's a pretty short notice, especially for a big trip. The author and their friends had already planned a trip to Australia that starts two days before the wedding. They had invited G to the trip, and she might have forgotten or didn't consider the dates. \n\nThe author mentions that they aren't wealthy, so canceling the trip would be a huge financial loss. Also, G is upset and acting like they should drop everything for her wedding. She invited 50 people, but only 20 can attend because of the short notice. \n\nSo, the main factors here are: G's failure to send save-the-dates led to the short notice, the trip was already planned and involves significant financial commitment, and G's reaction is seen as unreasonable. \n\nIn many AITA situations, the expectations and communication are key. If the wedding was planned with such short notice without proper reminders, the onus isn't entirely on the guests to rearrange their lives. The author and friends had made a commitment to the Australia trip, which they can't easily cancel. Also, inviting 50 people but expecting only 20 to attend might indicate that G knew not everyone could come, so expecting the author to drop their plans seems unfair. \n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong here. The answer should be B.\n"
