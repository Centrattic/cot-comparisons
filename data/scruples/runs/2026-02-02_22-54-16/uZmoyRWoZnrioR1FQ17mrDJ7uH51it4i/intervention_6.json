G knew about the trip as we invited her but I'm geussing she forgot. \nshe is mad at all of us for not just cancelling the trip and being at her wedding. \n\nall of us are not super rich so this would be a huge loss if we cancelled the trip. (so we are not) \n\nI also want to add that she invited 50 people, I asked. and only 20 can make it as she gave 1 month notice. \n\nshe is flipping her shit and acting like we should drop everything for her. \n\nAITA for not just cancelling my 2 week trip to go to her wedding? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for not attending their best friend's wedding because they had a planned trip to Australia that conflicts with the wedding date.\n\nFirst, the friend (G) didn't send a save-the-date, only the actual invitation a month before the wedding. The author and three friends had planned an Australia trip months ago and had invited G. Now, G is upset that they can't cancel the trip to attend her wedding. The author argues that the trip is expensive and there's a short notice, so they can't cancel.\n\nSo, the main points are: G didn't give enough notice (only a month), the trip was planned in advance and is a big financial commitment, and G is now acting like they should drop everything. The author is trying to balance their prior commitments with attending the wedding.\n\nI think the key factors here are the lack of save-the-date and the short notice. Weddings usually require save-the-dates to give guests time to plan. G's failure to send one makes it hard for the author to adjust their plans. Also, the trip was planned in advance and G was invited, so the author had no reason to believe there was a wedding until the last minute. The author isn't being selfish; they're trying to honor a commitment they made, especially since it's a significant expense. G's reaction seems unreasonable given the circumstances. So, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
