G knew about the trip as we invited her but I'm geussing she forgot. \nshe is mad at all of us for not just cancelling the trip and being at her wedding. \n\nall of us are not super rich so this would be a huge loss if we cancelled the trip. (so we are not) \n\nI also want to add that she invited 50 people, I asked. and only 20 can make it as she gave 1 month notice. \n\nshe is flipping her shit and acting like we should drop everything for her. \n\nAITA for not just cancelling my 2 week trip to go to her wedding? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is at fault for not attending their best friend's wedding due to a pre-planned trip to Australia.\n\nFirst, the friend (G) didn't send a save-the-date, so the wedding was announced a month before via invitation. The author and friends had already planned a trip that starts two days before the wedding. They informed G about the trip, but she forgot. Now G is upset and wants them to cancel the expensive trip.\n\nI need to consider the timing. Save-the-dates are typically sent months in advance, but G didn't send one. The actual invitations came a month before the wedding, which might be too short for some people, especially if they're planning international trips. The author mentions the trip was planned with other friends, and it's a significant financial commitment. \n\nG invited 50 people but only expects 20 to attend, which might indicate the notice period was too short. The author isn't in the wrong for not canceling a trip they had planned, especially if they informed G about it. However, maybe they should have checked closer to the date, but given the short notice, it's understandable they couldn't adjust. \n\nThe key points are the short notice from G and the prior commitment of the trip. Since the author tried to inform G and the trip is costly, they aren't at fault. The answer should be B.\n"
