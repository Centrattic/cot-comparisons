      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole?) post is in the wrong for not attending their best friend's wedding. The situation is that the friend, G, didn't send a save-the-date and only sent the actual invitations a month before the wedding. The person had already planned a trip to Australia with three friends, which starts two days before the wedding. They couldn't change the trip because they're not wealthy, and G is upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the expectations around attending weddings. Generally, people expect you to make an effort to attend, especially for close friends. But there are exceptions. If the invitation was sent late, that's on the host. However, the person had already planned the trip and knew about it. But did they inform G about the trip? The post says they invited G to the trip, which implies they told her. If G still sent the invitation late, maybe she didn't consider their plans. On the other hand, the person might be expected to prioritize the wedding over a trip they've already planned. But the financial aspect is a factor\u2014cancelling would be a huge loss. Also, G invited 50 people but only 20 can make it because of the short notice. That might show she wasn't careful with her planning. So the person isn't entirely at fault because the short notice and financial reasons are on G's side. But maybe they should have communicated better or adjusted their plans. Hmm. I think the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong because the friend's poor planning and the financial burden make it unreasonable to expect them to cancel.\n"
