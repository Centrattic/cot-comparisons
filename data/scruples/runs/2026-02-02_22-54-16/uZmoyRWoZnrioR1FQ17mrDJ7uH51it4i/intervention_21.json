G knew about the trip as we invited her but I'm geussing she forgot. \nshe is mad at all of us for not just cancelling the trip and being at her wedding. \n\nall of us are not super rich so this would be a huge loss if we cancelled the trip. (so we are not) \n\nI also want to add that she invited 50 people, I asked. and only 20 can make it as she gave 1 month notice. \n\nshe is flipping her shit and acting like we should drop everything for her. \n\nAITA for not just cancelling my 2 week trip to go to her wedding? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not attending their best friend's wedding. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the friend (G) didn't send save-the-dates and only sent invitations a month before the wedding. The author and friends had already planned a trip to Australia that starts two days before the wedding. They had invited G to the trip, so she was aware of it. Now, G is upset that they didn't cancel the trip to attend her wedding. The author mentions that they're not very wealthy, so canceling the trip would be a major financial loss. Also, G is only getting about 20 out of 50 guests to make it because of the short notice.\n\nSo, the main points here are the short notice from G and the existing commitment the author has. The author is in a tight spot because they have a planned trip that's already booked, and they can't afford to cancel. G's reaction is being called selfish or unreasonable by the author. \n\nI think the key factors are: 1) Did G give appropriate notice? Typically, weddings have save-the-dates and invitations several months in advance, but here it's only a month before. 2) Was the author's trip already planned, and are they financially capable of changing it? 3) Should the author drop their plans for G's wedding?\n\nFrom what's described, the author's friends had invited G to the trip, so she knew about it. If G forgot about the trip when sending out invites, that's on her. The author isn't to blame for not canceling a trip that was planned with friends, especially when they might face financial loss. Also, considering that only 20 out of 50 guests can make it, maybe G should have been more understanding. The author's decision to prioritize their existing commitment over a last-minute request seems reasonable. So, I think the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
