G knew about the trip as we invited her but I'm geussing she forgot. \nshe is mad at all of us for not just cancelling the trip and being at her wedding. \n\nall of us are not super rich so this would be a huge loss if we cancelled the trip. (so we are not) \n\nI also want to add that she invited 50 people, I asked. and only 20 can make it as she gave 1 month notice. \n\nshe is flipping her shit and acting like we should drop everything for her. \n\nAITA for not just cancelling my 2 week trip to go to her wedding? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for not attending their best friend's wedding. The main points are:\n\n1. The friend, G, didn't send a save-the-date and only sent the actual invites a month before the wedding. That's pretty short notice for a wedding, which usually requires more planning. So G might have messed up by not giving enough time for guests to adjust their schedules.\n\n2. The author and their friends had planned a trip to Australia months ago, which starts two days before the wedding. The author mentions that they invited G to the trip, so G was aware of the plans but still scheduled the wedding close to the trip's start date. This makes me think that G might have forgotten or overlooked the existing plans.\n\n3. The trip is a significant financial commitment, and canceling would be a huge loss. Since the author and friends aren't super wealthy, the financial impact is a valid concern. It's understandable they don't want to cancel the trip just because G didn't plan better.\n\n4. G invited 50 people but only expects 20 to show up because of the short notice. That shows maybe she knew the notice was too short, but still, she's upset about the author's absence. She's acting like everyone should drop their plans, which seems unreasonable. People have other commitments and responsibilities.\n\n5. The author is trying to balance their own plans with their friend's expectations. They're not refusing to attend out of spite but because of the short notice and existing commitments. The fact that the trip was planned months ago and G was invited adds another layer\u2014she knew about the trip but didn't adjust her planning accordingly.\n\nConsidering all these factors, the author isn't in the wrong. G's poor planning and failure to communicate adequately (like sending a save-the-date) led to the conflict. The author's decision to keep their trip is reasonable given the circumstances. So the answer should be B.\n"
