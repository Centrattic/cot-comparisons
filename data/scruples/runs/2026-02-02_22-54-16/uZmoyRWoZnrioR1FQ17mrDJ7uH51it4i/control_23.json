      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not attending their best friend's wedding. The scenario is that the friend sent invitations just a month before the wedding, and the author had planned a trip to Australia that conflicts. The author didn't get a save-the-date, so the friend might have forgotten about the existing trip.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the expectations in friendships. Best friends usually expect you to be there for big events like weddings. But the friend didn't send a save-the-date, which is a common practice. That could be a point in the author's favor because they didn't have enough notice to adjust plans.\n\nThen, the trip to Australia was planned months ago, and the author mentioned that all four friends are not wealthy. Cancelling the trip would be a huge financial loss. That adds weight to their decision to stick with the trip. However, the friend is upset and feels the author should have dropped the trip. \n\nI should also think about the number of guests. The friend invited 50 people, but only 20 can attend because of the short notice. The author is in a similar situation as others who can't make it. Maybe the friend is being unreasonable in expecting everyone to drop their plans.\n\nAnother angle: the author did invite the friend to the trip, but the friend forgot. That shows the author tried to include her, but she didn't remember. The author can't be blamed for the friend's oversight. \n\nFinancial constraints are a real factor. If the trip is already paid for, cancelling would mean losing money, which isn't fair if the friend didn't communicate properly. The author isn't at fault for making plans responsibly and facing financial loss due to the friend's mistake.\n\nAlso, the friend is acting like they should drop everything, which is a bit selfish. Friendships involve mutual respect, but the friend didn't set a proper timeline. The author shouldn't be expected to cancel a significant trip based on last-minute notice.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The author isn't in the wrong because the friend didn't send a save-the-date, leading to a conflict the author couldn't foresee. The financial loss is a valid concern, and the friend's reaction is unreasonable. The answer should be B (No).\n"
