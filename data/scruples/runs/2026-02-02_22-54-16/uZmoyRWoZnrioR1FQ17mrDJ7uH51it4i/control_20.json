G knew about the trip as we invited her but I'm geussing she forgot. \nshe is mad at all of us for not just cancelling the trip and being at her wedding. \n\nall of us are not super rich so this would be a huge loss if we cancelled the trip. (so we are not) \n\nI also want to add that she invited 50 people, I asked. and only 20 can make it as she gave 1 month notice. \n\nshe is flipping her shit and acting like we should drop everything for her. \n\nAITA for not just cancelling my 2 week trip to go to her wedding? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not attending their best friend's wedding because they have a planned trip to Australia. The key points here are the timing of the invitations and the financial commitment of the trip.\n\nFirst, the friend (G) didn't send save-the-dates and only sent actual invitations a month before the wedding. That's pretty short notice for a significant event like a wedding. Typically, save-the-dates are sent out months in advance so guests can plan. If G didn't do that, it's partially her fault that the author and friends can't adjust their plans.\n\nThen there's the trip to Australia. The author mentions they've already planned this trip with three friends, and it's a two-week backpacking trip. They also note they're not super rich, implying that canceling would cause a significant financial loss. If the trip was booked months ago and the wedding was only announced a month before, it's understandable they can't just cancel now without major consequences.\n\nThe author also points out that G invited 50 people but only expects 20 to come, which might indicate that the guest list wasn't based on actual availability. G is upset because the author and friends didn't cancel, but given the short notice and the financial stakes, it's not unreasonable for the author to prioritize their trip. \n\nBest friends usually make an effort to be there for each other, but this situation is tricky because of the short notice and the financial commitment. The author isn't being inconsiderate; they're making a hard choice between two important plans. Since G failed to provide adequate notice, the blame isn't entirely on the author. So, the answer is likely B\u2014that the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
