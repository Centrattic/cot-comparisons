      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the AITA scenario is wrong for not attending their best friend's wedding. The friend didn't send a save-the-date, only the actual invitation a month before the wedding. The author and three friends had already planned a trip to Australia, which starts two days before the wedding. The friend is upset they can't cancel the trip.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The friend (G) didn't send a save-the-date, which is a common practice. Save-the-dates are usually sent a year or six months in advance to help guests plan. By sending the invitation only a month before, G might have made it harder for people to adjust their schedules. \n\nThe author's argument is that they had already planned the trip months ago and were invited to do so. They mention that the trip is a big financial commitment, so cancelling would be a huge loss. Also, G is inviting 50 people but only expecting 20 to show up. It seems like she's upset that the author didn't prioritize her wedding over the trip, especially given the short notice.\n\nNow, considering social norms: Best friends usually expect to attend each other's weddings. But if the save-the-date wasn't sent out, the friend might be partially at fault for not giving enough notice. The author and friends had already committed to another plan, which they can't easily cancel. The financial aspect is a significant factor here\u2014canceling the trip would cost a lot, which is a real hardship.\n\nOn the other hand, weddings are important events, and best friends expecting each other to be there is understandable. However, the author's explanation about the short notice and financial constraints might mitigate the blame. The fact that G invited many people but only expects a fraction to attend could also suggest that she didn't realistically plan, expecting everyone to drop their plans last minute.\n\nI think the key here is the lack of save-the-date and the timing of the invitation. If G had given proper notice, the author would have had more time to adjust their plans. Since the trip was planned months in advance and the friend was aware of it, maybe the author isn't entirely at fault. The friend should have sent the save-the-date to avoid this conflict. \n\nAlso, the author is not the only one in a position where they can't attend; others are in the same boat. If G is upset, maybe she should consider the short notice issue first. The author's reasoning seems valid: they can't just drop a pre-planned and paid trip for a wedding that was not properly advertised. \n\nSo, in this case, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. The friend's poor planning might be the main issue here. Therefore, the answer would be B (No).\n"
