G knew about the trip as we invited her but I'm geussing she forgot. \nshe is mad at all of us for not just cancelling the trip and being at her wedding. \n\nall of us are not super rich so this would be a huge loss if we cancelled the trip. (so we are not) \n\nI also want to add that she invited 50 people, I asked. and only 20 can make it as she gave 1 month notice. \n\nshe is flipping her shit and acting like we should drop everything for her. \n\nAITA for not just cancelling my 2 week trip to go to her wedding? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the AITA question) is in the wrong for not attending their best friend's wedding. The key points are:\n\n1. The friend (G) sent invitations only a month before the wedding, which is quite short notice. Typically, save-the-dates are sent out several months in advance, so missing that might be on G.\n2. The author and three friends had planned a trip to Australia that starts two days before the wedding. They had invited G to the trip, but she didn't remember or didn't consider it when planning her wedding.\n3. The trip is significant because they aren't wealthy, so canceling would mean a major financial loss. They can't just drop everything to reschedule.\n4. G is upset and expects them to prioritize her wedding over their planned trip. The author mentions that out of 50 invitees, only 20 can make it due to the short notice, implying that the expectations might be unrealistic.\n\nNow, considering these points, the main issue seems to be the short notice from G. If the author had received a save-the-date earlier, maybe they could have adjusted their plans. But since they didn't, and they had already planned something else that's a big investment, it's understandable they can't cancel. The author isn't in the wrong because the responsibility for proper communication lies with the wedding planner (G). The friends' plans were made in good faith, and expecting them to cancel without a better heads-up is unreasonable. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
