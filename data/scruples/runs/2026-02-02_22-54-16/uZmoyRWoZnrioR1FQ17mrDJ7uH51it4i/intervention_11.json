G knew about the trip as we invited her but I'm geussing she forgot. \nshe is mad at all of us for not just cancelling the trip and being at her wedding. \n\nall of us are not super rich so this would be a huge loss if we cancelled the trip. (so we are not) \n\nI also want to add that she invited 50 people, I asked. and only 20 can make it as she gave 1 month notice. \n\nshe is flipping her shit and acting like we should drop everything for her. \n\nAITA for not just cancelling my 2 week trip to go to her wedding? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not attending their best friend's wedding because they had a planned trip to Australia that conflicts. The wedding was only announced a month in advance, which is quite short notice. The author mentions that the friend didn't send save-the-dates, leading to the late invitation. The trip was planned months ago, and the friend knew about it but didn't mention the wedding earlier.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural norms around wedding invitations. Typically, save-the-dates go out 6-8 months in advance, and formal invitations 2-3 months ahead. Here, the friend only sent invitations a month before, which is unusually short. That's a red flag. The author and friends had already planned a significant trip, which they can't afford to cancel. It's understandable they can't drop everything, especially since the friend had prior knowledge of their plans.\n\nAlso, the friend is upset that they didn't cancel, but the author isn't at fault here. The friend didn't give proper notice, and the author made their plans known. The fact that only 20 out of 50 invited guests can make it shows others are in a similar situation, which might indicate the friend is being unreasonable. The author isn't the only one who can't attend, but the friend is focusing on them, which seems unfair.\n\nFinancial constraints are a big factor. Cancelling a trip to Australia would be a huge loss, which the author can't afford. It's not reasonable to expect someone to cancel a planned trip unless the event was known much earlier. The friend's reaction of \"flipping her shit\" suggests she's overreacting, possibly expecting the author to prioritize her wedding over their own plans without considering the circumstances.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong. The fault lies with the friend for not giving proper notice and not respecting the existing commitments of the guests. The author made an informed decision based on the information given, and it's not their responsibility to cancel a trip they had planned, especially when the friend had the opportunity to communicate the wedding plans earlier.\n"
