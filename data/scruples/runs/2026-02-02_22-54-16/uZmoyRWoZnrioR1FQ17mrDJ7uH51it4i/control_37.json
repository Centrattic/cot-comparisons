G knew about the trip as we invited her but I'm geussing she forgot. \nshe is mad at all of us for not just cancelling the trip and being at her wedding. \n\nall of us are not super rich so this would be a huge loss if we cancelled the trip. (so we are not) \n\nI also want to add that she invited 50 people, I asked. and only 20 can make it as she gave 1 month notice. \n\nshe is flipping her shit and acting like we should drop everything for her. \n\nAITA for not just cancelling my 2 week trip to go to her wedding? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for not attending their best friend's wedding. The friend sent out invitations only a month before the wedding, which is really short notice. The person had already planned a trip to Australia with friends, which starts two days before the wedding. They can't cancel because it's expensive, and the friend is upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the norms around weddings. Typically, save-the-dates are sent out several months in advance, maybe 6-8 months before the wedding. The friend only gave one month notice by sending the invitations, which is way too short. That's a big red flag. Guests usually need time to make travel arrangements, so this was a mistake on the friend's part.\n\nThe author had already booked a trip and had informed the friend about it. The friend might have forgotten or not realized the short notice would conflict. The author isn't in a position to just drop the trip because it's expensive, which makes sense. The friend is upset, but the blame here might lie more with her for not giving proper notice.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that out of 50 invited, only 20 can make it. That's a low turnout, which might be because of the short notice. The friend is acting like everyone should drop their plans, which is unreasonable. The author isn't the one who messed up the planning. So, the answer is probably B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
