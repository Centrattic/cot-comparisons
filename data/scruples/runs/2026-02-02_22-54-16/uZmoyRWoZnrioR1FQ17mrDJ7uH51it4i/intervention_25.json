G knew about the trip as we invited her but I'm geussing she forgot. \nshe is mad at all of us for not just cancelling the trip and being at her wedding. \n\nall of us are not super rich so this would be a huge loss if we cancelled the trip. (so we are not) \n\nI also want to add that she invited 50 people, I asked. and only 20 can make it as she gave 1 month notice. \n\nshe is flipping her shit and acting like we should drop everything for her. \n\nAITA for not just cancelling my 2 week trip to go to her wedding? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not attending their best friend's wedding. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the friend, G, didn't send out save-the-dates and only sent invitations a month before the wedding. The author and their friends had already planned a trip to Australia that starts two days before the wedding. They invited G to the trip, but she forgot about it. Now, G is upset and wants them to cancel the trip, but the author can't afford to lose that money. \n\nSo, the key points here are: G didn't give proper notice, the trip was already planned and confirmed with others, and the author isn't in a financial position to cancel. The user thinks the author is in the right because the friend didn't plan ahead. But maybe there's another angle. \n\nIs it reasonable to expect someone to cancel a planned trip, especially when the wedding was only announced a month in advance? Also, the author mentions that G invited 50 people but only 20 can make it because of the short notice. That shows others had similar issues. The author's friends are also involved, so it's not just the author's decision. \n\nBut wait, is there any responsibility on the author's part? They did invite G to the trip, but maybe they should have checked in more? Or maybe not, since the trip was already months in the making. Also, the author might feel that G should have remembered the trip if she was truly their best friend. \n\nI think the main issue is the lack of save-the-dates and the short notice from G. The author and friends had a valid reason to commit to the trip before they even knew about the wedding date. So, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
