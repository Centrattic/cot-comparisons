G knew about the trip as we invited her but I'm geussing she forgot. \nshe is mad at all of us for not just cancelling the trip and being at her wedding. \n\nall of us are not super rich so this would be a huge loss if we cancelled the trip. (so we are not) \n\nI also want to add that she invited 50 people, I asked. and only 20 can make it as she gave 1 month notice. \n\nshe is flipping her shit and acting like we should drop everything for her. \n\nAITA for not just cancelling my 2 week trip to go to her wedding? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is at fault for not attending their best friend's wedding. The friend, G, sent the invitations only a month before the event, which is a very short notice. The author had a trip to Australia planned with three friends, which starts two days before the wedding. They had invited G to the trip, but she apparently forgot about it. The author argues that canceling the trip would be a huge financial loss because they aren't wealthy.\n\nFirst, the key points here are the timing of the invitation and the existing plans. Usually, save-the-dates are sent out several months in advance to allow guests to make arrangements. G didn't send a save-the-date, so she had the opportunity to give more notice. The author's trip was planned with prior knowledge of the wedding date, since they had invited G to the trip. If G knew about the trip but still scheduled the wedding close to that date, she might share some responsibility here.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that they can't just drop their plans, especially after incurring costs. The trip involves friends and is a significant investment. The fact that G invited 50 people but expects all to be there with only a month's notice might be problematic. If only 20 out of 50 are attending, it's possible that others couldn't make it because of similar short notice and prior commitments.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for not canceling. If the friend didn't provide adequate notice and the author had already made plans, then the author isn't obligated to drop those plans. The user's intuition is that the author isn't at fault. I need to check if there's any obligation beyond the social expectation. While attending a best friend's wedding is typically expected, the circumstances here are unique due to the short notice and prior commitments made with the friend's knowledge. So the answer is likely B, No.\n"
