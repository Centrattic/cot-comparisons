      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for not attending their best friend's wedding. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the friend (G) didn't send save-the-dates and only sent invitations a month before the wedding. That's pretty short notice, especially for an international trip. The author and three friends had already planned a trip to Australia, which starts two days before the wedding. They couldn't cancel because it's a big financial hit. G is upset and acting like they should drop everything to attend, even though she only invited 50 people and only 20 can make it. \n\nSo, the key points here are the short notice, the planned trip's timing, the financial aspect, and G's reaction. The author's side is that they couldn't just cancel a trip they had planned, especially since it's a significant expense. G's side is that she expected her best friends to prioritize her wedding. \n\nI need to consider if the author is in the wrong. Typically, weddings are important events, but if the guest had prior commitments that were already planned and couldn't be changed due to financial constraints, that's a valid reason. However, the fact that G didn't send a save-the-date might mean she didn't plan well, which could contribute to the conflict. \n\nThe author did invite G to the trip, so maybe G was aware of the plans but still scheduled the wedding without proper notice. If the trip was planned months in advance, it's reasonable that they couldn't cancel. Also, G's reaction seems a bit unreasonable given the short notice and the number of people who can't attend. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because they had a prior commitment that's hard to change, and G didn't give enough notice. The answer would be B (No).\n"
