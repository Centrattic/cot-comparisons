G knew about the trip as we invited her but I'm geussing she forgot. \nshe is mad at all of us for not just cancelling the trip and being at her wedding. \n\nall of us are not super rich so this would be a huge loss if we cancelled the trip. (so we are not) \n\nI also want to add that she invited 50 people, I asked. and only 20 can make it as she gave 1 month notice. \n\nshe is flipping her shit and acting like we should drop everything for her. \n\nAITA for not just cancelling my 2 week trip to go to her wedding? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not attending their best friend's wedding. The situation is that the friend didn't send save-the-dates and only sent the actual invitations a month before the wedding. The author and their friends had already planned a trip to Australia, which starts two days before the wedding. They can't cancel because it's a big financial hit. The friend is upset and feels they should come.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the norms around weddings. Typically, save-the-dates are sent out several months in advance, maybe 6-8 months, and formal invitations a few months before. Here, the friend sent the invitations just a month before, which is way too short. That's a problem on the friend's part. The author's friends couldn't just up and cancel a trip they planned months ago, especially since it's a significant expense. \n\nThe author mentions that the friend knew about the trip because they invited her, so it's possible she was aware but still scheduled the wedding too close. The friend's reaction seems unreasonable given that the notice was short. The author isn't the one who failed to communicate the timing. \n\nAlso, the author's reasoning makes sense. The trip was planned with others, and it's a financial burden to cancel. The friend is expecting the author to drop their plans, but that's a lot to ask when the wedding was scheduled without proper notice. The number of guests is also low, which might indicate that the friend wasn't expecting many people, but that's not the author's fault. \n\nSo putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. The main issue is the friend's lack of proper notification and her unreasonable expectation. The author made a choice based on prior commitments and financial constraints, which are valid. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
