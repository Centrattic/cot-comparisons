(so we are not) \n\nI also want to add that she invited 50 people, I asked. and only 20 can make it as she gave 1 month notice. \n\nshe is flipping her shit and acting like we should drop everything for her. \n\nAITA for not just cancelling my 2 week trip to go to her wedding? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for not attending their best friend's wedding. The situation is that the friend, G, didn't send a save-the-date and sent the actual invitations just a month before the wedding. The author and three friends had already planned a trip to Australia, which conflicts with the wedding. The author wants to know if they're at fault for not canceling the trip and attending.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the friend's responsibilities. Save-the-dates are usually sent months in advance, but G didn't send one, leading to the invite coming only a month before. That's a red flag because it's tight timing for guests to plan. The author mentions that G knew about the trip since they invited her, but G might have forgotten or not prioritized it. \n\nThen there's the financial aspect. The author and friends aren't wealthy, so canceling the trip would be a big loss. That's a significant factor. Friends are expected to make sacrifices, but when it's a financial strain, it's more complicated. Plus, only 20 out of 50 invitees can make it, showing others have similar conflicts.\n\nThe key points here are: G's failure to send a save-the-date, the short notice, the pre-existing commitment that's costly, and the fact that the author tried to inform G about the trip. It seems like G is being unreasonable to expect last-minute changes, especially when she didn't give proper notice. So the author isn't in the wrong because the issue stems from G's poor planning and the trip was planned in advance with knowledge from her. The answer should be B.\n"
