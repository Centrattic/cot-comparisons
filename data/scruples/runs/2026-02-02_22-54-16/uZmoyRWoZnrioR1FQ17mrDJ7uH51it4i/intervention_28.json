G knew about the trip as we invited her but I'm geussing she forgot. \nshe is mad at all of us for not just cancelling the trip and being at her wedding. \n\nall of us are not super rich so this would be a huge loss if we cancelled the trip. (so we are not) \n\nI also want to add that she invited 50 people, I asked. and only 20 can make it as she gave 1 month notice. \n\nshe is flipping her shit and acting like we should drop everything for her. \n\nAITA for not just cancelling my 2 week trip to go to her wedding? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA scenario is in the wrong for not attending their best friend's wedding. The situation is that the friend didn't send save-the-dates and only sent invitations a month before the wedding. The author had planned a trip to Australia with three friends, which starts two days before the wedding, and they can't cancel because it's a big financial hit. The friend is upset and expects them to drop everything.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the friend's responsibility. If she didn't send save-the-dates, she should have given more notice. A month before is really short for a wedding, especially if you expect people to rearrange plans. The author and friends had already planned their trip and informed her. If she forgot or didn't consider the timing, that's on her. \n\nThen there's the financial aspect. The trip is costly, and canceling would mean a huge loss. The author isn't in the position to just cancel, so it's a valid reason not to attend. Also, the friend is inviting 50 people but only expects 20 to come, which might mean she's aware not everyone can make it. \n\nThe friend's reaction seems excessive. The author is trying to attend the wedding but the timing conflict is real. The friend's anger is misplaced because she didn't plan ahead. The author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing a pre-planned trip they can't afford to cancel. So, answer B makes sense here.\n"
