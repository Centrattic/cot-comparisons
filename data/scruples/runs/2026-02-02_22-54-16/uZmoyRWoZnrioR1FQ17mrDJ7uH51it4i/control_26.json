G knew about the trip as we invited her but I'm geussing she forgot. \nshe is mad at all of us for not just cancelling the trip and being at her wedding. \n\nall of us are not super rich so this would be a huge loss if we cancelled the trip. (so we are not) \n\nI also want to add that she invited 50 people, I asked. and only 20 can make it as she gave 1 month notice. \n\nshe is flipping her shit and acting like we should drop everything for her. \n\nAITA for not just cancelling my 2 week trip to go to her wedding? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person (the author) is in the wrong for not attending their best friend's wedding. The situation is that the friend, G, didn't send save-the-dates and only sent the actual invitations a month before the wedding. The author and three friends had already planned a trip to Australia two weeks in advance of the wedding. They invited G, who knew about the trip, but she forgot. Now she's upset that they're not attending.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the timing. Save-the-dates are usually sent out 6-12 months in advance, so not sending one means the author didn't have much notice. The invitations came a month before, which is really short. The author's trip was planned and known about earlier, and G was invited but didn't remember. The author and friends can't afford to cancel the trip, which is a significant financial hit. \n\nG is upset that they aren't there, but there's a lack of communication from her side. She didn't send a save-the-date, which is a standard practice, leading to the short notice. The author's friends also can't attend, which shows the problem with the short notice. \n\nThe author is being blamed for not changing plans, but the root issue is G not giving enough notice. The author isn't at fault because they tried to inform G about the trip and she was aware but didn't remember. The financial aspect is a big factor too. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong because the problem started with the friend not providing timely information. The answer should be B.\n"
