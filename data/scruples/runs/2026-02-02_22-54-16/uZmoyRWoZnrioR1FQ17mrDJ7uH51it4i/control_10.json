G knew about the trip as we invited her but I'm geussing she forgot. \nshe is mad at all of us for not just cancelling the trip and being at her wedding. \n\nall of us are not super rich so this would be a huge loss if we cancelled the trip. (so we are not) \n\nI also want to add that she invited 50 people, I asked. and only 20 can make it as she gave 1 month notice. \n\nshe is flipping her shit and acting like we should drop everything for her. \n\nAITA for not just cancelling my 2 week trip to go to her wedding? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not attending their best friend's wedding. The situation is that the friend sent invitations only a month before the wedding, which is really short notice. The author had already planned a trip to Australia with three friends, which starts two days before the wedding. They couldn't cancel because it's expensive, and they mentioned that the friend invited 50 people but only 20 can make it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the main points here. The friend didn't send a save-the-date, which is usually done much earlier. The author and friends had planned the trip months in advance and had informed the friend. The short notice from the friend probably made it impossible to adjust their plans. The author is being criticized for not canceling, but given the financial constraints and prior commitments, it's understandable they can't just drop everything. Also, the friend is upset that others can't attend, but only 20 out of 50 invited guests are coming. That might mean the friend's expectations might be unrealistic given the timing.\n\nNow, thinking about the responsibilities here. Friends have different commitments. The wedding is important, but the author had a pre-planned trip. The friend didn't account for proper planning by sending early reminders. The author isn't in the wrong because they tried to inform the friend about the trip in advance. The friend's anger might be misplaced because she didn't plan accordingly. Also, the trip is a significant financial investment, which adds to the difficulty of canceling. The answer likely leans towards B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
