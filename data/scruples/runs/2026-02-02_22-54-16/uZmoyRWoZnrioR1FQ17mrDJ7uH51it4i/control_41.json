      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the situation is in the wrong for not attending their best friend's wedding. The scenario is that the friend (G) didn't send save-the-dates and only sent invitations a month before the wedding. The author and three friends had already planned a trip to Australia, which starts two days before the wedding. They couldn't change the trip because it's a big financial commitment. G is upset and thinks they should have canceled.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is at fault. Let's break it down. The key points are: G didn't give enough notice, the trip was already planned and confirmed, and the friends can't afford to cancel. Also, the author mentions that G invited 50 people but only expects 20 to come, implying that maybe she knew people might not be able to make it if given short notice.\n\nSo, the author's defense is that G didn't send save-the-dates, leading to last-minute invites. The trip was planned months ago, and they were upfront with G about it. The friends aren't wealthy, so canceling would be a big loss. G's reaction is seen as unreasonable because she's expecting others to drop their plans for her, even with the short notice.\n\nFrom a typical AITA perspective, the author might not be in the wrong. G didn't provide adequate warning, which is a common practice for weddings. Save-the-dates are usually sent 6-12 months in advance. Since they were invited later, the author and friends had no way to adjust their plans. The fact that they were upfront about the trip with G is important. The friends are also in a similar situation, so it's not just the author. The financial burden is a real factor, and it's not unreasonable to prioritize a pre-planned trip, especially if they communicated their plans early.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is a best friend, and maybe the expectation is higher. But G's fault in not sending save-the-dates is the root issue. The author isn't to blame for G's oversight. The answer would likely be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
