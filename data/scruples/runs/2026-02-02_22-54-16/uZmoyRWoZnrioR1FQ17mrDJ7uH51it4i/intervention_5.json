G knew about the trip as we invited her but I'm geussing she forgot. \nshe is mad at all of us for not just cancelling the trip and being at her wedding. \n\nall of us are not super rich so this would be a huge loss if we cancelled the trip. (so we are not) \n\nI also want to add that she invited 50 people, I asked. and only 20 can make it as she gave 1 month notice. \n\nshe is flipping her shit and acting like we should drop everything for her. \n\nAITA for not just cancelling my 2 week trip to go to her wedding? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author of the AITA scenario is in the wrong for not attending their best friend's wedding. Let me break down the details.\n\nFirst, the friend (G) didn't send a save-the-date, only the actual invitations a month before the wedding. That's pretty short notice, especially for an international trip. The author and their friends had planned a trip to Australia, which had already been organized. They invited G to the trip, but she forgot about it. Now she's upset because they can't cancel their trip, which is a big financial hit for them. The author and friends aren't wealthy, and only 20 out of 50 invited people can attend because of the short notice.\n\nSo, who's at fault here? G didn't communicate properly by not sending a save-the-date. She knew about the trip but didn't remember, which is on her. The author's group had planned this trip in advance and can't just drop it without significant loss. The fact that many others also can't attend (only 20 out of 50) suggests that the short notice is the main issue. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because they made their plans known and the wedding date was announced too late. G should have given more notice, and expecting others to cancel a trip they've already planned isn't fair. The answer should be B.\n"
