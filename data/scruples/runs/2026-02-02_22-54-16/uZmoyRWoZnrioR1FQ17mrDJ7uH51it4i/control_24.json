      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for not attending their best friend's wedding. Let me break down the details.\n\nFirst, the friend G didn't send save-the-dates and only sent invitations a month before the wedding. The author and three friends had planned a trip to Australia months ago, which starts two days before the wedding. They couldn't reschedule the trip because they're not super rich, so canceling would be a big financial hit. G is upset they're not coming. The author mentions that G invited 50 people but expects 20 to show up after a one-month notice.\n\nSo, the main points here: the friend didn't give enough notice with the save-the-date, leading to a short notice. The trip was planned months in advance, and they can't afford to cancel. The author is being accused of being inconsiderate by not dropping everything for the wedding. The friend is acting like everyone should prioritize her event despite the short notice.\n\nNow, considering social norms, save-the-dates are usually sent out several months in advance, especially for events that might require travel. G's failure to send one is a misstep. The author and friends had a prior commitment that was planned well in advance. Since the trip is a big financial commitment and they can't afford to cancel, their decision makes sense. The friend's reaction seems unreasonable given the short notice and the financial burden on the friends.\n\nAlso, the fact that only 20 out of 50 invited are expected to attend adds to the idea that the friend might not have managed expectations well. It's possible she didn't realize the short notice would be an issue for some guests, especially those who can't last-minute change plans.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, both parties share some. The author's friends could have maybe tried to adjust the trip, but the author isn't at fault for the friend's poor planning. The key here is that the author isn't the one who caused the short notice. The friend is the one who didn't communicate properly. The author is making a choice based on their existing commitment and financial situation, which is understandable.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer is B. The author isn't in the wrong. The friend's actions and lack of planning are the main issues here.\n"
