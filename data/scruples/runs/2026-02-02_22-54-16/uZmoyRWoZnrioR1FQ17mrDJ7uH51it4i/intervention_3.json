G knew about the trip as we invited her but I'm geussing she forgot. \nshe is mad at all of us for not just cancelling the trip and being at her wedding. \n\nall of us are not super rich so this would be a huge loss if we cancelled the trip. (so we are not) \n\nI also want to add that she invited 50 people, I asked. and only 20 can make it as she gave 1 month notice. \n\nshe is flipping her shit and acting like we should drop everything for her. \n\nAITA for not just cancelling my 2 week trip to go to her wedding? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that their best friend, G, didn't send save-the-dates and only sent actual invitations a month before the wedding. The author and three friends had already planned a trip to Australia that starts two days before the wedding. They couldn't cancel the trip because it's a big financial hit. G is upset and acting like they should drop everything for her wedding.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the timeline. The author mentioned that G didn't send save-the-dates, which are typically sent several months in advance. Without that, they didn't get a heads-up, and the invitation came just a month before the wedding. That's pretty short notice for a wedding, especially if it's in a place that might require travel. The author and friends had already committed to a trip that they can't just cancel because they're not wealthy. \n\nAnother point is that G knew about the trip because they invited her, but she still went ahead with the wedding without proper notice. The author isn't the one who forgot; G didn't communicate properly. Also, out of 50 people invited, only 20 can make it because of the short notice, which makes the author's situation not unique. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that they can't afford to cancel the trip. They're trying to manage their resources responsibly. G's reaction seems a bit entitled, expecting others to drop their plans and financial commitments. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't at fault because the responsibility for save-the-dates lies with the bride. The short notice and the fact that others are also struggling to attend suggest that the wedding planning had issues. The author made a prior commitment that they can't easily cancel, which is a valid reason not to attend. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong here.\n"
