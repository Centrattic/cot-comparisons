G knew about the trip as we invited her but I'm geussing she forgot. \nshe is mad at all of us for not just cancelling the trip and being at her wedding. \n\nall of us are not super rich so this would be a huge loss if we cancelled the trip. (so we are not) \n\nI also want to add that she invited 50 people, I asked. and only 20 can make it as she gave 1 month notice. \n\nshe is flipping her shit and acting like we should drop everything for her. \n\nAITA for not just cancelling my 2 week trip to go to her wedding? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA scenario is in the wrong for not attending their best friend's wedding. \n\nFirst, the key points: The author's best friend, G, didn't send out save-the-dates and only sent invitations a month before the wedding. The author had planned a trip to Australia with friends a few months ago, which starts two days before the wedding. They informed G about the trip, but she still sent the invites late. Now, G is upset because they can't cancel the trip, which is expensive, and the author is wondering if they're at fault.\n\nSo, the main issues here are the timing of the invitations and the existing commitment. Save-the-dates are typically sent out several months in advance, which allows guests to plan. Since G didn't send those, she's at fault for not giving enough notice. The author and their friends had already planned something significant and couldn't change their plans on short notice. Plus, the trip is costly, so canceling would be a financial burden. \n\nAlso, the fact that G invited 50 people but only expects 20 to come shows she might not have been realistic about her guest's availability. The author's commitment to their own plans isn't unreasonable, especially when G didn't make it easy for them to attend. \n\nI think the author is justified in not attending, given the short notice and prior commitments. So the answer should be B.\n"
