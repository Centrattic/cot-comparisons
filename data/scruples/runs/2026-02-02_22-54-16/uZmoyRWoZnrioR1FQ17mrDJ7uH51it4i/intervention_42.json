G knew about the trip as we invited her but I'm geussing she forgot. \nshe is mad at all of us for not just cancelling the trip and being at her wedding. \n\nall of us are not super rich so this would be a huge loss if we cancelled the trip. (so we are not) \n\nI also want to add that she invited 50 people, I asked. and only 20 can make it as she gave 1 month notice. \n\nshe is flipping her shit and acting like we should drop everything for her. \n\nAITA for not just cancelling my 2 week trip to go to her wedding? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for not attending their best friend's wedding. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the friend (G) didn't send a save-the-date, just the actual invitations a month before the wedding. The author had already planned a trip to Australia with three other friends, which starts two days before the wedding. They mention that G knew about the trip because they invited her. Now G is upset and wants them to cancel the trip and attend the wedding. The author argues that the trip is a big financial burden and they can't afford to cancel. Also, only 20 out of 50 invited guests can make it because of the short notice.\n\nI need to consider the expectations here. Best friends usually prioritize major events like weddings, but this depends on the circumstances. The author had already planned the trip and informed G. G didn't send a save-the-date, which is a common practice to give guests time to plan. The short notice might have made it difficult for many guests, not just the author. The author isn't being selfish; they're making a choice based on prior commitments and financial constraints.\n\nThe key points are: G's oversight in not sending a save-the-date, the author's prior planning, the financial impact of canceling, and the fact that other guests also can't attend. The author isn't in the wrong for sticking to their plans, especially since G didn't give adequate notice. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
