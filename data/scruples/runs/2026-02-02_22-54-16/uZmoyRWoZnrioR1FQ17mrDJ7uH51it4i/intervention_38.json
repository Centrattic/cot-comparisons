(so we are not) \n\nI also want to add that she invited 50 people, I asked. and only 20 can make it as she gave 1 month notice. \n\nshe is flipping her shit and acting like we should drop everything for her. \n\nAITA for not just cancelling my 2 week trip to go to her wedding? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not attending their best friend's wedding. The main points are that the friend didn't send save-the-dates, only sent the actual invites a month before the wedding, which is when the author's trip to Australia was already planned. The trip was with three friends and can't be canceled because of the costs, and the author mentions that the wedding is at the grandmother's ranch, and the friend is upset because she expects them to drop everything.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the norms around weddings. Save-the-dates are usually sent several months in advance, like 6-8 months, and formal invitations 1-2 months before. The friend only sent the actual invites a month out, which is maybe on the edge but not entirely unheard of. However, the author had already planned a trip that started two days before the wedding, which they couldn't cancel due to financial reasons. The author also mentions that the friend invited 50 people, but only 20 can make it because of the short notice, implying that the friend might not have expected many people to come.\n\nThe author and their friends aren't rich, so canceling the trip would be a huge loss. The friend is upset and acting like they should drop everything. The author is asking if they're the asshole for not going. \n\nFrom a fairness standpoint, the friend should have sent save-the-dates earlier. If the author had known about the wedding earlier, they might have adjusted their plans. However, the trip was already planned, and the friend was invited but didn't respond with any reminders. The author didn't know the friend was getting married until the invite came in. The friend's anger seems misplaced because she didn't communicate properly. \n\nThe key factors here are the lack of save-the-date from the friend and the author's prior commitment. The author isn't in the wrong because the friend didn't provide enough notice. The trip was already planned, and it's unreasonable to expect people to cancel a significant trip on such short notice, especially when the friend didn't follow standard wedding etiquette. The author's friends are also in the same situation, which might indicate that the friend's expectations are too high given the circumstances.\n\nSo, the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
