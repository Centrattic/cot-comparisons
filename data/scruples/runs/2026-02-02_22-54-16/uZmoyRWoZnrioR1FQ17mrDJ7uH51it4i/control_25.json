      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for not attending their best friend's wedding. The situation is that the friend (G) sent the invitations only a month before the wedding, which conflicts with a planned trip to Australia. The author and friends had already planned the trip, and G knew about it but still sent the invites late. The author is wondering if they're at fault for not canceling the trip.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the timeline. Save-the-dates are usually sent months in advance, maybe 6-8 months before the wedding. The author mentions that G didn't send a save-the-date and only sent actual invitations a month before. That's a significant short notice. Typically, weddings are planned with 6-12 months notice, so a month is really short. That's a problem on G's part.\n\nThen, the trip to Australia was planned a few months ago. The author mentions that G was invited to the trip but apparently forgot or didn't prioritize the wedding. The author and friends aren't wealthy, so canceling the trip would be a big financial loss. They can't just drop everything. \n\nThe friend is upset and acting like they should cancel. But the author's main point is that the notice was too short, leading to a conflict that's not their fault. The fact that only 20 out of 50 invited guests can make it also shows that the short notice affected many people, not just the author. \n\nSo, the author is in a situation where the wedding was planned without proper notice, leading to conflicts. The author isn't at fault because they made the trip known in advance, and the friend didn't follow proper etiquette by sending invites too late. The author's responsibility isn't to drop their plans, especially since it's a financial burden. \n\nI think the answer is B (No, the author isn't in the wrong) because the fault lies with G for not giving proper notice. The author had a prior commitment that was planned well in advance, and it's unreasonable to expect them to cancel due to G's oversight.\n"
