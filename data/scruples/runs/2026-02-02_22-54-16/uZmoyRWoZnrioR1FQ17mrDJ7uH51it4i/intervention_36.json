      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not attending their best friend's wedding. The situation is that the friend, G, didn't send save-the-dates and just mailed the invitations a month before the wedding. The author had already planned a trip to Australia with three friends, which starts two days before the wedding. They can't cancel the trip because it's a backpacking trip and they're not super rich, so it's a big financial loss. G is upset and acting like they should drop everything to attend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if the author did something wrong. The key points here are the timing of the invitations and the existing commitments. G didn't give a save-the-date, which is typically a courtesy, and only sent actual invitations a month out. Generally, weddings require more notice, maybe 6-8 months, but sometimes less if it's a smaller event. However, a month's notice is pretty short. The author had a pre-existing trip that they planned a few months ago, which G knew about. So if G knew about the trip but still scheduled the wedding that close to the date, maybe she should have considered that. \n\nAlso, the author mentions that G invited 50 people but only expects 20 to come. That might indicate that G knew the notice was short. The author isn't in a financial position to cancel their trip, which adds to the difficulty. \n\nFrom a typical perspective, friends should make an effort to be there for each other's big events, but if the notice was too short and the trip was already planned, it's understandable not to cancel. The author isn't being inconsiderate; they had a valid reason. G might need to take responsibility for not planning ahead. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong here. The answer should be B.\n"
