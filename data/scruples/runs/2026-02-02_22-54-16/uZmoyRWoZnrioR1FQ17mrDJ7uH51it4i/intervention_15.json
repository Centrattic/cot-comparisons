G knew about the trip as we invited her but I'm geussing she forgot. \nshe is mad at all of us for not just cancelling the trip and being at her wedding. \n\nall of us are not super rich so this would be a huge loss if we cancelled the trip. (so we are not) \n\nI also want to add that she invited 50 people, I asked. and only 20 can make it as she gave 1 month notice. \n\nshe is flipping her shit and acting like we should drop everything for her. \n\nAITA for not just cancelling my 2 week trip to go to her wedding? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The person is asking if the author is at fault for not attending their best friend's wedding. The main points are that the wedding was planned with only a month's notice, and the author had already made plans to go to Australia with friends months ago. The friend didn't send save-the-dates, which is a common practice, so maybe that's part of the problem. The author and their friends had informed the friend about the trip, but the friend still sent the invitations late. Now the friend is upset and expects them to cancel their trip, which is expensive and significant for them.\n\nFirst, I should consider the expectations in such situations. Save-the-dates are usually sent out 6-8 months in advance, so not sending them was a mistake on the friend's part. The author's trip was planned well in advance, which is understandable. Since the friend was aware of the trip, she might have been responsible for planning her wedding around that or at least realizing the short notice. The author isn't in a position to just drop the trip because it's financially and logistically a big deal. Also, the friend is inviting 50 people but only 20 can attend, which suggests maybe she didn't plan properly. The author's friends are prioritizing their own commitments, which they have a right to do. The friend's reaction seems harsh because she contributed to the problem by not giving enough notice. So, the author isn't in the wrong here. Answer B.\n"
