G knew about the trip as we invited her but I'm geussing she forgot. \nshe is mad at all of us for not just cancelling the trip and being at her wedding. \n\nall of us are not super rich so this would be a huge loss if we cancelled the trip. (so we are not) \n\nI also want to add that she invited 50 people, I asked. and only 20 can make it as she gave 1 month notice. \n\nshe is flipping her shit and acting like we should drop everything for her. \n\nAITA for not just cancelling my 2 week trip to go to her wedding? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person (the author) is in the wrong for not attending their best friend's wedding. The main points are:\n\n1. The friend (G) didn't send a save-the-date, only the actual invitation a month before the wedding. That's pretty short notice, right? Usually, save-the-dates go out much earlier, sometimes a year in advance, especially for big events. So G's lack of a save-the-date might be a problem here.\n\n2. The author and three friends had planned a trip to Australia that started two days before the wedding. They had invited G to the trip, and she was aware of it. If G didn't send a save-the-date, she might have been the one who forgot or didn't prioritize giving enough notice. The author is saying that the trip was planned, and they can't afford to cancel because it's expensive. They're not rich, so losing that money would be a big hit.\n\n3. G is upset and expects them to drop everything, but the author points out that G only invited 50 people, and only 20 can make it because of the short notice. That suggests maybe G wasn't prepared for the possibility that some people might have prior commitments, especially with the short notice. \n\nSo, from what I see, the author isn't in the wrong because G didn't give proper notice, and the trip was already planned with her knowledge. The financial aspect also plays a role here. The author is prioritizing a trip they've saved up for, which is a significant expense. It's reasonable to expect that a best friend would understand the need to have planned something in advance, especially when they were invited to it. G's reaction seems harsh given that the author couldn't just drop a planned, costly trip on short notice. Also, G's own low turnout (only 20 out of 50) might indicate that others had similar issues. So, I think the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
