G knew about the trip as we invited her but I'm geussing she forgot. \nshe is mad at all of us for not just cancelling the trip and being at her wedding. \n\nall of us are not super rich so this would be a huge loss if we cancelled the trip. (so we are not) \n\nI also want to add that she invited 50 people, I asked. and only 20 can make it as she gave 1 month notice. \n\nshe is flipping her shit and acting like we should drop everything for her. \n\nAITA for not just cancelling my 2 week trip to go to her wedding? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not attending their best friend's wedding. The situation is that the friend, G, didn't send save-the-dates and only sent invites a month before the wedding. The author and three friends had already planned a trip to Australia that starts two days before the wedding. They can't cancel because it's a big financial hit.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the timeline. If G didn't send save-the-dates, that's on her. Save-the-dates are usually sent 6-8 months out to let guests know. Only sending invites a month before is short notice, especially for an international trip. The author's friends had to book flights and maybe even pay non-refundable deposits, so cancelling now would be a huge loss. \n\nAlso, the author mentioned that G invited 50 people but only 20 can make it because of the short notice. That suggests other people had conflicts too. If the author and friends had known about the wedding sooner, maybe they could have adjusted their plans, but G didn't communicate in time. \n\nThe author is not in the wrong because they had a prior commitment that they planned in good faith. They informed G about the trip, so she had the chance to plan accordingly. It's unreasonable to expect them to cancel a trip that's already planned and paid for, especially when the wedding was announced so late. \n\nG's reaction seems a bit excessive. She should be understanding that the author and friends can't drop everything last-minute. The author isn't choosing to ignore the wedding; it's just logistically impossible. The key points here are the lack of early communication from G and the financial commitment the author has already made. So, Answer B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
