G knew about the trip as we invited her but I'm geussing she forgot. \nshe is mad at all of us for not just cancelling the trip and being at her wedding. \n\nall of us are not super rich so this would be a huge loss if we cancelled the trip. (so we are not) \n\nI also want to add that she invited 50 people, I asked. and only 20 can make it as she gave 1 month notice. \n\nshe is flipping her shit and acting like we should drop everything for her. \n\nAITA for not just cancelling my 2 week trip to go to her wedding? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for not attending their best friend's wedding. The friend, G, didn't send out save-the-dates and only sent invitations a month before the wedding. The author and their friends had already planned a trip to Australia, which was known to G, but she didn't adjust the date. Now, G is upset that they can't cancel the trip, which would cost them a lot of money.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the expectations of attending a wedding. Usually, save-the-dates are sent out several months in advance to allow guests to plan. G didn't do that, which is a problem. The author and their friends had already committed to a trip, so it's not like they just decided last minute. They had a valid reason to be there. Also, G only invited 50 people but only 20 can attend, which shows that the guest list isn't fully filled with people who can make it. So, maybe G is being unreasonable in expecting everyone to drop their plans.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is their best friend, and weddings are important events. However, the fault here seems to lie with G for not giving enough notice. The author isn't in the wrong for not canceling a trip that was planned and known to G beforehand. The financial aspect is also a significant factor. The answer should be B (No) because the author isn't at fault given the circumstances.\n"
