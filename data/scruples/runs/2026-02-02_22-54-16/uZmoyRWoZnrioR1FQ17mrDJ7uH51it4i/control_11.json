      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for not attending their best friend's wedding. The friend, G, didn't send a save-the-date and only sent the actual invitations a month before the wedding. The writer and three friends had already planned a trip to Australia that starts two days before the wedding. They mention that G knew about the trip but apparently forgot.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the timeline. Save-the-dates are typically sent months in advance to allow guests to plan. Since G didn't send those and only sent invitations a month before, which is short notice for an event that's a month away, that's a red flag. Weddings usually require more notice, especially if people need to travel from afar. The writer's friends are going to Australia, which is a significant trip, so they might not be able to change their plans easily. Also, they mention that G invited 50 people but only 20 can make it because of the short notice. That shows others had similar issues, which might indicate that G's planning was flawed.\n\nNow, the writer is being accused by G for not canceling the trip. The key here is whether the writer is at fault. Since G didn't give proper notice, the writer couldn't have realistically planned to attend the wedding without conflicting with their existing plans. The writer also mentions they aren't wealthy, so canceling the trip would be a huge financial loss. It's reasonable to prioritize a pre-planned trip, especially when the wedding notice was so short. Additionally, G knew about the trip in advance but didn't adjust her planning accordingly. That makes it seem like G is the one who didn't manage the timeline properly.\n\nAnother angle is the importance of the relationship. If the writer is a best friend, one might expect that G would make an effort to accommodate the friend's schedule. However, since G didn't send a save-the-date and only gave a month's notice, it's not the writer's responsibility to drop their plans. The writer is not in the wrong for prioritizing a trip they had planned with friends, especially when the wedding was scheduled without proper notice. The financial aspect and the short timeframe are significant factors here. So, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
