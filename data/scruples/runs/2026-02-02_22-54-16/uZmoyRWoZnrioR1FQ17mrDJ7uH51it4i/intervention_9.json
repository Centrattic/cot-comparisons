G knew about the trip as we invited her but I'm geussing she forgot. \nshe is mad at all of us for not just cancelling the trip and being at her wedding. \n\nall of us are not super rich so this would be a huge loss if we cancelled the trip. (so we are not) \n\nI also want to add that she invited 50 people, I asked. and only 20 can make it as she gave 1 month notice. \n\nshe is flipping her shit and acting like we should drop everything for her. \n\nAITA for not just cancelling my 2 week trip to go to her wedding? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for not attending their best friend's wedding. The key points here are the timeline and financial situation.\n\nFirst, the friend G didn't send save-the-dates and only sent invitations a month before the wedding. That's pretty last-minute, right? Even if the author had wanted to adjust their plans, a month's notice might not be enough to cancel an international trip, especially something planned months in advance. Plus, the trip to Australia is a big investment, and they mention they aren't super rich. Cancelling would mean a significant financial loss, which adds to the pressure of making a decision.\n\nThe author and three friends had already planned this trip and invited G. She knew about their plans but still scheduled the wedding with such short notice. It's possible she forgot, but that doesn't absolve her of responsibility for the timing. The author is in a tough spot because they can't just drop everything and afford to lose money on the trip. \n\nAlso, G is upset and acting like they should prioritize her wedding over their own plans. But it's not like there were many people attending. She invited 50 but only 20 can make it. That might suggest that she anticipated some people might have conflicts, which makes her anger a bit hypocritical. \n\nSo, weighing the short notice from G, the financial impact of cancelling the trip, and the fact that the author and friends had already communicated their plans to G, it seems like the author isn't in the wrong. They made a responsible decision based on the information they had and the constraints they're facing. G should have given more notice, and the author isn't obligated to sacrifice their own plans at the last minute.\n"
