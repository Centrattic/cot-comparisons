G knew about the trip as we invited her but I'm geussing she forgot. \nshe is mad at all of us for not just cancelling the trip and being at her wedding. \n\nall of us are not super rich so this would be a huge loss if we cancelled the trip. (so we are not) \n\nI also want to add that she invited 50 people, I asked. and only 20 can make it as she gave 1 month notice. \n\nshe is flipping her shit and acting like we should drop everything for her. \n\nAITA for not just cancelling my 2 week trip to go to her wedding? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is at fault for not attending their best friend's wedding. The friend didn't send save-the-dates and only sent invitations a month before the wedding. The author and three friends had planned a trip to Australia that starts two days before the wedding. They couldn't cancel because of financial reasons.\n\nFirst, the main points: The friend didn't give adequate notice. Save-the-dates are usually sent a few months in advance, and the actual invites a couple of months before. Here, the invites came just a month before, which is short notice. The trip was planned earlier, and the friend was aware of it. The author might feel that since the friend didn't plan properly, it's not their responsibility to drop plans now.\n\nAlso, the friend is upset and acting like everyone should drop everything. The author mentions that only 20 out of 50 invited guests can attend because of the short notice. That suggests the friend might have known the invite list was short, but maybe she expected more. The financial aspect is a big factor too; cancelling the trip would be a huge loss, so it's a valid reason not to change plans.\n\nThe key points are the short notice from the friend, prior knowledge of the trip by the author, and the financial implications. These factors support the idea that the author isn't at fault. The friend's reaction might be unreasonable given her own planning issues. So, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
