G knew about the trip as we invited her but I'm geussing she forgot. \nshe is mad at all of us for not just cancelling the trip and being at her wedding. \n\nall of us are not super rich so this would be a huge loss if we cancelled the trip. (so we are not) \n\nI also want to add that she invited 50 people, I asked. and only 20 can make it as she gave 1 month notice. \n\nshe is flipping her shit and acting like we should drop everything for her. \n\nAITA for not just cancelling my 2 week trip to go to her wedding? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not attending their best friend's wedding. The situation is that the wedding was announced with only a month's notice, which is pretty short. The author had already planned a trip to Australia with friends that starts two days before the wedding. They couldn't cancel because it's a big financial hit.\n\nFirst, the friend didn't send save-the-dates, so the author didn't know about the wedding until the last minute. The author had already committed to the trip, which they can't afford to cancel. The friend is upset and expects them to drop everything, but the author is standing by their decision. The user thinks the author is right, but wants confirmation.\n\nSo, from an outsider perspective, the friend made the mistake of not giving proper notice. Save-the-dates are usually sent months in advance. By not doing that, the friend is partly responsible for the conflict. The author had a valid reason to go on the trip and couldn't change plans due to financial constraints. The friend's reaction seems a bit harsh, expecting others to cancel significant plans without proper notice. The author isn't in the wrong here. Answer B.\n"
