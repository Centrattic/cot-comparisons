G knew about the trip as we invited her but I'm geussing she forgot. \nshe is mad at all of us for not just cancelling the trip and being at her wedding. \n\nall of us are not super rich so this would be a huge loss if we cancelled the trip. (so we are not) \n\nI also want to add that she invited 50 people, I asked. and only 20 can make it as she gave 1 month notice. \n\nshe is flipping her shit and acting like we should drop everything for her. \n\nAITA for not just cancelling my 2 week trip to go to her wedding? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this AITA question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not attending their best friend's wedding. The situation is that the wedding was scheduled with only a month's notice, and the author had already planned a trip to Australia with three friends, which conflicts with the wedding. The author mentioned that they informed their friend about the trip, but the friend forgot to send save-the-dates and is now upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the timeline. The author and friends had planned a trip months ago and invited the friend, who then scheduled her wedding without giving a save-the-date. The friend only sent the actual invitations a week before, giving a month of notice. The wedding is at her grandmother's ranch, which might be a destination in itself, but the author can't attend because their trip starts two days before. They also mention that not many people can make it due to the short notice.\n\nNow, the key points here are the lack of save-the-dates, the last-minute invitations, the financial commitment of the trip, and the friend's reaction. The author is being blamed for not cancelling the trip, but they argue it's a significant financial loss. \n\nFrom a typical AITA perspective, responsibility is often shared. However, the friend's role here is questionable. Save-the-dates are customary, especially for weddings, to avoid scheduling conflicts. By not sending one, the friend didn't give guests enough time to plan. The author did inform her about the trip beforehand, so the friend should have been aware. However, the author might have expected the friend to either adjust the date or send save-the-dates earlier.\n\nFinancial aspects matter too. The trip is a big expense, and cancelling would mean a loss. The friend is upset but also responsible for the short notice. The fact that only 20 out of 50 invitees can attend shows that others have conflicts as well, which the friend might have anticipated. Her reaction of flipping out seems unfair, especially since she didn't plan ahead properly.\n\nOn the other hand, the author could have tried to reschedule the trip if possible, but it's not mentioned if that's an option. The friends are going together, so maybe the trip is non-negotiable. The author's main point is that they're not in the wrong because the friend didn't provide enough notice and the trip is already planned and paid for.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the author isn't at fault. The friend's poor planning and lack of communication are the main issues here. The author taking responsibility by informing the friend about the trip shows they were considerate, but the friend's oversight led to the conflict. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
