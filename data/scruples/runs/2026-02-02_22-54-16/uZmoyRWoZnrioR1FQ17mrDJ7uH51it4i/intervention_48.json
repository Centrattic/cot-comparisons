G knew about the trip as we invited her but I'm geussing she forgot. \nshe is mad at all of us for not just cancelling the trip and being at her wedding. \n\nall of us are not super rich so this would be a huge loss if we cancelled the trip. (so we are not) \n\nI also want to add that she invited 50 people, I asked. and only 20 can make it as she gave 1 month notice. \n\nshe is flipping her shit and acting like we should drop everything for her. \n\nAITA for not just cancelling my 2 week trip to go to her wedding? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is at fault for not attending their best friend's wedding. The key points here are the timeline of events and the reasoning behind the author's decision.\n\nFirst, the friend G didn't send out save-the-dates, only the actual invitations a month before the wedding. That's pretty short notice for a significant event. The author had already planned a trip to Australia with three friends, which was scheduled to start just two days before the wedding. They had invited G to the trip, so she was aware of their plans. Now, G is upset and expects them to cancel the trip, but the author can't afford to lose the money for the trip since they're not wealthy.\n\nThe main issue here is the lack of proper communication from G. Save-the-dates are typically sent out months in advance so guests can make other plans. By not doing that, G may have contributed to the conflict. The author and friends had their trip planned, and while it's a personal choice to prioritize the trip over the wedding, the short notice complicates things. Also, G inviting 50 people but only expecting 20 to attend suggests she might have overestimated or not considered the logistics properly.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that they can't afford to cancel, which adds financial pressure. The fact that G is \"flipping her shit\" about this might indicate she's not handling the situation well, especially since she had prior knowledge of their plans. The friends were invited to the trip, so G knew about their schedule in advance. Therefore, the author isn't necessarily at fault because the responsibility was on G to send out save-the-dates and respect the existing commitments of her friends.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong here. The fault lies more with G for not giving proper notice and expecting last-minute changes to an already planned trip. The answer should be B.\n"
