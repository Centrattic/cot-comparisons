G knew about the trip as we invited her but I'm geussing she forgot. \nshe is mad at all of us for not just cancelling the trip and being at her wedding. \n\nall of us are not super rich so this would be a huge loss if we cancelled the trip. (so we are not) \n\nI also want to add that she invited 50 people, I asked. and only 20 can make it as she gave 1 month notice. \n\nshe is flipping her shit and acting like we should drop everything for her. \n\nAITA for not just cancelling my 2 week trip to go to her wedding? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the person who wrote the AITA post) is in the wrong for not attending their best friend's wedding. The friend, G, didn't send a save-the-date and only sent the actual invitation a month before the wedding. The author and three friends had already planned a trip to Australia, which starts two days before the wedding. They can't cancel the trip because it's a big financial hit. G is upset and wants them to drop everything.\n\nFirst, responsibility of the wedding host: Typically, the host (G) should send out save-the-dates well in advance, maybe a year or so before, and invitations a few months ahead. By only sending out invitations a month before, G didn't give enough notice. That's a problem on her end. Guests usually need time to make travel arrangements, especially international trips. So the author's friends couldn't cancel because the trip was already planned, and they're not in a position to drop it financially.\n\nThen there's the expectation of being a best friend. The user might think the author should prioritize the wedding, but realistically, if the host didn't plan properly, it's unfair to hold guests accountable. Also, G invited 50 people, but only 20 can make it. That suggests that others couldn't make it either, so it's not just the author's group. The author isn't in the wrong for not cancelling a trip that was planned after being invited to the wedding. They even mentioned inviting G to the trip, which shows they considered her in their plans. \n\nFinancial aspect is a big factor here. Cancelling a trip to Australia would be a huge loss, which isn't feasible for them. G's reaction of flipping her shit might indicate she's being unreasonable. The author is not in the wrong because the fault lies with G's poor planning and not giving enough notice. They had a prior commitment that they can't realistically back out of without significant consequences. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
