G knew about the trip as we invited her but I'm geussing she forgot. \nshe is mad at all of us for not just cancelling the trip and being at her wedding. \n\nall of us are not super rich so this would be a huge loss if we cancelled the trip. (so we are not) \n\nI also want to add that she invited 50 people, I asked. and only 20 can make it as she gave 1 month notice. \n\nshe is flipping her shit and acting like we should drop everything for her. \n\nAITA for not just cancelling my 2 week trip to go to her wedding? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not attending their best friend's wedding. The main points are that the friend didn't send a save-the-date, only a one-month notice, and the author had already planned a trip to Australia with friends. The trip starts two days before the wedding, so they can't cancel. The friend is upset and expects them to drop everything.\n\nHmm, the author's reasoning is that they're not super rich, so canceling the trip would be a huge loss. Also, the friend invited 50 people but only 20 can make it. The author thinks they're not wrong, but wants opinions.\n\nFirst, the friend didn't send a save-the-date, which is a common etiquette step. That's on her. She had a responsibility to give proper notice for a wedding. The author had a prior commitment that was known months ago, and she invited them but forgot. So the author isn't at fault for not canceling a trip they had planned, especially when the notice was short. The friend's reaction seems unreasonable given her own missteps. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
