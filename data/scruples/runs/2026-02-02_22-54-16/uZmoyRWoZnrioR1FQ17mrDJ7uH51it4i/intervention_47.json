(so we are not) \n\nI also want to add that she invited 50 people, I asked. and only 20 can make it as she gave 1 month notice. \n\nshe is flipping her shit and acting like we should drop everything for her. \n\nAITA for not just cancelling my 2 week trip to go to her wedding? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not attending their best friend's wedding. The situation involves the friend not sending a save-the-date, only the actual invitation a month before the wedding. The author and three friends had planned a trip to Australia that starts two days before the wedding. The friend, G, is upset that they didn't cancel the trip. The author argues that the trip is expensive and they aren't wealthy.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the timeline. Save-the-dates are usually sent several months in advance to allow guests to plan. G didn't send one, which is a common courtesy. By only sending invitations a month before, she gave the guests little time to adjust their schedules. The author had already planned a trip months ago and included G in the planning. It's possible G forgot about the trip when scheduling her wedding, but that's on her for not giving proper notice.\n\nThe cost is another factor. The user mentions they're not super rich, so canceling the trip would be a significant financial loss. Sacrificing a pre-planned trip at short notice, especially when the wedding notice was inadequate, might not be fair to expect. Additionally, only 20 out of 50 invited guests can attend, suggesting that the venue and timing might not be ideal for many people.\n\nHowever, the author is close friends with G, so there might be an expectation of attendance. But considering the lack of proper notice and the financial implications, it's understandable that the author can't cancel. The key points are the inadequate planning by G and the financial burden on the author. In many cases, it's the host's responsibility to give enough notice, and guests aren't obligated to drop plans made in good faith. So, the author isn't in the wrong here.\n"
