(so we are not) \n\nI also want to add that she invited 50 people, I asked. and only 20 can make it as she gave 1 month notice. \n\nshe is flipping her shit and acting like we should drop everything for her. \n\nAITA for not just cancelling my 2 week trip to go to her wedding? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not attending their best friend's wedding. The situation is that the friend didn't send a save-the-date and only sent the actual invitations a month before the wedding. The author had already planned a trip to Australia with friends, which starts two days before the wedding. They can't reschedule because it's a big financial hit and not everyone is wealthy. The friend is upset and expects them to drop the trip.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the timeline. The friend didn't send a save-the-date, which is a common practice to allow guests to plan. Sending the actual invitation just a month before is very short notice, especially for an international trip. The author and friends had already committed to Australia, so they can't just cancel without significant loss. \n\nNext, the number of guests\u201450 invited, but only 20 can make it. That suggests some people might have had similar scheduling conflicts. The friend is upset, but maybe she should have planned better. The author isn't the only one in this situation; their friends are also affected. The friend knew about the trip beforehand but still sent the invite so late. \n\nFinancial constraints are a big factor here. The author mentions they're not super rich, so canceling the trip would be a huge loss. It's understandable that they can't just drop everything, especially since the wedding notice was short. The friend's reaction seems harsh given the circumstances. \n\nI think the main issue is the friend's poor planning. If she had given more notice, maybe the author could have adjusted their plans. But with only a month's notice, especially for an international trip, it's not feasible. The author isn't in the wrong here. They made a commitment and can't reschedule without serious consequences. So the answer should be B.\n"
