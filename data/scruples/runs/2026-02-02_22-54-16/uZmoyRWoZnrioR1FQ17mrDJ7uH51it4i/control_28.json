      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not attending their best friend's wedding. The friend didn't send a save-the-date, just the actual invite a month before the wedding. The author and three friends had planned a trip to Australia that starts two days before the wedding, and they can't cancel because it's a huge financial loss. The friend is upset and expects them to drop everything, even though only 20 out of 50 invited guests can make it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the friend's actions. Not sending a save-the-date is a big oversight, especially for a close friend's wedding. Usually, save-the-dates are sent out several months in advance so guests have time to plan. The author mentions the trip was planned months ago, and they had invited the friend, who apparently forgot or didn't remember. That's a key point. The friend's poor planning led to this conflict.\n\nThen, the financial aspect. The author and friends aren't wealthy, so canceling the trip would be a huge loss. That's a valid reason not to go back on their plans. The trip was planned ahead of time, and the friend's late notice made it impossible to adjust. The friend is upset, but expecting others to sacrifice financially for a last-minute invite isn't fair.\n\nAlso, the fact that only 20 out of 50 guests can attend shows that the short notice affected many people. The author isn't the only one who can't make it, so the friend's reaction might be unreasonable. The author isn't being inconsiderate; they tried to plan ahead and are facing consequences beyond their control.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author should have checked in with the friend about the wedding date earlier. But since the friend didn't send a save-the-date, that's on her. The author isn't at fault here. The situation is more about the friend's poor communication and planning. So, the answer is B\u2014the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
