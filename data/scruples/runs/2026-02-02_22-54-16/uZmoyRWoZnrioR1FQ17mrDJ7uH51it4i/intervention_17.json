G knew about the trip as we invited her but I'm geussing she forgot. \nshe is mad at all of us for not just cancelling the trip and being at her wedding. \n\nall of us are not super rich so this would be a huge loss if we cancelled the trip. (so we are not) \n\nI also want to add that she invited 50 people, I asked. and only 20 can make it as she gave 1 month notice. \n\nshe is flipping her shit and acting like we should drop everything for her. \n\nAITA for not just cancelling my 2 week trip to go to her wedding? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is in the wrong for not attending their best friend's wedding. The main points are:\n\n1. The friend (G) didn't send a save-the-date, only the actual invitation a month before the wedding.\n2. The author and friends had planned a trip to Australia months ago, starting two days before the wedding. They invited G, who apparently forgot or didn't consider this when planning her wedding.\n3. The trip is a big financial commitment, and canceling would be a huge loss. Only 20 out of 50 invited guests can attend because of the short notice.\n4. G is upset and expects them to cancel the trip, acting like they should drop everything for her.\n\nFirst, the author's actions. They had a trip planned long before the wedding, which G was aware of. The problem here is that G didn't give proper notice\u2014save-the-dates are typically sent out several months in advance. By not sending one, she made it harder for guests to plan. The author's trip was already scheduled, and it's understandable they wouldn't want to lose the money. Financial constraints are a real issue, so canceling would be a significant hit.\n\nThen there's the expectation. G seems to expect that her best friend should prioritize her wedding over a planned trip, but if she didn't communicate properly, that's on her. Also, the fact that only a third of the guests can attend due to the short notice suggests that the planning was disorganized. The author and friends made an effort to invite G to their trip, which shows they care, but she didn't consider their plans when setting the date.\n\nThe key factors here are communication and prior commitments. G's failure to send a save-the-date led to the conflict. The author's decision not to attend, given the circumstances, is reasonable. They can't be blamed for not canceling a trip that was planned with knowledge from G, who forgot to account for their schedule. So, the answer is B\u2014author isn't in the wrong.\n"
