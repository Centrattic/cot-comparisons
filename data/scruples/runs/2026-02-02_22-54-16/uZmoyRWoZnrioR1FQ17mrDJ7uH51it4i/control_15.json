(so we are not) \n\nI also want to add that she invited 50 people, I asked. and only 20 can make it as she gave 1 month notice. \n\nshe is flipping her shit and acting like we should drop everything for her. \n\nAITA for not just cancelling my 2 week trip to go to her wedding? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about missing a best friend's wedding because of a planned trip to Australia.\n\nFirst, the friend G didn't send out save-the-dates and only sent the actual invitations a month before the wedding. The user and three friends had already planned a trip to Australia that starts two days before the wedding. The user mentions that G knew about the trip but didn't send the save-the-date. The trip is a significant financial commitment, and they can't afford to cancel. G is upset and expects them to drop everything.\n\nSo, the key points here are the timing of the invitations, the prior commitment, and the financial aspect. If the user and friends had been planning the trip for a while and G was aware, then she should have sent a save-the-date earlier. Weddings typically require save-the-dates well in advance, sometimes months ahead, so that guests can make plans. By not sending a save-the-date, G might have contributed to the problem. Additionally, the user is being asked to cancel a trip that's already booked and expensive, which is a big sacrifice. \n\nThe user is not the one who missed the communication; they had informed G about the trip. G had the chance to send the save-the-date earlier but didn't. So the user might not be in the wrong here. The main issue is G's poor planning. The fact that only 20 out of 50 invited people can attend because of the short notice also shows that the problem isn't just on the user's side. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer is likely B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. G's failure to provide early notice complicates things, and the trip was already planned with her knowledge.\n"
