(so we are not) \n\nI also want to add that she invited 50 people, I asked. and only 20 can make it as she gave 1 month notice. \n\nshe is flipping her shit and acting like we should drop everything for her. \n\nAITA for not just cancelling my 2 week trip to go to her wedding? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA scenario is in the wrong for not attending their best friend's wedding. The friend sent invitations only a month before the event, which is short notice. The author had already planned a trip to Australia with friends, which starts two days before the wedding. The trip was planned months ago, and the author mentions that they can't afford to cancel it. The friend is upset and expects them to drop everything.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the norms around weddings. Typically, save-the-dates are sent out several months in advance, and formal invitations follow a couple of months before the event. The friend didn't send a save-the-date, which is a common practice to let guests know the date in advance. By only giving a month's notice, the friend might have made it harder for guests to adjust their plans, especially for those who need to travel internationally, like the author's trip to Australia.\n\nThe author's situation is that they already had plans made for a while, which were known to the friend. Since the friend didn't communicate the wedding date earlier, the author couldn't have adjusted their schedule. The author also points out that only 20 out of 50 invited people can make it because of the short notice. This suggests that the friend's expectations might be unreasonable given the lack of early communication from their side.\n\nOn the other hand, the friend is upset because they expected their best friend to prioritize the wedding. However, the author is in a financial situation where canceling the trip would be a huge loss. The trip was planned with others, so changing plans might not be feasible for everyone involved. \n\nConsidering all this, the author isn't in the wrong because the friend didn't provide adequate notice and the author had prior commitments that couldn't be easily changed. The friend's reaction seems unreasonable given the circumstances. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
