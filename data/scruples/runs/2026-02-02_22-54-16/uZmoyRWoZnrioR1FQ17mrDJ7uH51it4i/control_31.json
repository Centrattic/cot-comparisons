G knew about the trip as we invited her but I'm geussing she forgot. \nshe is mad at all of us for not just cancelling the trip and being at her wedding. \n\nall of us are not super rich so this would be a huge loss if we cancelled the trip. (so we are not) \n\nI also want to add that she invited 50 people, I asked. and only 20 can make it as she gave 1 month notice. \n\nshe is flipping her shit and acting like we should drop everything for her. \n\nAITA for not just cancelling my 2 week trip to go to her wedding? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for not attending their best friend's wedding.\n\nFirst, the friend (G) didn't send save-the-dates and only sent invitations a month before the wedding. The author and their friends had planned a trip to Australia months ago, which starts two days before the wedding. They can't cancel because it's expensive. G is upset and thinks they should drop the trip. \n\nSo, the key points here are the timing of the invitations. Save-the-dates are usually sent several months in advance, so not sending one might be a big oversight. If the wedding was a month after the invites were sent, that's a short notice. The author had a prior commitment they were planning for a while, which they informed G about. \n\nG invited 50 people but only 20 can attend because of the short notice. The author's friends can't attend, and G is upset. But if the author had known earlier, maybe they could adjust. However, since the invites came late, the trip was already planned. Financial constraints are a factor, and it's a big trip. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because the friend didn't give enough notice. The trip was planned in advance, and they can't just cancel without losing money. G should have sent save-the-dates. So the answer is B.\n"
