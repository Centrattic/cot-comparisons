G knew about the trip as we invited her but I'm geussing she forgot. \nshe is mad at all of us for not just cancelling the trip and being at her wedding. \n\nall of us are not super rich so this would be a huge loss if we cancelled the trip. (so we are not) \n\nI also want to add that she invited 50 people, I asked. and only 20 can make it as she gave 1 month notice. \n\nshe is flipping her shit and acting like we should drop everything for her. \n\nAITA for not just cancelling my 2 week trip to go to her wedding? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for not attending their best friend's wedding. So, first, the setup: The friend, G, didn't send save-the-dates and only sent invitations a month before the wedding. The author and three friends had planned a trip to Australia that starts two days before the wedding. They invited G to the trip, but it seems she forgot or didn't consider the timing. Now, G is upset that they can't cancel the trip to attend.\n\nThe author argues that the trip was planned in advance, and they aren't wealthy enough to afford canceling it. Also, G sent the invites too late, and many people can't attend because of the short notice. The author isn't in the wrong? Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, the timing. G didn't send save-the-dates, which is a common courtesy. Save-the-dates are usually sent several months in advance so guests can plan. By not doing that, G made it difficult for people to adjust their schedules. The invitations came a month before, which is even shorter. That's a pretty tight timeline for a wedding, especially if people have existing plans.\n\nThe author and friends had already planned the Australia trip. They invited G to join them, which implies they wanted her to be part of their plans. But G didn't coordinate her wedding date with their trip. Since they've already committed to the trip, and it's a significant expense, it's understandable they can't just drop everything. Also, they mention that only 20 out of 50 invited guests can attend because of the short notice, which suggests that G's expectations might be unrealistic.\n\nOn the other hand, the wedding is a big event, and the author is one of the best friends. G might feel hurt or neglected because her best friend isn't there. But the author is in a tough spot here. They were invited to the trip and were told about the wedding plans later, which clashed. The author isn't at fault for the short notice from G. It's G's responsibility to communicate the wedding plans earlier, especially for close friends.\n\nAnother angle: Should the author have adjusted their plans? If the trip was flexible, maybe. But if it was already booked and the author isn't rich, canceling would be a huge loss. Plus, G's lack of communication is a key point here. If the author had known about the wedding date earlier, maybe they could have rearranged. But since they didn't get the save-the-date, they couldn't plan around it.\n\nSo considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. The fault lies more with G for not giving proper notice. The author made plans and can't afford to cancel them. So the answer should be B.\n"
