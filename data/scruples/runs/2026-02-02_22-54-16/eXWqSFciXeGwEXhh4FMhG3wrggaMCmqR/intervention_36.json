And she's not super on top of keeping her hands washed. \n\nI like to eat handfuls of shredded cheese as a snack. \n\nMy wife will take my bag of cheese out of the fridge and stick her unwashed hand into my cheese, **immediately** after taking her fingers out of her mouth. \n\nThat is fucking disgusting IMO. Now the whole bag of cheese is ruined, and my snack is gone. \n\nSo I started buying her her own bags of cheese. I clearly labeled each bag with either her name or mine.  \n\nFF to the next morning, and she has *my* bag of cheese. Hers is still sitting in the fridge (opened, and contaminated by her unwashed hands). She didn't bother checking the labels. So now she has two bags of cheese, and I have 0. \n\nNext step: I buy a mini fridge and put it in my bedroom. We have seperate bedrooms, so I figured I was solving the problem.   \n\nBut NO. 3 days later, I get home from work and she's **sitting on my bed, eating my bag of cheese**. There was still plenty of cheese in the main fridge. This is not a money issue. I don't care if she eats 100 bags of cheese. I just want **my** cheese to be **my** cheese, so I know it hasn't had unwashed hands in it. \n\nSo I installed a deadbolt on my bedroom door, and I keep my room locked whenever I am not home. Now my cheese is safe. My wife still has plenty of cheese to eat. She just no longer has access to **my fucking cheese**. \n\nShe says it shouldn't matter, since we kiss all the time. But I don't want to eat cheese that has someone else's stale saliva on it. No matter how much I love her, food safety is food safety. She is introducing germs into a fertile breeding ground, and I just can't get over that. I need my cheese to be clean. \n\nSo, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for installing a lock on his bedroom door to keep his cheese safe from his wife's actions. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The husband is upset because his wife takes his cheese without washing her hands after biting her nails. He's tried labeling the cheese and even getting a separate mini fridge, but she still ends up with his cheese. So he locks his room to prevent her from accessing his cheese. She argues that it's not a big deal because they kiss, but he's concerned about germs and food safety.\n\nNow, the key points here. The husband's actions are about personal boundaries and health concerns. He's not restricting her access to food entirely; he's just protecting his own stash. He's made multiple attempts to solve the problem without confrontation, like buying her her own cheese and a mini fridge. However, she continues to take his cheese despite the labels and the fridge. \n\nThe wife's perspective is that since they share a life and kiss, the germs shouldn't matter. But the husband's discomfort is about hygiene, which is a personal preference. Shouldn't he have the right to set boundaries, especially when it comes to food safety? \n\nAlso, considering that they have separate bedrooms already, the husband's decision to lock his room seems like a reasonable step to maintain his personal space and his personal property. Installing a lock isn't about keeping her out of his room entirely but protecting his specific item (the cheese). \n\nIs there any harm in the husband's actions? He's not withholding food from her; he's just keeping his own separate. The wife might feel it's overreacting, but the husband's health concerns are valid from his perspective. It's about respecting personal boundaries. \n\nSo, in terms of right or wrong, the husband isn't violating any rules. He's taking measures to protect his personal items from someone who's not respecting his requests. The wife isn't in the right for taking his cheese repeatedly despite the efforts made to prevent it. \n\nTherefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
