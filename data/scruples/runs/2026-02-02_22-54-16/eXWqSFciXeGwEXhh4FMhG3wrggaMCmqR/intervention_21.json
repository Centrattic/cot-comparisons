And she's not super on top of keeping her hands washed. \n\nI like to eat handfuls of shredded cheese as a snack. \n\nMy wife will take my bag of cheese out of the fridge and stick her unwashed hand into my cheese, **immediately** after taking her fingers out of her mouth. \n\nThat is fucking disgusting IMO. Now the whole bag of cheese is ruined, and my snack is gone. \n\nSo I started buying her her own bags of cheese. I clearly labeled each bag with either her name or mine.  \n\nFF to the next morning, and she has *my* bag of cheese. Hers is still sitting in the fridge (opened, and contaminated by her unwashed hands). She didn't bother checking the labels. So now she has two bags of cheese, and I have 0. \n\nNext step: I buy a mini fridge and put it in my bedroom. We have seperate bedrooms, so I figured I was solving the problem.   \n\nBut NO. 3 days later, I get home from work and she's **sitting on my bed, eating my bag of cheese**. There was still plenty of cheese in the main fridge. This is not a money issue. I don't care if she eats 100 bags of cheese. I just want **my** cheese to be **my** cheese, so I know it hasn't had unwashed hands in it. \n\nSo I installed a deadbolt on my bedroom door, and I keep my room locked whenever I am not home. Now my cheese is safe. My wife still has plenty of cheese to eat. She just no longer has access to **my fucking cheese**. \n\nShe says it shouldn't matter, since we kiss all the time. But I don't want to eat cheese that has someone else's stale saliva on it. No matter how much I love her, food safety is food safety. She is introducing germs into a fertile breeding ground, and I just can't get over that. I need my cheese to be clean. \n\nSo, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the person who wrote the situation) is in the wrong for locking their bedroom door to keep their cheese safe from their wife's habits.\n\nFirst, the author's wife has a habit of biting her nails and not washing her hands. She then uses these hands to take cheese from the fridge immediately after her mouth. The author finds this gross and wants to keep their snacks clean. They tried labeling the cheese, but the wife didn't check the labels and ended up taking the author's cheese. Then the author bought a mini fridge in their bedroom, but the wife still accessed it. So, they installed a lock.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks the author isn't, but they want an opinion. Let me consider both sides.\n\nOn one hand, the author has a legitimate concern about hygiene. They have a right to their belongings and to feel comfortable with their food's cleanliness. The wife's actions are the root cause here\u2014she's touching food with unwashed hands after biting her nails. The author tried several solutions, like labeling and a mini fridge, but those didn't work. Installing a lock seems like a final step to protect their own space and belongings. It's their bedroom, so locking it isn't inherently wrong. People often lock rooms or private spaces for privacy or security reasons.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the author is overreacting. The situation is about cheese, which might seem trivial to some. Also, in a shared household, there might be an expectation of mutual respect and compromise. However, the author's actions are about personal space and health concerns, which are valid. The wife's behavior is the initial issue here. The author's response is proportionate given the repeated failures of other solutions. Locking the door is a reasonable step to maintain their own standards of cleanliness, even if it's just about cheese.\n\nAnother angle: the wife's argument that they kiss and share saliva doesn't hold in this context. Kissing isn't the same as handling food with unwashed hands. The author's concern isn't about sharing germs through kisses but about hygiene when handling food. So the wife's point is a bit of a non-sequitur. The author isn't against sharing germs in general but specifically wants their own food to be clean.\n\nAlso, the author mentions they don't care if she eats a lot of cheese; it's about the cleanliness. So it's not about quantity but about personal standards. In that case, the author has the right to set boundaries regarding their own food.\n\nConsidering all this, the author's actions are a reasonable response to a repeated problem that they've tried to address in other ways. Locking the door is a way to enforce their personal boundaries without affecting the wife's access to her own cheese. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
