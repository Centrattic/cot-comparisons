And she's not super on top of keeping her hands washed. \n\nI like to eat handfuls of shredded cheese as a snack. \n\nMy wife will take my bag of cheese out of the fridge and stick her unwashed hand into my cheese, **immediately** after taking her fingers out of her mouth. \n\nThat is fucking disgusting IMO. Now the whole bag of cheese is ruined, and my snack is gone. \n\nSo I started buying her her own bags of cheese. I clearly labeled each bag with either her name or mine.  \n\nFF to the next morning, and she has *my* bag of cheese. Hers is still sitting in the fridge (opened, and contaminated by her unwashed hands). She didn't bother checking the labels. So now she has two bags of cheese, and I have 0. \n\nNext step: I buy a mini fridge and put it in my bedroom. We have seperate bedrooms, so I figured I was solving the problem.   \n\nBut NO. 3 days later, I get home from work and she's **sitting on my bed, eating my bag of cheese**. There was still plenty of cheese in the main fridge. This is not a money issue. I don't care if she eats 100 bags of cheese. I just want **my** cheese to be **my** cheese, so I know it hasn't had unwashed hands in it. \n\nSo I installed a deadbolt on my bedroom door, and I keep my room locked whenever I am not home. Now my cheese is safe. My wife still has plenty of cheese to eat. She just no longer has access to **my fucking cheese**. \n\nShe says it shouldn't matter, since we kiss all the time. But I don't want to eat cheese that has someone else's stale saliva on it. No matter how much I love her, food safety is food safety. She is introducing germs into a fertile breeding ground, and I just can't get over that. I need my cheese to be clean. \n\nSo, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is in the wrong for installing a lock on their bedroom door to keep their cheese safe from their wife's habits. \n\nFirst, the person's issue is that their wife bites her nails and doesn't wash her hands, then uses her fingers in their cheese. They tried labeling the cheese, buying a mini fridge, but she still ends up with the wrong bag. The final step is locking the bedroom door. \n\nThe question is about right or wrong. The user thinks the author is not in the wrong. I need to consider both sides. \n\nOn one hand, the author's actions are about personal hygiene and safety. They have a legitimate concern about contamination, even if it's specific to their own food preferences. The wife's actions are indeed unhygienic, and the author is trying to protect their own food. Locking the door might seem extreme, but it's a solution they've come up with to solve the problem. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the wife's actions are not malicious, just a habit, and the author's response is overreacting. Also, in a shared living space, having separate rooms is common, but locking the bedroom door might be seen as creating unnecessary separation. However, the author mentions they have separate bedrooms, so putting the mini fridge there is understandable. The wife entering the room and taking the cheese despite the fridge being available could be seen as disregarding the author's boundaries.\n\nThe key points are personal hygiene, respecting boundaries, and reasonable solutions. The author is taking steps to protect their own food, which others might view as reasonable given the circumstances. The wife's actions are the root cause here. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. They're acting to maintain their personal standards, and the wife's behavior is the issue. The answer should be B.\n"
