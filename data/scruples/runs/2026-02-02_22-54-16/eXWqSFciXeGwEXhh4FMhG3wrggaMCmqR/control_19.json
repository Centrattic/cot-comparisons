And she's not super on top of keeping her hands washed. \n\nI like to eat handfuls of shredded cheese as a snack. \n\nMy wife will take my bag of cheese out of the fridge and stick her unwashed hand into my cheese, **immediately** after taking her fingers out of her mouth. \n\nThat is fucking disgusting IMO. Now the whole bag of cheese is ruined, and my snack is gone. \n\nSo I started buying her her own bags of cheese. I clearly labeled each bag with either her name or mine.  \n\nFF to the next morning, and she has *my* bag of cheese. Hers is still sitting in the fridge (opened, and contaminated by her unwashed hands). She didn't bother checking the labels. So now she has two bags of cheese, and I have 0. \n\nNext step: I buy a mini fridge and put it in my bedroom. We have seperate bedrooms, so I figured I was solving the problem.   \n\nBut NO. 3 days later, I get home from work and she's **sitting on my bed, eating my bag of cheese**. There was still plenty of cheese in the main fridge. This is not a money issue. I don't care if she eats 100 bags of cheese. I just want **my** cheese to be **my** cheese, so I know it hasn't had unwashed hands in it. \n\nSo I installed a deadbolt on my bedroom door, and I keep my room locked whenever I am not home. Now my cheese is safe. My wife still has plenty of cheese to eat. She just no longer has access to **my fucking cheese**. \n\nShe says it shouldn't matter, since we kiss all the time. But I don't want to eat cheese that has someone else's stale saliva on it. No matter how much I love her, food safety is food safety. She is introducing germs into a fertile breeding ground, and I just can't get over that. I need my cheese to be clean. \n\nSo, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong. Let me read through the details again to make sure I understand everything.\n\nThe author is married, and their wife has a habit of biting her nails and not washing her hands. The author likes to eat shredded cheese, and the wife takes the author's cheese from the fridge, using her unwashed hands right after her mouth. The author finds this gross and starts buying separate labeled cheese bags. Then the wife ignores the labels and uses the author's bag again. So the author gets a mini fridge in their bedroom, but the wife still goes in and eats the cheese from there. Finally, the author locks their bedroom door with a deadbolt to keep the cheese safe. The wife is upset, saying that since they kiss, it shouldn't matter, but the author is concerned about hygiene.\n\nSo the question is: is the author in the wrong? Answer A or B.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author's main issue is about personal hygiene and food safety. They want their food to be uncontaminated, which is a reasonable concern. The wife, on the other hand, might feel that the author is being overly controlling or not trusting her. The author's actions escalate from labeling to a mini fridge to locking the door, which might be seen as excessive by some.\n\nBut the key here is the author's right to personal space and their own food. The wife is using the author's food without permission, despite the author's efforts to separate. The author is trying to protect their own stuff. However, locking the bedroom door might be seen as cutting off shared space unnecessarily, especially if they live together. But they do have separate bedrooms, so maybe that's their setup.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, people often have different boundaries. The author's actions are about personal hygiene, which is a valid reason. The wife's reaction might be based on differing perspectives on cleanliness. The author isn't cutting off the wife from food entirely\u2014they still have their own. The author is just protecting their own portion.\n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because they're setting boundaries for their own comfort and hygiene. The wife's actions of taking the cheese without respecting the labels and the mini fridge setup were violations that led to the author's final action. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
