And she's not super on top of keeping her hands washed. \n\nI like to eat handfuls of shredded cheese as a snack. \n\nMy wife will take my bag of cheese out of the fridge and stick her unwashed hand into my cheese, **immediately** after taking her fingers out of her mouth. \n\nThat is fucking disgusting IMO. Now the whole bag of cheese is ruined, and my snack is gone. \n\nSo I started buying her her own bags of cheese. I clearly labeled each bag with either her name or mine.  \n\nFF to the next morning, and she has *my* bag of cheese. Hers is still sitting in the fridge (opened, and contaminated by her unwashed hands). She didn't bother checking the labels. So now she has two bags of cheese, and I have 0. \n\nNext step: I buy a mini fridge and put it in my bedroom. We have seperate bedrooms, so I figured I was solving the problem.   \n\nBut NO. 3 days later, I get home from work and she's **sitting on my bed, eating my bag of cheese**. There was still plenty of cheese in the main fridge. This is not a money issue. I don't care if she eats 100 bags of cheese. I just want **my** cheese to be **my** cheese, so I know it hasn't had unwashed hands in it. \n\nSo I installed a deadbolt on my bedroom door, and I keep my room locked whenever I am not home. Now my cheese is safe. My wife still has plenty of cheese to eat. She just no longer has access to **my fucking cheese**. \n\nShe says it shouldn't matter, since we kiss all the time. But I don't want to eat cheese that has someone else's stale saliva on it. No matter how much I love her, food safety is food safety. She is introducing germs into a fertile breeding ground, and I just can't get over that. I need my cheese to be clean. \n\nSo, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for installing a lock on their bedroom door to keep their cheese safe from their wife's habits. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The main issue is the wife taking the husband's cheese after using her hands in her mouth and not washing them. The husband wants his cheese to be clean, so he takes steps to secure it, even to the point of a mini fridge in his room and then locking the door. \n\nNow, the question is whether he's wrong. Let's break it down. The husband is trying to protect his personal space and his food preferences. The wife isn't respecting his boundaries, even after he tried to label the cheese and provide a separate fridge. The wife's actions are causing him discomfort, and he's taking measures to prevent that.\n\nBut is there a problem with his solution? Well, having separate bedrooms might mean they already have some separation. Installing a lock might be extreme, but if they live together, it's possible that having separate spaces is their choice. However, in some cases, locking a bedroom door could be seen as creating a barrier in the relationship. But the husband's reasoning is about hygiene and personal space, which are valid concerns.\n\nThe wife might feel that he's overreacting, but the husband's stance is about his health and comfort. The key here is mutual respect for boundaries. The wife isn't respecting his food preferences, and he's trying to enforce his boundaries. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The husband has the right to his own space and preferences, especially regarding food. However, the wife might feel that his actions are isolating her or creating unnecessary distance. But given the context, the husband's actions seem like a reasonable response to protect his own needs, even if the methods might be seen as extreme by some.\n\nSo, I think the answer is B, No, the author is not in the wrong because he's asserting his boundaries to maintain his hygiene standards, which is his right. The wife isn't respecting his preferences despite his efforts, so his actions are a logical next step.\n"
