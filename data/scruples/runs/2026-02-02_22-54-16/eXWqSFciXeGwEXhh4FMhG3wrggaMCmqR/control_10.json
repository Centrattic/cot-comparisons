And she's not super on top of keeping her hands washed. \n\nI like to eat handfuls of shredded cheese as a snack. \n\nMy wife will take my bag of cheese out of the fridge and stick her unwashed hand into my cheese, **immediately** after taking her fingers out of her mouth. \n\nThat is fucking disgusting IMO. Now the whole bag of cheese is ruined, and my snack is gone. \n\nSo I started buying her her own bags of cheese. I clearly labeled each bag with either her name or mine.  \n\nFF to the next morning, and she has *my* bag of cheese. Hers is still sitting in the fridge (opened, and contaminated by her unwashed hands). She didn't bother checking the labels. So now she has two bags of cheese, and I have 0. \n\nNext step: I buy a mini fridge and put it in my bedroom. We have seperate bedrooms, so I figured I was solving the problem.   \n\nBut NO. 3 days later, I get home from work and she's **sitting on my bed, eating my bag of cheese**. There was still plenty of cheese in the main fridge. This is not a money issue. I don't care if she eats 100 bags of cheese. I just want **my** cheese to be **my** cheese, so I know it hasn't had unwashed hands in it. \n\nSo I installed a deadbolt on my bedroom door, and I keep my room locked whenever I am not home. Now my cheese is safe. My wife still has plenty of cheese to eat. She just no longer has access to **my fucking cheese**. \n\nShe says it shouldn't matter, since we kiss all the time. But I don't want to eat cheese that has someone else's stale saliva on it. No matter how much I love her, food safety is food safety. She is introducing germs into a fertile breeding ground, and I just can't get over that. I need my cheese to be clean. \n\nSo, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is whether the author did something wrong by locking their bedroom door to keep their cheese away from their wife.\n\nFirst, let me recap the situation. The husband is upset because his wife takes his cheese from the fridge after biting her nails and not washing her hands. He tried labeling the cheese, but she still took his. Then he bought a mini fridge in his bedroom, but she went into his room and ate the cheese. So he locked the door.\n\nThe main issue here is about personal hygiene and boundaries. The husband is really bothered by the idea of his wife's unwashed hands, especially after biting her nails, touching his cheese. He's taking steps to protect his own food, which he sees as his property. The wife, on the other hand, might feel that sharing a home means sharing resources, and locking the bedroom door is an overreaction.\n\nFrom a personal responsibility angle, the husband has a right to his own space and belongings. If he's uncomfortable with his wife's habits, it's reasonable to set boundaries. However, locking the bedroom door might be seen as cutting off shared access to a space they both use. But since they have separate bedrooms, maybe the husband's room is his private space, so locking it isn't necessarily wrong.\n\nThe key points are: Is it reasonable to lock the door to protect his own property (cheese) when the wife isn't respecting his boundaries? The husband isn't trying to keep her out of the house, just his own room. The cheese is his, and he's making sure it's kept clean. The wife's actions are the initial problem here. \n\nThe wife might feel that the husband is being overly controlling, but the husband is justified in wanting food safety. So it's a matter of personal boundaries. Since the husband isn't doing anything to harm the wife or restrict her in a significant way beyond his own property, it's probably not wrong. The answer might be B (No).\n"
