And she's not super on top of keeping her hands washed. \n\nI like to eat handfuls of shredded cheese as a snack. \n\nMy wife will take my bag of cheese out of the fridge and stick her unwashed hand into my cheese, **immediately** after taking her fingers out of her mouth. \n\nThat is fucking disgusting IMO. Now the whole bag of cheese is ruined, and my snack is gone. \n\nSo I started buying her her own bags of cheese. I clearly labeled each bag with either her name or mine.  \n\nFF to the next morning, and she has *my* bag of cheese. Hers is still sitting in the fridge (opened, and contaminated by her unwashed hands). She didn't bother checking the labels. So now she has two bags of cheese, and I have 0. \n\nNext step: I buy a mini fridge and put it in my bedroom. We have seperate bedrooms, so I figured I was solving the problem.   \n\nBut NO. 3 days later, I get home from work and she's **sitting on my bed, eating my bag of cheese**. There was still plenty of cheese in the main fridge. This is not a money issue. I don't care if she eats 100 bags of cheese. I just want **my** cheese to be **my** cheese, so I know it hasn't had unwashed hands in it. \n\nSo I installed a deadbolt on my bedroom door, and I keep my room locked whenever I am not home. Now my cheese is safe. My wife still has plenty of cheese to eat. She just no longer has access to **my fucking cheese**. \n\nShe says it shouldn't matter, since we kiss all the time. But I don't want to eat cheese that has someone else's stale saliva on it. No matter how much I love her, food safety is food safety. She is introducing germs into a fertile breeding ground, and I just can't get over that. I need my cheese to be clean. \n\nSo, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for locking their bedroom door to prevent their wife from taking their cheese. \n\nFirst, the situation: The wife bites her nails and doesn't keep her hands clean. The husband likes to eat shredded cheese and is disturbed when she uses her unwashed hands (after biting) to take cheese from his bag. He starts labeling their cheese, but she ignores the labels and takes his. He then gets a mini fridge in his bedroom, but she still accesses it. Finally, he locks the door.\n\nThe key points here are about personal boundaries, shared living spaces, and food safety. The husband is expressing a concern about hygiene and wants his food to be uncontaminated. The wife, on the other hand, might feel that the husband is being overly possessive or not considering shared responsibilities.\n\nIn a shared household, it's reasonable for individuals to have personal space and to set boundaries. Installing a lock on a bedroom door is a common practice for privacy. However, the context here is food, which is a shared resource in many relationships. The husband's solution of a mini fridge in his bedroom is a step to maintain his personal choice, but when the wife accesses it despite that, locking the door could be seen as a necessary measure to respect his preferences.\n\nThe wife's argument that they kiss all the time might imply that she doesn't see the issue, but personal preferences about food hygiene can be strong. The husband isn't forbidding her from eating cheese; he's just protecting his own. The action of locking the door is about controlling his own space and belongings. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It depends on cultural norms and relationship dynamics. Legally, he's not in the wrong for securing his own property. Emotionally, it might cause tension, but his actions are about personal boundaries and hygiene. Therefore, the answer is B (No), he's not in the wrong.\n"
