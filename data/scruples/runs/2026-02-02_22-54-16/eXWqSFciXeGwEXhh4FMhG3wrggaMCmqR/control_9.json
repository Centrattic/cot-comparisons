And she's not super on top of keeping her hands washed. \n\nI like to eat handfuls of shredded cheese as a snack. \n\nMy wife will take my bag of cheese out of the fridge and stick her unwashed hand into my cheese, **immediately** after taking her fingers out of her mouth. \n\nThat is fucking disgusting IMO. Now the whole bag of cheese is ruined, and my snack is gone. \n\nSo I started buying her her own bags of cheese. I clearly labeled each bag with either her name or mine.  \n\nFF to the next morning, and she has *my* bag of cheese. Hers is still sitting in the fridge (opened, and contaminated by her unwashed hands). She didn't bother checking the labels. So now she has two bags of cheese, and I have 0. \n\nNext step: I buy a mini fridge and put it in my bedroom. We have seperate bedrooms, so I figured I was solving the problem.   \n\nBut NO. 3 days later, I get home from work and she's **sitting on my bed, eating my bag of cheese**. There was still plenty of cheese in the main fridge. This is not a money issue. I don't care if she eats 100 bags of cheese. I just want **my** cheese to be **my** cheese, so I know it hasn't had unwashed hands in it. \n\nSo I installed a deadbolt on my bedroom door, and I keep my room locked whenever I am not home. Now my cheese is safe. My wife still has plenty of cheese to eat. She just no longer has access to **my fucking cheese**. \n\nShe says it shouldn't matter, since we kiss all the time. But I don't want to eat cheese that has someone else's stale saliva on it. No matter how much I love her, food safety is food safety. She is introducing germs into a fertile breeding ground, and I just can't get over that. I need my cheese to be clean. \n\nSo, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for installing a lock on their bedroom door to keep their cheese safe from their wife. Hmm. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author's wife bites her nails and doesn't wash her hands properly. She takes his cheese, uses her unwashed hands right after her mouth to put her fingers into his cheese. The author finds this gross. He labels cheese bags, but she ignores the labels. Then he buys a mini fridge in his bedroom, but she still gets into his cheese. So he locks his room when he's not there.\n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong. The possible answers are A or B. I need to decide based on the situation.\n\nWell, from a personal boundaries standpoint, the author is trying to protect his personal space and belongings. He's not preventing his wife from eating cheese; he's just securing his own. The wife's actions are invading his space and contaminating his food. The lock is a response to repeated behavior. But is locking the door an overreaction?\n\nIn a shared living situation, both parties should respect each other's boundaries. The author's actions might be seen as necessary if the wife isn't respecting his attempts to keep his cheese separate. However, the wife might feel that the lock is an overreaction or a lack of trust. But the author's main point is about hygiene and personal preferences. \n\nThe wife's behavior is clearly causing the conflict. The author tried multiple solutions: labeling, separate fridge. When those failed, he took more drastic measures. It's his home, so he can lock his door. Unless there's a mutual agreement to live together without personal space, which isn't indicated here, the author's actions are reasonable. The wife might need to adjust her behavior, but the author isn't wrong for protecting his own space and food. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
