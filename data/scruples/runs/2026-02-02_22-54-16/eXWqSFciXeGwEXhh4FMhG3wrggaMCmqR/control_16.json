And she's not super on top of keeping her hands washed. \n\nI like to eat handfuls of shredded cheese as a snack. \n\nMy wife will take my bag of cheese out of the fridge and stick her unwashed hand into my cheese, **immediately** after taking her fingers out of her mouth. \n\nThat is fucking disgusting IMO. Now the whole bag of cheese is ruined, and my snack is gone. \n\nSo I started buying her her own bags of cheese. I clearly labeled each bag with either her name or mine.  \n\nFF to the next morning, and she has *my* bag of cheese. Hers is still sitting in the fridge (opened, and contaminated by her unwashed hands). She didn't bother checking the labels. So now she has two bags of cheese, and I have 0. \n\nNext step: I buy a mini fridge and put it in my bedroom. We have seperate bedrooms, so I figured I was solving the problem.   \n\nBut NO. 3 days later, I get home from work and she's **sitting on my bed, eating my bag of cheese**. There was still plenty of cheese in the main fridge. This is not a money issue. I don't care if she eats 100 bags of cheese. I just want **my** cheese to be **my** cheese, so I know it hasn't had unwashed hands in it. \n\nSo I installed a deadbolt on my bedroom door, and I keep my room locked whenever I am not home. Now my cheese is safe. My wife still has plenty of cheese to eat. She just no longer has access to **my fucking cheese**. \n\nShe says it shouldn't matter, since we kiss all the time. But I don't want to eat cheese that has someone else's stale saliva on it. No matter how much I love her, food safety is food safety. She is introducing germs into a fertile breeding ground, and I just can't get over that. I need my cheese to be clean. \n\nSo, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for installing a lock on their bedroom door and keeping it locked when they're not there. The situation involves the author's wife taking his cheese, which he doesn't want her to do because of hygiene issues.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author's main issue is with his wife using his cheese after touching her mouth and not washing her hands. He took steps to separate the cheese by buying separate bags and even a mini fridge in his bedroom. When that didn't work, he locked his door to prevent access. His wife argues that it shouldn't matter because they kiss, but he's adamant about food safety.\n\nNow, to determine if he's in the wrong. The question hinges on whether his actions are reasonable given his concerns. Food safety is a valid concern for many people. The author is not preventing his wife from having cheese; he's just securing his own. The deadbolt is a logical step after previous attempts failed. However, the wife might feel that he's being overly controlling or that the cheese is a shared resource in a marriage. \n\nBut the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The key factors are: the author's legitimate hygiene concerns, the steps he took to address them, and the fact that he's not restricting her access to cheese overall. Locking the bedroom door could be seen as a reasonable measure to protect his personal belongings, especially when his wife isn't respecting his efforts. The wife's argument about kissing might not address his specific concern about the cheese's cleanliness. \n\nHowever, in a shared living space, there might be expectations of some compromise. But since the author is providing his wife with her own cheese and the issue is about his personal preference, not about her needs, it's more about personal boundaries. So, from a food safety and personal space perspective, his actions are justified. Therefore, the answer is likely B (No, he's not in the wrong).\n"
