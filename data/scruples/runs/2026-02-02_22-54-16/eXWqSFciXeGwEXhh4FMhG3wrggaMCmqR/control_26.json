And she's not super on top of keeping her hands washed. \n\nI like to eat handfuls of shredded cheese as a snack. \n\nMy wife will take my bag of cheese out of the fridge and stick her unwashed hand into my cheese, **immediately** after taking her fingers out of her mouth. \n\nThat is fucking disgusting IMO. Now the whole bag of cheese is ruined, and my snack is gone. \n\nSo I started buying her her own bags of cheese. I clearly labeled each bag with either her name or mine.  \n\nFF to the next morning, and she has *my* bag of cheese. Hers is still sitting in the fridge (opened, and contaminated by her unwashed hands). She didn't bother checking the labels. So now she has two bags of cheese, and I have 0. \n\nNext step: I buy a mini fridge and put it in my bedroom. We have seperate bedrooms, so I figured I was solving the problem.   \n\nBut NO. 3 days later, I get home from work and she's **sitting on my bed, eating my bag of cheese**. There was still plenty of cheese in the main fridge. This is not a money issue. I don't care if she eats 100 bags of cheese. I just want **my** cheese to be **my** cheese, so I know it hasn't had unwashed hands in it. \n\nSo I installed a deadbolt on my bedroom door, and I keep my room locked whenever I am not home. Now my cheese is safe. My wife still has plenty of cheese to eat. She just no longer has access to **my fucking cheese**. \n\nShe says it shouldn't matter, since we kiss all the time. But I don't want to eat cheese that has someone else's stale saliva on it. No matter how much I love her, food safety is food safety. She is introducing germs into a fertile breeding ground, and I just can't get over that. I need my cheese to be clean. \n\nSo, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for installing a lock on their bedroom door to keep their cheese safe from their wife's habit of using unwashed hands after biting nails. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author wants their cheese to be clean, free from their wife's germs. They've tried labeling, separate fridges, but the wife ends up taking the wrong bag. So they lock their bedroom to keep their cheese private.\n\nThe key points here are about personal boundaries, shared living spaces, and health concerns. The author's actions are driven by their own hygiene preferences. They mention not caring about the cost, just wanting their cheese untouched. The wife is upset, but the author believes it's about food safety.\n\nNow, considering possible angles. In a shared home, is it reasonable to have a separate fridge? Maybe, if they have separate bedrooms. But locking the bedroom door might be seen as overreacting. The wife might feel it's unnecessary and creates distance between them. The author's reasoning is about cleanliness, but others might argue that in a marriage, such boundaries can lead to isolation or disrespect.\n\nAlso, the argument that they kiss each other might be used to counter the author's concern, implying that sharing saliva is part of the relationship. But the author is concerned about germs on food, which is different from kissing. However, the wife's actions are indeed unsanitary, which the author is trying to prevent.\n\nBut the solution of locking the door might be seen as extreme. Is there a middle ground? Like a separate fridge in a common area, but locked? Or maybe using containers with lids, or storing cheese in a way that's not accessible? The author's step is effective for them, but could be perceived as inconsiderate.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the wife is invading their private space (the bedroom) to take something, maybe they have a right to lock it. However, in some cultures or relationships, having a locked bedroom is normal. But others might see it as creating unnecessary separation.\n\nAlso, the author's reasoning is about personal health, which is important. If the wife's actions are indeed unsanitary, the author's precautions are valid. But the method of locking the room might be seen as an overreaction. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be B (No), because the author is protecting their personal hygiene preferences in their own space. However, there's a nuance. The wife might feel disrespected, but the author's actions are to maintain their own standards. It's a personal choice, and unless there's a breach of trust or shared understanding, it's about personal boundaries. The author isn't wrong for wanting their food to be clean, even if it comes across as extreme. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
