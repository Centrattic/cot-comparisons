And she's not super on top of keeping her hands washed. \n\nI like to eat handfuls of shredded cheese as a snack. \n\nMy wife will take my bag of cheese out of the fridge and stick her unwashed hand into my cheese, **immediately** after taking her fingers out of her mouth. \n\nThat is fucking disgusting IMO. Now the whole bag of cheese is ruined, and my snack is gone. \n\nSo I started buying her her own bags of cheese. I clearly labeled each bag with either her name or mine.  \n\nFF to the next morning, and she has *my* bag of cheese. Hers is still sitting in the fridge (opened, and contaminated by her unwashed hands). She didn't bother checking the labels. So now she has two bags of cheese, and I have 0. \n\nNext step: I buy a mini fridge and put it in my bedroom. We have seperate bedrooms, so I figured I was solving the problem.   \n\nBut NO. 3 days later, I get home from work and she's **sitting on my bed, eating my bag of cheese**. There was still plenty of cheese in the main fridge. This is not a money issue. I don't care if she eats 100 bags of cheese. I just want **my** cheese to be **my** cheese, so I know it hasn't had unwashed hands in it. \n\nSo I installed a deadbolt on my bedroom door, and I keep my room locked whenever I am not home. Now my cheese is safe. My wife still has plenty of cheese to eat. She just no longer has access to **my fucking cheese**. \n\nShe says it shouldn't matter, since we kiss all the time. But I don't want to eat cheese that has someone else's stale saliva on it. No matter how much I love her, food safety is food safety. She is introducing germs into a fertile breeding ground, and I just can't get over that. I need my cheese to be clean. \n\nSo, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. So, the author is a person who installed a lock on their bedroom door to prevent their wife from taking their cheese. The main issue here is about personal boundaries, food safety, and maybe even marital dynamics.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The author's wife has a habit of biting her nails and not washing her hands, which he finds gross. He likes to eat shredded cheese, and the wife takes his cheese after her fingers are in her mouth. He buys her her own cheese, labels them, but she ends up taking his anyway. Then he gets a mini fridge in his bedroom, but she still comes in and takes his cheese. So he locks his door to prevent her from accessing it.\n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong. The options are A for yes, B for no.\n\nThe user thinks he's not in the wrong. Let me consider both sides.\n\nOn one hand, the author is trying to protect his personal food from contamination. He's concerned about hygiene and food safety. He's also made efforts to provide his wife with her own cheese, but she ignores the labels. Locking the door could be seen as a reasonable step to protect his belongings, especially in their separate bedrooms. It's a shared living space, but they have separate rooms. The author's room is his private space, so locking it might be within his rights.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife might feel that the author is overreacting. The argument is that they are married, they kiss, so sharing food shouldn't be an issue. The wife's actions might be seen as normal in a shared household, but the author has specific health concerns. The wife's habit of not washing hands could be a problem, but the author's response of locking the door might be seen as an extreme measure. However, the author isn't keeping the wife out entirely; he just locks the door when he's not there. He still allows her access to her own cheese in the main fridge.\n\nAnother angle is communication. Did the author try to talk to his wife about his concerns? If he expressed his feelings and she continued to take his cheese despite his efforts, then locking the door could be a necessary action. But if he didn't communicate effectively, that might be a problem. However, the story mentions he clearly labeled the bags and bought a mini fridge, which suggests he tried to make things clear.\n\nFood safety is a legitimate concern here. The wife's habit of not washing hands does introduce a health risk. The author has a right to protect his food from contamination. Even in shared spaces, people can have different standards of cleanliness. The author's decision to lock his room is a personal choice to maintain his standards.\n\nThe wife's reaction that \"we kiss all the time\" is a common argument but doesn't address the specific issue of hygiene and food safety. Kissing doesn't mean someone wants to share saliva on cheese. The author is clear that it's not about the money but about his personal boundaries.\n\nConsidering all this, the author's actions seem like a reasonable response to protect his health and personal property. The lock is a personal choice in his own bedroom, which is his private space. Unless there's a shared understanding that he should allow access to his room's fridge, locking it isn't unreasonable. Therefore, the answer is likely B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
