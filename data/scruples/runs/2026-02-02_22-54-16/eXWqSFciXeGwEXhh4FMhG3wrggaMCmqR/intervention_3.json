And she's not super on top of keeping her hands washed. \n\nI like to eat handfuls of shredded cheese as a snack. \n\nMy wife will take my bag of cheese out of the fridge and stick her unwashed hand into my cheese, **immediately** after taking her fingers out of her mouth. \n\nThat is fucking disgusting IMO. Now the whole bag of cheese is ruined, and my snack is gone. \n\nSo I started buying her her own bags of cheese. I clearly labeled each bag with either her name or mine.  \n\nFF to the next morning, and she has *my* bag of cheese. Hers is still sitting in the fridge (opened, and contaminated by her unwashed hands). She didn't bother checking the labels. So now she has two bags of cheese, and I have 0. \n\nNext step: I buy a mini fridge and put it in my bedroom. We have seperate bedrooms, so I figured I was solving the problem.   \n\nBut NO. 3 days later, I get home from work and she's **sitting on my bed, eating my bag of cheese**. There was still plenty of cheese in the main fridge. This is not a money issue. I don't care if she eats 100 bags of cheese. I just want **my** cheese to be **my** cheese, so I know it hasn't had unwashed hands in it. \n\nSo I installed a deadbolt on my bedroom door, and I keep my room locked whenever I am not home. Now my cheese is safe. My wife still has plenty of cheese to eat. She just no longer has access to **my fucking cheese**. \n\nShe says it shouldn't matter, since we kiss all the time. But I don't want to eat cheese that has someone else's stale saliva on it. No matter how much I love her, food safety is food safety. She is introducing germs into a fertile breeding ground, and I just can't get over that. I need my cheese to be clean. \n\nSo, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for installing a lock on their bedroom door to keep their cheese safe from their wife. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author's wife bites her nails and doesn't wash her hands properly. She takes the author's cheese from the fridge with unwashed hands after putting her fingers in her mouth. This disgusts the author, so they started buying separate bags and labeling them. The wife ignored the labels and took his cheese again. Then he got a mini fridge in his bedroom, but she still took the cheese when he was away. Now he's locked his room, and the wife is upset. The author argues that food safety is important and that he wants his cheese uncontaminated. The wife says kissing each other shouldn't matter.\n\nSo, the main points are: the author wants to protect his cheese from contamination, he's taken multiple steps (labeling, separate fridge, locking the room), and the wife is not respecting his boundaries. The question is, is the author in the wrong for locking his door?\n\nI need to consider both sides. The author's actions are about personal hygiene and food safety, which are legitimate concerns. However, in a shared household, there might be expectations of mutual respect and communication. The wife might feel that the locks are unnecessary or a breach of trust. But the author's right to control access to his personal space (since they have separate bedrooms) could be seen as valid. The fact that he's not cutting her off entirely but just protecting his own belongings might tip the balance. Also, the wife's behavior of ignoring labels and taking his cheese without consent is problematic. So the author's actions are a reasonable response to repeated violations of his boundaries. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
