And she's not super on top of keeping her hands washed. \n\nI like to eat handfuls of shredded cheese as a snack. \n\nMy wife will take my bag of cheese out of the fridge and stick her unwashed hand into my cheese, **immediately** after taking her fingers out of her mouth. \n\nThat is fucking disgusting IMO. Now the whole bag of cheese is ruined, and my snack is gone. \n\nSo I started buying her her own bags of cheese. I clearly labeled each bag with either her name or mine.  \n\nFF to the next morning, and she has *my* bag of cheese. Hers is still sitting in the fridge (opened, and contaminated by her unwashed hands). She didn't bother checking the labels. So now she has two bags of cheese, and I have 0. \n\nNext step: I buy a mini fridge and put it in my bedroom. We have seperate bedrooms, so I figured I was solving the problem.   \n\nBut NO. 3 days later, I get home from work and she's **sitting on my bed, eating my bag of cheese**. There was still plenty of cheese in the main fridge. This is not a money issue. I don't care if she eats 100 bags of cheese. I just want **my** cheese to be **my** cheese, so I know it hasn't had unwashed hands in it. \n\nSo I installed a deadbolt on my bedroom door, and I keep my room locked whenever I am not home. Now my cheese is safe. My wife still has plenty of cheese to eat. She just no longer has access to **my fucking cheese**. \n\nShe says it shouldn't matter, since we kiss all the time. But I don't want to eat cheese that has someone else's stale saliva on it. No matter how much I love her, food safety is food safety. She is introducing germs into a fertile breeding ground, and I just can't get over that. I need my cheese to be clean. \n\nSo, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a husband who keeps his cheese in a mini fridge in his bedroom to avoid his wife eating it with her unwashed hands after biting her nails. He installed a lock because she keeps taking his cheese. The question is whether he's at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The wife's actions are a problem because she's contaminating the cheese with her unwashed hands after nail-biting. The husband tries labeling, then a mini fridge, which she bypasses. He locks his room to prevent that. He's not upset about the cost, just the hygiene.\n\nFrom a rights perspective, he's protecting his property. But maybe there's an expectation in a marriage to share resources? However, the article hinges on personal hygiene preferences. The wife's actions are unsanitary, and he's trying to avoid contamination. His solution is extreme (locking the door), but given the context, he's justified in wanting clean food. The wife might not see the issue, but the husband's hygiene concerns are valid. \n\nIs there a middle ground? Maybe, but the question is about being in the wrong. The wife's behavior is the root cause. The husband's measures are a response to her actions. So the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
