And she's not super on top of keeping her hands washed. \n\nI like to eat handfuls of shredded cheese as a snack. \n\nMy wife will take my bag of cheese out of the fridge and stick her unwashed hand into my cheese, **immediately** after taking her fingers out of her mouth. \n\nThat is fucking disgusting IMO. Now the whole bag of cheese is ruined, and my snack is gone. \n\nSo I started buying her her own bags of cheese. I clearly labeled each bag with either her name or mine.  \n\nFF to the next morning, and she has *my* bag of cheese. Hers is still sitting in the fridge (opened, and contaminated by her unwashed hands). She didn't bother checking the labels. So now she has two bags of cheese, and I have 0. \n\nNext step: I buy a mini fridge and put it in my bedroom. We have seperate bedrooms, so I figured I was solving the problem.   \n\nBut NO. 3 days later, I get home from work and she's **sitting on my bed, eating my bag of cheese**. There was still plenty of cheese in the main fridge. This is not a money issue. I don't care if she eats 100 bags of cheese. I just want **my** cheese to be **my** cheese, so I know it hasn't had unwashed hands in it. \n\nSo I installed a deadbolt on my bedroom door, and I keep my room locked whenever I am not home. Now my cheese is safe. My wife still has plenty of cheese to eat. She just no longer has access to **my fucking cheese**. \n\nShe says it shouldn't matter, since we kiss all the time. But I don't want to eat cheese that has someone else's stale saliva on it. No matter how much I love her, food safety is food safety. She is introducing germs into a fertile breeding ground, and I just can't get over that. I need my cheese to be clean. \n\nSo, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong for installing a lock on his bedroom door to keep his wife from taking his cheese. Hmm.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author is married and has a habit of eating shredded cheese. His wife bites her nails and doesn't keep her hands clean. She takes his cheese from the fridge with her unwashed hands after her fingers are in her mouth, which he finds disgusting. He then buys her her own cheese, labels them, but she still ends up taking his. So he gets a mini fridge in his bedroom. Then she enters his room and eats his cheese again, leading him to lock his door.\n\nThe question is about whether he's in the wrong. The possible answers are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nI should consider the key points here. The author's main issue is about hygiene and personal space. He's taking steps to protect his food from contamination due to his wife's habits. He's not trying to restrict her access to food, just his own. The wife's actions are causing a hygiene issue that he finds unacceptable. \n\nIn a shared living situation, especially a marriage, it's common for people to have differing boundaries. The author is trying to set a boundary to protect his personal belongings and health. Installing a lock seems extreme, but it's a solution he came up with after other attempts failed. The wife's argument about kissing not mattering doesn't address the actual concern of hygiene and contamination. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that locking the bedroom door could be seen as creating unnecessary distance. However, since they already have separate bedrooms, the lock might just be securing his own space. The author isn't trying to cut off communication or access entirely, just to protect his own belongings. \n\nThe main issue is about personal hygiene and the right to control one's own space. The author's actions are a response to a problem he's facing, and he's making it clear that he's not trying to be mean about food quantity but about cleanliness. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author is probably not in the wrong. His actions are a reasonable step to maintain his personal hygiene standards, and he's communicated his needs clearly. The wife's actions are the root cause, and the author is responding to protect his own well-being.\n"
