And she's not super on top of keeping her hands washed. \n\nI like to eat handfuls of shredded cheese as a snack. \n\nMy wife will take my bag of cheese out of the fridge and stick her unwashed hand into my cheese, **immediately** after taking her fingers out of her mouth. \n\nThat is fucking disgusting IMO. Now the whole bag of cheese is ruined, and my snack is gone. \n\nSo I started buying her her own bags of cheese. I clearly labeled each bag with either her name or mine.  \n\nFF to the next morning, and she has *my* bag of cheese. Hers is still sitting in the fridge (opened, and contaminated by her unwashed hands). She didn't bother checking the labels. So now she has two bags of cheese, and I have 0. \n\nNext step: I buy a mini fridge and put it in my bedroom. We have seperate bedrooms, so I figured I was solving the problem.   \n\nBut NO. 3 days later, I get home from work and she's **sitting on my bed, eating my bag of cheese**. There was still plenty of cheese in the main fridge. This is not a money issue. I don't care if she eats 100 bags of cheese. I just want **my** cheese to be **my** cheese, so I know it hasn't had unwashed hands in it. \n\nSo I installed a deadbolt on my bedroom door, and I keep my room locked whenever I am not home. Now my cheese is safe. My wife still has plenty of cheese to eat. She just no longer has access to **my fucking cheese**. \n\nShe says it shouldn't matter, since we kiss all the time. But I don't want to eat cheese that has someone else's stale saliva on it. No matter how much I love her, food safety is food safety. She is introducing germs into a fertile breeding ground, and I just can't get over that. I need my cheese to be clean. \n\nSo, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The main issue is about the husband installing a lock on his bedroom door to keep his wife from taking his cheese.\n\nFirst, I need to look at both sides. The husband is upset because his wife uses her hands, which she says are dirty after biting her nails, to take cheese from his fridge. He tried labeling the cheese and even got a mini fridge, but she still took his. He locked his room to prevent this. The wife argues that they kiss, so it shouldn't matter, but the husband is concerned about germs and food safety.\n\nHmm. On one hand, the husband has a legitimate concern about hygiene. If someone else uses unwashed hands to handle his food, it's understandable he'd be grossed out. He's making reasonable efforts to protect his personal items. On the other hand, the wife might feel that the husband is overreacting, especially since they share a life and intimate moments. The fact that they have separate bedrooms might mean they have some autonomy, but the husband's solution of locking the door could be seen as extreme.\n\nI need to consider if there's a middle ground. Maybe communication could resolve this. The husband could talk to his wife about his specific concerns without resorting to locking the door. But the husband has tried multiple steps (labeling, separate fridge) and the wife didn't respect that. The lock is a final measure to protect his property. \n\nIs the husband overstepping by locking the bedroom door? If they have separate bedrooms, then perhaps it's his space to control. However, sitting on someone's bed and eating their food might be more about boundaries than the cheese itself. The husband's actions might be seen as necessary to maintain his personal space and hygiene. \n\nThe wife's argument about kissing not mattering is a bit confusing. Kissing doesn't equate to sharing food, especially when there's a specific hygiene issue involved. The husband's need for clean food is valid. \n\nSo, considering all this, the husband's actions are a response to his wife's repeated disregard for his requests. He's trying to maintain his personal boundaries and hygiene. The wife's actions, taking the cheese despite labels and a separate fridge, might be the bigger issue here. Therefore, the husband isn't in the wrong for taking steps to protect his own belongings.\n"
