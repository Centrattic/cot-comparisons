And she's not super on top of keeping her hands washed. \n\nI like to eat handfuls of shredded cheese as a snack. \n\nMy wife will take my bag of cheese out of the fridge and stick her unwashed hand into my cheese, **immediately** after taking her fingers out of her mouth. \n\nThat is fucking disgusting IMO. Now the whole bag of cheese is ruined, and my snack is gone. \n\nSo I started buying her her own bags of cheese. I clearly labeled each bag with either her name or mine.  \n\nFF to the next morning, and she has *my* bag of cheese. Hers is still sitting in the fridge (opened, and contaminated by her unwashed hands). She didn't bother checking the labels. So now she has two bags of cheese, and I have 0. \n\nNext step: I buy a mini fridge and put it in my bedroom. We have seperate bedrooms, so I figured I was solving the problem.   \n\nBut NO. 3 days later, I get home from work and she's **sitting on my bed, eating my bag of cheese**. There was still plenty of cheese in the main fridge. This is not a money issue. I don't care if she eats 100 bags of cheese. I just want **my** cheese to be **my** cheese, so I know it hasn't had unwashed hands in it. \n\nSo I installed a deadbolt on my bedroom door, and I keep my room locked whenever I am not home. Now my cheese is safe. My wife still has plenty of cheese to eat. She just no longer has access to **my fucking cheese**. \n\nShe says it shouldn't matter, since we kiss all the time. But I don't want to eat cheese that has someone else's stale saliva on it. No matter how much I love her, food safety is food safety. She is introducing germs into a fertile breeding ground, and I just can't get over that. I need my cheese to be clean. \n\nSo, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. So first, I need to understand the situation.\n\nThe author is married and has a wife who bites her nails and doesn't keep her hands clean. He likes to eat shredded cheese, but his wife uses her unwashed hands right after her mouth to take cheese from his bag. He finds this gross and starts labeling the cheese bags. When that doesn't work, he gets a mini fridge in his bedroom. But she still takes his cheese from there, so he locks his door. Now he's asking if he's in the wrong (AITA?).\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong but wants my opinion. The options are A (Yes, wrong) or B (No, not wrong). \n\nHmm. Let's break this down. The core issue is about personal boundaries and cleanliness. The husband is disturbed by his wife's hygiene habits affecting his food. He's taken steps to prevent this: buying separate cheese, labeling, then a mini fridge. When those fail, he locks his door. \n\nFrom a fairness perspective, everyone has different cleanliness standards. The husband has a valid concern about food safety and personal space. The wife, on the other hand, might feel that the measures are excessive, especially since they're married and sharing a home. However, the key point is that the husband's actions are to protect his own food preferences, not to exclude his wife unnecessarily. \n\nThe wife's actions\u2014taking his cheese despite labels and a separate fridge\u2014show she isn't respecting his boundaries. The husband's response is about maintaining his personal space and hygiene standards. Locking the door isn't harmful beyond restricting access to his own room, which he has a right to do. \n\nIn relationships, compromise is important, but so is respecting individual boundaries. The husband isn't being malicious; he's trying to protect his own preferences. The wife's argument about kissing not mattering might be her way of saying she doesn't see the issue, but that doesn't negate his feelings. \n\nSo, I think the author isn't in the wrong. His actions are about personal hygiene and property, which are valid. The wife's actions are disregarding his boundaries. Therefore, the correct answer should be B.\n"
