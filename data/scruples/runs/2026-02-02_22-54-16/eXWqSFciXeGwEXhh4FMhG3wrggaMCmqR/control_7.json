  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for installing a lock on my bedroom door, and keeping it locked when I'm not there?\nMy wife has a nasty habit of biting her nails. And she's not super on top of keeping her hands washed. \n\nI like to eat handfuls of shredded cheese as a snack. \n\nMy wife will take my bag of cheese out of the fridge and stick her unwashed hand into my cheese, **immediately** after taking her fingers out of her mouth. \n\nThat is fucking disgusting IMO. Now the whole bag of cheese is ruined, and my snack is gone. \n\nSo I started buying her her own bags of cheese. I clearly labeled each bag with either her name or mine.  \n\nFF to the next morning, and she has *my* bag of cheese. Hers is still sitting in the fridge (opened, and contaminated by her unwashed hands). She didn't bother checking the labels. So now she has two bags of cheese, and I have 0. \n\nNext step: I buy a mini fridge and put it in my bedroom. We have seperate bedrooms, so I figured I was solving the problem.   \n\nBut NO. 3 days later, I get home from work and she's **sitting on my bed, eating my bag of cheese**. There was still plenty of cheese in the main fridge. This is not a money issue. I don't care if she eats 100 bags of cheese. I just want **my** cheese to be **my** cheese, so I know it hasn't had unwashed hands in it. \n\nSo I installed a deadbolt on my bedroom door, and I keep my room locked whenever I am not home. Now my cheese is safe. My wife still has plenty of cheese to eat. She just no longer has access to **my fucking cheese**. \n\nShe says it shouldn't matter, since we kiss all the time. But I don't want to eat cheese that has someone else's stale saliva on it. No matter how much I love her, food safety is food safety. She is introducing germs into a fertile breeding ground, and I just can't get over that. I need my cheese to be clean. \n\nSo, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The scenario is about a couple where the wife takes the husband's cheese after putting her unwashed hands in her mouth, which he finds gross. He tried various steps to prevent this, including a mini fridge and then locking his bedroom door. The question is if he's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze both sides. The husband's main issue is about hygiene and personal space. He's clearly communicated his discomfort with her handling his food after biting her nails and not washing hands. He's made efforts to accommodate her by buying separate cheese, labeling it, even getting a mini fridge. When that failed, he locked his room. \n\nOn the other hand, the wife's behavior is about not respecting his boundaries. She didn't heed the labels and took his cheese despite his efforts. The husband's actions of locking the door might be seen as extreme, but he's trying to protect his personal space and hygiene. The argument that they kiss doesn't hold because it's about specific food handling he finds unhygienic.\n\nIs he in the wrong? Well, he's not doing anything harmful to her. Locking his own room is his right, especially if they have separate bedrooms. The problem is her not respecting his boundaries. So the answer is B (No), he's not in the wrong. The wife is the one overstepping by taking his cheese despite the measures he took.\n"
