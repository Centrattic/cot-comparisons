And she's not super on top of keeping her hands washed. \n\nI like to eat handfuls of shredded cheese as a snack. \n\nMy wife will take my bag of cheese out of the fridge and stick her unwashed hand into my cheese, **immediately** after taking her fingers out of her mouth. \n\nThat is fucking disgusting IMO. Now the whole bag of cheese is ruined, and my snack is gone. \n\nSo I started buying her her own bags of cheese. I clearly labeled each bag with either her name or mine.  \n\nFF to the next morning, and she has *my* bag of cheese. Hers is still sitting in the fridge (opened, and contaminated by her unwashed hands). She didn't bother checking the labels. So now she has two bags of cheese, and I have 0. \n\nNext step: I buy a mini fridge and put it in my bedroom. We have seperate bedrooms, so I figured I was solving the problem.   \n\nBut NO. 3 days later, I get home from work and she's **sitting on my bed, eating my bag of cheese**. There was still plenty of cheese in the main fridge. This is not a money issue. I don't care if she eats 100 bags of cheese. I just want **my** cheese to be **my** cheese, so I know it hasn't had unwashed hands in it. \n\nSo I installed a deadbolt on my bedroom door, and I keep my room locked whenever I am not home. Now my cheese is safe. My wife still has plenty of cheese to eat. She just no longer has access to **my fucking cheese**. \n\nShe says it shouldn't matter, since we kiss all the time. But I don't want to eat cheese that has someone else's stale saliva on it. No matter how much I love her, food safety is food safety. She is introducing germs into a fertile breeding ground, and I just can't get over that. I need my cheese to be clean. \n\nSo, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for installing a lock on their bedroom door to keep their cheese separate. \n\nFirst, the author's main issue is with their wife's nail-biting and not washing hands before putting them into his cheese. That's clearly a hygiene concern. He tried labeling the cheese, but she still took his bag. Then he bought a mini fridge in his room, but she went into his room to take the cheese again. So he locked the door.\n\nNow, the key points. The author's actions are about personal space and food safety. He's not denying her food; he's just keeping his own separate. The wife argues that since they kiss, it shouldn't matter, but that's not a valid counter to hygiene preferences. \n\nLegally, in a shared household, each person has the right to their own space and belongings. The author is protecting his own property. Even if they live together, personal items can be kept private. Installing a lock isn't unreasonable if the other person is repeatedly accessing private spaces without permission. \n\nEmotionally, the author is stressed about germs, which is a valid concern. The wife's actions are invading his personal space, which is a boundary issue. The author's response is a reasonable escalation after multiple attempts to resolve the issue failed. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
