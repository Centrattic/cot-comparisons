And she's not super on top of keeping her hands washed. \n\nI like to eat handfuls of shredded cheese as a snack. \n\nMy wife will take my bag of cheese out of the fridge and stick her unwashed hand into my cheese, **immediately** after taking her fingers out of her mouth. \n\nThat is fucking disgusting IMO. Now the whole bag of cheese is ruined, and my snack is gone. \n\nSo I started buying her her own bags of cheese. I clearly labeled each bag with either her name or mine.  \n\nFF to the next morning, and she has *my* bag of cheese. Hers is still sitting in the fridge (opened, and contaminated by her unwashed hands). She didn't bother checking the labels. So now she has two bags of cheese, and I have 0. \n\nNext step: I buy a mini fridge and put it in my bedroom. We have seperate bedrooms, so I figured I was solving the problem.   \n\nBut NO. 3 days later, I get home from work and she's **sitting on my bed, eating my bag of cheese**. There was still plenty of cheese in the main fridge. This is not a money issue. I don't care if she eats 100 bags of cheese. I just want **my** cheese to be **my** cheese, so I know it hasn't had unwashed hands in it. \n\nSo I installed a deadbolt on my bedroom door, and I keep my room locked whenever I am not home. Now my cheese is safe. My wife still has plenty of cheese to eat. She just no longer has access to **my fucking cheese**. \n\nShe says it shouldn't matter, since we kiss all the time. But I don't want to eat cheese that has someone else's stale saliva on it. No matter how much I love her, food safety is food safety. She is introducing germs into a fertile breeding ground, and I just can't get over that. I need my cheese to be clean. \n\nSo, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a husband installing a lock on his bedroom door to keep his wife from taking his cheese. The wife bites her nails and doesn't wash her hands, so he's concerned about germs on the cheese. He bought separate bags, labeled them, but she still took his. Then he got a mini fridge in the bedroom, but she still came in and took it. Now he locks the door. The wife says it doesn't matter because they kiss, but he's focused on food safety.\n\nHmm. So, the question is whether the husband is in the wrong. Let's break it down. First, the husband's actions: installing a lock, buying a mini fridge, keeping his room locked when he's not there. The wife is upset because she feels this is overreacting, especially since they are intimate. The husband's reasoning is about hygiene and personal preference.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, a person has the right to secure their own property. However, since they are married, it's a shared living situation. Marital traditions often involve a level of access to each other's spaces, but that can vary. The husband's actions might be seen as reasonable if he's protecting his personal belongings based on his preferences. However, the wife might feel disrespected or ignored in the relationship dynamics. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit subjective. If the husband is not doing anything harmful, just protecting his own stuff, then maybe not in the wrong. But if the wife feels it's an overreaction and there's a lack of communication, maybe the husband could be more considerate. But the user's question is about whether he's in the wrong. Since the husband's actions are about his own preferences and safety, and not actively harming the wife, the answer might be B. However, some might argue that in a marriage, such personal boundaries can cause unnecessary tension. But the story says the wife has her own cheese, so she's not deprived. It's about his own choice to protect his belongings. So probably B is correct.\n"
