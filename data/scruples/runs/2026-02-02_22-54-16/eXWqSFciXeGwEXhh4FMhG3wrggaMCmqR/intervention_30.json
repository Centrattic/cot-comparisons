And she's not super on top of keeping her hands washed. \n\nI like to eat handfuls of shredded cheese as a snack. \n\nMy wife will take my bag of cheese out of the fridge and stick her unwashed hand into my cheese, **immediately** after taking her fingers out of her mouth. \n\nThat is fucking disgusting IMO. Now the whole bag of cheese is ruined, and my snack is gone. \n\nSo I started buying her her own bags of cheese. I clearly labeled each bag with either her name or mine.  \n\nFF to the next morning, and she has *my* bag of cheese. Hers is still sitting in the fridge (opened, and contaminated by her unwashed hands). She didn't bother checking the labels. So now she has two bags of cheese, and I have 0. \n\nNext step: I buy a mini fridge and put it in my bedroom. We have seperate bedrooms, so I figured I was solving the problem.   \n\nBut NO. 3 days later, I get home from work and she's **sitting on my bed, eating my bag of cheese**. There was still plenty of cheese in the main fridge. This is not a money issue. I don't care if she eats 100 bags of cheese. I just want **my** cheese to be **my** cheese, so I know it hasn't had unwashed hands in it. \n\nSo I installed a deadbolt on my bedroom door, and I keep my room locked whenever I am not home. Now my cheese is safe. My wife still has plenty of cheese to eat. She just no longer has access to **my fucking cheese**. \n\nShe says it shouldn't matter, since we kiss all the time. But I don't want to eat cheese that has someone else's stale saliva on it. No matter how much I love her, food safety is food safety. She is introducing germs into a fertile breeding ground, and I just can't get over that. I need my cheese to be clean. \n\nSo, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for locking their bedroom door to keep their cheese safe from their wife. The main issue here is about personal boundaries and hygiene.\n\nThe author's wife takes his cheese after using her hands in her mouth, which he finds unhygienic. He tried labeling the cheese and even bought a mini fridge, but she still ended up with his cheese. Then he locked his room to prevent access. \n\nThe key points are: 1. The wife's actions are causing the author discomfort due to hygiene. 2. The author took steps to separate their belongings. 3. After those steps failed, he locked his room, which is in their shared home.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, he's protecting his personal space and food. Others might argue that in a shared living space, locking a room could be seen as creating unnecessary barriers. But considering the specific issue with the cheese and the hygiene concern, it seems he's trying to maintain boundaries. The wife's argument about kissing not making it matter might not address the author's personal boundaries and cleanliness issues. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong because he's addressing his own comfort and health concerns. The answer should be B.\n"
