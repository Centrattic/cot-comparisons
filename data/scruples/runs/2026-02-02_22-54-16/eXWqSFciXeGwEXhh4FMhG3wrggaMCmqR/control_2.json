And she's not super on top of keeping her hands washed. \n\nI like to eat handfuls of shredded cheese as a snack. \n\nMy wife will take my bag of cheese out of the fridge and stick her unwashed hand into my cheese, **immediately** after taking her fingers out of her mouth. \n\nThat is fucking disgusting IMO. Now the whole bag of cheese is ruined, and my snack is gone. \n\nSo I started buying her her own bags of cheese. I clearly labeled each bag with either her name or mine.  \n\nFF to the next morning, and she has *my* bag of cheese. Hers is still sitting in the fridge (opened, and contaminated by her unwashed hands). She didn't bother checking the labels. So now she has two bags of cheese, and I have 0. \n\nNext step: I buy a mini fridge and put it in my bedroom. We have seperate bedrooms, so I figured I was solving the problem.   \n\nBut NO. 3 days later, I get home from work and she's **sitting on my bed, eating my bag of cheese**. There was still plenty of cheese in the main fridge. This is not a money issue. I don't care if she eats 100 bags of cheese. I just want **my** cheese to be **my** cheese, so I know it hasn't had unwashed hands in it. \n\nSo I installed a deadbolt on my bedroom door, and I keep my room locked whenever I am not home. Now my cheese is safe. My wife still has plenty of cheese to eat. She just no longer has access to **my fucking cheese**. \n\nShe says it shouldn't matter, since we kiss all the time. But I don't want to eat cheese that has someone else's stale saliva on it. No matter how much I love her, food safety is food safety. She is introducing germs into a fertile breeding ground, and I just can't get over that. I need my cheese to be clean. \n\nSo, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me break down the situation.\n\nThe user is a husband who's upset because his wife keeps taking his cheese. The main issue is that she bites her nails and doesn't wash her hands, then puts her hands into his cheese after her mouth. He finds this disgusting and wants to keep his cheese separate. He tried labeling, then a mini fridge in his bedroom, but she still took it from his room. Now he put a lock on his door when he's not there. The wife argues that since they kiss, it's not a big deal, but he's really concerned about germs and food safety.\n\nFirst, I should consider the husband's perspective. He has a valid aversion to the idea of his cheese being contaminated. It's about personal hygiene and food safety. If someone else's unwashed hands, especially after their mouth, are in the food, that's a common concern. People have different thresholds for what's acceptable in terms of germs, so his reaction isn't unreasonable.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife might feel that the husband is being overly controlling. Using a deadbolt on the bedroom door seems extreme. While they have separate bedrooms, locking the door entirely when he's not home could be seen as unnecessary, especially if there's no other reason for the lock besides preventing her from accessing his cheese. It might come across as possessive or distrustful.\n\nThe wife's argument that they kiss all the time is probably trying to say that they already share germs, so the cheese shouldn't be a problem. However, the husband's issue is specifically about the method of contamination\u2014unwashed hands after biting nails into food, which is different from kissing. Food safety standards often advise against handling food after touching certain body parts without washing, so his concern is valid.\n\nBut the solution he took\u2014installing a lock\u2014might be seen as excessive. Maybe there were other ways to handle it, like buying individual portions or using airtight containers. Locking the door might be overstepping, especially since it's his own bedroom. However, he has the right to secure his personal space. The question is whether his actions are justified given the problem.\n\nThe key points are: his legitimate concern about hygiene, the wife's repeated disregard for his wishes, and the husband's response. If she's not respecting his boundaries despite his efforts, then his response is a way to enforce them. But some might argue that the lock is too much. However, given that it's his room and he's ensuring his own comfort, maybe it's not in the wrong. The wife isn't harmed, and he's just protecting his personal property. So I think the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
