And she's not super on top of keeping her hands washed. \n\nI like to eat handfuls of shredded cheese as a snack. \n\nMy wife will take my bag of cheese out of the fridge and stick her unwashed hand into my cheese, **immediately** after taking her fingers out of her mouth. \n\nThat is fucking disgusting IMO. Now the whole bag of cheese is ruined, and my snack is gone. \n\nSo I started buying her her own bags of cheese. I clearly labeled each bag with either her name or mine.  \n\nFF to the next morning, and she has *my* bag of cheese. Hers is still sitting in the fridge (opened, and contaminated by her unwashed hands). She didn't bother checking the labels. So now she has two bags of cheese, and I have 0. \n\nNext step: I buy a mini fridge and put it in my bedroom. We have seperate bedrooms, so I figured I was solving the problem.   \n\nBut NO. 3 days later, I get home from work and she's **sitting on my bed, eating my bag of cheese**. There was still plenty of cheese in the main fridge. This is not a money issue. I don't care if she eats 100 bags of cheese. I just want **my** cheese to be **my** cheese, so I know it hasn't had unwashed hands in it. \n\nSo I installed a deadbolt on my bedroom door, and I keep my room locked whenever I am not home. Now my cheese is safe. My wife still has plenty of cheese to eat. She just no longer has access to **my fucking cheese**. \n\nShe says it shouldn't matter, since we kiss all the time. But I don't want to eat cheese that has someone else's stale saliva on it. No matter how much I love her, food safety is food safety. She is introducing germs into a fertile breeding ground, and I just can't get over that. I need my cheese to be clean. \n\nSo, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for installing a lock on their bedroom door to keep their wife from taking their cheese. The situation involves the wife taking the husband's cheese after biting her nails and not washing her hands. The husband tried different things like labeling and a mini fridge, but the wife still took his cheese. So he locked his room.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the main points. The husband has a strong aversion to his wife handling his food, especially after she's been putting unwashed hands in her mouth. He's taken steps to separate their belongings, but she's still taking his. He's now locked his room to prevent that. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nFrom the husband's perspective, it's about personal boundaries and hygiene. He's not happy with the situation and has tried multiple solutions. The wife, on the other hand, might feel that the husband is being overly controlling or not respecting their shared living space. They live together, so having separate bedrooms is already a compromise. Installing a lock might be seen as an extreme measure, especially if it's to prevent a spouse from accessing a room, even if it's about food.\n\nBut the husband's main argument is about hygiene and personal preference. He's not stopping her from eating cheese, just his specific bag. The wife's actions are considered disgusting by him, and he's trying to protect his food. However, in a shared living situation, completely restricting access to a shared space (like the bedroom when he's not there) might be seen as going too far. Even though they have separate bedrooms, the fact that she was sitting on his bed eating his cheese without permission could be a breach of his personal space, which he's now addressing with the lock.\n\nThe key here is whether the husband's actions are reasonable given his concerns. While it's his right to set boundaries, the method of locking the door might be seen as an overreaction. The wife's argument that they kiss all the time might be her way of saying that sharing food shouldn't matter, but the husband's hygiene standards are personal. However, locking the door could be perceived as unnecessary control, especially if the wife is accessing the room without his presence. \n\nIn some relationships, such actions might be seen as inconsiderate, but others might understand the need for personal space and hygiene. The answer might depend on cultural or personal expectations. But generally, if the husband is not using the room while he's away and the lock is to prevent access to the mini fridge with his cheese, it's a way to enforce his boundaries. However, if the wife is using the room (sitting on the bed) without his presence, the lock might be a reasonable step to protect his belongings and personal space.\n"
