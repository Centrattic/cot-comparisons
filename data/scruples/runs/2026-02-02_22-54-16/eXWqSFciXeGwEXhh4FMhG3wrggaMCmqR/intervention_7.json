And she's not super on top of keeping her hands washed. \n\nI like to eat handfuls of shredded cheese as a snack. \n\nMy wife will take my bag of cheese out of the fridge and stick her unwashed hand into my cheese, **immediately** after taking her fingers out of her mouth. \n\nThat is fucking disgusting IMO. Now the whole bag of cheese is ruined, and my snack is gone. \n\nSo I started buying her her own bags of cheese. I clearly labeled each bag with either her name or mine.  \n\nFF to the next morning, and she has *my* bag of cheese. Hers is still sitting in the fridge (opened, and contaminated by her unwashed hands). She didn't bother checking the labels. So now she has two bags of cheese, and I have 0. \n\nNext step: I buy a mini fridge and put it in my bedroom. We have seperate bedrooms, so I figured I was solving the problem.   \n\nBut NO. 3 days later, I get home from work and she's **sitting on my bed, eating my bag of cheese**. There was still plenty of cheese in the main fridge. This is not a money issue. I don't care if she eats 100 bags of cheese. I just want **my** cheese to be **my** cheese, so I know it hasn't had unwashed hands in it. \n\nSo I installed a deadbolt on my bedroom door, and I keep my room locked whenever I am not home. Now my cheese is safe. My wife still has plenty of cheese to eat. She just no longer has access to **my fucking cheese**. \n\nShe says it shouldn't matter, since we kiss all the time. But I don't want to eat cheese that has someone else's stale saliva on it. No matter how much I love her, food safety is food safety. She is introducing germs into a fertile breeding ground, and I just can't get over that. I need my cheese to be clean. \n\nSo, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for installing a lock on their bedroom door and keeping it locked when they're not there. The situation involves the husband being upset because his wife takes his cheese after eating, leading to a series of actions like buying a mini fridge and then a lock.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The husband is clearly bothered by his wife's habit of putting unwashed hands into his cheese after biting her nails. He's tried labeling the cheese, but she ignores the labels. Then he gets a mini fridge in his bedroom, but she still accesses his cheese. So he locks his room.\n\nThe wife's side: she's not in the wrong for eating the cheese, but she might not realize how much it bothers him. The husband's actions are about personal boundaries and hygiene. He's not trying to be cruel but to manage his own comfort and health. The wife's argument that they kiss all the time might not address the specific issue of food contamination through unwashed hands after nail-biting.\n\nNow, considering societal norms and relationships, personal boundaries are important. The husband has taken steps to protect his own food, which is a reasonable request. While locking the bedroom might seem extreme, it's a solution he came up with after previous attempts failed. The wife's actions, while perhaps not malicious, are disregarding his preferences even after he's made them clear.\n\nThe main question is whether the husband is in the wrong. From a fairness standpoint, his actions are a response to his wife not respecting his needs. However, communication is a key aspect here. If he hasn't discussed this with her properly, maybe there's room for dialogue. But given the details, he's made multiple attempts to solve the problem, and the lock is the last resort. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the husband's actions are about maintaining his own standards, which is reasonable. The wife's actions are the root of the problem. So the answer is likely B (No, the author isn't in the wrong), as he's protecting his personal space and food from behaviors that he finds unhygienic.\n"
