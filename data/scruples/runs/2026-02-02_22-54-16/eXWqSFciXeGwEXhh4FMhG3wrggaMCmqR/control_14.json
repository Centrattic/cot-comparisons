And she's not super on top of keeping her hands washed. \n\nI like to eat handfuls of shredded cheese as a snack. \n\nMy wife will take my bag of cheese out of the fridge and stick her unwashed hand into my cheese, **immediately** after taking her fingers out of her mouth. \n\nThat is fucking disgusting IMO. Now the whole bag of cheese is ruined, and my snack is gone. \n\nSo I started buying her her own bags of cheese. I clearly labeled each bag with either her name or mine.  \n\nFF to the next morning, and she has *my* bag of cheese. Hers is still sitting in the fridge (opened, and contaminated by her unwashed hands). She didn't bother checking the labels. So now she has two bags of cheese, and I have 0. \n\nNext step: I buy a mini fridge and put it in my bedroom. We have seperate bedrooms, so I figured I was solving the problem.   \n\nBut NO. 3 days later, I get home from work and she's **sitting on my bed, eating my bag of cheese**. There was still plenty of cheese in the main fridge. This is not a money issue. I don't care if she eats 100 bags of cheese. I just want **my** cheese to be **my** cheese, so I know it hasn't had unwashed hands in it. \n\nSo I installed a deadbolt on my bedroom door, and I keep my room locked whenever I am not home. Now my cheese is safe. My wife still has plenty of cheese to eat. She just no longer has access to **my fucking cheese**. \n\nShe says it shouldn't matter, since we kiss all the time. But I don't want to eat cheese that has someone else's stale saliva on it. No matter how much I love her, food safety is food safety. She is introducing germs into a fertile breeding ground, and I just can't get over that. I need my cheese to be clean. \n\nSo, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. They installed a lock on their bedroom door to prevent their wife from taking their cheese. The main issue here seems to be about personal boundaries and shared living spaces.\n\nFirst, the author's wife is taking the cheese after handling it in a way the author finds unhygienic. The author tried various solutions like labeling the cheese and even getting a mini fridge. When that didn't work, they locked their room. The wife is upset, but the author is firm about wanting their cheese to be clean.\n\nI need to consider both perspectives. The author has a right to their own food, especially if they have hygiene concerns. However, in a shared living space, locking the bedroom might be seen as creating unnecessary separation. But the author mentions they have separate bedrooms, so maybe that's part of their arrangement. The wife might feel that the author is overreacting, but the author's stance is about personal choice and health.\n\nI think the key here is autonomy. The author is trying to protect their own preferences and health without affecting their wife's access to her own cheese. Since they have separate rooms, maybe the lock is just extending that separation. The wife's actions (eating from the mini fridge) were the initial problem, so the author's response, while perhaps extreme, is a way to enforce their boundaries. So, the answer might be B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
