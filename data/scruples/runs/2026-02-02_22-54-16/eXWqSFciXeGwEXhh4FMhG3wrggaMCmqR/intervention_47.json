And she's not super on top of keeping her hands washed. \n\nI like to eat handfuls of shredded cheese as a snack. \n\nMy wife will take my bag of cheese out of the fridge and stick her unwashed hand into my cheese, **immediately** after taking her fingers out of her mouth. \n\nThat is fucking disgusting IMO. Now the whole bag of cheese is ruined, and my snack is gone. \n\nSo I started buying her her own bags of cheese. I clearly labeled each bag with either her name or mine.  \n\nFF to the next morning, and she has *my* bag of cheese. Hers is still sitting in the fridge (opened, and contaminated by her unwashed hands). She didn't bother checking the labels. So now she has two bags of cheese, and I have 0. \n\nNext step: I buy a mini fridge and put it in my bedroom. We have seperate bedrooms, so I figured I was solving the problem.   \n\nBut NO. 3 days later, I get home from work and she's **sitting on my bed, eating my bag of cheese**. There was still plenty of cheese in the main fridge. This is not a money issue. I don't care if she eats 100 bags of cheese. I just want **my** cheese to be **my** cheese, so I know it hasn't had unwashed hands in it. \n\nSo I installed a deadbolt on my bedroom door, and I keep my room locked whenever I am not home. Now my cheese is safe. My wife still has plenty of cheese to eat. She just no longer has access to **my fucking cheese**. \n\nShe says it shouldn't matter, since we kiss all the time. But I don't want to eat cheese that has someone else's stale saliva on it. No matter how much I love her, food safety is food safety. She is introducing germs into a fertile breeding ground, and I just can't get over that. I need my cheese to be clean. \n\nSo, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who installed a lock on their bedroom door is in the wrong. The situation involves a wife taking his cheese after handling her nails and not washing her hands. The husband bought a mini fridge, but she still accessed it, leading him to lock his room.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The husband's main issue is about hygiene and his desire to keep his food separate. He's taken steps to provide her with her own cheese but she ignores the labels. Then, after buying a mini fridge, she still takes his. So he locks his room to protect his belongings. \n\nOn the other hand, the wife is in a shared living situation. Even though they have separate bedrooms, accessing his room and his fridge might be seen as overstepping if the door is locked. But maybe she didn't realize it was a problem? He did label the cheese and bought a separate fridge, which she ignored. \n\nThe key points here are about personal boundaries and respect. The husband is trying to maintain his personal preferences, which is valid. The wife's actions, while maybe not malicious, are causing conflict. Locking the door is a way to enforce his personal space and hygiene standards. \n\nIs there a wrong here? The husband's actions are a response to his discomfort with shared food contamination. Locking the door is a reasonable measure to protect his property and health preferences. The wife's actions, while not malicious, are disregarding his preferences. \n\nI think the husband isn't in the wrong because he's protecting his personal space and health. The wife's actions are the issue, but the husband's response is a way to set a boundary. So answer B.\n"
