And she's not super on top of keeping her hands washed. \n\nI like to eat handfuls of shredded cheese as a snack. \n\nMy wife will take my bag of cheese out of the fridge and stick her unwashed hand into my cheese, **immediately** after taking her fingers out of her mouth. \n\nThat is fucking disgusting IMO. Now the whole bag of cheese is ruined, and my snack is gone. \n\nSo I started buying her her own bags of cheese. I clearly labeled each bag with either her name or mine.  \n\nFF to the next morning, and she has *my* bag of cheese. Hers is still sitting in the fridge (opened, and contaminated by her unwashed hands). She didn't bother checking the labels. So now she has two bags of cheese, and I have 0. \n\nNext step: I buy a mini fridge and put it in my bedroom. We have seperate bedrooms, so I figured I was solving the problem.   \n\nBut NO. 3 days later, I get home from work and she's **sitting on my bed, eating my bag of cheese**. There was still plenty of cheese in the main fridge. This is not a money issue. I don't care if she eats 100 bags of cheese. I just want **my** cheese to be **my** cheese, so I know it hasn't had unwashed hands in it. \n\nSo I installed a deadbolt on my bedroom door, and I keep my room locked whenever I am not home. Now my cheese is safe. My wife still has plenty of cheese to eat. She just no longer has access to **my fucking cheese**. \n\nShe says it shouldn't matter, since we kiss all the time. But I don't want to eat cheese that has someone else's stale saliva on it. No matter how much I love her, food safety is food safety. She is introducing germs into a fertile breeding ground, and I just can't get over that. I need my cheese to be clean. \n\nSo, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for locking their bedroom door to keep their cheese safe from their wife's habits. \n\nFirst, the main issue is about personal space and boundaries. The author is clearly upset because their wife uses their cheese without permission, and they feel their personal items are being contaminated. They tried several steps: labeling, getting a mini fridge, but the wife still accessed the cheese. So they locked the door.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is wrong. On one hand, they have a valid desire for their food to be clean, especially given the wife's nail-biting and hand hygiene. They took reasonable steps to address the problem before locking the door. Locking the bedroom door might be a strong measure, but it's their room, so they have the right to control access when they're not there.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife might feel that since they're married, sharing a home, and they have separate rooms, the author's actions are over the top. Maybe she feels it's unnecessary to lock the door because they're in a relationship where such boundaries aren't typically enforced. However, the author's concern about food safety is legitimate, and they\u2019re not keeping the cheese from her\u2014they\u2019re just protecting their own.\n\nThe author's response is about personal choice and health preferences. As long as it's not infringing on others' rights beyond their own space, it's their right to do so. The wife's argument about kissing doesn't address the specific issue of food contamination the author is bothered by. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They're asserting their right to personal space and hygiene, even if others find it extreme.\n"
