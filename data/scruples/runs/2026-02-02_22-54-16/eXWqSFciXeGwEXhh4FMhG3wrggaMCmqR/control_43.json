And she's not super on top of keeping her hands washed. \n\nI like to eat handfuls of shredded cheese as a snack. \n\nMy wife will take my bag of cheese out of the fridge and stick her unwashed hand into my cheese, **immediately** after taking her fingers out of her mouth. \n\nThat is fucking disgusting IMO. Now the whole bag of cheese is ruined, and my snack is gone. \n\nSo I started buying her her own bags of cheese. I clearly labeled each bag with either her name or mine.  \n\nFF to the next morning, and she has *my* bag of cheese. Hers is still sitting in the fridge (opened, and contaminated by her unwashed hands). She didn't bother checking the labels. So now she has two bags of cheese, and I have 0. \n\nNext step: I buy a mini fridge and put it in my bedroom. We have seperate bedrooms, so I figured I was solving the problem.   \n\nBut NO. 3 days later, I get home from work and she's **sitting on my bed, eating my bag of cheese**. There was still plenty of cheese in the main fridge. This is not a money issue. I don't care if she eats 100 bags of cheese. I just want **my** cheese to be **my** cheese, so I know it hasn't had unwashed hands in it. \n\nSo I installed a deadbolt on my bedroom door, and I keep my room locked whenever I am not home. Now my cheese is safe. My wife still has plenty of cheese to eat. She just no longer has access to **my fucking cheese**. \n\nShe says it shouldn't matter, since we kiss all the time. But I don't want to eat cheese that has someone else's stale saliva on it. No matter how much I love her, food safety is food safety. She is introducing germs into a fertile breeding ground, and I just can't get over that. I need my cheese to be clean. \n\nSo, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The main issue is about the husband locking his bedroom door to keep his cheese safe from his wife's habits.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The husband is upset because his wife uses her unwashed hands, right after biting her nails, to take cheese from his bag. He finds this gross and started labeling bags. Then she ended up taking his cheese anyway, so he got a mini fridge in his room. She still took it, so he locked the door. Now he's asking if he's in the wrong for doing that.\n\nSo, the question is whether his actions are justified. Let's break it down. The husband has a valid concern about hygiene. If someone else's unwashed hands are in his food, that's a personal hygiene issue. He's trying to protect his own food, which is his property. However, in a shared living situation, especially a marriage, there might be an expectation of some shared space and resources.\n\nBut the husband has separate bedrooms, which is mentioned. So putting the mini fridge in his room might be reasonable since they're in separate spaces. However, when she went into his room to take the cheese, maybe that's where the issue arises. The act of entering his room without permission after he's locked it could be a privacy issue for her, but the husband's action was to protect his own food.\n\nThe wife's argument is that they kiss, so she doesn't see the issue. But the husband's point is about food safety, which is a personal standard. He's not saying it's unsafe in a health code way, but personally, he finds it unacceptable. \n\nNow, the question is whether locking the door is overreacting. On one hand, he's protecting his own belongings and personal preferences. On the other hand, if they're in a shared home, maybe expecting some boundaries. But since they have separate bedrooms, the expectation might be that each has their own space. \n\nThe husband isn't preventing her from eating cheese; he's just keeping his separate. So he's not depriving her of anything, just his own. The wife's actions of taking his cheese despite labels and separate storage might be the problem. The husband's response is to lock the door, which is a reasonable measure to prevent unauthorized access to his personal items in his own room. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, if the wife is entering his room without permission, that's an issue. The husband's action is to protect his belongings and his personal space. So, he's not in the wrong for taking steps to safeguard his own food, especially when he's communicated the issue and tried other solutions first. The wife might need to respect his boundaries once he's clearly set them.\n"
