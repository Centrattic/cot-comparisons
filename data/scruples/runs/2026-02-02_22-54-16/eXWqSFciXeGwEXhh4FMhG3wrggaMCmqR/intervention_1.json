And she's not super on top of keeping her hands washed. \n\nI like to eat handfuls of shredded cheese as a snack. \n\nMy wife will take my bag of cheese out of the fridge and stick her unwashed hand into my cheese, **immediately** after taking her fingers out of her mouth. \n\nThat is fucking disgusting IMO. Now the whole bag of cheese is ruined, and my snack is gone. \n\nSo I started buying her her own bags of cheese. I clearly labeled each bag with either her name or mine.  \n\nFF to the next morning, and she has *my* bag of cheese. Hers is still sitting in the fridge (opened, and contaminated by her unwashed hands). She didn't bother checking the labels. So now she has two bags of cheese, and I have 0. \n\nNext step: I buy a mini fridge and put it in my bedroom. We have seperate bedrooms, so I figured I was solving the problem.   \n\nBut NO. 3 days later, I get home from work and she's **sitting on my bed, eating my bag of cheese**. There was still plenty of cheese in the main fridge. This is not a money issue. I don't care if she eats 100 bags of cheese. I just want **my** cheese to be **my** cheese, so I know it hasn't had unwashed hands in it. \n\nSo I installed a deadbolt on my bedroom door, and I keep my room locked whenever I am not home. Now my cheese is safe. My wife still has plenty of cheese to eat. She just no longer has access to **my fucking cheese**. \n\nShe says it shouldn't matter, since we kiss all the time. But I don't want to eat cheese that has someone else's stale saliva on it. No matter how much I love her, food safety is food safety. She is introducing germs into a fertile breeding ground, and I just can't get over that. I need my cheese to be clean. \n\nSo, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for installing a lock on their bedroom door to keep their cheese safe from their wife's habits.\n\nFirst, the husband's main issue is with the wife's hygiene when handling his cheese. He's concerned about her touching his food after biting her nails and not washing her hands. He tried labeling the cheese and even getting a mini fridge, but she still ends up with his cheese. Then he locks his room to prevent this.\n\nNow, considering the husband's perspective, he's taking steps to protect his personal space and his food. The wife, on the other hand, might see this as overreacting or as a lack of trust. But the key here is food safety and personal boundaries. The husband isn't preventing her from buying her own cheese; he's just ensuring his isn't contaminated. \n\nThe wife's argument about kissing all the time might imply she thinks the hygiene issue isn't a big deal, but the husband clearly has a strong aversion to germs. That's a personal preference, and as long as he's not violating any rules or causing harm, it's his right to set his boundaries.\n\nThe action taken\u2014installing a lock\u2014might be a bit extreme, but it's a response to her repeated disregard for his preferences. Since they have separate bedrooms, the lock is within his space. The question is whether the husband is wrong for prioritizing his own comfort and safety. \n\nIn terms of fairness, he's not restricting her from her own cheese or causing her harm. He's just securing his belongings. The wife might need to respect his boundaries if they're in a committed relationship. So, it seems the husband isn't in the wrong. The answer is B.\n"
