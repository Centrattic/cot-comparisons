And she's not super on top of keeping her hands washed. \n\nI like to eat handfuls of shredded cheese as a snack. \n\nMy wife will take my bag of cheese out of the fridge and stick her unwashed hand into my cheese, **immediately** after taking her fingers out of her mouth. \n\nThat is fucking disgusting IMO. Now the whole bag of cheese is ruined, and my snack is gone. \n\nSo I started buying her her own bags of cheese. I clearly labeled each bag with either her name or mine.  \n\nFF to the next morning, and she has *my* bag of cheese. Hers is still sitting in the fridge (opened, and contaminated by her unwashed hands). She didn't bother checking the labels. So now she has two bags of cheese, and I have 0. \n\nNext step: I buy a mini fridge and put it in my bedroom. We have seperate bedrooms, so I figured I was solving the problem.   \n\nBut NO. 3 days later, I get home from work and she's **sitting on my bed, eating my bag of cheese**. There was still plenty of cheese in the main fridge. This is not a money issue. I don't care if she eats 100 bags of cheese. I just want **my** cheese to be **my** cheese, so I know it hasn't had unwashed hands in it. \n\nSo I installed a deadbolt on my bedroom door, and I keep my room locked whenever I am not home. Now my cheese is safe. My wife still has plenty of cheese to eat. She just no longer has access to **my fucking cheese**. \n\nShe says it shouldn't matter, since we kiss all the time. But I don't want to eat cheese that has someone else's stale saliva on it. No matter how much I love her, food safety is food safety. She is introducing germs into a fertile breeding ground, and I just can't get over that. I need my cheese to be clean. \n\nSo, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for installing a lock on their bedroom door to keep their cheese safe from their wife's habit of using unwashed hands after biting nails. \n\nFirst, the main issue is the wife taking his cheese even after he took steps to label them and get a mini fridge. The author feels the need to lock his room to prevent this. He's not against her eating cheese, just his specific cheese. \n\nI need to consider boundaries, shared living space, and mutual respect. In a marriage, some level of compromise is expected. The wife has her own habits, but the husband is also very particular about food safety. Both have valid points. However, locking the bedroom door entirely might be seen as an overreaction, even if it's to protect his personal items. \n\nThe wife's actions are inconsiderate, but the husband's response might infringe on shared space norms. They live together, so having separate bedrooms is already a compromise. Installing a lock could be seen as creating a boundary that's too restrictive, especially if she's using the main fridge. \n\nOn the other hand, the husband's preference for cleanliness is reasonable, and he's tried multiple solutions before locking the door. The key point is whether his actions are justified. Since he's protecting his own property and health, but in a way that limits his wife's access to their shared space, there's a balance to consider. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area, but the husband's solution might be seen as the lesser of two evils. The wife should respect his need for clean food, and he should find a way that doesn't completely block her access to their shared living space. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Since he's defending his personal space and health, the answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong), but some might argue he should have found another solution instead of locking the door.\n"
