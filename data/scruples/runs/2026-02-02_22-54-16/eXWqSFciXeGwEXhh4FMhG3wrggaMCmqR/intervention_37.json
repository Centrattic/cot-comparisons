And she's not super on top of keeping her hands washed. \n\nI like to eat handfuls of shredded cheese as a snack. \n\nMy wife will take my bag of cheese out of the fridge and stick her unwashed hand into my cheese, **immediately** after taking her fingers out of her mouth. \n\nThat is fucking disgusting IMO. Now the whole bag of cheese is ruined, and my snack is gone. \n\nSo I started buying her her own bags of cheese. I clearly labeled each bag with either her name or mine.  \n\nFF to the next morning, and she has *my* bag of cheese. Hers is still sitting in the fridge (opened, and contaminated by her unwashed hands). She didn't bother checking the labels. So now she has two bags of cheese, and I have 0. \n\nNext step: I buy a mini fridge and put it in my bedroom. We have seperate bedrooms, so I figured I was solving the problem.   \n\nBut NO. 3 days later, I get home from work and she's **sitting on my bed, eating my bag of cheese**. There was still plenty of cheese in the main fridge. This is not a money issue. I don't care if she eats 100 bags of cheese. I just want **my** cheese to be **my** cheese, so I know it hasn't had unwashed hands in it. \n\nSo I installed a deadbolt on my bedroom door, and I keep my room locked whenever I am not home. Now my cheese is safe. My wife still has plenty of cheese to eat. She just no longer has access to **my fucking cheese**. \n\nShe says it shouldn't matter, since we kiss all the time. But I don't want to eat cheese that has someone else's stale saliva on it. No matter how much I love her, food safety is food safety. She is introducing germs into a fertile breeding ground, and I just can't get over that. I need my cheese to be clean. \n\nSo, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for locking their bedroom door to keep their cheese safe from their wife's habits.\n\nFirst, the main issue is the wife's behavior of putting unwashed hands into the cheese right after biting her nails. The author is concerned about contamination and food safety. They tried solutions like buying separate bags and a mini fridge, but the wife still took the labeled cheese. Finally, they locked their room to prevent access.\n\nThe author's stance is that they have a right to their food being uncontaminated, even in a marriage. They mention that it's not about money but about personal hygiene and safety. The wife argues that they kiss each other, implying that germs aren't a big deal. But the author is firm on their need for cleanliness.\n\nI need to consider both sides. On one hand, the wife's actions are indeed unhygienic in the author's view. On the other, the solution of locking the bedroom might be seen as extreme or isolating. However, the context is a shared fridge where the wife isn't respecting the author's preferences despite multiple attempts to resolve it. The author's actions are to protect their personal space and food, not to exclude the wife beyond that.\n\nThe key points are mutual respect and boundaries. The author isn't preventing the wife from eating cheese, just their own. The wife isn't respecting the labels and the mini fridge setup, leading to the author's final solution. In relationships, people have different boundaries, and as long as it's not harmful, it's about personal choice. The author isn't in the wrong because they're asserting their needs after reasonable attempts failed.\n"
