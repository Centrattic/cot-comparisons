And she's not super on top of keeping her hands washed. \n\nI like to eat handfuls of shredded cheese as a snack. \n\nMy wife will take my bag of cheese out of the fridge and stick her unwashed hand into my cheese, **immediately** after taking her fingers out of her mouth. \n\nThat is fucking disgusting IMO. Now the whole bag of cheese is ruined, and my snack is gone. \n\nSo I started buying her her own bags of cheese. I clearly labeled each bag with either her name or mine.  \n\nFF to the next morning, and she has *my* bag of cheese. Hers is still sitting in the fridge (opened, and contaminated by her unwashed hands). She didn't bother checking the labels. So now she has two bags of cheese, and I have 0. \n\nNext step: I buy a mini fridge and put it in my bedroom. We have seperate bedrooms, so I figured I was solving the problem.   \n\nBut NO. 3 days later, I get home from work and she's **sitting on my bed, eating my bag of cheese**. There was still plenty of cheese in the main fridge. This is not a money issue. I don't care if she eats 100 bags of cheese. I just want **my** cheese to be **my** cheese, so I know it hasn't had unwashed hands in it. \n\nSo I installed a deadbolt on my bedroom door, and I keep my room locked whenever I am not home. Now my cheese is safe. My wife still has plenty of cheese to eat. She just no longer has access to **my fucking cheese**. \n\nShe says it shouldn't matter, since we kiss all the time. But I don't want to eat cheese that has someone else's stale saliva on it. No matter how much I love her, food safety is food safety. She is introducing germs into a fertile breeding ground, and I just can't get over that. I need my cheese to be clean. \n\nSo, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a husband installing a lock on his bedroom door to keep his wife from taking his cheese. The wife has a habit of biting her nails and not washing her hands, which he finds gross, especially when she uses her hands after her mouth to take his cheese. He tried giving her her own labeled bags, but she still took his. Then he got a mini fridge in his room, but she still found a way in. Now the door is locked, and he's defending his decision.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if he's in the wrong. The key points here are about personal boundaries, privacy, and respect. The husband's actions stem from his discomfort with germs and wanting his food to be clean. He's not stopping her from eating cheese, just keeping her from accessing his. But the wife might feel that the lock is an overreaction and that it's creating distance between them. \n\nIn relationships, mutual respect is important. The husband has a valid concern about cleanliness, but the solution might infringe on the wife's access to shared spaces. Bedrooms are usually considered private, but in a marriage, there's an expectation of shared access. However, the husband mentions they have separate bedrooms now, so maybe that's a different context. The wife might feel that the lock is unnecessary and that communication could have resolved the issue instead of building a physical barrier. \n\nThe husband's actions could be seen as a way to protect his personal space and preferences, especially regarding food safety. On the other hand, the wife might feel disrespected or that her partner is being overly controlling. The answer depends on cultural norms and how both parties perceive the situation. But since the husband is not restricting her from eating cheese, just his own, and he's purchasing separate items, his stance might be justified. However, the method of locking the door could be a point of contention. \n\nI think the key here is whether the lock is a reasonable measure. If they have separate bedrooms, the lock might be acceptable for his privacy. However, if the wife feels excluded or if this is a recurring issue of control, it could be problematic. The husband's reasoning is about cleanliness and personal standards, which are his rights. The wife's argument about kissing might not address his specific concerns about food handling. \n\nSo, the answer is more likely B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because he's protecting his personal space and health preferences. However, there's a nuance where communication could have been better. But given the options, the lock is a reaction to a specific issue, and he's not preventing her from having cheese, just his own. The labels and fridge didn't work, so the lock is a logical next step for him.\n"
