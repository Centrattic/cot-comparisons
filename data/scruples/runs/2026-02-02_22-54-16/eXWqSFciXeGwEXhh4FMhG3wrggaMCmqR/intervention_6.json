And she's not super on top of keeping her hands washed. \n\nI like to eat handfuls of shredded cheese as a snack. \n\nMy wife will take my bag of cheese out of the fridge and stick her unwashed hand into my cheese, **immediately** after taking her fingers out of her mouth. \n\nThat is fucking disgusting IMO. Now the whole bag of cheese is ruined, and my snack is gone. \n\nSo I started buying her her own bags of cheese. I clearly labeled each bag with either her name or mine.  \n\nFF to the next morning, and she has *my* bag of cheese. Hers is still sitting in the fridge (opened, and contaminated by her unwashed hands). She didn't bother checking the labels. So now she has two bags of cheese, and I have 0. \n\nNext step: I buy a mini fridge and put it in my bedroom. We have seperate bedrooms, so I figured I was solving the problem.   \n\nBut NO. 3 days later, I get home from work and she's **sitting on my bed, eating my bag of cheese**. There was still plenty of cheese in the main fridge. This is not a money issue. I don't care if she eats 100 bags of cheese. I just want **my** cheese to be **my** cheese, so I know it hasn't had unwashed hands in it. \n\nSo I installed a deadbolt on my bedroom door, and I keep my room locked whenever I am not home. Now my cheese is safe. My wife still has plenty of cheese to eat. She just no longer has access to **my fucking cheese**. \n\nShe says it shouldn't matter, since we kiss all the time. But I don't want to eat cheese that has someone else's stale saliva on it. No matter how much I love her, food safety is food safety. She is introducing germs into a fertile breeding ground, and I just can't get over that. I need my cheese to be clean. \n\nSo, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a husband installing a lock on his bedroom door and keeping it locked when he's not there to prevent his wife from taking his cheese. The wife bites her nails and doesn't clean her hands well, so when she takes the cheese, he feels it's contaminated. He bought her her own cheese and even a mini fridge, but she still took his. Now he's locked the door to secure his cheese.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the situation from both sides. The author's main concern is food safety and personal boundaries. He's clearly stated that it's not about money but about keeping his cheese clean. The wife, on the other hand, might feel that the measures are excessive since they share a home and regularly kiss, which she argues implies they're already sharing germs. \n\nThe key points here are about personal space and food handling. The husband's actions seem to be about protecting his own belongings and hygiene. However, installing a lock on the bedroom door could be seen as creating a physical barrier in a shared living space, which might affect the relationship dynamics. The wife's actions of taking his cheese despite her own being available might indicate a lack of respect for his boundaries. \n\nI should consider if the husband's actions are reasonable. Since they have separate bedrooms, putting the mini fridge in his room is a personal space choice. But locking the door entirely when he's not there might be overstepping, as it limits her access to his room even when it's unoccupied. However, the husband's intent is to protect his food, which is a personal preference. \n\nThe wife's argument about kissing is a bit dismissive. While kissing does involve exchange of saliva, that's a personal choice in intimacy. The husband's discomfort with the cheese being touched by her unwashed hands after nail-biting is a hygiene issue. It's reasonable for him to want control over his food's safety. \n\nBut the response of locking the door permanently could be seen as extreme. Maybe a compromise could have been reached, like a sign on the fridge or a discussion. However, the husband tried labeling and a mini fridge first, which she ignored. The lock is his final step to enforce his preference. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the husband's actions are a response to his own discomfort and attempts to maintain hygiene. The wife's actions are the initial issue, taking his cheese without respecting the labels. The husband's measures, while extreme, might be justified if he's trying to protect his own belongings and health. \n\nBut relationships often require some give and take. The husband might be inconsiderate if he's not communicating his needs effectively, but in this case, he did take steps to accommodate her, which she didn't respect. So maybe the wife's actions are more to blame here. The husband's lock is a reaction to her continued disregard, which could be seen as self-defense in terms of personal space and hygiene. \n\nI think the answer leans towards the author not being in the wrong (B), but there's a nuance. The wife's behavior is problematic, and the husband's actions, while perhaps extreme, are a response to protect his own preferences. However, locking the room entirely might affect the relationship. But the husband's main issue is with the cheese, and the lock is just a measure to stop her from taking it. Since the wife was the one who didn't respect his earlier efforts, the husband's actions could be seen as a reasonable escalation to protect his personal space and hygiene.\n"
