And she's not super on top of keeping her hands washed. \n\nI like to eat handfuls of shredded cheese as a snack. \n\nMy wife will take my bag of cheese out of the fridge and stick her unwashed hand into my cheese, **immediately** after taking her fingers out of her mouth. \n\nThat is fucking disgusting IMO. Now the whole bag of cheese is ruined, and my snack is gone. \n\nSo I started buying her her own bags of cheese. I clearly labeled each bag with either her name or mine.  \n\nFF to the next morning, and she has *my* bag of cheese. Hers is still sitting in the fridge (opened, and contaminated by her unwashed hands). She didn't bother checking the labels. So now she has two bags of cheese, and I have 0. \n\nNext step: I buy a mini fridge and put it in my bedroom. We have seperate bedrooms, so I figured I was solving the problem.   \n\nBut NO. 3 days later, I get home from work and she's **sitting on my bed, eating my bag of cheese**. There was still plenty of cheese in the main fridge. This is not a money issue. I don't care if she eats 100 bags of cheese. I just want **my** cheese to be **my** cheese, so I know it hasn't had unwashed hands in it. \n\nSo I installed a deadbolt on my bedroom door, and I keep my room locked whenever I am not home. Now my cheese is safe. My wife still has plenty of cheese to eat. She just no longer has access to **my fucking cheese**. \n\nShe says it shouldn't matter, since we kiss all the time. But I don't want to eat cheese that has someone else's stale saliva on it. No matter how much I love her, food safety is food safety. She is introducing germs into a fertile breeding ground, and I just can't get over that. I need my cheese to be clean. \n\nSo, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a husband installing a lock on his bedroom door to keep his wife from taking his cheese. The wife takes his cheese even after he labels them and buys a mini fridge, leading him to lock the room.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The husband has a valid concern about his cheese being contaminated by his wife's unwashed hands after she bites her nails. He's taking steps to protect his snacks, which he wants to be clean and safe. On the other hand, the wife is eating his cheese despite his efforts, leading to the husband locking his room.\n\nThe key points here are about personal boundaries and shared resources in a marriage. In a shared household, food is typically considered a shared resource. However, the husband is making a reasonable effort to separate his personal items by labeling and using a mini fridge. The wife's actions, not checking labels and taking his cheese, disregard his efforts. \n\nThe husband's response of locking the door is a way to enforce his boundaries. While it might seem extreme, it's a reaction to her repeated disregard for his preferences. The question is whether his actions are justified. Since the wife is the one initiating the behavior he finds offensive, and he's trying to protect his personal space, it's more about respecting individual boundaries. The husband isn't preventing her from eating her own cheese, just his. \n\nSo, considering that, the husband isn't in the wrong. He's protecting his personal property and health preferences. The wife should respect his wishes if they're in a healthy relationship. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
