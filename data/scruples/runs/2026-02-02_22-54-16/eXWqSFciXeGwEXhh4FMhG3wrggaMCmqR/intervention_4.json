And she's not super on top of keeping her hands washed. \n\nI like to eat handfuls of shredded cheese as a snack. \n\nMy wife will take my bag of cheese out of the fridge and stick her unwashed hand into my cheese, **immediately** after taking her fingers out of her mouth. \n\nThat is fucking disgusting IMO. Now the whole bag of cheese is ruined, and my snack is gone. \n\nSo I started buying her her own bags of cheese. I clearly labeled each bag with either her name or mine.  \n\nFF to the next morning, and she has *my* bag of cheese. Hers is still sitting in the fridge (opened, and contaminated by her unwashed hands). She didn't bother checking the labels. So now she has two bags of cheese, and I have 0. \n\nNext step: I buy a mini fridge and put it in my bedroom. We have seperate bedrooms, so I figured I was solving the problem.   \n\nBut NO. 3 days later, I get home from work and she's **sitting on my bed, eating my bag of cheese**. There was still plenty of cheese in the main fridge. This is not a money issue. I don't care if she eats 100 bags of cheese. I just want **my** cheese to be **my** cheese, so I know it hasn't had unwashed hands in it. \n\nSo I installed a deadbolt on my bedroom door, and I keep my room locked whenever I am not home. Now my cheese is safe. My wife still has plenty of cheese to eat. She just no longer has access to **my fucking cheese**. \n\nShe says it shouldn't matter, since we kiss all the time. But I don't want to eat cheese that has someone else's stale saliva on it. No matter how much I love her, food safety is food safety. She is introducing germs into a fertile breeding ground, and I just can't get over that. I need my cheese to be clean. \n\nSo, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a husband who's upset because his wife keeps taking his cheese. He's taken steps to label the cheese, then bought a mini fridge, and finally locked his bedroom door to prevent her from accessing his cheese.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The husband's main issue is about hygiene. He doesn't want his food contaminated by her unwashed hands after she bites her nails. That seems like a valid concern. Personal hygiene is important, and if someone is uncomfortable with how another person handles food, it's understandable they'd take steps to avoid it.\n\nThe wife's side is that they share a fridge and maybe a bed, so she might not see the issue with sharing cheese. She might think it's overreacting, especially since they kiss, implying that they already exchange saliva, so the cheese shouldn't be a problem. But the husband's issue isn't about the act of sharing saliva, but about the physical contact with cheese after she's been in her mouth and hasn't washed her hands. There's a difference between kissing and handling food with unwashed hands, especially after nail-biting, which can introduce bacteria.\n\nThe husband's actions start with labeling, then moving to a mini fridge in his room, and finally locking the door. Each step is a response to her not respecting his boundaries. The question is whether locking the door is going too far. In a shared living space, personal boundaries can be tricky. If they have separate bedrooms, having a mini fridge in his room is a reasonable measure. Locking the door might be seen as excessive, but if it's to protect his personal belongings and his health concerns are valid, maybe not.\n\nThe key points are consent and respect for personal boundaries. The wife is taking his belongings without permission, even after he's tried to set up clear boundaries. The husband is trying to protect his own health and preferences. While locking the door might seem extreme, it's a way to enforce his personal space and protect his property. The wife's actions (taking his cheese multiple times) are disrespectful of his boundaries, so his response is about self-preservation.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that in a marriage, there's an expectation of sharing and that the husband's actions are isolating. But marriage doesn't mean sacrificing all personal preferences. Health and hygiene are personal and can be non-negotiable. If the wife isn't respecting his needs, he's within his rights to take measures to protect himself, even if it's inconvenient for her.\n\nSo the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong. He's asserting his personal boundaries and health preferences, which are valid. The wife is the one not respecting those boundaries, so the author's actions are justified.\n"
