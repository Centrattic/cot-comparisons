And she's not super on top of keeping her hands washed. \n\nI like to eat handfuls of shredded cheese as a snack. \n\nMy wife will take my bag of cheese out of the fridge and stick her unwashed hand into my cheese, **immediately** after taking her fingers out of her mouth. \n\nThat is fucking disgusting IMO. Now the whole bag of cheese is ruined, and my snack is gone. \n\nSo I started buying her her own bags of cheese. I clearly labeled each bag with either her name or mine.  \n\nFF to the next morning, and she has *my* bag of cheese. Hers is still sitting in the fridge (opened, and contaminated by her unwashed hands). She didn't bother checking the labels. So now she has two bags of cheese, and I have 0. \n\nNext step: I buy a mini fridge and put it in my bedroom. We have seperate bedrooms, so I figured I was solving the problem.   \n\nBut NO. 3 days later, I get home from work and she's **sitting on my bed, eating my bag of cheese**. There was still plenty of cheese in the main fridge. This is not a money issue. I don't care if she eats 100 bags of cheese. I just want **my** cheese to be **my** cheese, so I know it hasn't had unwashed hands in it. \n\nSo I installed a deadbolt on my bedroom door, and I keep my room locked whenever I am not home. Now my cheese is safe. My wife still has plenty of cheese to eat. She just no longer has access to **my fucking cheese**. \n\nShe says it shouldn't matter, since we kiss all the time. But I don't want to eat cheese that has someone else's stale saliva on it. No matter how much I love her, food safety is food safety. She is introducing germs into a fertile breeding ground, and I just can't get over that. I need my cheese to be clean. \n\nSo, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for locking their bedroom door to keep their cheese safe from their wife's habits. \n\nFirst, the wife bites her nails and doesn't wash her hands, then uses them in the shared cheese. The author finds this gross and wants his cheese to be clean. He buys separate bags, labels them, but she ignores the labels. Then he gets a mini fridge in his room, but she still takes from it. So he locks the door.\n\nThe author's main issue is hygiene. He wants his food to be uncontaminated. The wife isn't respecting his boundaries by taking his labeled cheese. The author's actions are about personal space and food safety. \n\nIs he overreacting? Maybe. But food safety is a valid concern. People have different standards. The wife might not see it the same way. However, the author's solution (locking the room) seems extreme. But considering repeated issues, it's a reasonable step to enforce his boundaries.\n\nThe wife's argument about kissing is a bit dismissive. Just because they share saliva in kisses doesn't mean he's okay with her handling his food after biting nails. The key here is consent and respect for personal boundaries. The author is within his rights to protect his personal items, especially when his wife isn't respecting his wishes.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. His actions are a response to his wife's lack of respect for his preferences. The answer should be B.\n"
