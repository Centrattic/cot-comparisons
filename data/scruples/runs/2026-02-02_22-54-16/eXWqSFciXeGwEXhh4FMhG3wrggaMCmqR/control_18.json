And she's not super on top of keeping her hands washed. \n\nI like to eat handfuls of shredded cheese as a snack. \n\nMy wife will take my bag of cheese out of the fridge and stick her unwashed hand into my cheese, **immediately** after taking her fingers out of her mouth. \n\nThat is fucking disgusting IMO. Now the whole bag of cheese is ruined, and my snack is gone. \n\nSo I started buying her her own bags of cheese. I clearly labeled each bag with either her name or mine.  \n\nFF to the next morning, and she has *my* bag of cheese. Hers is still sitting in the fridge (opened, and contaminated by her unwashed hands). She didn't bother checking the labels. So now she has two bags of cheese, and I have 0. \n\nNext step: I buy a mini fridge and put it in my bedroom. We have seperate bedrooms, so I figured I was solving the problem.   \n\nBut NO. 3 days later, I get home from work and she's **sitting on my bed, eating my bag of cheese**. There was still plenty of cheese in the main fridge. This is not a money issue. I don't care if she eats 100 bags of cheese. I just want **my** cheese to be **my** cheese, so I know it hasn't had unwashed hands in it. \n\nSo I installed a deadbolt on my bedroom door, and I keep my room locked whenever I am not home. Now my cheese is safe. My wife still has plenty of cheese to eat. She just no longer has access to **my fucking cheese**. \n\nShe says it shouldn't matter, since we kiss all the time. But I don't want to eat cheese that has someone else's stale saliva on it. No matter how much I love her, food safety is food safety. She is introducing germs into a fertile breeding ground, and I just can't get over that. I need my cheese to be clean. \n\nSo, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's start by breaking down the situation. The author is married, and their wife has a habit of biting her nails and not washing her hands properly. The author likes to eat shredded cheese and was upset when the wife would take his cheese from the fridge, use her unwashed hands after biting her nails, and contaminate it. \n\nFirst, the author tried labeling the cheese bags, but the wife ended up taking the wrong one. Then, the author bought a mini fridge for the bedroom to keep their cheese separate. However, the wife still managed to get into the bedroom and eat the cheese from the mini fridge. Finally, the author installed a lock on the bedroom door to prevent access when they're not there.\n\nThe author's reasoning is about food safety and personal hygiene. They want their cheese to be uncontaminated. The wife argues that since they kiss, it shouldn't matter. The author feels that their actions are about maintaining cleanliness and personal boundaries.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. Let's consider the key points. The wife's actions (biting nails, not washing hands) are indeed unhygienic, which the author is reacting to. The author tried multiple solutions\u2014labeling, separate fridge, then locking the door. The main issue is about personal space and hygiene preferences. \n\nIn a shared living situation, people have different boundaries. The author's actions were to protect their own food from contamination. However, the wife's behavior of entering the bedroom and taking the cheese without permission might be the bigger issue here. The author's response is about protecting their personal belongings and health standards. \n\nFrom a fairness standpoint, the author's actions seem reasonable given their concerns. The wife's disregard for the labels and the lock is problematic. The author isn't denying the wife access to cheese entirely, just their own. So, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
