And she's not super on top of keeping her hands washed. \n\nI like to eat handfuls of shredded cheese as a snack. \n\nMy wife will take my bag of cheese out of the fridge and stick her unwashed hand into my cheese, **immediately** after taking her fingers out of her mouth. \n\nThat is fucking disgusting IMO. Now the whole bag of cheese is ruined, and my snack is gone. \n\nSo I started buying her her own bags of cheese. I clearly labeled each bag with either her name or mine.  \n\nFF to the next morning, and she has *my* bag of cheese. Hers is still sitting in the fridge (opened, and contaminated by her unwashed hands). She didn't bother checking the labels. So now she has two bags of cheese, and I have 0. \n\nNext step: I buy a mini fridge and put it in my bedroom. We have seperate bedrooms, so I figured I was solving the problem.   \n\nBut NO. 3 days later, I get home from work and she's **sitting on my bed, eating my bag of cheese**. There was still plenty of cheese in the main fridge. This is not a money issue. I don't care if she eats 100 bags of cheese. I just want **my** cheese to be **my** cheese, so I know it hasn't had unwashed hands in it. \n\nSo I installed a deadbolt on my bedroom door, and I keep my room locked whenever I am not home. Now my cheese is safe. My wife still has plenty of cheese to eat. She just no longer has access to **my fucking cheese**. \n\nShe says it shouldn't matter, since we kiss all the time. But I don't want to eat cheese that has someone else's stale saliva on it. No matter how much I love her, food safety is food safety. She is introducing germs into a fertile breeding ground, and I just can't get over that. I need my cheese to be clean. \n\nSo, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the given scenario is in the wrong. The situation revolves around the author installing a lock on their bedroom door because their wife keeps taking his cheese. \n\nFirst, the wife's habit of biting her nails and not washing her hands is a hygiene issue. The author is upset because she uses her unwashed hands to take cheese from his bag, which he finds gross. He starts labeling bags, but she still ends up with his cheese. Then he gets a mini fridge in their separate bedroom, but she still takes his cheese from there. The final step is installing a deadbolt to keep his cheese safe.\n\nThe key points here are about boundaries, shared living spaces, and personal preferences. The author is trying to protect his personal space and food from something he finds unhygienic. The wife, on the other hand, might feel that since they're married, sharing food is normal. \n\nHowever, the author's solution\u2014locking the bedroom door\u2014might come off as extreme to some. While it's understandable that he wants his food to be uncontaminated, the response of physically locking the door could be seen as cutting off access unnecessarily, especially if the wife isn't aware of the issue or doesn't see it the same way. The author's reasoning about food safety is valid from his perspective, but the method of addressing it might be over the top.\n\nConsidering that they live together and are married, the expectation might be that they share resources unless there's a specific reason not to. The author's actions might be seen as creating unnecessary separation in a relationship where shared living is expected. However, personal boundaries are also important, especially regarding personal hygiene and food safety.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author went too far. If the wife isn't respecting his boundaries despite his efforts to communicate (labeling, separate fridge), then locking the door could be justified. But if he didn't address the issue with her first, maybe that's a problem. The story doesn't mention him talking to her about the germs before taking drastic measures, which might be a point against him.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, people often have differing views on what's acceptable in relationships. Some would say the author is within his rights to protect his personal items, while others might think the solution is too extreme. The answer likely depends on cultural context and individual perspectives on privacy versus shared living. Given the information, the author's actions are a response to a hygiene concern he takes seriously, and he's trying to prevent contamination. The wife's actions aren't malicious, but she's not respecting his preferences. The lock is a way to enforce his boundaries. So, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because he's protecting his personal space and health, even if the method is extreme. But there's a counterargument that he should have communicated better and found a less intrusive solution. However, since the story states he tried previous steps (labeling, separate fridge), maybe B is the right choice.\n"
