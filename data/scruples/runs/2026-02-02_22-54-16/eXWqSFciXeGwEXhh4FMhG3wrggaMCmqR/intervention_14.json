And she's not super on top of keeping her hands washed. \n\nI like to eat handfuls of shredded cheese as a snack. \n\nMy wife will take my bag of cheese out of the fridge and stick her unwashed hand into my cheese, **immediately** after taking her fingers out of her mouth. \n\nThat is fucking disgusting IMO. Now the whole bag of cheese is ruined, and my snack is gone. \n\nSo I started buying her her own bags of cheese. I clearly labeled each bag with either her name or mine.  \n\nFF to the next morning, and she has *my* bag of cheese. Hers is still sitting in the fridge (opened, and contaminated by her unwashed hands). She didn't bother checking the labels. So now she has two bags of cheese, and I have 0. \n\nNext step: I buy a mini fridge and put it in my bedroom. We have seperate bedrooms, so I figured I was solving the problem.   \n\nBut NO. 3 days later, I get home from work and she's **sitting on my bed, eating my bag of cheese**. There was still plenty of cheese in the main fridge. This is not a money issue. I don't care if she eats 100 bags of cheese. I just want **my** cheese to be **my** cheese, so I know it hasn't had unwashed hands in it. \n\nSo I installed a deadbolt on my bedroom door, and I keep my room locked whenever I am not home. Now my cheese is safe. My wife still has plenty of cheese to eat. She just no longer has access to **my fucking cheese**. \n\nShe says it shouldn't matter, since we kiss all the time. But I don't want to eat cheese that has someone else's stale saliva on it. No matter how much I love her, food safety is food safety. She is introducing germs into a fertile breeding ground, and I just can't get over that. I need my cheese to be clean. \n\nSo, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a husband installing a lock on his bedroom door because his wife keeps taking his cheese after using her hands in her mouth.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The husband's main issue is with food safety. He doesn't want his cheese contaminated by her unwashed hands after she bites her nails. He's tried several steps: labeling the cheese, getting a mini fridge, but ultimately had to lock his room. He's not denying her cheese; she has her own, but he wants his to be uncontaminated.\n\nThe wife's perspective might be that they are married and share things, so locking the door is excessive. She might feel it's unnecessary to have separate cheese or a mini fridge. However, the husband's actions are to protect his own health preferences, which are valid even if they're more strict than the wife's.\n\nFrom a fairness standpoint, the husband isn't being selfish about money; he's willing to buy her cheese. The core issue is about personal boundaries and food safety. While locking the bedroom door might be seen as over-the-top by some, it's a solution that addresses his specific problem without affecting her access to food. There's no indication he's being malicious; he just wants to avoid contamination.\n\nIn relationships, personal boundaries are important. If both parties have different standards, they need to find compromises. The husband's actions, though perhaps extreme, are a response to his legitimate concerns. The wife might need to adjust her behavior, but he's within his rights to protect his own preferences. So, the author isn't in the wrong because he's acting on his own health concerns without infringing on her rights.\n"
