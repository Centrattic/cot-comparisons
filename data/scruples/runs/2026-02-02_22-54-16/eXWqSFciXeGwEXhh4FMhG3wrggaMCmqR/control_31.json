And she's not super on top of keeping her hands washed. \n\nI like to eat handfuls of shredded cheese as a snack. \n\nMy wife will take my bag of cheese out of the fridge and stick her unwashed hand into my cheese, **immediately** after taking her fingers out of her mouth. \n\nThat is fucking disgusting IMO. Now the whole bag of cheese is ruined, and my snack is gone. \n\nSo I started buying her her own bags of cheese. I clearly labeled each bag with either her name or mine.  \n\nFF to the next morning, and she has *my* bag of cheese. Hers is still sitting in the fridge (opened, and contaminated by her unwashed hands). She didn't bother checking the labels. So now she has two bags of cheese, and I have 0. \n\nNext step: I buy a mini fridge and put it in my bedroom. We have seperate bedrooms, so I figured I was solving the problem.   \n\nBut NO. 3 days later, I get home from work and she's **sitting on my bed, eating my bag of cheese**. There was still plenty of cheese in the main fridge. This is not a money issue. I don't care if she eats 100 bags of cheese. I just want **my** cheese to be **my** cheese, so I know it hasn't had unwashed hands in it. \n\nSo I installed a deadbolt on my bedroom door, and I keep my room locked whenever I am not home. Now my cheese is safe. My wife still has plenty of cheese to eat. She just no longer has access to **my fucking cheese**. \n\nShe says it shouldn't matter, since we kiss all the time. But I don't want to eat cheese that has someone else's stale saliva on it. No matter how much I love her, food safety is food safety. She is introducing germs into a fertile breeding ground, and I just can't get over that. I need my cheese to be clean. \n\nSo, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about cheese and the wife's habits. The author is upset because his wife bites her nails and doesn't wash her hands properly. She takes his cheese from the fridge with her hands right after her mouth, which he finds gross. He then buys her her own cheese, labels them, but she still ends up taking his. So he gets a mini fridge in his bedroom, but she still goes in and eats his cheese. Then he locks his door, and now she can't get in. He's asking if he's at fault.\n\nHmm, the key points here are about boundaries and respecting each other's preferences. The author is clearly upset about the hygiene issue. From his perspective, he's taking steps to protect his food, which is a personal choice. But then he goes a step further by locking his room. Now, in a shared living space, having separate bedrooms is one thing, but adding a lock might be a problem if it's a home they both live in. However, if they have separate bedrooms, maybe it's more about his right to control his own space. \n\nBut the wife isn't being violent or stealing. She's just eating his cheese, which he labels as his. But maybe he's overreacting? The labels didn't work, so he tried a mini fridge. When that failed, he locked the door. Is it reasonable to lock the door to prevent someone from eating your food? If they're in separate bedrooms, maybe it's his room, so he can lock it. However, if she's entering his room without permission, that's an issue. But he didn't mention her entering his room before locking it. He just said she was sitting on his bed eating the cheese. So maybe she had access to his room anyway, and now he's locking it to prevent her from doing that. \n\nThe wife's side: she might feel that since they're married, the food is shared, and he's being too controlling. But the author's concern is valid regarding hygiene. However, the solution of locking the door might be seen as excessive. Maybe there's a middle ground, like using containers or stricter labeling. But he's taking it to the point of locking the room, which could be seen as him creating a private space that excludes her. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author isn't wrong about wanting his food clean. But his actions might be seen as overstepping, especially if the wife feels disrespected. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer depends on cultural norms and personal boundaries. In some contexts, locking the door is his right, especially if it's his room. But if the wife is entering his room without his permission, that's a separate issue. \n\nSo considering all that, maybe the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because he's protecting his personal preferences and hygiene. But some might argue that he's being too controlling. However, given the details, his actions are to maintain his own comfort, even if others might find it extreme.\n"
