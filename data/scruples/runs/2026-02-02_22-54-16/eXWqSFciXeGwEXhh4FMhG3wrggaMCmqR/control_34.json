And she's not super on top of keeping her hands washed. \n\nI like to eat handfuls of shredded cheese as a snack. \n\nMy wife will take my bag of cheese out of the fridge and stick her unwashed hand into my cheese, **immediately** after taking her fingers out of her mouth. \n\nThat is fucking disgusting IMO. Now the whole bag of cheese is ruined, and my snack is gone. \n\nSo I started buying her her own bags of cheese. I clearly labeled each bag with either her name or mine.  \n\nFF to the next morning, and she has *my* bag of cheese. Hers is still sitting in the fridge (opened, and contaminated by her unwashed hands). She didn't bother checking the labels. So now she has two bags of cheese, and I have 0. \n\nNext step: I buy a mini fridge and put it in my bedroom. We have seperate bedrooms, so I figured I was solving the problem.   \n\nBut NO. 3 days later, I get home from work and she's **sitting on my bed, eating my bag of cheese**. There was still plenty of cheese in the main fridge. This is not a money issue. I don't care if she eats 100 bags of cheese. I just want **my** cheese to be **my** cheese, so I know it hasn't had unwashed hands in it. \n\nSo I installed a deadbolt on my bedroom door, and I keep my room locked whenever I am not home. Now my cheese is safe. My wife still has plenty of cheese to eat. She just no longer has access to **my fucking cheese**. \n\nShe says it shouldn't matter, since we kiss all the time. But I don't want to eat cheese that has someone else's stale saliva on it. No matter how much I love her, food safety is food safety. She is introducing germs into a fertile breeding ground, and I just can't get over that. I need my cheese to be clean. \n\nSo, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for installing a lock on his bedroom door to keep his wife from taking his cheese. Hmm.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The wife has a habit of biting her nails and not washing her hands. The husband likes to eat shredded cheese, but she takes his from the fridge with her hands after her mouth. He finds it disgusting, so he buys separate bags, labels them, but she still ends up taking his. He then gets a mini fridge in his room, but she still comes in and takes it. So he locks his room.\n\nHe argues that it's about food safety and his personal preference. She says it shouldn't matter because they kiss, implying that sharing germs is normal. The husband is firm on his need for clean food.\n\nSo, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Let's break it down. \n\nFrom a perspective of personal boundaries, the husband is trying to protect his personal items. If they have separate bedrooms, maybe that was a step already. But then the wife enters his room and takes his cheese. Locking the door to prevent that could be seen as protecting his property and personal space.\n\nHowever, marriage often involves compromise. The husband's solution is pretty strict, but she might feel that entering his room is a privacy issue. But the husband's main issue isn't the intrusion but the cheese. He's not hiding from her, just protecting his snack. \n\nBut is it reasonable? Some might say that in a shared home, expecting someone else to not touch your belongings is reasonable. Others might think that the husband's reaction (installing a lock) is excessive, but given the specific issue with food safety, maybe not. \n\nThe wife's actions are the root here. She's taking his cheese despite labels, which he clearly set up. If she's not respecting his boundaries, then locking the door is a way to enforce them. \n\nHowever, maybe there's a middle ground. But the husband's actions are about self-preservation regarding his food preferences. Since it's not about money but about cleanliness, there's a valid point there. \n\nSo, considering all that, the husband is trying to protect his personal space and food from something he finds unsanitary. The wife isn't respecting his boundaries, leading him to take more extreme measures. But is he in the wrong? Probably not, because he's asserting his right to have his personal items and space respected. So answer B.\n"
