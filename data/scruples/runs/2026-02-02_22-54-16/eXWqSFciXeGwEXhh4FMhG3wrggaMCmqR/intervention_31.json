And she's not super on top of keeping her hands washed. \n\nI like to eat handfuls of shredded cheese as a snack. \n\nMy wife will take my bag of cheese out of the fridge and stick her unwashed hand into my cheese, **immediately** after taking her fingers out of her mouth. \n\nThat is fucking disgusting IMO. Now the whole bag of cheese is ruined, and my snack is gone. \n\nSo I started buying her her own bags of cheese. I clearly labeled each bag with either her name or mine.  \n\nFF to the next morning, and she has *my* bag of cheese. Hers is still sitting in the fridge (opened, and contaminated by her unwashed hands). She didn't bother checking the labels. So now she has two bags of cheese, and I have 0. \n\nNext step: I buy a mini fridge and put it in my bedroom. We have seperate bedrooms, so I figured I was solving the problem.   \n\nBut NO. 3 days later, I get home from work and she's **sitting on my bed, eating my bag of cheese**. There was still plenty of cheese in the main fridge. This is not a money issue. I don't care if she eats 100 bags of cheese. I just want **my** cheese to be **my** cheese, so I know it hasn't had unwashed hands in it. \n\nSo I installed a deadbolt on my bedroom door, and I keep my room locked whenever I am not home. Now my cheese is safe. My wife still has plenty of cheese to eat. She just no longer has access to **my fucking cheese**. \n\nShe says it shouldn't matter, since we kiss all the time. But I don't want to eat cheese that has someone else's stale saliva on it. No matter how much I love her, food safety is food safety. She is introducing germs into a fertile breeding ground, and I just can't get over that. I need my cheese to be clean. \n\nSo, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who installed a lock on their bedroom door is in the wrong. The situation involves a wife who takes his cheese, even after labels and a mini fridge.\n\nFirst, the author's main issue is about food safety and personal boundaries. He's disturbed by his wife's habit of putting unwashed hands into his cheese after biting her nails. He's tried multiple solutions: buying her own cheese, labeling, then a mini fridge. When that didn't work, he locked his room.\n\nHe argues he's not trying to restrict her access to cheese since there's still plenty in the main fridge. His issue is specifically about his own cheese being contaminated. The wife's response that they kiss doesn't address his concern, as he's focused on the food being handled in a way he finds unhygienic.\n\nFrom a personal boundaries perspective, everyone has different sensitivities. If he finds the action gross, it's his right to set boundaries to protect his own food. While the wife might not see it the same way, the author's actions are about respecting his own limits. Locking the door is a reasonable step if other measures failed. The key here is that he's not cutting her off entirely but securing his own belongings. So, the answer would be B (not in the wrong).\n"
