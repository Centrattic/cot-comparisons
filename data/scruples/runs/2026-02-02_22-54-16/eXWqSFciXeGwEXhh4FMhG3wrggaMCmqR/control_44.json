And she's not super on top of keeping her hands washed. \n\nI like to eat handfuls of shredded cheese as a snack. \n\nMy wife will take my bag of cheese out of the fridge and stick her unwashed hand into my cheese, **immediately** after taking her fingers out of her mouth. \n\nThat is fucking disgusting IMO. Now the whole bag of cheese is ruined, and my snack is gone. \n\nSo I started buying her her own bags of cheese. I clearly labeled each bag with either her name or mine.  \n\nFF to the next morning, and she has *my* bag of cheese. Hers is still sitting in the fridge (opened, and contaminated by her unwashed hands). She didn't bother checking the labels. So now she has two bags of cheese, and I have 0. \n\nNext step: I buy a mini fridge and put it in my bedroom. We have seperate bedrooms, so I figured I was solving the problem.   \n\nBut NO. 3 days later, I get home from work and she's **sitting on my bed, eating my bag of cheese**. There was still plenty of cheese in the main fridge. This is not a money issue. I don't care if she eats 100 bags of cheese. I just want **my** cheese to be **my** cheese, so I know it hasn't had unwashed hands in it. \n\nSo I installed a deadbolt on my bedroom door, and I keep my room locked whenever I am not home. Now my cheese is safe. My wife still has plenty of cheese to eat. She just no longer has access to **my fucking cheese**. \n\nShe says it shouldn't matter, since we kiss all the time. But I don't want to eat cheese that has someone else's stale saliva on it. No matter how much I love her, food safety is food safety. She is introducing germs into a fertile breeding ground, and I just can't get over that. I need my cheese to be clean. \n\nSo, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a husband and wife. The husband is upset because his wife is taking his cheese after putting her unwashed hands in it. He's taken steps to separate their cheeses and even bought a mini fridge in his bedroom, but she still accessed his cheese when he wasn't there. Now he's locked his bedroom door.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The husband is clearly disturbed by the idea of his wife's unwashed hands in his food, especially after biting her nails. He values cleanliness and doesn't want to eat something contaminated. That makes sense, especially if he's health-conscious or has a strong aversion to germs. His actions are about protecting his personal belongings and his health.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife might feel that since they're married, sharing food is normal. She might not realize how much this is bothering him. Also, having separate bedrooms and then putting a lock on the door could be seen as creating more separation. But maybe they already have separate spaces, so adding a lock isn't unusual. The wife's argument that they kiss all the time implies she doesn't see the issue with saliva transfer, but the husband is more concerned about the germs and the context of how the cheese is handled.\n\nIs the husband overreacting? Maybe. But his reasoning is about food safety, which is a legitimate concern. The key here is whether his actions are unreasonable. Installing a lock to protect his personal property is a common way to secure things. However, if the wife feels this is an overreaction or if it's causing marital tension, there might be room for compromise. But the question is about whether he's in the wrong. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the husband's actions are within his rights. He's protecting his own property and health. The wife's actions of taking his cheese without permission, especially after knowing the labels, might be the initial issue. So the husband's response is a reasonable step to prevent further issues. The wife's response (saying it shouldn't matter) might not address his specific concerns. \n\nTherefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
