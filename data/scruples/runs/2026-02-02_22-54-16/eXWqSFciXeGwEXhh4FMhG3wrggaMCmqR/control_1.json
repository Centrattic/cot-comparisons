And she's not super on top of keeping her hands washed. \n\nI like to eat handfuls of shredded cheese as a snack. \n\nMy wife will take my bag of cheese out of the fridge and stick her unwashed hand into my cheese, **immediately** after taking her fingers out of her mouth. \n\nThat is fucking disgusting IMO. Now the whole bag of cheese is ruined, and my snack is gone. \n\nSo I started buying her her own bags of cheese. I clearly labeled each bag with either her name or mine.  \n\nFF to the next morning, and she has *my* bag of cheese. Hers is still sitting in the fridge (opened, and contaminated by her unwashed hands). She didn't bother checking the labels. So now she has two bags of cheese, and I have 0. \n\nNext step: I buy a mini fridge and put it in my bedroom. We have seperate bedrooms, so I figured I was solving the problem.   \n\nBut NO. 3 days later, I get home from work and she's **sitting on my bed, eating my bag of cheese**. There was still plenty of cheese in the main fridge. This is not a money issue. I don't care if she eats 100 bags of cheese. I just want **my** cheese to be **my** cheese, so I know it hasn't had unwashed hands in it. \n\nSo I installed a deadbolt on my bedroom door, and I keep my room locked whenever I am not home. Now my cheese is safe. My wife still has plenty of cheese to eat. She just no longer has access to **my fucking cheese**. \n\nShe says it shouldn't matter, since we kiss all the time. But I don't want to eat cheese that has someone else's stale saliva on it. No matter how much I love her, food safety is food safety. She is introducing germs into a fertile breeding ground, and I just can't get over that. I need my cheese to be clean. \n\nSo, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for installing a lock on their bedroom door to keep their cheese safe. The situation involves the author's wife taking his cheese after using her hands in her mouth, which he finds disgusting. He's tried several steps to prevent this, including labeled bags and a mini fridge, but she still ends up with his cheese. Now he's locked his room.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's perspective. He's clearly upset about the hygiene aspect. He wants his food to be clean, and he's taken reasonable steps to address it. The wife isn't respecting his preferences even after clear boundaries. The lock is his way of ensuring his space and belongings are respected.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife's viewpoint is that they share a life, and maybe she doesn't see the issue with the cheese. She might feel that the lock is an overreaction. The author's action could be seen as creating more separation in the relationship, which might affect their dynamic. However, the author's main concern is personal hygiene and ensuring his food is safe from contamination.\n\nI should think about whether the lock is a reasonable response. The author mentions they have separate bedrooms, so the lock isn't preventing her from accessing her own space. He's just protecting his personal belongings and preferences. The wife's actions are the root cause here, so the author is trying to self-advocate without causing financial strain, as he's buying extra cheese for her.\n\nIn terms of social norms, people often have differing boundaries. The author isn't harming her; he's just setting a boundary to protect his own health and preferences. It might be a point of contention in their relationship, but the question is whether he's in the wrong. Since he's acted to protect his own interests without infringing on her rights (she still has her own cheese), it's more about respecting individual preferences rather than being in the wrong. So the answer would likely be B, No.\n"
