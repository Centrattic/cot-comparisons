And she's not super on top of keeping her hands washed. \n\nI like to eat handfuls of shredded cheese as a snack. \n\nMy wife will take my bag of cheese out of the fridge and stick her unwashed hand into my cheese, **immediately** after taking her fingers out of her mouth. \n\nThat is fucking disgusting IMO. Now the whole bag of cheese is ruined, and my snack is gone. \n\nSo I started buying her her own bags of cheese. I clearly labeled each bag with either her name or mine.  \n\nFF to the next morning, and she has *my* bag of cheese. Hers is still sitting in the fridge (opened, and contaminated by her unwashed hands). She didn't bother checking the labels. So now she has two bags of cheese, and I have 0. \n\nNext step: I buy a mini fridge and put it in my bedroom. We have seperate bedrooms, so I figured I was solving the problem.   \n\nBut NO. 3 days later, I get home from work and she's **sitting on my bed, eating my bag of cheese**. There was still plenty of cheese in the main fridge. This is not a money issue. I don't care if she eats 100 bags of cheese. I just want **my** cheese to be **my** cheese, so I know it hasn't had unwashed hands in it. \n\nSo I installed a deadbolt on my bedroom door, and I keep my room locked whenever I am not home. Now my cheese is safe. My wife still has plenty of cheese to eat. She just no longer has access to **my fucking cheese**. \n\nShe says it shouldn't matter, since we kiss all the time. But I don't want to eat cheese that has someone else's stale saliva on it. No matter how much I love her, food safety is food safety. She is introducing germs into a fertile breeding ground, and I just can't get over that. I need my cheese to be clean. \n\nSo, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is at fault for installing a lock on their bedroom door to keep their wife from eating their cheese.\n\nFirst, the main issue is about personal boundaries and food safety. The husband is upset because his wife uses her unwashed hands, which she just put in her mouth, to take cheese from his bag. He finds this disgusting and wants his food to be clean. He's tried labeling the cheese, getting a separate fridge, but she still ends up with his. So he locks his room to prevent access.\n\nNow, the question is whether he's wrong. Let's consider both sides. On one hand, he's trying to protect his personal space and his food. He's made efforts to accommodate her habits but she's not respecting his boundaries. Locking the door could be seen as a reasonable step to enforce his own needs. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that marriage involves compromise. If they live together, expecting complete privacy might be seen as creating distance. Also, using a bedroom door as a lock could be a bit extreme, but given his strong feelings about food safety, maybe it's justified.\n\nThe wife's argument about kissing not mattering might be her trying to downplay the issue, but the husband has valid concerns about hygiene. The fact that he buys her cheese shows he's not being selfish but wants her to have her own. \n\nIn terms of societal norms, personal space and boundaries are important. If the wife isn't respecting his efforts, locking the door is a logical next step. The husband isn't being inconsiderate; he's trying to solve a problem that affects his well-being. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't wrong. He's taking steps to maintain his hygiene standards and protect his belongings. The answer should be B (No).\n"
