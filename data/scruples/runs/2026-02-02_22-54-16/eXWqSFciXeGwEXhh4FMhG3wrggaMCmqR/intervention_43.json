And she's not super on top of keeping her hands washed. \n\nI like to eat handfuls of shredded cheese as a snack. \n\nMy wife will take my bag of cheese out of the fridge and stick her unwashed hand into my cheese, **immediately** after taking her fingers out of her mouth. \n\nThat is fucking disgusting IMO. Now the whole bag of cheese is ruined, and my snack is gone. \n\nSo I started buying her her own bags of cheese. I clearly labeled each bag with either her name or mine.  \n\nFF to the next morning, and she has *my* bag of cheese. Hers is still sitting in the fridge (opened, and contaminated by her unwashed hands). She didn't bother checking the labels. So now she has two bags of cheese, and I have 0. \n\nNext step: I buy a mini fridge and put it in my bedroom. We have seperate bedrooms, so I figured I was solving the problem.   \n\nBut NO. 3 days later, I get home from work and she's **sitting on my bed, eating my bag of cheese**. There was still plenty of cheese in the main fridge. This is not a money issue. I don't care if she eats 100 bags of cheese. I just want **my** cheese to be **my** cheese, so I know it hasn't had unwashed hands in it. \n\nSo I installed a deadbolt on my bedroom door, and I keep my room locked whenever I am not home. Now my cheese is safe. My wife still has plenty of cheese to eat. She just no longer has access to **my fucking cheese**. \n\nShe says it shouldn't matter, since we kiss all the time. But I don't want to eat cheese that has someone else's stale saliva on it. No matter how much I love her, food safety is food safety. She is introducing germs into a fertile breeding ground, and I just can't get over that. I need my cheese to be clean. \n\nSo, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for installing a lock on their bedroom door and keeping it locked to prevent their wife from accessing their cheese. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The wife has a habit of biting her nails and not washing her hands, and she puts her hands in the author's cheese right after. The author is upset because they want their cheese to be clean. They tried labeling the cheese, but the wife didn't check the labels. Then they bought a mini fridge in their bedroom, but the wife still accessed it. So they locked the bedroom door.\n\nThe main issue here is about boundaries and personal space. The couple is married but has separate bedrooms. The author's actions are to protect their personal food, which they consider important for hygiene. The wife, on the other hand, might feel that this is being overly controlling or unnecessary. \n\nLegally, the author owns their own property, including the mini fridge and bedroom. So installing a lock isn't illegal. Ethically, it's more about mutual respect. The author is trying to enforce their personal boundaries, which is understandable. However, in a marriage, there's often an expectation of some level of shared space and trust. But the author isn't preventing the wife from eating cheese; they're just keeping their own separate. \n\nThe wife's reaction might be that the author is being too strict, but the author has a valid concern about hygiene. The key point is that the author isn't denying the wife food, just their own specific portion. The fact that the wife has her own cheese but doesn't check the labels complicates things. The author's actions are a response to repeated issues, so it's a protective measure rather than a controlling one. \n\nConsidering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. They're maintaining their personal boundaries and addressing legitimate concerns. The wife's actions are the ones causing the problem, so the author's response is justified.\n"
