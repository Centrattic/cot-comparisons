And she's not super on top of keeping her hands washed. \n\nI like to eat handfuls of shredded cheese as a snack. \n\nMy wife will take my bag of cheese out of the fridge and stick her unwashed hand into my cheese, **immediately** after taking her fingers out of her mouth. \n\nThat is fucking disgusting IMO. Now the whole bag of cheese is ruined, and my snack is gone. \n\nSo I started buying her her own bags of cheese. I clearly labeled each bag with either her name or mine.  \n\nFF to the next morning, and she has *my* bag of cheese. Hers is still sitting in the fridge (opened, and contaminated by her unwashed hands). She didn't bother checking the labels. So now she has two bags of cheese, and I have 0. \n\nNext step: I buy a mini fridge and put it in my bedroom. We have seperate bedrooms, so I figured I was solving the problem.   \n\nBut NO. 3 days later, I get home from work and she's **sitting on my bed, eating my bag of cheese**. There was still plenty of cheese in the main fridge. This is not a money issue. I don't care if she eats 100 bags of cheese. I just want **my** cheese to be **my** cheese, so I know it hasn't had unwashed hands in it. \n\nSo I installed a deadbolt on my bedroom door, and I keep my room locked whenever I am not home. Now my cheese is safe. My wife still has plenty of cheese to eat. She just no longer has access to **my fucking cheese**. \n\nShe says it shouldn't matter, since we kiss all the time. But I don't want to eat cheese that has someone else's stale saliva on it. No matter how much I love her, food safety is food safety. She is introducing germs into a fertile breeding ground, and I just can't get over that. I need my cheese to be clean. \n\nSo, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a husband who installed a lock on his bedroom door because his wife keeps taking his cheese. The wife bites her nails and doesn't wash her hands, then uses her hands to take his cheese. He tried labeling the bags and even got a mini fridge, but she still took his cheese. Now he locks his room to keep it safe.\n\nHmm, I need to figure out if he's in the wrong. The key points are about personal boundaries, shared living arrangements, and food safety. The husband is concerned about hygiene and wants his cheese to be untouched. But he's taken extreme measures by locking his door. \n\nIn a shared home, even with separate bedrooms, there's an expectation that both partners respect each other's spaces and belongings. However, the husband's actions might be seen as overreacting. Locking the bedroom door could be seen as creating unnecessary separation. But on the other hand, he's trying to protect his personal hygiene preferences. \n\nThe wife's actions are inconsiderate, but the husband's solution might be too extreme. Maybe there's a middle ground, like communicating better, using airtight containers, or storing the cheese in a place where she can't access it without permission. Locking the room might be perceived as not trust or being too controlling. \n\nBut the husband's main point is about food safety. If he's allergic or has a medical condition, that's different. But here, it's more about personal preference. Still, people have different standards. The wife might feel disrespected if he's keeping his room locked. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? Well, he's taking steps to protect his belongings, but the method might be too harsh. However, given his specific needs, maybe it's understandable. It's a bit of a gray area. The question is whether the husband's actions are justified given the circumstances. I think the answer hinges on mutual respect. If the wife isn't respecting his boundaries, he has a right to protect his stuff, but locking the door might be an overreaction. However, considering his specific issues with hygiene, maybe he's not in the wrong. The wife should find another way to get cheese instead of taking his. So, the answer might be B.\n"
