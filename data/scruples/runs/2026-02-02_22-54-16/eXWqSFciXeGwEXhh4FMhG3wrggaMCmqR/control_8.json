And she's not super on top of keeping her hands washed. \n\nI like to eat handfuls of shredded cheese as a snack. \n\nMy wife will take my bag of cheese out of the fridge and stick her unwashed hand into my cheese, **immediately** after taking her fingers out of her mouth. \n\nThat is fucking disgusting IMO. Now the whole bag of cheese is ruined, and my snack is gone. \n\nSo I started buying her her own bags of cheese. I clearly labeled each bag with either her name or mine.  \n\nFF to the next morning, and she has *my* bag of cheese. Hers is still sitting in the fridge (opened, and contaminated by her unwashed hands). She didn't bother checking the labels. So now she has two bags of cheese, and I have 0. \n\nNext step: I buy a mini fridge and put it in my bedroom. We have seperate bedrooms, so I figured I was solving the problem.   \n\nBut NO. 3 days later, I get home from work and she's **sitting on my bed, eating my bag of cheese**. There was still plenty of cheese in the main fridge. This is not a money issue. I don't care if she eats 100 bags of cheese. I just want **my** cheese to be **my** cheese, so I know it hasn't had unwashed hands in it. \n\nSo I installed a deadbolt on my bedroom door, and I keep my room locked whenever I am not home. Now my cheese is safe. My wife still has plenty of cheese to eat. She just no longer has access to **my fucking cheese**. \n\nShe says it shouldn't matter, since we kiss all the time. But I don't want to eat cheese that has someone else's stale saliva on it. No matter how much I love her, food safety is food safety. She is introducing germs into a fertile breeding ground, and I just can't get over that. I need my cheese to be clean. \n\nSo, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for locking their bedroom door to keep their cheese safe from their wife. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The wife bites her nails and doesn't wash her hands, then puts them into the husband's cheese. The husband is upset because he wants his cheese to be clean. He tried labeling, then a mini fridge, but she still took his. So he locked the bedroom door.\n\nNow, the question is whether he's at fault. Let's break it down. The husband's actions are about personal space and food safety. The wife, on the other hand, might feel that sharing a fridge and not having access to his room is unfair. \n\nIn most relationships, sharing resources is expected unless there's a specific reason to keep them separate. The husband's main issue is about hygiene, which is a personal preference. However, locking the bedroom door might be seen as extreme. While he's protecting his own preferences, it could also be seen as overreacting, especially since they live together. \n\nThe wife's reaction might be about feeling excluded or not respected. The husband's solution of a mini fridge and then a lock could be seen as creating unnecessary separation. The key point is whether his actions are reasonable. \n\nHygiene is subjective. What's gross to him might not be to her, and vice versa. The fact that they kiss suggests they share bodily fluids, so his argument about germs might not hold in her eyes. \n\nSo, the husband's actions are trying to enforce his personal boundaries, but the method (locking the room) might be crossing into territory that affects their relationship dynamics. The answer depends on balancing personal preferences with relationship respect. The lock might be too much, making him at fault.\n"
