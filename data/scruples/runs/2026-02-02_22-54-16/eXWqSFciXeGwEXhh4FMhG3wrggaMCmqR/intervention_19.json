And she's not super on top of keeping her hands washed. \n\nI like to eat handfuls of shredded cheese as a snack. \n\nMy wife will take my bag of cheese out of the fridge and stick her unwashed hand into my cheese, **immediately** after taking her fingers out of her mouth. \n\nThat is fucking disgusting IMO. Now the whole bag of cheese is ruined, and my snack is gone. \n\nSo I started buying her her own bags of cheese. I clearly labeled each bag with either her name or mine.  \n\nFF to the next morning, and she has *my* bag of cheese. Hers is still sitting in the fridge (opened, and contaminated by her unwashed hands). She didn't bother checking the labels. So now she has two bags of cheese, and I have 0. \n\nNext step: I buy a mini fridge and put it in my bedroom. We have seperate bedrooms, so I figured I was solving the problem.   \n\nBut NO. 3 days later, I get home from work and she's **sitting on my bed, eating my bag of cheese**. There was still plenty of cheese in the main fridge. This is not a money issue. I don't care if she eats 100 bags of cheese. I just want **my** cheese to be **my** cheese, so I know it hasn't had unwashed hands in it. \n\nSo I installed a deadbolt on my bedroom door, and I keep my room locked whenever I am not home. Now my cheese is safe. My wife still has plenty of cheese to eat. She just no longer has access to **my fucking cheese**. \n\nShe says it shouldn't matter, since we kiss all the time. But I don't want to eat cheese that has someone else's stale saliva on it. No matter how much I love her, food safety is food safety. She is introducing germs into a fertile breeding ground, and I just can't get over that. I need my cheese to be clean. \n\nSo, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a husband installing a lock on his bedroom door to keep his wife from taking his cheese. He's upset because she uses her unwashed hands after biting her nails to take cheese from his bag. He tried labeling the bags, but she still took his. Then he got a mini fridge in his room, but she still came in and ate his cheese. Now he's locked the door.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The husband's main issue is hygiene. He doesn't want to eat cheese that's been touched by his wife's unwashed hands after she's bitten her nails. That's his personal preference, but is it unreasonable? Well, people do have different standards for cleanliness. The wife might not see the problem, thinking they kiss all the time, so germs aren't an issue. But the husband clearly feels strongly about it.\n\nHe tried several solutions: buying her separate cheese, using labels, getting a mini fridge. When those didn't work, he locked the door. The wife is upset because she now can't access his cheese. The question is whether he's in the wrong for doing this.\n\nNow, considering the actions. Is it unreasonable to want his own food to be uncontaminated? From a health perspective, if someone's hands are dirty or have saliva from nail-biting, putting them into food could spread germs. But the husband is taking extreme measures to prevent that. Locking the bedroom door might be seen as overreacting. After all, bedrooms are shared spaces in a marriage, so locking it could be seen as creating a boundary that's too strict.\n\nBut on the other hand, the husband has legitimate concerns about hygiene. If he's not willing to compromise, maybe there's a middle ground. For example, maybe he could just keep the cheese in a container that's sealed, or use plastic bags that are harder to open without the key. Locking the door might be an excessive measure, especially since his wife might feel it's a personal intrusion.\n\nHowever, the husband's actions are to protect his own food preferences. The wife's actions are also a bit inconsiderate, given that she's taking his stuff despite the labels. So maybe both sides have some responsibility here. But the question is about the husband's actions. Is he wrong for locking the door?\n\nIn some cultures, sharing resources in a marriage is expected, but personal preferences about food can be a gray area. The husband isn't preventing his wife from accessing food; she has her own. He's just securing his own. So maybe it's about personal boundaries. If he's comfortable with the lock and it doesn't affect their relationship negatively, perhaps it's okay. But if it's causing tension, maybe he should communicate more.\n\nBut the key point is that he's taking steps to protect his own hygiene standards. Since it's his home, he has the right to set boundaries. However, locking the bedroom door might be seen as an overreaction. Maybe there's a better way to handle it without locking the door. But since he's done that, the question is if he's in the wrong.\n\nIn the end, it's about whether the husband's actions are reasonable. The answer could depend on cultural context, but generally, people have different tolerance levels. The husband's actions, while extreme, are to protect his own preferences. The wife's actions are also a bit inconsiderate. So maybe the answer is that he's not in the wrong, as he's protecting his own space and preferences, even if the method is extreme. But some might argue that a lock is too much. However, the user initially thought the answer is B (not in the wrong), and I need to decide if that's correct.\n"
