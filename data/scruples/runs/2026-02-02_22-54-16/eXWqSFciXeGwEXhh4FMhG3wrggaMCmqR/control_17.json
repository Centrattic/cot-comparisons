And she's not super on top of keeping her hands washed. \n\nI like to eat handfuls of shredded cheese as a snack. \n\nMy wife will take my bag of cheese out of the fridge and stick her unwashed hand into my cheese, **immediately** after taking her fingers out of her mouth. \n\nThat is fucking disgusting IMO. Now the whole bag of cheese is ruined, and my snack is gone. \n\nSo I started buying her her own bags of cheese. I clearly labeled each bag with either her name or mine.  \n\nFF to the next morning, and she has *my* bag of cheese. Hers is still sitting in the fridge (opened, and contaminated by her unwashed hands). She didn't bother checking the labels. So now she has two bags of cheese, and I have 0. \n\nNext step: I buy a mini fridge and put it in my bedroom. We have seperate bedrooms, so I figured I was solving the problem.   \n\nBut NO. 3 days later, I get home from work and she's **sitting on my bed, eating my bag of cheese**. There was still plenty of cheese in the main fridge. This is not a money issue. I don't care if she eats 100 bags of cheese. I just want **my** cheese to be **my** cheese, so I know it hasn't had unwashed hands in it. \n\nSo I installed a deadbolt on my bedroom door, and I keep my room locked whenever I am not home. Now my cheese is safe. My wife still has plenty of cheese to eat. She just no longer has access to **my fucking cheese**. \n\nShe says it shouldn't matter, since we kiss all the time. But I don't want to eat cheese that has someone else's stale saliva on it. No matter how much I love her, food safety is food safety. She is introducing germs into a fertile breeding ground, and I just can't get over that. I need my cheese to be clean. \n\nSo, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for installing a lock on their bedroom door to keep their cheese safe from their wife's germs. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The wife bites her nails and doesn't wash her hands, and the husband likes to eat shredded cheese. She takes his cheese directly after her mouth, which he finds gross. He tries giving her her own labeled bags, but she still ends up taking his. Then he gets a mini fridge in his room, but she accesses it anyway. So he locks the door to keep his cheese safe.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The husband's actions are to protect his personal space and his food. The wife is in their shared home, but they have separate bedrooms. He's using a deadbolt to prevent access to his room when he's not there. \n\nIn terms of rights, in most places, a married couple shares a home, but each person might have a right to their own space. If they have separate bedrooms, each might have the right to lock their own room. However, the wife might feel that the husband is being controlling or creating unnecessary barriers. \n\nThe husband's reasoning is about personal hygiene and food safety. He's concerned about germs from her unwashed hands and using the cheese immediately after her mouth. That's a valid health concern for him. On the other hand, the wife might see it as an overreaction, especially since they kiss and share meals, implying she's comfortable with close contact otherwise. \n\nBut the key point is whether he's in the wrong. Legally, unless there's a domestic violence issue or something, installing a lock on a bedroom is generally acceptable. It's a private space. However, in terms of relationship dynamics, it might be a point of contention. The husband is asserting his personal space and preferences, which is his right, but the wife might feel disrespected or that he's not being considerate. \n\nThe wife's argument is that since they kiss, germs shouldn't matter. But that's a different context\u2014kissing is consensual and doesn't involve food. The husband's issue is with food being handled in a way he finds unsanitary. It's about personal boundaries. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? If the lock is just to protect his own belongings and personal space in a shared home but separate rooms, then no. He's not doing anything illegal. But if the lock is causing unnecessary conflict or is an overreaction, maybe. However, given the context, his actions seem reasonable. The wife could have her own cheese, but he's ensuring his is safe. \n\nTherefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
