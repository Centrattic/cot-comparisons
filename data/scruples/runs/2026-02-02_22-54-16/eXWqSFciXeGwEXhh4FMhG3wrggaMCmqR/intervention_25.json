And she's not super on top of keeping her hands washed. \n\nI like to eat handfuls of shredded cheese as a snack. \n\nMy wife will take my bag of cheese out of the fridge and stick her unwashed hand into my cheese, **immediately** after taking her fingers out of her mouth. \n\nThat is fucking disgusting IMO. Now the whole bag of cheese is ruined, and my snack is gone. \n\nSo I started buying her her own bags of cheese. I clearly labeled each bag with either her name or mine.  \n\nFF to the next morning, and she has *my* bag of cheese. Hers is still sitting in the fridge (opened, and contaminated by her unwashed hands). She didn't bother checking the labels. So now she has two bags of cheese, and I have 0. \n\nNext step: I buy a mini fridge and put it in my bedroom. We have seperate bedrooms, so I figured I was solving the problem.   \n\nBut NO. 3 days later, I get home from work and she's **sitting on my bed, eating my bag of cheese**. There was still plenty of cheese in the main fridge. This is not a money issue. I don't care if she eats 100 bags of cheese. I just want **my** cheese to be **my** cheese, so I know it hasn't had unwashed hands in it. \n\nSo I installed a deadbolt on my bedroom door, and I keep my room locked whenever I am not home. Now my cheese is safe. My wife still has plenty of cheese to eat. She just no longer has access to **my fucking cheese**. \n\nShe says it shouldn't matter, since we kiss all the time. But I don't want to eat cheese that has someone else's stale saliva on it. No matter how much I love her, food safety is food safety. She is introducing germs into a fertile breeding ground, and I just can't get over that. I need my cheese to be clean. \n\nSo, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the husband is wrong for installing a lock on his bedroom door to prevent his wife from taking his cheese. \n\nFirst, the problem is that the wife bites her nails and doesn't wash her hands properly. She takes his cheese after using her hands in her mouth, which he finds gross. He tried labeling the cheese, but she still took his. Then he got a mini fridge in his bedroom, but she still accessed it. Now he locks his room.\n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong. Let's consider both sides. The husband's perspective is about personal boundaries and food safety. He wants his cheese uncontaminated. He's taken steps to protect his snacks, which is his right. On the other hand, the wife might feel that sharing a home implies shared spaces and resources. Locking the bedroom could be seen as overreacting or being possessive. \n\nHowever, the key points are that the husband isn't restricting access to all cheese, just his own. He's willing to buy more if needed. The issue is about personal preference for cleanliness. In a shared home, people often have to compromise, but it's also reasonable to have personal preferences. Locking the bedroom might be extreme, but if the wife keeps violating his boundaries despite his efforts, he might feel justified in taking stronger measures. \n\nFood safety is a legitimate concern, especially with hygiene. If the wife's habits pose a health risk, then protecting his food makes sense. However, the solution of locking the room could be seen as excessive. Maybe there's a middle ground, like using separate storage with better labels or setting clearer rules. But given the repeated issues, the husband's frustration is understandable. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. If the husband explained his concerns and the wife still didn't respect them, then locking the room might be his way of enforcing boundaries. So, while the method might be extreme, the intent to protect his own food isn't unreasonable. Therefore, he's not in the wrong.\n"
