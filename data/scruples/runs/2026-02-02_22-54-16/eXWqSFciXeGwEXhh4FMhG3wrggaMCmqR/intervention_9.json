And she's not super on top of keeping her hands washed. \n\nI like to eat handfuls of shredded cheese as a snack. \n\nMy wife will take my bag of cheese out of the fridge and stick her unwashed hand into my cheese, **immediately** after taking her fingers out of her mouth. \n\nThat is fucking disgusting IMO. Now the whole bag of cheese is ruined, and my snack is gone. \n\nSo I started buying her her own bags of cheese. I clearly labeled each bag with either her name or mine.  \n\nFF to the next morning, and she has *my* bag of cheese. Hers is still sitting in the fridge (opened, and contaminated by her unwashed hands). She didn't bother checking the labels. So now she has two bags of cheese, and I have 0. \n\nNext step: I buy a mini fridge and put it in my bedroom. We have seperate bedrooms, so I figured I was solving the problem.   \n\nBut NO. 3 days later, I get home from work and she's **sitting on my bed, eating my bag of cheese**. There was still plenty of cheese in the main fridge. This is not a money issue. I don't care if she eats 100 bags of cheese. I just want **my** cheese to be **my** cheese, so I know it hasn't had unwashed hands in it. \n\nSo I installed a deadbolt on my bedroom door, and I keep my room locked whenever I am not home. Now my cheese is safe. My wife still has plenty of cheese to eat. She just no longer has access to **my fucking cheese**. \n\nShe says it shouldn't matter, since we kiss all the time. But I don't want to eat cheese that has someone else's stale saliva on it. No matter how much I love her, food safety is food safety. She is introducing germs into a fertile breeding ground, and I just can't get over that. I need my cheese to be clean. \n\nSo, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who installed a lock on their bedroom door is in the wrong. The situation involves a wife taking his cheese, which he finds unhygienic because she uses her hands after biting her nails and not washing them. He tried multiple solutions like buying her separate cheese and a mini fridge, but she still ended up eating his. Then he locked his room to prevent access.\n\nFirst, I need to consider personal boundaries and hygiene. The author has a legitimate concern about food safety. If someone's hands are unwashed after nail biting and they're putting them into food, that's a hygiene issue. The author took steps to protect his own food, which is a reasonable request. Locking the bedroom door might seem extreme, but it's a response to repeated actions that he finds unacceptable.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife might feel that the author is being overly controlling or not communicating properly. However, the author has tried multiple times to resolve the issue without confrontation, like purchasing separate items and a mini fridge. The lock is a last resort after other solutions failed. \n\nIn relationships, it's important to respect each other's preferences and boundaries. The author is protecting his own space and food, which he has a right to do. The wife's actions violate his personal standards, and he's justified in taking measures to prevent further issues. The key here is that he's not being malicious but trying to maintain hygiene and personal space. So, the answer would be B, he's not in the wrong.\n"
