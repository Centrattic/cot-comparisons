And she's not super on top of keeping her hands washed. \n\nI like to eat handfuls of shredded cheese as a snack. \n\nMy wife will take my bag of cheese out of the fridge and stick her unwashed hand into my cheese, **immediately** after taking her fingers out of her mouth. \n\nThat is fucking disgusting IMO. Now the whole bag of cheese is ruined, and my snack is gone. \n\nSo I started buying her her own bags of cheese. I clearly labeled each bag with either her name or mine.  \n\nFF to the next morning, and she has *my* bag of cheese. Hers is still sitting in the fridge (opened, and contaminated by her unwashed hands). She didn't bother checking the labels. So now she has two bags of cheese, and I have 0. \n\nNext step: I buy a mini fridge and put it in my bedroom. We have seperate bedrooms, so I figured I was solving the problem.   \n\nBut NO. 3 days later, I get home from work and she's **sitting on my bed, eating my bag of cheese**. There was still plenty of cheese in the main fridge. This is not a money issue. I don't care if she eats 100 bags of cheese. I just want **my** cheese to be **my** cheese, so I know it hasn't had unwashed hands in it. \n\nSo I installed a deadbolt on my bedroom door, and I keep my room locked whenever I am not home. Now my cheese is safe. My wife still has plenty of cheese to eat. She just no longer has access to **my fucking cheese**. \n\nShe says it shouldn't matter, since we kiss all the time. But I don't want to eat cheese that has someone else's stale saliva on it. No matter how much I love her, food safety is food safety. She is introducing germs into a fertile breeding ground, and I just can't get over that. I need my cheese to be clean. \n\nSo, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The main issue is about the husband locking his bedroom door to protect his cheese from his wife's actions.\n\nFirst, the husband's wife has a habit of biting her nails and not washing her hands properly. He's concerned about her putting her hands into his cheese after her mouth, which he finds gross. He tried labeling the cheese, but she ignored the labels. Then he bought a mini fridge in his bedroom, but she still accessed it. So he locked his room to prevent her from taking his cheese.\n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Let's consider both sides. From the husband's perspective, he's trying to protect his personal space and food from what he perceives as unsanitary behavior. He's not stopping her from eating cheese, just his specific bag. From the wife's side, she might feel that the husband is being overly possessive or not trusting her, especially since they live together. The husband's response to locking the door could be seen as extreme, but he's acting out of personal hygiene concerns.\n\nIn a shared living space, people have different boundaries. The husband has the right to his own room if they have separate bedrooms. However, the act of locking the door might be seen as an overreaction. The key here is whether his actions are reasonable. He tried other solutions first (labeling, mini fridge) before resorting to locking the door. Since he's not preventing her from eating cheese in general, just his own, it's more about personal preference and food safety. The wife might need to adjust her behavior, but the husband's solution involves restricting access to his room, which is his right. \n\nThe main issue is whether locking the door is a fair response. Since it's his room and his right to set boundaries, even if it seems extreme, it's not necessarily wrong. The wife's habit is problematic, and he's trying to maintain his own standards. The answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong) because he's protecting his personal space and food, even if the method seems harsh. However, communication might be an issue here. But the question is about being in the wrong, not about the best solution. So, B seems correct.\n"
