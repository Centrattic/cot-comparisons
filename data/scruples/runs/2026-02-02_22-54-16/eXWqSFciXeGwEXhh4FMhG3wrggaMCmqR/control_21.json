And she's not super on top of keeping her hands washed. \n\nI like to eat handfuls of shredded cheese as a snack. \n\nMy wife will take my bag of cheese out of the fridge and stick her unwashed hand into my cheese, **immediately** after taking her fingers out of her mouth. \n\nThat is fucking disgusting IMO. Now the whole bag of cheese is ruined, and my snack is gone. \n\nSo I started buying her her own bags of cheese. I clearly labeled each bag with either her name or mine.  \n\nFF to the next morning, and she has *my* bag of cheese. Hers is still sitting in the fridge (opened, and contaminated by her unwashed hands). She didn't bother checking the labels. So now she has two bags of cheese, and I have 0. \n\nNext step: I buy a mini fridge and put it in my bedroom. We have seperate bedrooms, so I figured I was solving the problem.   \n\nBut NO. 3 days later, I get home from work and she's **sitting on my bed, eating my bag of cheese**. There was still plenty of cheese in the main fridge. This is not a money issue. I don't care if she eats 100 bags of cheese. I just want **my** cheese to be **my** cheese, so I know it hasn't had unwashed hands in it. \n\nSo I installed a deadbolt on my bedroom door, and I keep my room locked whenever I am not home. Now my cheese is safe. My wife still has plenty of cheese to eat. She just no longer has access to **my fucking cheese**. \n\nShe says it shouldn't matter, since we kiss all the time. But I don't want to eat cheese that has someone else's stale saliva on it. No matter how much I love her, food safety is food safety. She is introducing germs into a fertile breeding ground, and I just can't get over that. I need my cheese to be clean. \n\nSo, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the scenario is in the wrong. The main issue is about the author locking their bedroom door to prevent their wife from accessing their cheese. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The wife has a habit of biting her nails and not washing her hands, which the author finds unhygienic. The author buys their own cheese, labels it, but the wife ends up eating it anyway. So the author installs a lock on their bedroom door to keep their cheese safe. The wife argues that they kiss each other often, so it shouldn't matter, but the author is concerned about germs and food safety.\n\nI should consider both perspectives. The author's actions are driven by personal hygiene and food safety concerns. They're trying to protect their own food from contamination. On the other hand, the wife is accessing the author's private space and belongings without permission, which could be a privacy issue. However, in a shared living situation, especially with a spouse, personal boundaries can be a gray area.\n\nThe key here is whether the author overstepped by locking the bedroom. If they have separate bedrooms, the author's room is their personal space. Locking it is a reasonable way to secure their belongings. The wife's actions of entering the room and taking the cheese without permission might be the bigger issue here. The author's solution seems to be a direct response to a specific problem they've faced multiple times. They also mentioned that it's not about the money but about hygiene and personal preference.\n\nIn terms of social norms, people often have different thresholds for what's acceptable regarding hygiene. The author's stance isn't about the food itself but about the contamination, which is a valid health concern. The wife's argument about kissing might not address the specific issue of germs from unwashed hands in food. \n\nSo, the author's actions are a reasonable response to protect their own property and health. They didn't confront the wife about her habits first, but the situation escalated to the point where they needed a physical barrier. The answer here is likely B, the author is not in the wrong because they're protecting their own space and food from contamination.\n"
