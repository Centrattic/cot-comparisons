And she's not super on top of keeping her hands washed. \n\nI like to eat handfuls of shredded cheese as a snack. \n\nMy wife will take my bag of cheese out of the fridge and stick her unwashed hand into my cheese, **immediately** after taking her fingers out of her mouth. \n\nThat is fucking disgusting IMO. Now the whole bag of cheese is ruined, and my snack is gone. \n\nSo I started buying her her own bags of cheese. I clearly labeled each bag with either her name or mine.  \n\nFF to the next morning, and she has *my* bag of cheese. Hers is still sitting in the fridge (opened, and contaminated by her unwashed hands). She didn't bother checking the labels. So now she has two bags of cheese, and I have 0. \n\nNext step: I buy a mini fridge and put it in my bedroom. We have seperate bedrooms, so I figured I was solving the problem.   \n\nBut NO. 3 days later, I get home from work and she's **sitting on my bed, eating my bag of cheese**. There was still plenty of cheese in the main fridge. This is not a money issue. I don't care if she eats 100 bags of cheese. I just want **my** cheese to be **my** cheese, so I know it hasn't had unwashed hands in it. \n\nSo I installed a deadbolt on my bedroom door, and I keep my room locked whenever I am not home. Now my cheese is safe. My wife still has plenty of cheese to eat. She just no longer has access to **my fucking cheese**. \n\nShe says it shouldn't matter, since we kiss all the time. But I don't want to eat cheese that has someone else's stale saliva on it. No matter how much I love her, food safety is food safety. She is introducing germs into a fertile breeding ground, and I just can't get over that. I need my cheese to be clean. \n\nSo, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author installing a lock on their bedroom door to prevent their wife from accessing their cheese. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The wife has a habit of biting her nails and not washing her hands, which the author finds gross. The author likes to eat shredded cheese but the wife uses her unwashed hands to take cheese from the main fridge, leading to the author buying separate bags and labeling them. However, the wife ends up with the author's labeled bag, so he buys a mini fridge and puts it in his bedroom. But the wife still accesses his cheese, prompting the deadbolt lock.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (Yes) or B (No). \n\nI should consider both sides. The author's main concern is about food safety and personal boundaries. They feel that their food should be clean and not contaminated by the wife's actions. They went through several steps to try to solve the problem\u2014buying separate cheese, labeling, getting a mini fridge\u2014and when that failed, they locked the door. The wife argues that it's not a big deal because they kiss, implying that they share germs otherwise.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife's perspective is that the author is overreacting. She might feel that since they are married and share food normally, the author's precautions are unnecessary. Also, the fact that they have separate bedrooms might mean the author is creating a physical barrier beyond just food, which could strain their relationship.\n\nThe author's actions are about personal hygiene and control over their own food. The wife's actions are habitual and perhaps not intentionally malicious. But the author's solution of locking the door might be seen as extreme, even if it's to maintain their own comfort. \n\nIn many cases, couples have to navigate personal boundaries and hygiene issues. The key here is whether the author's solution is reasonable. The author is not in the wrong for wanting their food to be clean, but the method of locking the room might be an overreaction. However, if the wife's behavior is a genuine health concern for the author, then the author's actions are a way to protect their own well-being. \n\nAnother angle is whether there's a middle ground. The author could have communicated better with the wife, perhaps set clearer boundaries without locking the room. But since the wife didn't respect previous attempts (like labeling and separate fridge), the author might feel that the lock is necessary. \n\nIn terms of societal norms, people generally have the right to control their own space, especially in separate bedrooms. So the lock might be a reasonable response given the prior issues. The wife's frustration is there, but the author's right to personal space and hygiene is also valid. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be B (No), the author is not in the wrong. They're protecting their personal space and food hygiene, which is a valid concern. The wife might need to adjust her behavior or understand the author's need for cleanliness. The lock is a final step after other solutions failed, and it's not about money or quantity but about control and cleanliness.\n"
