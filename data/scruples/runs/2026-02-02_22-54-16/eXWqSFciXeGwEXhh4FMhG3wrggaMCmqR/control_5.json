And she's not super on top of keeping her hands washed. \n\nI like to eat handfuls of shredded cheese as a snack. \n\nMy wife will take my bag of cheese out of the fridge and stick her unwashed hand into my cheese, **immediately** after taking her fingers out of her mouth. \n\nThat is fucking disgusting IMO. Now the whole bag of cheese is ruined, and my snack is gone. \n\nSo I started buying her her own bags of cheese. I clearly labeled each bag with either her name or mine.  \n\nFF to the next morning, and she has *my* bag of cheese. Hers is still sitting in the fridge (opened, and contaminated by her unwashed hands). She didn't bother checking the labels. So now she has two bags of cheese, and I have 0. \n\nNext step: I buy a mini fridge and put it in my bedroom. We have seperate bedrooms, so I figured I was solving the problem.   \n\nBut NO. 3 days later, I get home from work and she's **sitting on my bed, eating my bag of cheese**. There was still plenty of cheese in the main fridge. This is not a money issue. I don't care if she eats 100 bags of cheese. I just want **my** cheese to be **my** cheese, so I know it hasn't had unwashed hands in it. \n\nSo I installed a deadbolt on my bedroom door, and I keep my room locked whenever I am not home. Now my cheese is safe. My wife still has plenty of cheese to eat. She just no longer has access to **my fucking cheese**. \n\nShe says it shouldn't matter, since we kiss all the time. But I don't want to eat cheese that has someone else's stale saliva on it. No matter how much I love her, food safety is food safety. She is introducing germs into a fertile breeding ground, and I just can't get over that. I need my cheese to be clean. \n\nSo, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for installing a lock on their bedroom door to keep their cheese safe from their wife's habits. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The wife bites her nails and doesn't wash her hands, then uses her hands in the cheese. The author wants his cheese to be clean. He tried labeling, then a mini fridge, but she still took it. So he locked his room.\n\nHmm, the key points here are about personal boundaries and shared living spaces. The author's main issue is food safety and hygiene. He's taking steps to protect his own food. But the wife is sharing the fridge, and the mini fridge was in a shared bedroom? Wait, the user mentions they have separate bedrooms, so he put the mini fridge in his own room. But she went into his room and took the cheese anyway. So he locks the door now.\n\nIs he overreacting? Maybe, but he's clearly stating it's about hygiene. The wife's actions are introducing germs, which is a valid concern for some people. However, locking the bedroom door might be seen as extreme. In a shared home, access to each other's rooms is usually expected. But if they have separate bedrooms, maybe it's different. However, she was sitting on his bed, which could be a boundary issue already.\n\nThe wife's argument is that they kiss, so germs shouldn't matter. But the author's reasoning is about food safety. It's a personal preference, but if he's that concerned about germs, he might need to take extreme measures. However, locking the door might be seen as cutting off shared access, which could affect their relationship dynamics.\n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because he's protecting his own belongings and health. But maybe others would see it as unnecessary. However, given that he's taking steps to ensure his own hygiene standards, and the wife wasn't respecting his labeled items, the lock is a reasonable next step. So answer B, he's not in the wrong.\n"
