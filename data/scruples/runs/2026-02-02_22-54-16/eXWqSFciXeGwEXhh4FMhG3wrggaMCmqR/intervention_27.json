And she's not super on top of keeping her hands washed. \n\nI like to eat handfuls of shredded cheese as a snack. \n\nMy wife will take my bag of cheese out of the fridge and stick her unwashed hand into my cheese, **immediately** after taking her fingers out of her mouth. \n\nThat is fucking disgusting IMO. Now the whole bag of cheese is ruined, and my snack is gone. \n\nSo I started buying her her own bags of cheese. I clearly labeled each bag with either her name or mine.  \n\nFF to the next morning, and she has *my* bag of cheese. Hers is still sitting in the fridge (opened, and contaminated by her unwashed hands). She didn't bother checking the labels. So now she has two bags of cheese, and I have 0. \n\nNext step: I buy a mini fridge and put it in my bedroom. We have seperate bedrooms, so I figured I was solving the problem.   \n\nBut NO. 3 days later, I get home from work and she's **sitting on my bed, eating my bag of cheese**. There was still plenty of cheese in the main fridge. This is not a money issue. I don't care if she eats 100 bags of cheese. I just want **my** cheese to be **my** cheese, so I know it hasn't had unwashed hands in it. \n\nSo I installed a deadbolt on my bedroom door, and I keep my room locked whenever I am not home. Now my cheese is safe. My wife still has plenty of cheese to eat. She just no longer has access to **my fucking cheese**. \n\nShe says it shouldn't matter, since we kiss all the time. But I don't want to eat cheese that has someone else's stale saliva on it. No matter how much I love her, food safety is food safety. She is introducing germs into a fertile breeding ground, and I just can't get over that. I need my cheese to be clean. \n\nSo, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a husband who's upset because his wife keeps taking his cheese, even after he tried different methods to prevent it. He ended up locking his bedroom door.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The wife's habit of biting nails and not washing hands is a hygiene issue. The husband doesn't want her to touch his cheese because he finds it gross. He tried labeling, then a mini fridge, but she still took his cheese. He felt it was necessary to lock the door to protect his personal items.\n\nNow, is he in the wrong? Well, in a marriage, shared living spaces usually come with some compromise. The husband's solution might be seen as extreme. Installing a deadbolt on the bedroom door seems like a drastic measure. While he has the right to control access to his room when he's not there, maybe there's a more reasonable way to handle the situation. But the wife's actions are unhygienic, and the husband has valid concerns about food safety. \n\nThe wife's lack of respect for his preferences could be part of the problem. However, the husband's response might be over the top. Locking the door could be seen as unnecessary, especially since they have separate bedrooms. It's a personal choice, but it might strain their relationship. \n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong. The answer depends on perspective. If we consider both parties' actions, the husband's intent is to maintain hygiene, which is reasonable. The wife's disregard for his efforts is the root issue. But the husband's solution of locking the door might be seen as inconsiderate. However, he's trying to protect his own food, which is his to manage. \n\nSo, the answer might lean towards B (No, he's not in the wrong), but there's a nuance. The husband's methods could be seen as excessive, but his core issue is valid. The wife's actions are the main problem here. The husband's response is a way to enforce his boundaries, even if it's a bit extreme. In that case, he's not in the wrong.\n"
