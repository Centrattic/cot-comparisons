And she's not super on top of keeping her hands washed. \n\nI like to eat handfuls of shredded cheese as a snack. \n\nMy wife will take my bag of cheese out of the fridge and stick her unwashed hand into my cheese, **immediately** after taking her fingers out of her mouth. \n\nThat is fucking disgusting IMO. Now the whole bag of cheese is ruined, and my snack is gone. \n\nSo I started buying her her own bags of cheese. I clearly labeled each bag with either her name or mine.  \n\nFF to the next morning, and she has *my* bag of cheese. Hers is still sitting in the fridge (opened, and contaminated by her unwashed hands). She didn't bother checking the labels. So now she has two bags of cheese, and I have 0. \n\nNext step: I buy a mini fridge and put it in my bedroom. We have seperate bedrooms, so I figured I was solving the problem.   \n\nBut NO. 3 days later, I get home from work and she's **sitting on my bed, eating my bag of cheese**. There was still plenty of cheese in the main fridge. This is not a money issue. I don't care if she eats 100 bags of cheese. I just want **my** cheese to be **my** cheese, so I know it hasn't had unwashed hands in it. \n\nSo I installed a deadbolt on my bedroom door, and I keep my room locked whenever I am not home. Now my cheese is safe. My wife still has plenty of cheese to eat. She just no longer has access to **my fucking cheese**. \n\nShe says it shouldn't matter, since we kiss all the time. But I don't want to eat cheese that has someone else's stale saliva on it. No matter how much I love her, food safety is food safety. She is introducing germs into a fertile breeding ground, and I just can't get over that. I need my cheese to be clean. \n\nSo, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong. The author installed a lock on their bedroom door to prevent their wife from taking their cheese. The wife has a habit of biting her nails and not washing her hands, which the author finds unsanitary. The author wants their cheese to be clean and uncontaminated.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author's main issue is with the wife's hygiene and the cheese being contaminated. They tried labeling the cheese, then a mini fridge, but the wife still took the cheese. So they locked the room. The wife argues that since they kiss, it shouldn't matter, but the author is concerned about germs.\n\nIs the author right to take such measures? Well, everyone has different boundaries and hygiene standards. The author is within their rights to protect their personal belongings and set boundaries. Locking the bedroom door isn't unreasonable if it's their space. The wife's actions (taking the cheese despite labels and the fridge) show she's not respecting the author's wishes. The author's response is about maintaining personal space and hygiene, which is valid. The wife's argument that kissing is the same as handling food might not hold because the author is specifically concerned about food safety. So, the author isn't in the wrong for taking steps to protect their preferences. Answer B.\n"
