And she's not super on top of keeping her hands washed. \n\nI like to eat handfuls of shredded cheese as a snack. \n\nMy wife will take my bag of cheese out of the fridge and stick her unwashed hand into my cheese, **immediately** after taking her fingers out of her mouth. \n\nThat is fucking disgusting IMO. Now the whole bag of cheese is ruined, and my snack is gone. \n\nSo I started buying her her own bags of cheese. I clearly labeled each bag with either her name or mine.  \n\nFF to the next morning, and she has *my* bag of cheese. Hers is still sitting in the fridge (opened, and contaminated by her unwashed hands). She didn't bother checking the labels. So now she has two bags of cheese, and I have 0. \n\nNext step: I buy a mini fridge and put it in my bedroom. We have seperate bedrooms, so I figured I was solving the problem.   \n\nBut NO. 3 days later, I get home from work and she's **sitting on my bed, eating my bag of cheese**. There was still plenty of cheese in the main fridge. This is not a money issue. I don't care if she eats 100 bags of cheese. I just want **my** cheese to be **my** cheese, so I know it hasn't had unwashed hands in it. \n\nSo I installed a deadbolt on my bedroom door, and I keep my room locked whenever I am not home. Now my cheese is safe. My wife still has plenty of cheese to eat. She just no longer has access to **my fucking cheese**. \n\nShe says it shouldn't matter, since we kiss all the time. But I don't want to eat cheese that has someone else's stale saliva on it. No matter how much I love her, food safety is food safety. She is introducing germs into a fertile breeding ground, and I just can't get over that. I need my cheese to be clean. \n\nSo, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given story is in the wrong. The situation involves a married couple where the husband is upset because his wife uses his cheese after not washing her hands properly. He tries various solutions, like labeling bags, getting a mini fridge, and finally locking his bedroom door. The wife is upset, but the husband feels it's about food safety and personal preference.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The husband's main issue is hygiene and wanting his cheese to be untouched by others. He's taken steps to prevent this, which escalated to locking his room. The wife, on the other hand, doesn't see the problem, comparing it to kissing, which doesn't affect her view.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The husband's actions are based on his personal preferences and food safety concerns. From a legal standpoint, he owns the cheese, so he can control access to it. However, in a marriage, there might be expectations of shared resources. But the husband has made it clear he's not against her eating cheese in general, just his own. He's even bought her separate bags. The mini fridge and lock are his solutions to protect his preferences.\n\nThe wife's reaction might be about feeling disrespected or not having her boundaries respected, but the husband's actions are about his own comfort and hygiene. It's a matter of personal choice versus shared living. Since there's no indication of harm beyond personal preferences, the husband isn't necessarily in the wrong. He's managing his own stuff in a way that aligns with his values, even if it causes some friction. The answer is likely B.\n"
