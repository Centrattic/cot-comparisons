And she's not super on top of keeping her hands washed. \n\nI like to eat handfuls of shredded cheese as a snack. \n\nMy wife will take my bag of cheese out of the fridge and stick her unwashed hand into my cheese, **immediately** after taking her fingers out of her mouth. \n\nThat is fucking disgusting IMO. Now the whole bag of cheese is ruined, and my snack is gone. \n\nSo I started buying her her own bags of cheese. I clearly labeled each bag with either her name or mine.  \n\nFF to the next morning, and she has *my* bag of cheese. Hers is still sitting in the fridge (opened, and contaminated by her unwashed hands). She didn't bother checking the labels. So now she has two bags of cheese, and I have 0. \n\nNext step: I buy a mini fridge and put it in my bedroom. We have seperate bedrooms, so I figured I was solving the problem.   \n\nBut NO. 3 days later, I get home from work and she's **sitting on my bed, eating my bag of cheese**. There was still plenty of cheese in the main fridge. This is not a money issue. I don't care if she eats 100 bags of cheese. I just want **my** cheese to be **my** cheese, so I know it hasn't had unwashed hands in it. \n\nSo I installed a deadbolt on my bedroom door, and I keep my room locked whenever I am not home. Now my cheese is safe. My wife still has plenty of cheese to eat. She just no longer has access to **my fucking cheese**. \n\nShe says it shouldn't matter, since we kiss all the time. But I don't want to eat cheese that has someone else's stale saliva on it. No matter how much I love her, food safety is food safety. She is introducing germs into a fertile breeding ground, and I just can't get over that. I need my cheese to be clean. \n\nSo, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who installed a lock on their bedroom door is in the wrong. The situation involves a wife who takes the husband's cheese after biting her nails and not washing her hands. The husband keeps buying his own cheese, but she ends up taking his labeled bag. He then gets a mini fridge and locks his room to keep his cheese safe. The wife argues it shouldn't matter because they kiss, but he's concerned about germs.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the core of the issue. The husband has a legitimate concern about hygiene. If someone inserts unwashed hands into food after putting them in their mouth, that's unsanitary and could lead to contamination. The husband's actions are to protect his own food. He's not keeping her out of the room, just securing his own belongings. \n\nThen, the wife's behavior is the issue here. She's taking his cheese despite labels, which suggests she's not respecting his boundaries. The husband's solution is to lock his room, which is a personal space. Since they have separate bedrooms, having a lock on his own room is not unreasonable. The wife's argument about kissing is a bit dismissive of his personal preferences and hygiene standards. \n\nIt's important to consider mutual respect in a relationship. If the husband's needs are being compromised because of his wife's actions, he's within his rights to take measures to protect his own space and belongings. However, the wife might feel that the lock is an overreaction, but given the persistence of the problem and his valid concerns, it's a reasonable step. \n\nNo one is in the wrong if the husband is protecting his own space and the wife is causing the problem by not respecting his boundaries. The husband isn't being selfish; he's addressing a legitimate health and hygiene concern. The answer should be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
