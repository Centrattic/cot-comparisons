And she's not super on top of keeping her hands washed. \n\nI like to eat handfuls of shredded cheese as a snack. \n\nMy wife will take my bag of cheese out of the fridge and stick her unwashed hand into my cheese, **immediately** after taking her fingers out of her mouth. \n\nThat is fucking disgusting IMO. Now the whole bag of cheese is ruined, and my snack is gone. \n\nSo I started buying her her own bags of cheese. I clearly labeled each bag with either her name or mine.  \n\nFF to the next morning, and she has *my* bag of cheese. Hers is still sitting in the fridge (opened, and contaminated by her unwashed hands). She didn't bother checking the labels. So now she has two bags of cheese, and I have 0. \n\nNext step: I buy a mini fridge and put it in my bedroom. We have seperate bedrooms, so I figured I was solving the problem.   \n\nBut NO. 3 days later, I get home from work and she's **sitting on my bed, eating my bag of cheese**. There was still plenty of cheese in the main fridge. This is not a money issue. I don't care if she eats 100 bags of cheese. I just want **my** cheese to be **my** cheese, so I know it hasn't had unwashed hands in it. \n\nSo I installed a deadbolt on my bedroom door, and I keep my room locked whenever I am not home. Now my cheese is safe. My wife still has plenty of cheese to eat. She just no longer has access to **my fucking cheese**. \n\nShe says it shouldn't matter, since we kiss all the time. But I don't want to eat cheese that has someone else's stale saliva on it. No matter how much I love her, food safety is food safety. She is introducing germs into a fertile breeding ground, and I just can't get over that. I need my cheese to be clean. \n\nSo, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a husband who's upset because his wife keeps taking his cheese. He's installed a lock on his bedroom door to prevent her from accessing his mini fridge where his cheese is stored. The wife bites her nails and doesn't wash her hands, which he finds gross because she puts her hands into his cheese after her mouth. \n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The husband has a legitimate concern about hygiene. If someone puts their unwashed hands, especially after biting nails, into food, that's a hygiene issue. He's trying to protect his food from contamination. He's even gone to the trouble of buying separate bags and a mini fridge, but the wife still ends up with his cheese. So he locks his door to prevent that.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife might feel that they are a married couple sharing a home, and that personal preferences shouldn't require such measures. She might argue that they exchange saliva during kissing, so his concern is inconsistent. But the husband's issue is about food safety and personal hygiene, which is a valid health concern. \n\nThe question is whether locking the bedroom door is an overreaction. Some might see it as reasonable because he's protecting his personal property and health. Others might think it's creating unnecessary separation in a marriage. However, they do have separate bedrooms, which is already a significant boundary. Adding a lock might be seen as a necessary step after previous attempts failed.\n\nI think the key points are the husband's right to personal hygiene and property, and the wife's actions that repeatedly ignore his boundaries. Since he's taken steps to address the issue and she hasn't respected them, locking the door could be justified. So the answer would likely be B (No, he's not in the wrong).\n"
