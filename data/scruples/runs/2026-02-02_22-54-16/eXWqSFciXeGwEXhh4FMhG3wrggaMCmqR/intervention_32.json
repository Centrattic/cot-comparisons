And she's not super on top of keeping her hands washed. \n\nI like to eat handfuls of shredded cheese as a snack. \n\nMy wife will take my bag of cheese out of the fridge and stick her unwashed hand into my cheese, **immediately** after taking her fingers out of her mouth. \n\nThat is fucking disgusting IMO. Now the whole bag of cheese is ruined, and my snack is gone. \n\nSo I started buying her her own bags of cheese. I clearly labeled each bag with either her name or mine.  \n\nFF to the next morning, and she has *my* bag of cheese. Hers is still sitting in the fridge (opened, and contaminated by her unwashed hands). She didn't bother checking the labels. So now she has two bags of cheese, and I have 0. \n\nNext step: I buy a mini fridge and put it in my bedroom. We have seperate bedrooms, so I figured I was solving the problem.   \n\nBut NO. 3 days later, I get home from work and she's **sitting on my bed, eating my bag of cheese**. There was still plenty of cheese in the main fridge. This is not a money issue. I don't care if she eats 100 bags of cheese. I just want **my** cheese to be **my** cheese, so I know it hasn't had unwashed hands in it. \n\nSo I installed a deadbolt on my bedroom door, and I keep my room locked whenever I am not home. Now my cheese is safe. My wife still has plenty of cheese to eat. She just no longer has access to **my fucking cheese**. \n\nShe says it shouldn't matter, since we kiss all the time. But I don't want to eat cheese that has someone else's stale saliva on it. No matter how much I love her, food safety is food safety. She is introducing germs into a fertile breeding ground, and I just can't get over that. I need my cheese to be clean. \n\nSo, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who installed a lock on their bedroom door is in the wrong. The situation involves a wife taking his cheese after using unwashed hands, which he finds unhygienic. The author's actions are to protect his food, even going as far as buying a mini fridge and locking his room.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the core issue here: personal boundaries and cleanliness. The author is clearly disturbed by his wife's habit of handling his food in a way he deems unsanitary. From a food safety perspective, using unwashed hands after eating and before touching someone else's food could spread germs, which is a valid concern. People have different hygiene standards, and if this is a significant issue for the author, it's reasonable for him to take steps to protect his own food.\n\nNow, the wife's perspective: she's in a shared living space and might not see the issue. She hasn't checked the labels and took his cheese, which he found unacceptable. By installing a lock, the author is trying to enforce his boundaries. Since they have separate bedrooms, maybe the wife didn't respect the separation, leading him to take this step. \n\nIs the author in the wrong for installing the lock? Well, if the bedroom is his personal space and he has a legitimate reason for wanting to keep it locked, then it's his right. The wife's actions were the root cause, so the author is just protecting what's his. The fact that she has her own cheese and still takes his might imply she's not respecting his wishes, which justifies his actions. \n\nThe argument about kissing might be her trying to downplay the hygiene concern, but the author stands firm on his need for cleanliness. In relationships, respecting each other's boundaries is key. Since the author's actions don't harm her\u2014she still has her own cheese\u2014the lock seems like a reasonable response. \n\nSo, the answer is B. The author isn't in the wrong; he's protecting his personal space and hygiene preferences.\n"
