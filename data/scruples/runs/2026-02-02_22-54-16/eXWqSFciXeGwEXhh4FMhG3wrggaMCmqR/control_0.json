And she's not super on top of keeping her hands washed. \n\nI like to eat handfuls of shredded cheese as a snack. \n\nMy wife will take my bag of cheese out of the fridge and stick her unwashed hand into my cheese, **immediately** after taking her fingers out of her mouth. \n\nThat is fucking disgusting IMO. Now the whole bag of cheese is ruined, and my snack is gone. \n\nSo I started buying her her own bags of cheese. I clearly labeled each bag with either her name or mine.  \n\nFF to the next morning, and she has *my* bag of cheese. Hers is still sitting in the fridge (opened, and contaminated by her unwashed hands). She didn't bother checking the labels. So now she has two bags of cheese, and I have 0. \n\nNext step: I buy a mini fridge and put it in my bedroom. We have seperate bedrooms, so I figured I was solving the problem.   \n\nBut NO. 3 days later, I get home from work and she's **sitting on my bed, eating my bag of cheese**. There was still plenty of cheese in the main fridge. This is not a money issue. I don't care if she eats 100 bags of cheese. I just want **my** cheese to be **my** cheese, so I know it hasn't had unwashed hands in it. \n\nSo I installed a deadbolt on my bedroom door, and I keep my room locked whenever I am not home. Now my cheese is safe. My wife still has plenty of cheese to eat. She just no longer has access to **my fucking cheese**. \n\nShe says it shouldn't matter, since we kiss all the time. But I don't want to eat cheese that has someone else's stale saliva on it. No matter how much I love her, food safety is food safety. She is introducing germs into a fertile breeding ground, and I just can't get over that. I need my cheese to be clean. \n\nSo, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the main issue is about the cheese and the wife taking it despite the labels and the mini fridge. The author installed a lock on their bedroom door to keep their cheese safe. \n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author is concerned about food safety because their wife bites her nails and doesn't wash her hands. They don't want their cheese contaminated. On the other hand, the wife might feel that sharing a fridge and having separate rooms is normal, but now locking the bedroom door is over the top. \n\nThe author mentions that they bought separate labeled bags and even a mini fridge, but the wife still took the wrong cheese. Maybe she didn't read the labels or didn't care. The author's response was to lock the door, which prevents access to their personal fridge. \n\nIs locking the bedroom door a reasonable solution? Well, they have separate bedrooms, so maybe the wife's actions were intruding into the author's personal space. But bedrooms are typically private, so locking it shouldn't be an issue. However, the wife might feel hurt or that the author is being controlling. \n\nThe author's main issue is about food safety and personal preference. They are not saying the wife is sick or a health risk, just that they find it gross. That's subjective. However, the lock is a way to enforce their personal boundaries. \n\nOn the flip side, could the author have handled it differently? Maybe talking to the wife, setting clearer boundaries, or maybe using a different storage method. But the author tried labels and a mini fridge, which the wife ignored. The lock is the next step to protect their own food. \n\nI think the key here is whether the lock was a reasonable response. Since the wife continued to take without respecting the labels, the author is trying to prevent that. It's about personal space and food safety. The author isn't harming the wife by locking their own room. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author isn't in the wrong) because they are protecting their own property and health preferences, even though the wife might be upset. It's about personal boundaries in a shared living space.\n"
