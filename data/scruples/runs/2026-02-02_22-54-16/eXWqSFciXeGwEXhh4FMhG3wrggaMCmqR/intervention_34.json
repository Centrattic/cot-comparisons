And she's not super on top of keeping her hands washed. \n\nI like to eat handfuls of shredded cheese as a snack. \n\nMy wife will take my bag of cheese out of the fridge and stick her unwashed hand into my cheese, **immediately** after taking her fingers out of her mouth. \n\nThat is fucking disgusting IMO. Now the whole bag of cheese is ruined, and my snack is gone. \n\nSo I started buying her her own bags of cheese. I clearly labeled each bag with either her name or mine.  \n\nFF to the next morning, and she has *my* bag of cheese. Hers is still sitting in the fridge (opened, and contaminated by her unwashed hands). She didn't bother checking the labels. So now she has two bags of cheese, and I have 0. \n\nNext step: I buy a mini fridge and put it in my bedroom. We have seperate bedrooms, so I figured I was solving the problem.   \n\nBut NO. 3 days later, I get home from work and she's **sitting on my bed, eating my bag of cheese**. There was still plenty of cheese in the main fridge. This is not a money issue. I don't care if she eats 100 bags of cheese. I just want **my** cheese to be **my** cheese, so I know it hasn't had unwashed hands in it. \n\nSo I installed a deadbolt on my bedroom door, and I keep my room locked whenever I am not home. Now my cheese is safe. My wife still has plenty of cheese to eat. She just no longer has access to **my fucking cheese**. \n\nShe says it shouldn't matter, since we kiss all the time. But I don't want to eat cheese that has someone else's stale saliva on it. No matter how much I love her, food safety is food safety. She is introducing germs into a fertile breeding ground, and I just can't get over that. I need my cheese to be clean. \n\nSo, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the scenario is in the wrong for installing a lock on their bedroom door to keep their cheese separate from their wife's. \n\nFirst, the main issue is about food safety and personal boundaries. The wife's habit of biting her nails and not washing her hands leads her to contaminate the author's cheese. The author tried compromises like buying separate bags and even a mini fridge, but the wife still ended up with his cheese. The final step was locking the bedroom door.\n\nI need to consider both sides. The author's concern is about hygiene and personal preferences regarding food. They have a valid point about not wanting to eat food touched by unwashed hands, especially after nail biting. On the other hand, the wife might feel that the author is being overly controlling or not trusting her with shared food.\n\nBut in a marriage, respecting each other's boundaries is important. The author's actions are about protecting his personal space and preferences, not necessarily controlling. The wife has her own habits, and the author is trying to accommodate by keeping his food safe. The fact that they have separate bedrooms might reduce the conflict, but the intrusion into his room for the cheese is a violation of his personal space.\n\nThe key here is whether the author's actions are reasonable. Installing a lock is a last resort after other measures failed. The author isn't preventing the wife from getting her own cheese; he's just securing his own. The wife's complaint about kissing not mattering seems irrelevant here\u2014personal hygiene preferences can be separate from romantic intimacy.\n\nSo, considering the steps the author took and the valid hygiene concerns, the author is not in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
