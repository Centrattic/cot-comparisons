And she's not super on top of keeping her hands washed. \n\nI like to eat handfuls of shredded cheese as a snack. \n\nMy wife will take my bag of cheese out of the fridge and stick her unwashed hand into my cheese, **immediately** after taking her fingers out of her mouth. \n\nThat is fucking disgusting IMO. Now the whole bag of cheese is ruined, and my snack is gone. \n\nSo I started buying her her own bags of cheese. I clearly labeled each bag with either her name or mine.  \n\nFF to the next morning, and she has *my* bag of cheese. Hers is still sitting in the fridge (opened, and contaminated by her unwashed hands). She didn't bother checking the labels. So now she has two bags of cheese, and I have 0. \n\nNext step: I buy a mini fridge and put it in my bedroom. We have seperate bedrooms, so I figured I was solving the problem.   \n\nBut NO. 3 days later, I get home from work and she's **sitting on my bed, eating my bag of cheese**. There was still plenty of cheese in the main fridge. This is not a money issue. I don't care if she eats 100 bags of cheese. I just want **my** cheese to be **my** cheese, so I know it hasn't had unwashed hands in it. \n\nSo I installed a deadbolt on my bedroom door, and I keep my room locked whenever I am not home. Now my cheese is safe. My wife still has plenty of cheese to eat. She just no longer has access to **my fucking cheese**. \n\nShe says it shouldn't matter, since we kiss all the time. But I don't want to eat cheese that has someone else's stale saliva on it. No matter how much I love her, food safety is food safety. She is introducing germs into a fertile breeding ground, and I just can't get over that. I need my cheese to be clean. \n\nSo, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who locked their bedroom door to keep their cheese safe is in the wrong. The situation involves a husband and wife with a conflict over cheese consumption.\n\nFirst, the husband's main issue is his wife's hygiene when handling his cheese. He finds it gross that she uses her unwashed hands, right after biting her nails, to take his cheese. He's trying to prevent cross-contamination. He starts by buying separate labeled bags, but she ignores the labels. Then he gets a mini fridge in his bedroom to keep his cheese safe, but she still accesses it. Finally, he locks his door to prevent her from getting his cheese when he's not there.\n\nThe question is whether he's at fault. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nI need to consider both sides. The husband has a legitimate concern about food safety and personal preference. He's taking steps to protect his own food, which he has a right to do. However, locking the bedroom door might be seen as an overreaction or creating a barrier in their shared living space. But since they have separate bedrooms, maybe it's more about personal space. \n\nThe wife's reaction isn't detailed, but the husband is asserting his right to his own food. The key here is that he's not prohibiting her from buying her own cheese; he's just securing his own. His actions are about personal hygiene and comfort, not about controlling her. \n\nIn terms of fault, it's about boundaries. If the husband is within his rights to lock his room to protect his belongings, then he's not in the wrong. The wife's actions (ignoring labels, taking his cheese) are the initial problem. The husband's response is a reasonable escalation given his previous attempts to resolve it. \n\nSo, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
