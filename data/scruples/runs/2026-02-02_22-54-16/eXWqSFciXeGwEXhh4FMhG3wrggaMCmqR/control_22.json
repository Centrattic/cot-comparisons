And she's not super on top of keeping her hands washed. \n\nI like to eat handfuls of shredded cheese as a snack. \n\nMy wife will take my bag of cheese out of the fridge and stick her unwashed hand into my cheese, **immediately** after taking her fingers out of her mouth. \n\nThat is fucking disgusting IMO. Now the whole bag of cheese is ruined, and my snack is gone. \n\nSo I started buying her her own bags of cheese. I clearly labeled each bag with either her name or mine.  \n\nFF to the next morning, and she has *my* bag of cheese. Hers is still sitting in the fridge (opened, and contaminated by her unwashed hands). She didn't bother checking the labels. So now she has two bags of cheese, and I have 0. \n\nNext step: I buy a mini fridge and put it in my bedroom. We have seperate bedrooms, so I figured I was solving the problem.   \n\nBut NO. 3 days later, I get home from work and she's **sitting on my bed, eating my bag of cheese**. There was still plenty of cheese in the main fridge. This is not a money issue. I don't care if she eats 100 bags of cheese. I just want **my** cheese to be **my** cheese, so I know it hasn't had unwashed hands in it. \n\nSo I installed a deadbolt on my bedroom door, and I keep my room locked whenever I am not home. Now my cheese is safe. My wife still has plenty of cheese to eat. She just no longer has access to **my fucking cheese**. \n\nShe says it shouldn't matter, since we kiss all the time. But I don't want to eat cheese that has someone else's stale saliva on it. No matter how much I love her, food safety is food safety. She is introducing germs into a fertile breeding ground, and I just can't get over that. I need my cheese to be clean. \n\nSo, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person (the author) is in the wrong for installing a lock on their bedroom door to keep their cheese safe from their wife's habit of using unwashed hands after biting nails.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author's wife takes his cheese, uses her hands that were in her mouth, and he finds it disgusting. He tried labeling, then a mini fridge, but she still took it. So he locked his room. He's not in a money issue, just wants his cheese to be his own. The wife argues that they kiss, so it's okay, but he's concerned about germs.\n\nNow, to determine if he's in the wrong. Let's consider both sides. On one hand, the author is protecting his personal space and preferences. Everyone has different boundaries about food hygiene. He tried several solutions before the lock. The lock itself is a personal choice, especially since they have separate bedrooms. It's his room; he can lock it if he wants. The wife's actions are the trigger, but she's not respecting his preferences.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife might feel that the lock is an overreaction. Maybe she didn't realize how much this bothered him, or she's not considering his hygiene concerns. But the author did try to communicate by labeling and moving the fridge. The lock is a final step to enforce his personal space. Since the problem was recurring, and he's not cutting her off entirely (she still has her own cheese), it's a way to set a boundary.\n\nIn relationships, respecting each other's boundaries is key. The author is asserting his boundary, which is about his comfort with food. Unless he's being unreasonable or it's causing harm beyond his own comfort, he's not necessarily in the wrong. The wife might need to adjust her behavior, but the lock is his right to protect his belongings and personal space. So, answer B (No) makes sense here.\n"
