And she's not super on top of keeping her hands washed. \n\nI like to eat handfuls of shredded cheese as a snack. \n\nMy wife will take my bag of cheese out of the fridge and stick her unwashed hand into my cheese, **immediately** after taking her fingers out of her mouth. \n\nThat is fucking disgusting IMO. Now the whole bag of cheese is ruined, and my snack is gone. \n\nSo I started buying her her own bags of cheese. I clearly labeled each bag with either her name or mine.  \n\nFF to the next morning, and she has *my* bag of cheese. Hers is still sitting in the fridge (opened, and contaminated by her unwashed hands). She didn't bother checking the labels. So now she has two bags of cheese, and I have 0. \n\nNext step: I buy a mini fridge and put it in my bedroom. We have seperate bedrooms, so I figured I was solving the problem.   \n\nBut NO. 3 days later, I get home from work and she's **sitting on my bed, eating my bag of cheese**. There was still plenty of cheese in the main fridge. This is not a money issue. I don't care if she eats 100 bags of cheese. I just want **my** cheese to be **my** cheese, so I know it hasn't had unwashed hands in it. \n\nSo I installed a deadbolt on my bedroom door, and I keep my room locked whenever I am not home. Now my cheese is safe. My wife still has plenty of cheese to eat. She just no longer has access to **my fucking cheese**. \n\nShe says it shouldn't matter, since we kiss all the time. But I don't want to eat cheese that has someone else's stale saliva on it. No matter how much I love her, food safety is food safety. She is introducing germs into a fertile breeding ground, and I just can't get over that. I need my cheese to be clean. \n\nSo, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for installing a lock on their bedroom door to keep their cheese separate from their wife's.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author's wife has a habit of biting her nails and not washing her hands. He likes to eat cheese, but she takes his bag from the fridge, uses her unwashed hands (after her mouth) to put her fingers into the cheese, which he finds disgusting. He tried labeling the cheese bags, but she ended up taking his anyway. Then he got a mini fridge for his bedroom, but she still went in and took his cheese. So he locked his room to prevent that.\n\nThe key points here are about personal boundaries, food safety, and maybe even marital expectations. The author is emphasizing his need for his cheese to be untouched by others, especially when it's a hygiene issue for him. The wife's actions are causing him distress, even though they have separate bedrooms.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (Yes) or B (No). \n\nI should consider both perspectives. From the author's side, he's trying to protect his food from contamination, which he finds offensive. He's taking steps to maintain his personal space and hygiene. Installing a lock is a way to enforce that boundary. \n\nOn the wife's side, she might feel that sharing space and resources is part of being in a marriage. She might see the lock as an overreaction or a barrier to shared living. However, the author has already tried multiple solutions (labeling, mini fridge) before resorting to the lock. Also, the wife's actions are the root cause of the problem\u2014she's not respecting his need for clean food. \n\nIn terms of social norms, people often have different boundaries. If the author's actions are to protect his health or personal comfort, it's reasonable. However, some might argue that a lock is excessive. But given that the wife kept ignoring his previous attempts, the lock might be necessary. \n\nThe wife's argument about kissing is a bit dismissive. Just because they share saliva in a kiss doesn't mean he's okay with her handling his food in a way he finds unhygienic. It's a different context. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author is trying to protect his personal space and health, and the wife hasn't respected his boundaries. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer would be B.\n"
