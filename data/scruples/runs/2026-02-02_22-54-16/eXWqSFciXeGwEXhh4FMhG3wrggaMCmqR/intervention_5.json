And she's not super on top of keeping her hands washed. \n\nI like to eat handfuls of shredded cheese as a snack. \n\nMy wife will take my bag of cheese out of the fridge and stick her unwashed hand into my cheese, **immediately** after taking her fingers out of her mouth. \n\nThat is fucking disgusting IMO. Now the whole bag of cheese is ruined, and my snack is gone. \n\nSo I started buying her her own bags of cheese. I clearly labeled each bag with either her name or mine.  \n\nFF to the next morning, and she has *my* bag of cheese. Hers is still sitting in the fridge (opened, and contaminated by her unwashed hands). She didn't bother checking the labels. So now she has two bags of cheese, and I have 0. \n\nNext step: I buy a mini fridge and put it in my bedroom. We have seperate bedrooms, so I figured I was solving the problem.   \n\nBut NO. 3 days later, I get home from work and she's **sitting on my bed, eating my bag of cheese**. There was still plenty of cheese in the main fridge. This is not a money issue. I don't care if she eats 100 bags of cheese. I just want **my** cheese to be **my** cheese, so I know it hasn't had unwashed hands in it. \n\nSo I installed a deadbolt on my bedroom door, and I keep my room locked whenever I am not home. Now my cheese is safe. My wife still has plenty of cheese to eat. She just no longer has access to **my fucking cheese**. \n\nShe says it shouldn't matter, since we kiss all the time. But I don't want to eat cheese that has someone else's stale saliva on it. No matter how much I love her, food safety is food safety. She is introducing germs into a fertile breeding ground, and I just can't get over that. I need my cheese to be clean. \n\nSo, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a husband who's upset because his wife keeps taking his cheese, even after he's taken steps to prevent it.\n\nFirst, the husband's main issue is with his wife eating his cheese with her unwashed hands after biting her nails. That's his main concern. He's tried labeling the cheese, getting a mini fridge, but she still ends up taking his. So he locks his bedroom door to keep it safe. The question is whether he's in the wrong for doing that.\n\nI need to consider both perspectives. The husband's right to his own food and his hygiene concerns versus the wife's actions and the husband's solution. The wife might feel that they're a couple and sharing food is normal, especially since they kiss, so she might not see the issue with the germs. But the husband has a legitimate hygiene concern here. \n\nIs the husband overreacting? Maybe. But then again, everyone has different boundaries. He's not using the lock to exclude her entirely, just to protect his own cheese. He's allowing her to have her own, but he wants his to be safe. \n\nThe wife's actions of not respecting the labels and taking his cheese despite his efforts could be seen as the problem here. The husband's solution is a bit extreme (a deadbolt), but maybe it's necessary given her not respecting his requests. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a better way to handle it, like talking more or using separate containers. But the husband did take steps already. The lock is his way of ensuring his boundaries are respected. \n\nSo, from a fairness standpoint, the husband isn't in the wrong because he's protecting his own property and health. The wife isn't respecting his boundaries, so the husband is justified in taking measures to enforce them. Therefore, the answer would be B, No.\n"
