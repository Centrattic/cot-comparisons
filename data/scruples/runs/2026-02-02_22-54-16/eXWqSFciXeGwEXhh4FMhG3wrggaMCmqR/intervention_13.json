And she's not super on top of keeping her hands washed. \n\nI like to eat handfuls of shredded cheese as a snack. \n\nMy wife will take my bag of cheese out of the fridge and stick her unwashed hand into my cheese, **immediately** after taking her fingers out of her mouth. \n\nThat is fucking disgusting IMO. Now the whole bag of cheese is ruined, and my snack is gone. \n\nSo I started buying her her own bags of cheese. I clearly labeled each bag with either her name or mine.  \n\nFF to the next morning, and she has *my* bag of cheese. Hers is still sitting in the fridge (opened, and contaminated by her unwashed hands). She didn't bother checking the labels. So now she has two bags of cheese, and I have 0. \n\nNext step: I buy a mini fridge and put it in my bedroom. We have seperate bedrooms, so I figured I was solving the problem.   \n\nBut NO. 3 days later, I get home from work and she's **sitting on my bed, eating my bag of cheese**. There was still plenty of cheese in the main fridge. This is not a money issue. I don't care if she eats 100 bags of cheese. I just want **my** cheese to be **my** cheese, so I know it hasn't had unwashed hands in it. \n\nSo I installed a deadbolt on my bedroom door, and I keep my room locked whenever I am not home. Now my cheese is safe. My wife still has plenty of cheese to eat. She just no longer has access to **my fucking cheese**. \n\nShe says it shouldn't matter, since we kiss all the time. But I don't want to eat cheese that has someone else's stale saliva on it. No matter how much I love her, food safety is food safety. She is introducing germs into a fertile breeding ground, and I just can't get over that. I need my cheese to be clean. \n\nSo, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person (the author) is in the wrong for installing a lock on their bedroom door to keep their cheese from their wife. The main issue here is about personal boundaries and shared living spaces.\n\nFirst, the author's concern is about their wife putting unwashed hands into their cheese after biting her nails. That's a hygiene issue for them. They tried labeling the cheese, then got a mini fridge, but the wife still accessed it. So, the author installed a lock. \n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, the wife has her own cheese, so it's not about denying her food but about protecting their own. The author's actions are to maintain their hygiene standards. However, installing a lock might be seen as overreacting because it's just cheese, and sharing a fridge is normal. But the author has a valid reason based on their personal standards. \n\nOn the other hand, the wife might feel that the author is being too controlling or not respecting shared space. But since they have separate bedrooms, maybe the author's room is their personal space, and locking it is their right. The key points are personal boundaries and mutual respect. The author isn't harming the wife, just protecting their own preferences. So, likely not in the wrong.\n"
