And she's not super on top of keeping her hands washed. \n\nI like to eat handfuls of shredded cheese as a snack. \n\nMy wife will take my bag of cheese out of the fridge and stick her unwashed hand into my cheese, **immediately** after taking her fingers out of her mouth. \n\nThat is fucking disgusting IMO. Now the whole bag of cheese is ruined, and my snack is gone. \n\nSo I started buying her her own bags of cheese. I clearly labeled each bag with either her name or mine.  \n\nFF to the next morning, and she has *my* bag of cheese. Hers is still sitting in the fridge (opened, and contaminated by her unwashed hands). She didn't bother checking the labels. So now she has two bags of cheese, and I have 0. \n\nNext step: I buy a mini fridge and put it in my bedroom. We have seperate bedrooms, so I figured I was solving the problem.   \n\nBut NO. 3 days later, I get home from work and she's **sitting on my bed, eating my bag of cheese**. There was still plenty of cheese in the main fridge. This is not a money issue. I don't care if she eats 100 bags of cheese. I just want **my** cheese to be **my** cheese, so I know it hasn't had unwashed hands in it. \n\nSo I installed a deadbolt on my bedroom door, and I keep my room locked whenever I am not home. Now my cheese is safe. My wife still has plenty of cheese to eat. She just no longer has access to **my fucking cheese**. \n\nShe says it shouldn't matter, since we kiss all the time. But I don't want to eat cheese that has someone else's stale saliva on it. No matter how much I love her, food safety is food safety. She is introducing germs into a fertile breeding ground, and I just can't get over that. I need my cheese to be clean. \n\nSo, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who installed a lock on their bedroom door is in the wrong. The situation involves the wife taking his cheese after handling it with her hands, which he finds unhygienic because she bites her nails and doesn't wash them. He's tried labeling the cheese and even bought a mini fridge, but she still took his. Now he's locked the bedroom door to prevent her from accessing his cheese.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the boundaries in a relationship. While it's a shared living space, personal preferences about food safety are valid. The husband has a legitimate concern about germs and doesn't want his food touched by unwashed hands. He's taken steps to protect his stuff, which shows he's trying to resolve the issue without confrontation. The wife, on the other hand, seems to dismiss his concerns, even after he's made accommodations for her. \n\nIs the lock an overreaction? Maybe, but considering he's already tried other solutions and she hasn't respected those, securing his space could be seen as protecting his personal belongings. However, in a marriage, there's an expectation of mutual respect and compromise. The husband's actions might be seen as isolating, but his reasoning is about health and personal space. The wife's actions of ignoring labels and taking the cheese despite his efforts could be seen as dismissive of his boundaries. \n\nSo, the husband is trying to maintain his hygiene standards, which is reasonable. The wife isn't respecting his boundaries. The lock is a final measure after previous attempts failed. Therefore, the husband isn't in the wrong; he's protecting his preferences in a shared home. The answer should be B.\n"
