And she's not super on top of keeping her hands washed. \n\nI like to eat handfuls of shredded cheese as a snack. \n\nMy wife will take my bag of cheese out of the fridge and stick her unwashed hand into my cheese, **immediately** after taking her fingers out of her mouth. \n\nThat is fucking disgusting IMO. Now the whole bag of cheese is ruined, and my snack is gone. \n\nSo I started buying her her own bags of cheese. I clearly labeled each bag with either her name or mine.  \n\nFF to the next morning, and she has *my* bag of cheese. Hers is still sitting in the fridge (opened, and contaminated by her unwashed hands). She didn't bother checking the labels. So now she has two bags of cheese, and I have 0. \n\nNext step: I buy a mini fridge and put it in my bedroom. We have seperate bedrooms, so I figured I was solving the problem.   \n\nBut NO. 3 days later, I get home from work and she's **sitting on my bed, eating my bag of cheese**. There was still plenty of cheese in the main fridge. This is not a money issue. I don't care if she eats 100 bags of cheese. I just want **my** cheese to be **my** cheese, so I know it hasn't had unwashed hands in it. \n\nSo I installed a deadbolt on my bedroom door, and I keep my room locked whenever I am not home. Now my cheese is safe. My wife still has plenty of cheese to eat. She just no longer has access to **my fucking cheese**. \n\nShe says it shouldn't matter, since we kiss all the time. But I don't want to eat cheese that has someone else's stale saliva on it. No matter how much I love her, food safety is food safety. She is introducing germs into a fertile breeding ground, and I just can't get over that. I need my cheese to be clean. \n\nSo, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author of the scenario is in the wrong.\n\nSo the situation is about the author installing a lock on their bedroom door to keep their cheese safe from their wife. The wife has a habit of biting her nails and not washing her hands, which the author finds gross. The author likes to eat shredded cheese, but the wife uses her hands after her mouth to take cheese from the fridge, contaminating it. The author tried labeling bags, buying a mini fridge, but the wife still took the cheese from the bedroom. So he locked the door.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the author's actions are reasonable. The key points are about personal boundaries and food safety. The author is concerned about hygiene, which is a personal preference. However, the wife is part of a shared living space, so there's a balance between personal preferences and shared resources.\n\nThe author's solution is to lock their bedroom door. Since they have separate bedrooms, maybe that's acceptable. But locking the door to prevent access to personal belongings might be seen as overreacting. The wife might feel that the author is being controlling or not communicating properly. The author mentions they don't mind her eating cheese, just want their own to be uncontaminated. \n\nBut is locking the door an appropriate response? Maybe the author should have discussed the issue with the wife first, set clearer boundaries, or found another solution without restricting access. Using a mini fridge in the bedroom is a step, but if the wife still takes the cheese, perhaps the author should have communicated more. \n\nThe wife's perspective is that they share a life, and maybe she doesn't see the issue with the cheese. The author's insistence on separate cheese might be a personal hygiene issue, but locking the door could be seen as an extreme measure. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author is trying to protect their own preferences, but the method might be excessive. It's possible that the author is not in the wrong because they have a right to their own preferences, especially regarding food safety. However, the response of locking the door might be seen as unnecessary, especially if communication failed. \n\nBut since the author states they don't care about the cost and just want their own cheese clean, maybe locking the door is their way of ensuring that. The answer might depend on cultural or personal norms. In some views, it's reasonable to take steps to protect one's own preferences, even if others don't share them. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author might not be in the wrong (B), but others might see it as overreacting. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the action is about protecting personal hygiene and the wife's actions are causing contamination, the author's response is a way to self-regulate. The answer could be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
