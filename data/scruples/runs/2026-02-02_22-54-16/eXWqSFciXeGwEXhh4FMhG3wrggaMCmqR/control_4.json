And she's not super on top of keeping her hands washed. \n\nI like to eat handfuls of shredded cheese as a snack. \n\nMy wife will take my bag of cheese out of the fridge and stick her unwashed hand into my cheese, **immediately** after taking her fingers out of her mouth. \n\nThat is fucking disgusting IMO. Now the whole bag of cheese is ruined, and my snack is gone. \n\nSo I started buying her her own bags of cheese. I clearly labeled each bag with either her name or mine.  \n\nFF to the next morning, and she has *my* bag of cheese. Hers is still sitting in the fridge (opened, and contaminated by her unwashed hands). She didn't bother checking the labels. So now she has two bags of cheese, and I have 0. \n\nNext step: I buy a mini fridge and put it in my bedroom. We have seperate bedrooms, so I figured I was solving the problem.   \n\nBut NO. 3 days later, I get home from work and she's **sitting on my bed, eating my bag of cheese**. There was still plenty of cheese in the main fridge. This is not a money issue. I don't care if she eats 100 bags of cheese. I just want **my** cheese to be **my** cheese, so I know it hasn't had unwashed hands in it. \n\nSo I installed a deadbolt on my bedroom door, and I keep my room locked whenever I am not home. Now my cheese is safe. My wife still has plenty of cheese to eat. She just no longer has access to **my fucking cheese**. \n\nShe says it shouldn't matter, since we kiss all the time. But I don't want to eat cheese that has someone else's stale saliva on it. No matter how much I love her, food safety is food safety. She is introducing germs into a fertile breeding ground, and I just can't get over that. I need my cheese to be clean. \n\nSo, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking whether the author (his name is omitted here, but he's the one posting the AITA question) is at fault for installing a lock on his bedroom door to prevent his wife from taking his cheese. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The wife has a habit of biting her nails and not washing her hands properly. The husband likes to eat shredded cheese, which he finds gets contaminated when she uses her unwashed hands after her mouth to take from his bag. He tried giving her her own labeled bags, but she mixed them up and ended up taking his. He then got a mini fridge in his bedroom, but she still found a way to take his cheese, leading to the installation of a lock.\n\nThe main issue here is about personal boundaries and hygiene. The husband feels that his food safety is compromised because of his wife's habits. He's taking measures to protect his own preferences, even if it's about food. The wife, on the other hand, might feel that this is overreacting, especially since they share a life together and kissing, which implies some level of intimacy and trust.\n\nBut when it comes to food, people have different sensitivity levels. Some might find the husband's actions extreme, while others might empathize with his need for cleanliness. The fact that he's not cutting off her access entirely (she still has her own cheese) but just securing his own could be seen as reasonable. However, the act of locking the bedroom door might be perceived as creating a physical barrier that could affect their relationship dynamics.\n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong. If we look at it from a standpoint of personal choice and rights, he's within his right to protect his own food. However, the social aspect is about how his actions affect the relationship. Locking the bedroom door could be seen as a step too far, implying a lack of trust or an unnecessary isolation. But considering his specific hygiene concerns, it's a personal preference that he's trying to uphold.\n\nSo, balancing personal boundaries versus relationship health. If the wife is okay with her own habits and the husband is taking measures to protect his own preferences without harming the relationship, then he's not at fault. But if the locking of the door is causing rifts or showing a lack of communication, that's where he might be in the wrong. The story doesn't mention any attempts to communicate the issue beyond buying separate cheese and a mini fridge. Maybe if he had discussed his hygiene concerns with her, they could have found a compromise. But since he took the step of the lock without that, maybe that's where the fault lies.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, people might judge based on their own experiences. Some would say it's about personal space and hygiene, so he's justified. Others might say it's overreacting and that the lock is an unnecessary measure that disrupts their shared life. Since the situation is resolved without conflict (she still has her cheese), maybe he's not in the wrong. The key is whether his actions are reasonable given his specific needs and the context.\n"
