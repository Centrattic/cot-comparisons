And she's not super on top of keeping her hands washed. \n\nI like to eat handfuls of shredded cheese as a snack. \n\nMy wife will take my bag of cheese out of the fridge and stick her unwashed hand into my cheese, **immediately** after taking her fingers out of her mouth. \n\nThat is fucking disgusting IMO. Now the whole bag of cheese is ruined, and my snack is gone. \n\nSo I started buying her her own bags of cheese. I clearly labeled each bag with either her name or mine.  \n\nFF to the next morning, and she has *my* bag of cheese. Hers is still sitting in the fridge (opened, and contaminated by her unwashed hands). She didn't bother checking the labels. So now she has two bags of cheese, and I have 0. \n\nNext step: I buy a mini fridge and put it in my bedroom. We have seperate bedrooms, so I figured I was solving the problem.   \n\nBut NO. 3 days later, I get home from work and she's **sitting on my bed, eating my bag of cheese**. There was still plenty of cheese in the main fridge. This is not a money issue. I don't care if she eats 100 bags of cheese. I just want **my** cheese to be **my** cheese, so I know it hasn't had unwashed hands in it. \n\nSo I installed a deadbolt on my bedroom door, and I keep my room locked whenever I am not home. Now my cheese is safe. My wife still has plenty of cheese to eat. She just no longer has access to **my fucking cheese**. \n\nShe says it shouldn't matter, since we kiss all the time. But I don't want to eat cheese that has someone else's stale saliva on it. No matter how much I love her, food safety is food safety. She is introducing germs into a fertile breeding ground, and I just can't get over that. I need my cheese to be clean. \n\nSo, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for installing a lock on their bedroom door to keep their cheese safe from their wife's habit of using unwashed hands after biting her nails. The author provided a detailed situation.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The wife takes the author's cheese, uses her hands after her mouth, contaminates it, and then even after being given separate labeled bags, she ignores them. The author then gets a mini fridge in their bedroom, but she still takes the cheese from there. So the author locks the bedroom door to prevent access.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks the author isn't, but wants my opinion. Let's break it down. \n\nThe author's main issue is about personal hygiene and food safety. They have a legitimate concern about contamination. The wife's actions are causing the author distress. The author is taking steps to protect their personal property (the cheese) and their health. Locking the bedroom door is a response to repeated issues where the wife isn't respecting the boundaries set (like labeled bags, separate fridge). \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that in a shared living situation, especially in a marriage, there's an expectation of shared access to certain areas and items. However, the author mentions they have separate bedrooms, which complicates that. Also, the wife's actions are specifically causing the problem. The author isn't keeping the cheese hidden; they're creating a space where their preferences for cleanliness are respected. \n\nThe wife's argument about kissing not mattering might be a point where she's trying to downplay the situation, but the author has clear boundaries about food safety. The author isn't being unreasonable about the situation; they're trying to find solutions (buying separate cheese, mini fridge) and finally locking the door when those don't work. \n\nI think the author's actions are reasonable given the circumstances. They're protecting their personal space and health, and the wife isn't respecting their boundaries. So the answer would be B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
