And she's not super on top of keeping her hands washed. \n\nI like to eat handfuls of shredded cheese as a snack. \n\nMy wife will take my bag of cheese out of the fridge and stick her unwashed hand into my cheese, **immediately** after taking her fingers out of her mouth. \n\nThat is fucking disgusting IMO. Now the whole bag of cheese is ruined, and my snack is gone. \n\nSo I started buying her her own bags of cheese. I clearly labeled each bag with either her name or mine.  \n\nFF to the next morning, and she has *my* bag of cheese. Hers is still sitting in the fridge (opened, and contaminated by her unwashed hands). She didn't bother checking the labels. So now she has two bags of cheese, and I have 0. \n\nNext step: I buy a mini fridge and put it in my bedroom. We have seperate bedrooms, so I figured I was solving the problem.   \n\nBut NO. 3 days later, I get home from work and she's **sitting on my bed, eating my bag of cheese**. There was still plenty of cheese in the main fridge. This is not a money issue. I don't care if she eats 100 bags of cheese. I just want **my** cheese to be **my** cheese, so I know it hasn't had unwashed hands in it. \n\nSo I installed a deadbolt on my bedroom door, and I keep my room locked whenever I am not home. Now my cheese is safe. My wife still has plenty of cheese to eat. She just no longer has access to **my fucking cheese**. \n\nShe says it shouldn't matter, since we kiss all the time. But I don't want to eat cheese that has someone else's stale saliva on it. No matter how much I love her, food safety is food safety. She is introducing germs into a fertile breeding ground, and I just can't get over that. I need my cheese to be clean. \n\nSo, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The question is whether the author is at fault for installing a lock on his bedroom door to keep his cheese safe from his wife's actions. First, I need to understand the situation.\n\nThe husband is upset because his wife puts her unwashed hands into his cheese after biting her nails. He's tried labeling bags and even getting a mini fridge in his separate bedroom, but she still ends up eating his cheese. Now he locks his room when he's not there. He argues it's about food safety and his personal preference, not money. She thinks it's overkill since they kiss, implying she doesn't see the issue with sharing germs.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, from a personal space and autonomy perspective, people have the right to control their own environment. If he's in a separate bedroom, which is common in some marriages, he might feel entitled to keep his belongings secure. The problem is she's accessing his private space and taking his food, which he's tried to prevent through various means. The lock is a final measure to protect his personal property.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the issue is trivial, like the cheese being a snack, and that locking the bedroom could create more tension. But the husband's concern is about hygiene and food safety, which are personal and valid. Since it's not a financial issue and he's providing for her as well, his actions are about maintaining his own standards. The wife's behavior could be seen as inconsiderate if she's ignoring his boundaries despite his efforts.\n\nThe key points are personal boundaries, consent, and mutual respect. If he's communicated his needs and she's still not respecting them, then he's justified in taking steps to protect his space. The answer hinges on whether his actions are reasonable given the repeated disrespect of his boundaries. Many people would side with him because he's protecting his personal property and health preferences. So, probably answer B (No, he's not in the wrong).\n"
