And she's not super on top of keeping her hands washed. \n\nI like to eat handfuls of shredded cheese as a snack. \n\nMy wife will take my bag of cheese out of the fridge and stick her unwashed hand into my cheese, **immediately** after taking her fingers out of her mouth. \n\nThat is fucking disgusting IMO. Now the whole bag of cheese is ruined, and my snack is gone. \n\nSo I started buying her her own bags of cheese. I clearly labeled each bag with either her name or mine.  \n\nFF to the next morning, and she has *my* bag of cheese. Hers is still sitting in the fridge (opened, and contaminated by her unwashed hands). She didn't bother checking the labels. So now she has two bags of cheese, and I have 0. \n\nNext step: I buy a mini fridge and put it in my bedroom. We have seperate bedrooms, so I figured I was solving the problem.   \n\nBut NO. 3 days later, I get home from work and she's **sitting on my bed, eating my bag of cheese**. There was still plenty of cheese in the main fridge. This is not a money issue. I don't care if she eats 100 bags of cheese. I just want **my** cheese to be **my** cheese, so I know it hasn't had unwashed hands in it. \n\nSo I installed a deadbolt on my bedroom door, and I keep my room locked whenever I am not home. Now my cheese is safe. My wife still has plenty of cheese to eat. She just no longer has access to **my fucking cheese**. \n\nShe says it shouldn't matter, since we kiss all the time. But I don't want to eat cheese that has someone else's stale saliva on it. No matter how much I love her, food safety is food safety. She is introducing germs into a fertile breeding ground, and I just can't get over that. I need my cheese to be clean. \n\nSo, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for locking their bedroom door to protect their cheese. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The husband is upset because his wife uses his cheese after touching her mouth and not washing her hands. He tried labeling the cheese and even got a mini fridge in their separate bedroom, but she still took his. So he locked the door. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't wrong. I need to evaluate both sides. From the husband's perspective, he's concerned about hygiene and food safety. He clearly communicated by labeling, but she didn't respect that. The wife might feel it's overreacting, especially since they share a home and intimate contact. But the husband has a valid point about germs. \n\nIs locking the door excessive? Well, they have separate bedrooms, so maybe it's reasonable for him to secure his space. Food safety is a personal preference, but if it's causing conflict, maybe there's a middle ground. However, the husband's actions are to protect his own food, which isn't harmful. The wife's actions are the issue here. \n\nThe key points: He's not denying her cheese, just keeping his own safe. The wife's behavior is the root of the problem. The husband's solution, while maybe extreme, is a response to her not respecting his boundaries. So, he's not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
