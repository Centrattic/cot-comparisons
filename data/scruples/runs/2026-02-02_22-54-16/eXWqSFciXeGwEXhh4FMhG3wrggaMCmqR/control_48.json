And she's not super on top of keeping her hands washed. \n\nI like to eat handfuls of shredded cheese as a snack. \n\nMy wife will take my bag of cheese out of the fridge and stick her unwashed hand into my cheese, **immediately** after taking her fingers out of her mouth. \n\nThat is fucking disgusting IMO. Now the whole bag of cheese is ruined, and my snack is gone. \n\nSo I started buying her her own bags of cheese. I clearly labeled each bag with either her name or mine.  \n\nFF to the next morning, and she has *my* bag of cheese. Hers is still sitting in the fridge (opened, and contaminated by her unwashed hands). She didn't bother checking the labels. So now she has two bags of cheese, and I have 0. \n\nNext step: I buy a mini fridge and put it in my bedroom. We have seperate bedrooms, so I figured I was solving the problem.   \n\nBut NO. 3 days later, I get home from work and she's **sitting on my bed, eating my bag of cheese**. There was still plenty of cheese in the main fridge. This is not a money issue. I don't care if she eats 100 bags of cheese. I just want **my** cheese to be **my** cheese, so I know it hasn't had unwashed hands in it. \n\nSo I installed a deadbolt on my bedroom door, and I keep my room locked whenever I am not home. Now my cheese is safe. My wife still has plenty of cheese to eat. She just no longer has access to **my fucking cheese**. \n\nShe says it shouldn't matter, since we kiss all the time. But I don't want to eat cheese that has someone else's stale saliva on it. No matter how much I love her, food safety is food safety. She is introducing germs into a fertile breeding ground, and I just can't get over that. I need my cheese to be clean. \n\nSo, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote this scenario is in the wrong. The author installed a lock on their bedroom door to keep their wife from eating their cheese. The wife takes his cheese even after he's tried to label and separate them, leading him to use a mini fridge in his room, which she still accessed. Now he locks the door.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The main issue here is about personal boundaries and shared living situations. The author has a legitimate concern about hygiene. His wife's habit of putting unwashed hands into his cheese after biting her nails is a hygiene issue he finds unacceptable. He's tried multiple solutions: buying her her own cheese, labeling, using a mini fridge. When those didn't work, he locked his room. \n\nThe wife's perspective might be that they're married, and sharing resources is normal. She might feel that locking the door is unnecessary and creates a barrier. But the author's actions are driven by his health and comfort. The question is whether his response is reasonable.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's about whether his actions cross a line. Installing a lock in a shared home can be seen as creating a separate living space, which might be a privacy issue. However, if the wife is respecting the lock, then it's a mutual agreement. But if she's entering despite the lock, that's an issue. However, the author states he locks the door when he's not there, implying she shouldn't be entering. The wife's actions of entering and taking the cheese without permission are the problem here.\n\nThe author's intention is to protect his personal items due to hygiene reasons. It's reasonable for someone to have such preferences. The wife's reaction might be about not understanding the severity of the hygiene issue. The author isn't preventing her from having cheese; he's just protecting his own. \n\nBut in a marriage, sharing is expected. However, personal boundaries should be respected too. The author's solution might be extreme, but it's his way of managing a situation where previous solutions failed. The key here is whether locking the door is a reasonable step. Since they have separate bedrooms, maybe it's acceptable for him to secure his own space. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong because he's setting a boundary to maintain his hygiene and personal preferences. The wife's actions of taking his cheese without respecting his locks are the issue here. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
