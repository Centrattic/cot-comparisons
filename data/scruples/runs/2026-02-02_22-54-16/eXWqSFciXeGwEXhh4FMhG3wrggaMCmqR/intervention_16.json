And she's not super on top of keeping her hands washed. \n\nI like to eat handfuls of shredded cheese as a snack. \n\nMy wife will take my bag of cheese out of the fridge and stick her unwashed hand into my cheese, **immediately** after taking her fingers out of her mouth. \n\nThat is fucking disgusting IMO. Now the whole bag of cheese is ruined, and my snack is gone. \n\nSo I started buying her her own bags of cheese. I clearly labeled each bag with either her name or mine.  \n\nFF to the next morning, and she has *my* bag of cheese. Hers is still sitting in the fridge (opened, and contaminated by her unwashed hands). She didn't bother checking the labels. So now she has two bags of cheese, and I have 0. \n\nNext step: I buy a mini fridge and put it in my bedroom. We have seperate bedrooms, so I figured I was solving the problem.   \n\nBut NO. 3 days later, I get home from work and she's **sitting on my bed, eating my bag of cheese**. There was still plenty of cheese in the main fridge. This is not a money issue. I don't care if she eats 100 bags of cheese. I just want **my** cheese to be **my** cheese, so I know it hasn't had unwashed hands in it. \n\nSo I installed a deadbolt on my bedroom door, and I keep my room locked whenever I am not home. Now my cheese is safe. My wife still has plenty of cheese to eat. She just no longer has access to **my fucking cheese**. \n\nShe says it shouldn't matter, since we kiss all the time. But I don't want to eat cheese that has someone else's stale saliva on it. No matter how much I love her, food safety is food safety. She is introducing germs into a fertile breeding ground, and I just can't get over that. I need my cheese to be clean. \n\nSo, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for installing a lock on their bedroom door to keep their cheese safe from their wife's hand hygiene habits.\n\nFirst, the author's main issue is their wife putting her unwashed hands into his cheese right after biting her nails. That's a legitimate hygiene concern. He tried labelling the cheese bags, but she still ends up with his. Then he bought a mini fridge, but she still accessed his cheese in his room. So he locks the door to prevent that.\n\nNow, is he in the wrong? Let's consider both sides. The wife's actions are indeed unhygienic from the author's perspective, but does that justify installing a lock? The bedrooms are separate, so he's within his right to secure his own room. The wife's argument that they kiss all the time might be trying to downplay the hygiene concern, but people have different boundaries, especially regarding food. \n\nThe author's solution seems extreme, but given the repeated issues, locking the door might be his way of enforcing personal boundaries. The key points are consent and respect. If the wife isn't respecting his boundaries, he's within his right to take measures to protect his property and personal space. However, the deadbolt might be seen as overkill, but it's his room and his choice. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong. He's trying to maintain hygiene and protect his belongings, which others might see as reasonable. The wife's actions are the initial problem, so the author's response is a way to prevent further issues without causing a bigger conflict.\n"
