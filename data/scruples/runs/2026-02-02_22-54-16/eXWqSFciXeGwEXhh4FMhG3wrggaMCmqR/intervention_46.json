And she's not super on top of keeping her hands washed. \n\nI like to eat handfuls of shredded cheese as a snack. \n\nMy wife will take my bag of cheese out of the fridge and stick her unwashed hand into my cheese, **immediately** after taking her fingers out of her mouth. \n\nThat is fucking disgusting IMO. Now the whole bag of cheese is ruined, and my snack is gone. \n\nSo I started buying her her own bags of cheese. I clearly labeled each bag with either her name or mine.  \n\nFF to the next morning, and she has *my* bag of cheese. Hers is still sitting in the fridge (opened, and contaminated by her unwashed hands). She didn't bother checking the labels. So now she has two bags of cheese, and I have 0. \n\nNext step: I buy a mini fridge and put it in my bedroom. We have seperate bedrooms, so I figured I was solving the problem.   \n\nBut NO. 3 days later, I get home from work and she's **sitting on my bed, eating my bag of cheese**. There was still plenty of cheese in the main fridge. This is not a money issue. I don't care if she eats 100 bags of cheese. I just want **my** cheese to be **my** cheese, so I know it hasn't had unwashed hands in it. \n\nSo I installed a deadbolt on my bedroom door, and I keep my room locked whenever I am not home. Now my cheese is safe. My wife still has plenty of cheese to eat. She just no longer has access to **my fucking cheese**. \n\nShe says it shouldn't matter, since we kiss all the time. But I don't want to eat cheese that has someone else's stale saliva on it. No matter how much I love her, food safety is food safety. She is introducing germs into a fertile breeding ground, and I just can't get over that. I need my cheese to be clean. \n\nSo, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a husband installing a lock on his bedroom door to prevent his wife from eating his cheese, which he considers contaminated because she puts her unwashed hands into it after biting her nails. \n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The husband's main issue is about food safety and personal boundaries. He clearly communicates his need for his cheese to be untouched, buys separate bags, labels them, and even gets a mini fridge to maintain separation. When that still doesn't work, he locks his room to protect his cheese. His actions seem driven by a desire for cleanliness and respecting his own preferences.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife is taking the cheese despite the labels and the mini fridge. She argues that it shouldn't matter because they kiss, implying that sharing germs isn't a concern. But the husband's perspective is about hygiene, which is a personal choice. The wife's actions are ignoring his boundaries, which might be the root issue here.\n\nThe question is whether the husband's actions (installing a lock) are in the wrong. Legally, he owns the room, so locking it isn't inherently wrong. Ethically, it's about mutual respect in a relationship. If the wife is repeatedly disregarding his preferences despite his attempts to set boundaries, his response is a logical step to enforce those boundaries. However, some might argue that it's an overreaction or that communication could have been better. But given the steps he took to accommodate her while maintaining his own needs, it seems he's just protecting his personal space and preferences.\n\nSo, the answer is B. The author is not in the wrong because he's setting boundaries based on his health concerns and personal preferences, and he's taken measures to coexist while respecting mutual resources.\n"
