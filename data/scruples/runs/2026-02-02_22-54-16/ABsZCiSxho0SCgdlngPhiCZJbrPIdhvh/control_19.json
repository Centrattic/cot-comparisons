      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person is in the wrong for having a vegetarian-only wedding meal. Both they and their partner are strict vegetarians. They don't have an issue with others eating meat in general but find the smell or look of it gross. They don't say anything when others eat meat around them, but on their wedding day, they want the reception to be meat-free.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The main question is whether serving only vegetarian meals at their wedding makes them the \"asshole.\" The answer options are A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no, not in the wrong). \n\nI should think about the reasons they're doing this. They're vegetarians, and their wedding is their day to celebrate their union. It's reasonable for them to want the event to reflect their personal choices and values. They mentioned they don't comment on others' eating habits but just want their own day to be free from meat. \n\nNow, considering the guests. Could some guests have dietary restrictions that require meat? Maybe, but the couple isn't serving meat because they themselves are vegetarian. However, they are the hosts, and the wedding is their event. It's customary for the hosts to set the menu based on their preferences, especially if they communicate it in advance. \n\nBut wait, what about guests who might not be vegetarian or who prefer meat? They might have to adjust, but guests usually accommodate the hosts' preferences. The couple isn't forcing guests to eat vegetarian; they're just choosing not to serve meat. If they make it clear beforehand, guests can bring their own food or adjust. However, some people might feel it's inconsiderate, but others might respect the hosts' choice. \n\nAlso, the couple isn't making a moral judgment against others. They just prefer not to have meat around. They don't comment on others' choices in daily life, so doing so at their wedding is a personal choice. \n\nIn terms of societal norms, weddings are personal events where the hosts can set the tone. Many couples choose specific themes or menus based on their preferences. Vegetarian weddings are becoming more common, and vendors can accommodate that. \n\nPotential counterarguments: Some might say guests should have options, but the couple isn't providing meat; they're choosing their own preferences. If they wanted to include meat for some guests, they could offer it, but they've decided against it. \n\nAnother point: The couple is in a committed relationship, so their joint decision to have a vegetarian wedding is a reflection of their shared values. It's a significant day for them, so their comfort should be prioritized. \n\nIn conclusion, the couple isn't being inconsiderate in a malicious way. They're making a personal choice for their special day, and as long as they inform guests in advance, it's reasonable. Therefore, the answer is B (not in the wrong).\n"
