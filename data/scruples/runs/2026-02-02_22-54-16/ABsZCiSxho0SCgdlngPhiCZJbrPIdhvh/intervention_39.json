      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the person who wants to have only vegetarian meals at their wedding is in the wrong. Let me process this step by step.\n\nFirst, the situation: the couple are strict vegetarians. They don't have an issue with others eating meat generally but find the smell or look of it gross. They don't comment on others eating meat, but on their wedding day, they prefer no meat. The question is if they're at fault (AITA) for making the reception all vegetarian.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. Let me consider the factors. Personal dietary choices are common these days. Weddings are personal events where couples can set their own preferences. If the couple is clear about their choice and it's their day, they should have the right to decide. Also, they are respectful of others' choices in general, just avoiding meat on their day. So it's not about forcing others to be vegetarian, but about their own comfort and values on a significant day. \n\nSome might argue that guests have their preferences too, but if the couple is hosting, they can make the menu reflect their lifestyle. Plus, vegetarian options can be appealing to many. Maybe some guests might prefer not to eat meat anyway. The key is that the couple is not being judgmental but making a choice for their day. \n\nI should check if there's any hidden nuance. The couple isn't opposing meat consumption, just not having it at their wedding. They don't impose their views on others, so it's about their own event. In that case, the answer is likely B, they're not in the wrong. The wedding is their time to celebrate their way, and as long as they communicate the menu clearly, it's acceptable.\n"
