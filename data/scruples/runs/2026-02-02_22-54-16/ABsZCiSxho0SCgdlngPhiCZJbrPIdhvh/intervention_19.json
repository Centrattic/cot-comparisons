      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" (AITA) post is in the wrong for having a vegetarian-only wedding. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author and their partner are strict vegetarians. They don't have issues with others eating meat in general but find the smell or look of it gross. They don't comment on others eating meat around them, but on their wedding day, they want to avoid it. The question is whether it's wrong to have a reception with no meat options.\n\nI need to consider cultural norms and personal rights. Weddings are personal events where the couple can set their own preferences. Since they're the hosts, it's their choice to make the event reflect their values and dietary habits. Many people have themed weddings or specific food choices for various reasons. Vegetarian or vegan weddings are becoming more common, so this isn't unusual.\n\nHowever, some might argue that guests with dietary restrictions should be accommodated. But the author isn't saying there are no other options, just that meat isn't offered. If the wedding menu is vegetarian, it's still possible to provide varied dishes that cater to different preferences, like gluten-free or dairy-free for some guests. But the core issue here is the exclusion of meat, not other dietary needs.\n\nAlso, the couple mentions they don't impose their views on others in daily life, just on their special day. That shows respect for others' choices, so their reasoning is personal and not about policing others. \n\nPotential backlash could come from guests who expected meat or are offended by the exclusion. But again, it's the couple's event. They can choose their menu based on their beliefs and comfort. It's about personal autonomy versus guest expectations. \n\nIn many AITA scenarios, the key is whether the person's actions are inconsiderate without justification. Here, the justification is clear: their personal dietary choices and aversion to meat-related stimuli. They aren't forcing anyone to eat a certain way, just serving their preferred food. \n\nSo, considering all these points, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
