      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wants a vegetarian-only wedding is in the wrong. The scenario is that both they and their partner are strict vegetarians and they don't want meat served at their wedding. They don't mind others eating meat otherwise but want their wedding to be meat-free. The question is if they're in the wrong (AITA) for not offering meat options.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the cultural and social norms around weddings. Weddings are personal events where the couple can make choices based on their preferences. Since the couple is vegetarian and has a valid reason (they find the smell or look of meat gross on their day), it's their right to choose the menu. They are not imposing on others' choices unless guests are explicitly excluded from eating meat. The key point is that guests can still choose their own meals, but the wedding itself reflects the hosts' preferences.\n\nAlso, the couple isn't forcing people to eat vegetarian; they're just not serving meat. If guests bring their own food, that's up to them, but the couple isn't responsible for that. There's a difference between not providing something and forcing others to abstain. So, the answer would likely be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
