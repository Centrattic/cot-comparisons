      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong for serving only vegetarian meals at their wedding. Both they and their partner are strict vegetarians and they find the smell or look of meat gross, but they don't mind others eating meat in general. They just want their wedding day to be meat-free.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the perspectives. The author's position is that they have the right to choose their wedding menu based on their personal preferences and dietary restrictions. They are not imposing on others' choices, just creating a space that aligns with their values. Their partner shares the same view, so it's a mutual decision.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that guests have diverse dietary needs and preferences. If all the food is vegetarian, non-vegetarian guests might not have options they like. However, the author mentions they have no issues with others eating meat; they just prefer not to have it present. The key here is that they're not forcing others to eat vegetarian food, just choosing their own event's menu.\n\nWeddings are personal events where the couple can set the tone. It's common to have specific themes or dietary choices. For example, some weddings are vegan, kosher, or halal. The author's choice is similar to those, where the couple's personal beliefs shape the event. Providing vegetarian meals is a valid choice, especially when both partners are committed to it.\n\nAnother point is that the guests can bring their own food or choose not to eat if they don't like the options. However, in practice, most guests would expect the wedding to accommodate a variety of dietary needs. But the author isn't refusing meat options entirely; they\u2019re just not including them. Wait, actually, they are saying there are no meat options. So maybe they should have considered offering vegetarian and some non-vegetarian options. But the scenario states that both the author and their partner are strict vegetarians and want to avoid even the smell or look of meat. They don't want to deal with it on their wedding day. So serving vegetarian-only is their way of creating a comfortable environment for themselves and their partner.\n\nBut some guests might have different dietary needs. For example, someone who can't eat certain vegetables due to allergies or preferences. However, the question is specifically about vegetarian vs. meat. The author isn't making others vegetarian, just choosing a meat-free menu. If they're providing enough vegetarian options, then it's their choice. The key is that they\u2019re not forcing guests to eat vegetarian, but they\u2019re setting the menu according to their preferences. They are the hosts, so it's reasonable for them to prioritize their own comfort and values on their special day.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong. They have the right to make personal choices for their wedding, especially when it aligns with their lifestyle and the choice doesn't harm others.\n"
