      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wants to have a vegetarian-only wedding is at fault. Both the person and their partner are strict vegetarians. They don't mind others eating meat generally but find the smell or appearance of it gross. They don't comment on others eating around them but want their wedding to be meat-free.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Wedings are personal events where the couple's preferences usually take precedence. They're making a choice that aligns with their lifestyle and comfort. Since they're not forcing guests to eat vegetarian, but just not offering meat options, the issue is whether this is reasonable.\n\nThe couple is respectful of others' choices in general, as they don't comment when people eat meat around them. Their wedding is their day, so they should have the right to set the menu according to their preferences. However, some guests might have dietary restrictions or strong preferences. The couple should probably offer vegetarian options, but since they're already serving vegetarian meals, maybe they can also offer other vegetarian dishes that cater to different tastes. Wait, the question is about whether they are in the wrong for having no meat options. But they are vegetarians, so their own preferences are valid. The problem would be if they were imposing meat on others, but since they're not serving it, it's about their choice. So the answer would be B (No). They are not in the wrong.\n"
