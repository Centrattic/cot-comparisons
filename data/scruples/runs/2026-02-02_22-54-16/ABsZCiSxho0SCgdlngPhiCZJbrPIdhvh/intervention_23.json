      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for having a vegetarian-only wedding. Let me read through the scenario again to make sure I understand it correctly.\n\nThe couple is both strict vegetarians. They don't have an issue with others eating meat in general, but they find the smell or look of it gross. They don't say anything when others eat meat around them, but on their wedding day, they want to avoid that. The question is whether it's wrong for the reception to have no meat options.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The couple is making a personal choice based on their dietary preferences and comfort. They are not imposing on others; they're just choosing their own event's menu. Vegetarianism is a personal choice for many reasons\u2014ethical, health, environmental, or personal taste. In this case, they mention they don't mind others eating meat but just prefer not to be around it on their big day. That seems like a valid reason.\n\nNow, thinking about potential counterarguments. Some might say that guests might expect a variety of options, including meat. But the couple is clear that they're vegetarians, so it's their event. It's their right to choose the menu that aligns with their values and comfort. They're not forcing guests to eat vegetarian; they're just not serving meat. If some guests have dietary restrictions that require meat, maybe the couple should have considered that. However, the question doesn't mention any guests with such needs, and the couple is strict vegetarians, so perhaps they didn't anticipate that issue. Still, the main point is about the couple's right to their own preferences.\n\nAlso, the couple states they don't comment on others eating meat, which shows they're not judgmental. They're just applying their own preferences to their event. Weddings are personal, and couples often have specific themes or dietary choices. So hosting a vegetarian-only wedding doesn't seem unreasonable. \n\nIn terms of AITA, the person is likely not in the wrong. The answer should be B. They are making a choice that affects their own event, not imposing on others beyond what they can control. Unless there's a cultural expectation of meat at weddings that might be relevant, but the question doesn't mention that. So, the answer is B.\n"
