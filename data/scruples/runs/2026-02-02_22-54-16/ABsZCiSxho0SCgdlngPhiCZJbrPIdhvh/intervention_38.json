      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for having a vegetarian-only wedding reception. The couple are strict vegetarians and find the smell or look of meat gross, so they don't want meat served. They don't mind other people eating meat in general but just on their wedding day, they want it meat-free.\n\nHmm, first, I need to consider their reasons. They are being true to their personal beliefs and dietary preferences. It's their wedding, after all, so they have the right to make choices that reflect their lifestyle. Also, they mentioned they don't comment on others eating meat normally, so it's not about being judgmental. They just want their day to be comfortable for them and their partner.\n\nBut wait, maybe some guests might have dietary restrictions that require meat. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since they are the ones hosting, they can set the menu as they see fit. It's common for hosts to accommodate their own preferences. Plus, if any guests need meat, they might bring their own or choose not to attend, but that's up to the guests. The author isn't forcing anyone to eat vegetarian; they're just not serving meat. \n\nAnother angle: Weddings are personal events. The hosts get to decide the theme and menu. Many couples have specific dietary preferences and communicate that to their guests. It's respectful to their beliefs. There's no obligation to provide meat unless there's a cultural norm, but even then, they can choose to deviate if they're comfortable. \n\nSo putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. They're making a personal choice for their special day, which is their right. The answer should be B.\n"
