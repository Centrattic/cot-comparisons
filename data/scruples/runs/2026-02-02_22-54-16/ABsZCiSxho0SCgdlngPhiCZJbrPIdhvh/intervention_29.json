      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for having a vegetarian wedding. Let me start by understanding the situation. The author and their partner are strict vegetarians. They don't have a problem with others eating meat but find the smell or look of it gross. They're planning a wedding and want only vegetarian meals served, and they're asking if they're the asshole (AITA) for doing so.\n\nFirst, I should consider their reasons. They're not forcing others to be vegetarian, just choosing their own preferences for their special day. Weddings are personal events where couples can set their own rules. It's common for people to have specific dietary choices, like vegan, gluten-free, or in this case, vegetarian. The key here is that the author is providing their own preferences and not making others eat that way. \n\nThen, thinking about the guests. Some guests might have different dietary needs or preferences. But the author isn't saying they can't have other options; they're just not providing meat. Wait, actually, the question says the reception has no meat options. So if the guests want meat, they can't get it. But the author is a vegetarian, so serving vegetarian meals makes sense for the couple's comfort. \n\nI should also consider cultural or social norms. In many places, it's acceptable to have vegetarian menus, especially when the couple has personal reasons. People often choose all-vegetarian menus for ethical, health, or personal reasons. The fact that they're both strict vegetarians adds to the legitimacy of their choice. \n\nAre there any potential issues? Some guests might not like it, but the couple isn't forcing anyone to eat the food. If guests have dietary restrictions, they can bring their own food or choose not to attend, though that's a stretch. The main point is the author's right to have their own preferences on their wedding day. \n\nComparing to other scenarios: If someone has a vegan wedding, people might comment, but ultimately, it's their choice. Similarly, a kosher or halal wedding has dietary restrictions. The same applies here. The author is making a personal choice that affects their own event, not imposing on others beyond the guests' attendance. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is not in the wrong. They're making a choice that aligns with their values and comfort, and it's their right to do so on their wedding day. The answer should be B (No).\n"
