      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wants a vegetarian-only wedding is in the wrong. The scenario is that both they and their partner are strict vegetarians. They don't have a problem with others eating meat in general but find the smell or look of it gross. They don't comment on others eating around them, but on their wedding day, they want no meat options. The question is whether they are at fault (AITA) for that.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Weddings are personal events where the couple can make choices based on their preferences. Since both partners are vegetarians, it's their right to choose the type of food served at their reception. They're not forcing guests to eat vegetarian, just not providing meat. The key point here is that they're not commenting on others' choices but just avoiding meat on their special day. \n\nI should think about common practices. Many weddings have specific dietary options, like vegetarian or gluten-free. It's standard to accommodate different preferences. However, not offering meat could be an issue if guests expect it, but the couple is making a conscious choice based on their lifestyle. \n\nPotential counterarguments: Some might say guests might not have suitable options, especially non-vegetarians. But the couple isn't preventing guests from eating meat elsewhere; they're just not serving it. Also, they're not judging others' choices, just their own event. \n\nAnother angle: Are they causing inconvenience? Maybe some guests prefer meat and might find it lacking, but it's a one-day event. The couple's comfort and personal choice on their wedding day should take precedence. \n\nIn terms of etiquette, the couple has every right to set the menu according to their preferences. They aren't imposing their views but simply not serving something they don't want to deal with. There's no evidence they're being exclusive, just making their own choice. \n\nSo, considering all this, the answer is likely B (No, they aren't in the wrong). The couple is within their rights to have a vegetarian menu, respecting their own preferences without imposing on others.\n"
