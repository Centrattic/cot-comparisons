      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the person who wants a vegetarian-only wedding is in the wrong. Both they and their partner are strict vegetarians. They don't have issues with others eating meat but find the smell or look of it gross. They don't want to say anything to guests but prefer their wedding to be meat-free. So, AITA (Am I the Asshole) for the reception having no meat options?\n\nFirst, I need to consider the arguments for both sides. On one hand, the wedding is a personal event where the couple can set their own preferences. If they're vegetarian and uncomfortable with meat, it's their right to choose the menu. Guests might bring non-vegetarian dishes, but the couple can request a vegetarian-only menu. However, some might argue that not offering meat could inconvenience non-vegetarian guests, especially if they have dietary preferences or allergies beyond just meat.\n\nBut wait, the couple is strict vegetarians and have no problem with others eating meat. They just don't want it on their wedding day. So their reasoning is about their comfort, not pushing their beliefs on others. The key point is that they're not judging others but avoiding meat themselves. \n\nIn terms of etiquette, hosting a vegetarian-only wedding isn't inherently wrong. Many couples choose dietary restrictions based on their preferences, religion, or health. Guests are usually expected to follow the host's menu, unless there are specific dietary needs. If the couple communicates their menu choice clearly and provides adequate vegetarian options, it's reasonable. However, if the menu is so restrictive that it's unsafe for guests (like no meat for someone who needs protein for health reasons), that's a different issue. But the scenario doesn't mention that.\n\nAnother angle: some people might feel it's a private event, so the couple's choice is their business. Others might think it's a small inconvenience for guests, but not the end of the world. The couple isn't forcing anyone to eat vegetarian; they're simply not serving meat. If guests are unhappy, they could bring their own food, but that's not common. Typically, the hosts decide the menu.\n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the couple's choice is reasonable and respectful. Since they're not imposing their beliefs but making a personal choice for their day, and they're providing vegetarian meals (assuming they do), they're not in the wrong. The potential issue is if they don't offer enough variety, but the question doesn't say that. Therefore, the answer is B (No, they're not in the wrong).\n"
