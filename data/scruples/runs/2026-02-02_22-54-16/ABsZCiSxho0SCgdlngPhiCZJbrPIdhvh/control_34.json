      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person is in the wrong for having a vegetarian-only wedding. The scenario is that both the person and their partner are strict vegetarians. They don't have an issue with others eating meat generally but find the smell or look of it gross. They don't comment on others eating meat around them but want their wedding day to be meat-free.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the main points. The couple's personal choice to be vegetarian is their right. They're not imposing on others; they're just making their own event reflect their values. The key here is that they're not forcing guests to eat vegetarian, but they're choosing the menu based on their own preferences. \n\nHowever, some might argue that guests who aren't vegetarian might not have options. But the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The scenario doesn't mention that they're not providing alternatives. Wait, actually, they are serving vegetarian meals, which should be the main course. If they're only serving vegetarian, they might need to ensure that there's enough variety for non-vegetarians, but the question doesn't specify that they're not offering other options. Wait, the user says \"no meat options,\" so the reception has only vegetarian food. So guests who want meat wouldn't have that option.\n\nBut the couple's reasoning is that they don't want to deal with the smell or look of meat on their day. They don't have a problem with others eating meat in general, just on their wedding day. So the question is, is that reasonable? It's their event, so they have the right to set the menu according to their preferences. Unless they communicated poorly, maybe guests expect some meat options. But if they made it clear when sending out save-the-dates or the invitations that the menu is vegetarian, then guests can adjust accordingly. If they didn't communicate that and guests show up expecting meat, maybe there's an issue. But the scenario doesn't mention communication issues.\n\nAlso, in some cultures, weddings have traditional menus that might include meat, so deviating from that could be seen as unusual. But the couple's dietary preferences are their choice. The key is that they're not forcing others to eat vegetarian, just choosing their own event's menu. It's their right to do so unless they caused harm or exclusion without notice. The answer would likely be B (No, not in the wrong) because it's their event and they can make choices based on their lifestyle. However, some might argue that they should consider guests' preferences. But since they're not making others eat vegetarian, just not serving meat, it's their choice.\n"
