      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the person who wants a vegetarian-only wedding is in the wrong. Both they and their partner are strict vegetarians. They don't mind others eating meat in general but find the smell or look of it gross. They don't want to comment on others' choices but want their wedding day to be free of meat.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Weddings are personal events where the couple can set their preferences. They're making a choice that aligns with their values and comfort. They're not forcing anyone else to eat vegetarian; they're just choosing the menu for their own event. The key point here is that it's their day, and they have the right to make decisions about their own wedding.\n\nSome might argue that guests with dietary restrictions could be left out, but the couple can offer alternative options or communicate in advance. The question is about being \"in the wrong,\" which usually relates to violating social norms or being unfair. Since they're not imposing their choice on others beyond their own event, it's within their rights. They're also respectful by not commenting on others' habits outside their wedding. So, the answer should be B, No.\n"
