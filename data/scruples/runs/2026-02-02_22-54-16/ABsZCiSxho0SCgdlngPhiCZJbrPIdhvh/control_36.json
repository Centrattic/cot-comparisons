      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wants a vegetarian-only wedding is in the wrong. Both they and their partner are strict vegetarians. They don't have a problem with others eating meat but find the smell or look of it gross. They don't want to comment on others eating, but on their wedding day, they don't want meat served.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the cultural norms around weddings. Weddings are personal events, and couples usually have the right to decide the menu. Vegetarianism is a personal choice, and many people have dietary restrictions or preferences. The key here is that the couple isn't forcing others to be vegetarian. They're just not serving meat at their own event. \n\nHowever, some guests might have dietary needs or preferences that require meat. If the wedding doesn't offer meat options, those guests might be left without something they can eat. But the couple is offering vegetarian meals, which should be sufficient. It's about accommodating their own preferences while ensuring the meal meets guests' needs. \n\nThe couple isn't making a judgment about others eating meat; they just don't want it at their wedding. It's their event, so they have the right to set the menu. But maybe they should check if any guests have specific dietary requirements and make exceptions if necessary. However, the original question doesn't mention that. The couple is just asking if they're in the wrong for not serving meat. \n\nIn most cases, people choose their wedding menu based on their preferences. Unless there's a cultural expectation in their community that requires meat, which isn't mentioned here, the couple isn't in the wrong. They're making a personal choice that aligns with their values. So the answer would be B, they are not in the wrong.\n"
