      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wants to have a vegetarian-only wedding is in the wrong. The situation is that both the person and their partner are strict vegetarians. They don't have issues with others eating meat in general but find the smell or look of it gross. They don't comment on others eating around them, but on their wedding day, they want the reception to have no meat options. The question is whether they're at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the principles here. Personal choice and hosting a wedding. Weddings are personal events, and the hosts usually make decisions about the food. The couple is choosing their own preferences for their day. They are not forcing others to eat vegetarian, but they're setting the menu. But some guests might have different dietary needs, like religious reasons, medical conditions, or preferences. However, the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nThe key points are that the couple is strict vegetarians, they don't impose on others normally, but for their wedding, they want the menu to reflect their preferences. They aren't offering meat options. So, is that unreasonable? Well, the wedding is their event, so they can choose the menu. But some might argue that guests should have options. However, the couple isn't saying guests can't have meat elsewhere, just that the event is vegetarian. If they provided vegetarian meals, that's their choice. \n\nBut wait, do they have to provide meat options? If they are having a vegetarian-only reception, are they responsible for ensuring that guests who want meat can still eat? Maybe not, because they can bring their own food, but that's not practical. Alternatively, maybe they should offer a meat option. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong for not having meat. \n\nAnother angle: the couple is making a personal choice for their wedding day. They are not forcing guests to eat vegetarian, but the menu is set. If guests have dietary restrictions, they can bring their own, but again, that's not ideal. However, the couple is not obligating guests to eat that way. So, is it their responsibility to accommodate all dietary needs? Possibly, but maybe they can choose their own preferences. \n\nI think the answer is B, No. The author is not in the wrong. They have the right to host their wedding as they wish. However, maybe they should have communicated better with guests beforehand. But the question is about being in the wrong. Since they are the hosts, and the wedding is their event, they can choose the menu. Unless there's a cultural expectation where meat is traditional, but the scenario doesn't mention that. So, the answer is B.\n"
