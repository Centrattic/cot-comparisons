      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA question is in the wrong. The scenario is that they want to serve only vegetarian meals at their wedding because both they and their partner are strict vegetarians and find meat's smell or look gross. They don't mind others eating meat but want their wedding day to avoid it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The couple is making a personal choice based on their own preferences and dietary needs. Weddings are personal events where the couple can set the tone and rules. They're not forcing others to become vegetarian, just not serving meat. Guests can bring their own food if they really need to, but that's a stretch. The question is whether it's acceptable to have a vegetarian-only menu when both partners are vegetarian.\n\nFrom a societal perspective, people often make personal choices for their events. For example, some weddings are vegan, others might have specific cultural foods. It's their event, so they should be able to set the menu based on their preferences. The author isn't imposing their beliefs on others but just avoiding something they find unpleasant. The answer is likely B, not in the wrong. But I should check if there's any hidden nuance. The couple is strict vegetarians, so it's a genuine preference, not a phase. Also, they don't comment on others eating meat, just don't want it at their event. So no, they aren't in the wrong.\n"
