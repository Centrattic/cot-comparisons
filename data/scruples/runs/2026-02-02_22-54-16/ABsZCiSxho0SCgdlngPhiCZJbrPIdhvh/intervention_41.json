      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong for serving only vegetarian meals at their wedding. Both the author and their partner are strict vegetarians, and they find the smell or look of meat gross. They don't mind others eating meat in general but want their wedding to be meat-free. The user says they think the author isn't in the wrong and asks for my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The couple's dietary preferences are strict vegetarianism, which they've maintained, and they're not imposing their views on others in general. The wedding is their event, and they have the right to make decisions about their own celebration. Serving vegetarian meals exclusively could be seen as respecting their own values and comfort on an important day. However, some guests might have dietary needs or preferences for meat, so maybe they should have considered that. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nI think the main factors here are autonomy and respect. The couple has the right to choose the menu for their wedding. While it's considerate to offer alternatives, if they're not forcing guests to eat vegetarian, it's their choice. The fact that they don't confront others about their meat-eating but want their own space is a reasonable stance. So the answer would likely be B, No, the author isn't in the wrong. But I should also check if there's any cultural or social expectations I'm missing. In some cultures, weddings might traditionally include meat, but that's changing. The key is that the couple's choice is their own, and they're not harming others by not serving meat. They might want to communicate this decision to guests in advance to avoid any confusion, but the choice itself isn't wrong.\n"
