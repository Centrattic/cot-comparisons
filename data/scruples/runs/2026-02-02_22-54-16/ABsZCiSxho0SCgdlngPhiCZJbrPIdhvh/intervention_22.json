      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wants a vegetarian-only wedding is in the wrong. The scenario is that both the person and their partner are strict vegetarians, and they find the smell or look of meat unpleasant. They don't want to eat meat around others, but they don't say anything about others eating meat. Now, they want their wedding reception to have no meat options.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the social norms and expectations around weddings. Weddings are personal events, and usually, the couple can make choices based on their preferences. However, there might be guests who are not vegetarian and might expect some meat options. The question is whether it's fair to cater only to the couple's preferences without considering the guests' dietary needs.\n\nBut the couple is clear that they are strict vegetarians, and they have a valid reason for their preference. However, the issue is serving only vegetarian meals, which could exclude non-vegetarian guests. But do they have an obligation to provide non-vegetarian options? It depends on cultural expectations and the couple's responsibility to their guests. In some cultures, the expectation might be to have a variety, but in others, the couple's preferences might take precedence.\n\nThe person is asking if they are in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). The user's own opinion is that the author is not in the wrong. I need to evaluate if there's a valid argument for either side.\n\nOn one hand, the couple's right to choose their wedding menu based on their dietary preferences and comfort is a personal choice. They are not forcing others to eat vegetarian, but they are choosing their own event's menu. On the other hand, some guests might feel excluded or inconvenienced if they can't eat meat. However, the couple could offer to have separate meat options if they can afford it, but if they are strict vegetarians, they might not want that. But the question is whether it's wrong to have only vegetarian meals.\n\nIn many cases, people do cater to various dietary restrictions, but that's not always the case. If the couple can't or don't want to provide non-vegetarian options, it's their choice. The key is whether they are being inconsiderate. The scenario says they don't comment on others eating meat, so they aren't imposing their views, just choosing their own event's setup. So maybe they are not in the wrong. The answer might be B.\n"
