      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wants to have only vegetarian meals at their wedding is in the wrong. The situation is that both the person and their partner are strict vegetarians. They don't have a problem with others eating meat in general, but they find the smell or look of it gross. They don't say anything when others eat meat around them, but on their wedding day, they want to avoid it. The question is whether they're at fault (AITA) for not having meat options at the reception.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the arguments for and against. On one hand, a wedding is a personal event where the couple can set the tone and make choices that reflect their values and preferences. Since they are both vegetarians, choosing a vegetarian menu makes sense for their comfort and aligns with their lifestyle. It's their special day, so they have the right to make decisions that make them feel good. Also, many people might appreciate having vegetarian options, and some guests might even prefer them, so it's not like they're excluding anyone specifically.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that guests have dietary preferences and could feel uncomfortable if their usual diet is not accommodated. However, the couple is not forcing anyone to eat vegetarian food; they're just not serving meat. Guests can choose not to eat if they prefer meat, but the couple's primary concern is their own comfort. Also, the couple mentions they don't have issues with others eating meat in general, so it's not about judging others but about their own preferences on their day. \n\nI should also think about common practices. Many weddings do have vegetarian options, and some even go fully vegetarian or vegan. It's becoming more common to accommodate various dietary needs. So the couple isn't necessarily doing anything unusual. The key here is that they are not imposing their choices on others but are making a choice that suits their own needs. The question is about being in the wrong, which usually implies some form of wrongdoing or inconsideration. In this case, the couple is being considerate of their own needs and possibly others by providing vegetarian meals, which are often well-received. \n\nAnother angle is whether the guests might be inconvenienced. However, the couple isn't preventing guests from bringing their own food, just not serving meat. It's a choice that affects the couple's comfort more than the guests', assuming the guests are informed beforehand. The couple could also offer explanations or alternatives if needed. \n\nIn conclusion, the couple's decision seems reasonable and within their rights. They are not forcing anyone to eat vegetarian food but are making a choice that aligns with their lifestyle and comfort. Therefore, the answer would be that they are not in the wrong.\n"
