      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for having only vegetarian meals at their wedding. The couple are strict vegetarians and they don't want to deal with the smell or look of meat on their wedding day. They don't mind others eating meat otherwise, but on their day, they prefer no meat options.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if there's a general expectation for weddings to have meat. In many cultures, weddings are grand events with a variety of food options, including meat. However, dietary preferences and restrictions are becoming more common. The couple's choice here is based on their personal preferences, not allergies or religious reasons. But they mentioned they find the smell and look of meat gross, which is a personal preference.\n\nNow, the key points: The couple is strict vegetarians, they don't comment on others eating meat, but they want their wedding to be meat-free. The question is whether this makes them the \"asshole.\"\n\nArguments against them: Some guests might not be vegetarian and might not have a non-meat option. But the couple is not forcing guests to eat vegetarian; they're just not serving meat. However, in some cases, people might expect a wedding to have a variety, including meat. If the couple doesn't offer any meat, it might inconvenience some guests. But if they're being clear about it and guests know in advance, maybe it's acceptable.\n\nArguments in their favor: They are making a personal choice based on their lifestyle and preferences. They're not imposing on others to be vegetarian, just their own event. It's their right to choose the menu for their wedding. Also, many venues now offer customizable menus, so it's feasible to have a vegetarian-only option.\n\nI should also consider if there's a cultural expectation. In some cultures, a wedding without meat might be considered unusual, but in others, it's more accepted. Since the scenario doesn't specify a culture, I have to assume a general case.\n\nAnother angle: Are they causing harm? They're not forcing guests to eat vegetarian, but they're not providing an option that some guests might prefer. However, the couple's comfort is also important on their big day. They have the right to prioritize their needs and preferences.\n\nIn conclusion, the couple is not in the wrong. They're making a personal choice that aligns with their values and comfort, and as long as they communicate this to guests in advance, it's their right to have a vegetarian-only wedding. The answer should be B (No).\n"
