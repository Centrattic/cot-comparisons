      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA question is in the wrong for having a vegetarian-only wedding. The couple are strict vegetarians, they don't have issues with others eating meat but find the smell or look of it gross. They don't want to have to deal with it on their wedding day, so they're serving only vegetarian meals.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if this is a reasonable decision. Weddings are personal events, and the hosts have the right to set the menu based on their preferences. The couple isn't forcing others to eat vegetarian; they're just choosing their own meal. They also mention they don't comment on others eating meat, so they're not being judgmental. The question is about serving only vegetarian, not about how they treat guests' choices.\n\nPossible counterarguments: Some guests might expect meat options, especially if they're not vegetarians. But the hosts are transparent about their choice. Guests can bring their own food if they really want meat, but that's a stretch. Also, providing a vegetarian menu can be inclusive for other vegetarians attending. It's a special day, and personal preferences are valid. \n\nSo, the answer is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. The hosts have the right to their choice, and the reasoning is respectful and personal without imposing on others.\n"
