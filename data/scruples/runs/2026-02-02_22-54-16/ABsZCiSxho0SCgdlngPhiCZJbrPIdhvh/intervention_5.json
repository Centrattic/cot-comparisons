      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for having a vegetarian-only wedding meal. Both the author and their partner are strict vegetarians. They don't have issues with others eating meat, but they find the smell or look of it gross. They don't comment on others eating meat, but on their wedding day, they want to avoid it. The question is whether the author is at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider personal choice and autonomy. The wedding is their event, so they have the right to set the menu as they wish. They\u2019re not forcing guests to eat vegetarian, but they\u2019re choosing what's served. Some guests might not like it, but the author isn't in a position to accommodate every guest's preferences unless they opt for a mixed menu. However, the author is choosing based on their own preferences, which is reasonable.\n\nAlso, the key point is that they\u2019re not imposing their views on others outside their own event. They don't comment on others' eating habits, which shows respect for others' choices. Their wedding is a personal celebration, and they have the right to make decisions that align with their values and comfort. \n\nPossible counterarguments might be that guests might have different dietary needs or preferences. But the author isn't refusing to accommodate them; they're just not serving meat. If guests need a non-vegetarian option, they can bring their own, but the author isn't obligated to provide both. It's their choice. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be B (No, the author isn't in the wrong).\n"
