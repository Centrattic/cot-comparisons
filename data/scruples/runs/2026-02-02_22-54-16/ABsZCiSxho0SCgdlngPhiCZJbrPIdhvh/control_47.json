      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for serving only vegetarian meals at their wedding. Both the author and their partner are strict vegetarians, and they find the smell or look of meat gross. They don't want to comment on others' choices but want their wedding day to be meat-free. The question is whether that makes them the \"asshole.\"\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Weddings are personal events where the couple can make choices based on their preferences. Since they're strict vegetarians, it's their right to have a vegetarian menu. The key point is that they're not imposing on others' dietary choices but setting their own event's menu. \n\nHowever, I should think about potential guests who might have different dietary needs or restrictions. Do they have to offer meat? Well, if guests can't eat vegetarian, that's a problem. But the scenario says the author is offering vegetarian meals, not excluding meat but just not serving it. Wait, actually, the reception has no meat options, so it's entirely vegetarian. So if guests need meat, they can't eat. But the author isn't forcing guests to eat vegetarian; they're just not providing meat. \n\nBut in many places, it's common to have vegetarian options, but not exclusively vegetarian unless specified. The couple has the right to choose their own menu. However, maybe some guests might have dietary restrictions that require meat. But the author's reasoning is about their own comfort, not the guests'. The problem arises if guests can't eat the provided food. But the question is about the author's position. \n\nThe AITA usually considers intent and impact. The couple's intent is to have a menu that aligns with their values and comfort. The impact is on guests who might prefer meat. But unless the guests have dietary restrictions (like allergies, religious reasons), it's a personal choice. However, some might argue that guests shouldn't have to eat vegetarian if they don't want to, but the author isn't forcing anyone to eat; they're just offering the menu they prefer.\n\nWait, but if the reception only has vegetarian food, then guests who can't eat vegetarian can't eat, which is a problem. The author might need to provide alternative options. However, the scenario says they have no meat options. So maybe the error is not providing alternatives. But the user's situation says they don't want to deal with the smell or look of meat. They might have considered this and provided other options. But the post doesn't mention that. If the menu is entirely vegetarian without alternatives, then guests who need meat can't eat, which could be a problem. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the author is aware that some guests can't eat vegetarian, then maybe they are in the wrong. However, the post doesn't mention that they are ignoring dietary needs, only their own preferences. \n\nThe AITA subreddit often balances personal choice against potential impact on others. Here, the couple's right to set their menu against guests' needs. If they didn't consider guests' dietary needs, they might be in the wrong. But the post doesn't say they ignored that. They might have planned for it. The answer could hinge on that. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since they are strict vegetarians and the wedding is their event, many would say they have the right. But if guests can't eat, that's a problem. The post doesn't mention that the author is aware of guests needing meat. So, based on the given info, the answer might be B (the author is not in the wrong) because they are making a personal choice for their event, but if they didn't provide alternatives, maybe they are. But the scenario doesn't mention that. \n\nIn many cases, people have all-vegetarian weddings without issues, as long as they communicate it. So the answer is likely B.\n"
