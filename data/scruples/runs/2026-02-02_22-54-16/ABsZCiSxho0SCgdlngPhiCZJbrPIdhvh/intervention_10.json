      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for having a vegetarian-only wedding reception. The couple are strict vegetarians and they find the smell or look of meat gross, even though they don't comment on others eating it. They want their wedding to be free of meat.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Weddings are personal events where couples can make choices that reflect their values and preferences. Since both partners are strict vegetarians, it's their right to have a reception that aligns with their dietary choices. They also mention they don't judge others for eating meat, which is respectful. The question is whether it's wrong to not offer meat options at their own wedding.\n\nI should think about the guests. Some guests might prefer meat, but the wedding is primarily about the couple. It's reasonable to assume that guests would respect the couple's wishes, especially if they're informed beforehand. However, there might be some guests who have dietary restrictions that require meat, but the couple could offer alternative options. The key point is that the wedding is their special day, and they should have the autonomy to make such decisions.\n\nAnother angle is cultural or religious considerations. If the couple's cultural background typically includes meat in such events, there might be pushback, but the scenario doesn't mention that. They are making a personal choice based on their lifestyle, not imposing on others. They are not forcing guests to eat vegetarian, just not serving meat. So guests can choose to eat or not, but the focus is on the couple's comfort.\n\nI think the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong. They have the right to make this choice for their own event, especially since they're not restricting others' choices elsewhere. The main thing is that they communicate clearly with guests and provide adequate vegetarian options. There's no indication they're being exclusive beyond their own preferences. So the couple isn't being inconsiderate; they're just honoring their own values on their special day.\n"
