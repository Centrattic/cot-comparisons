      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the person who wants to have a vegetarian-only wedding is in the wrong. The scenario is that both the person and their partner are strict vegetarians. They don't have an issue with others eating meat in general, but they find the smell or look of it gross. They don't comment on others eating meat, but they want their wedding reception to be vegetarian-only. The question is whether they're in the wrong for not providing meat options.\n\nFirst, I need to consider personal rights and choices. People have the right to make decisions about their own events, especially their weddings. Since it's their special day, they can set the menu according to their preferences. But then, there's the consideration of guests. Is it possible that some guests might prefer or require meat? However, the user mentions that they're strict vegetarians and they're the ones hosting. They also clarify they don't mind others eating meat, just in their own event they want to avoid it.\n\nNext, think about common practices. Many people have themed weddings or specific dietary preferences, like vegan, gluten-free, or all-vegetarian. It's becoming more common and accepted. So hosting a vegetarian-only wedding isn't unheard of. The hosts aren't forcing anyone to eat vegetarian; they're just choosing their own menu. Guests can choose to eat what's provided or bring their own, though in a wedding setting, guests usually go with the provided food.\n\nAlso, the hosts aren't making a judgment about others' dietary choices in general. They're just personal preferences for their event. So there's no direct imposition on others unless guests have specific dietary needs that aren't met. However, the user didn't mention that guests are given alternative options, but maybe in the context of a wedding, the hosts can decide their menu regardless. It's their celebration.\n\nAnother angle: maybe some guests might feel excluded, but the hosts aren't excluding them from the event. They're just not serving meat. It's about their comfort on the day. Since they find the smell or look of meat gross, it's a valid reason for them. They aren't being offensive, just accommodating their own preferences.\n\nIn conclusion, the hosts are within their rights to choose a vegetarian menu. The answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. They're making a personal choice for their event without forcing others to adopt their diet.\n"
