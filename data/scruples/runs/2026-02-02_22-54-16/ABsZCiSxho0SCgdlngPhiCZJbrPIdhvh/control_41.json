      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wants a vegetarian-only wedding is in the wrong. Both the person and their partner are strict vegetarians. They don't have a problem with others eating meat in general, but they find the smell or look of it gross. They don't comment on others eating meat around them, but they want their wedding reception to have no meat options.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if this is a reasonable request. Weddings are personal events, and people often have specific preferences for their big day. If the couple is vegetarian and wants their own wedding to reflect their dietary choices, that makes sense. They're not imposing on others; they're just setting up their own event as they see fit. \n\nBut wait, what about guests who might want meat? The question is whether the author is in the wrong for not offering meat. In many cases, weddings do offer a variety of options, but it's entirely possible to have a vegetarian-only menu. If the couple is clear about their choice in the invitations, guests would know beforehand. If they don't inform guests, maybe some might be inconvenienced, but that's on the couple to handle the communication.\n\nAnother angle: the couple isn't forcing guests to eat vegetarian; they're just not serving meat. If someone has dietary restrictions that require meat, they could bring their own food or choose not to attend. However, that's a stretch because most people can adapt. Plus, vegetarian menus can be just as satisfying. The key here is that the wedding is their celebration, so they have the right to make personal choices about the food.\n\nI've seen similar situations where people have all-vegetarian or even vegan weddings. It's their day to honor their values and preferences. Unless there's a cultural expectation that meat must be served, which varies by region, the couple isn't necessarily wrong. \n\nSo, considering all this, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). They have the right to host a vegetarian-only wedding to align with their lifestyle and preferences, as long as they've communicated this to their guests appropriately.\n"
