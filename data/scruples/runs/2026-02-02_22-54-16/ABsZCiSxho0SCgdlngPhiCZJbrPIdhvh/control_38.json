      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who wants a vegetarian-only wedding is in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: the couple are strict vegetarians. They don't have an issue with others eating meat, but they find the smell or look of it gross. They don't comment on others eating meat, but for their wedding, they want the reception to be vegetarian-only. The question is whether they're in the wrong (AITA) for doing that.\n\nI need to consider a few angles. Personal choice vs. accommodating guests. Weddings are personal events, so the hosts have the right to set their own preferences. However, some guests might have dietary restrictions or preferences that aren't vegetarian. Wait, but the couple mentioned they're strict vegetarians and are okay with others eating meat. So maybe they're not forcing guests to be vegetarian, just not serving meat. But some guests might want meat options. However, the couple's reasoning is about their own comfort on their special day.\n\nIn many cases, people choose vegetarian menus for their weddings for ethical, health, or personal reasons. It's their event, so they can decide the menu. However, it's also common to offer a variety, including vegetarian and non-vegetarian options, to accommodate all guests. But the couple says they don't have a problem with others eating meat, just that they don't want to deal with it on their day. So maybe they're not being exclusive, just choosing their own preference.\n\nI need to check if there's a cultural or social expectation here. In some cultures, weddings have traditional menus that include meat, but that's changing. Also, considering that they're not forcing others to be vegetarian, but just not serving meat. If they're willing to provide vegetarian options that are appealing, maybe guests can adjust. However, if some guests have dietary needs that require meat (e.g., medical reasons), that's different. But the couple didn't mention that. They just find the smell/look gross, so it's a personal preference.\n\nSo, in most cases, the hosts have the right to choose their wedding menu based on their beliefs and comfort. Unless there's a specific reason guests need meat, it's their event. Therefore, the answer would be No, they're not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
