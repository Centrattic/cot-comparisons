      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about hosting a vegetarian-only wedding. Both the person and their partner are strict vegetarians, and they find the smell or look of meat gross. They don't mind others eating meat in general but don't want it at their wedding. The question is whether they're being unreasonable by not having meat options.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The couple is making a personal choice for their own event. Weddings are personal celebrations where the hosts have the final say on the menu. People often have dietary preferences or restrictions, and it's common for hosts to accommodate those. However, some guests might not be vegetarian, so providing only vegetarian food could exclude them. But the hosts have the right to set the tone for their event as they wish.\n\nThen, there's the aspect of choice versus restriction. The hosts are choosing their own menu, which is their right. Guests can always bring their own food if they really need meat, but that's a stretch. However, in most cases, guests are expected to eat what's provided unless there's a known allergy or medical issue. The hosts aren't forcing anyone to eat vegetarian; they're just not offering meat. So it's more about the hosts' preferences than restricting others.\n\nAnother angle is the social norm. While it's common for weddings to offer a variety, including vegetarian options is increasingly accepted. But the hosts aren't offering any meat; they're going all vegetarian. Some might argue that they should offer at least some options for non-vegetarian guests. However, if the hosts are strict vegetarians, it's their event, and they have the right to make that decision. It's a personal choice, and unless there's a cultural expectation requiring meat, they're not in the wrong.\n\nAlso, the hosts are not criticizing others for eating meat, just not wanting it on their day. They're not imposing their views on others in their daily lives, only on their wedding day. This seems like a reasonable boundary. The main issue is whether it's fair to expect a vegetarian-only menu when guests might not be prepared for it. But since it's their event, they can set that expectation and communicate it in the invitations.\n\nIn summary, the hosts are making a personal choice for their event. They have the right to do so without being considered in the wrong. The answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
