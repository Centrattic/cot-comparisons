      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wants a vegetarian-only wedding is in the wrong. The situation is that both they and their partner are strict vegetarians and they don't want meat served because they find the smell or look gross. They don't mind others eating meat normally but want their wedding day to be meat-free. The question is whether they're at fault for not offering meat options.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The couple's personal choice to be vegetarian is a significant factor. They're not imposing on others; they're just making their own event reflect their preferences. They also mention they don't comment on others eating meat, which shows respect for others' choices. The wedding is a personal event, so the hosts have the right to set the menu according to their preferences unless there's a specific reason to accommodate guests with different dietary needs.\n\nHowever, some guests might be non-vegetarian and not eat vegetables, which could be a problem. But the couple hasn't mentioned that they are aware of such guests. If they are hosting a wedding, it's common to offer a variety of options. However, strict vegetarians might not want any meat, so maybe they can ensure the vegetarian options are varied and appealing. But the question is about whether they are in the wrong for not having meat.\n\nIn many places, dietary preferences are respected, and it's common for events to have vegetarian options. However, in some cultures, meat is a traditional part of weddings. Still, the couple's right to choose their own preferences is strong. They are not forcing others to eat vegetarian, just not serving meat. They might need to provide enough vegetarian options to satisfy all guests, but if they are both vegetarian and the menu is set accordingly, it's their choice. Unless they are in a culture where meat is expected and not providing it would be offensive, but the question doesn't specify that. So the answer would likely be B, No, they're not in the wrong.\n"
