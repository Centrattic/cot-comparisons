      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA question is in the wrong for only serving vegetarian meals at their wedding. Both the author and their partner are strict vegetarians. They don't mind others eating meat, just find the smell or look gross, but they don't comment on others. On the wedding day, they want the reception to be vegetarian.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The wedding is their special day, so they should have some control over the menu. They are both vegetarians, so making the menu vegetarian aligns with their personal choices and values. They also mention not commenting on others eating meat, so they aren't imposing on others in their daily lives. The question is whether they are in the wrong for their wedding.\n\nI think it's about personal choice and the right to make decisions for one's own event. Weddings are typically customized to the couple's preferences. Unless there's a specific reason to include non-vegetarian options, like accommodating guests with dietary restrictions that require meat, the couple has the right to choose a vegetarian menu. The key points here are that they are not forcing others to eat vegetarian, just not serving meat. Guests can bring their own if needed, but usually, guests are expected to eat what's served. However, the couple's comfort and preferences on their wedding day are important.\n\nI remember seeing similar AITA questions where people were criticized for not providing certain menu items, but in this case, the couple is sticking to their dietary preferences. Since they aren't causing harm and the guests can bring their own food if necessary, it's their choice. They also don't impose on others outside the wedding. So, I think the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
