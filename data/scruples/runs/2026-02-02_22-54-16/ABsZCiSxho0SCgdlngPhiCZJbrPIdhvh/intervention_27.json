      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wants to have a vegetarian-only wedding is in the wrong (AITA). The situation is that both the person and their partner are strict vegetarians. They don't mind others eating meat in general but find the smell or look of it gross. They don't comment on others eating meat around them, but on their wedding day, they prefer no meat options.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong and wants to know my opinion. The answer should be A or B. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Weddings are personal events, so the couple has the right to set the menu according to their preferences. They are not forcing others to eat vegetarian, just not offering meat. They are accommodating their own dietary needs and comfort. \n\nSome might argue that guests might expect meat options, but that's not necessarily the case. Many people attend vegetarian or vegan weddings, and it's becoming more common. Plus, the couple isn't making any judgment about others' choices outside the wedding. They're just ensuring their own day is comfortable for them.\n\nPotential counterarguments: Maybe some guests would prefer meat, but the couple isn't obligated to cater to all guests' preferences beyond their own. It's their event, and they can choose the menu. Also, they might have considered providing other options, not just vegetarian, but the question is specifically about not having meat. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the key is personal choice and whether the action is harmful. Since they're not imposing on others, just not including meat, it's their right. The answer should be B (No, not in the wrong).\n"
