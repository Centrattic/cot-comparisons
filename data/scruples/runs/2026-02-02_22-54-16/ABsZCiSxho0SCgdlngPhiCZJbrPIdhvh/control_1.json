      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the person is at fault for only serving vegetarian meals at their wedding. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the couple are strict vegetarians. They don't mind others eating meat in general, but they find the smell or look of it gross. They aren't telling others not to eat meat in their presence, but on their wedding day, they don't want to deal with it. So they decide to have a vegetarian-only reception.\n\nNow, the question is whether they're in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nI think I need to consider a few things. Weddings are personal events, and the couple usually has the right to choose their preferences. They are not imposing their beliefs on others by not serving meat. Guests might have dietary restrictions, but the couple could offer vegetarian options for everyone. However, maybe some guests who are used to meat might feel excluded. But the couple is not forcing anyone to eat vegetarian; they're just choosing their own meal. Also, they mentioned they don't comment on others eating meat normally, so it's not about being judgmental. \n\nAnother angle: Weddings can be expensive, and sometimes guests expect a variety of food. But if the couple is paying for the event, they can choose how they want it. Plus, many restaurants and caterers can provide vegetarian menus that are satisfying. It's their day, so their preferences should take priority. Unless there are guests with specific dietary needs (like not vegetarian), but the question doesn't mention that. The couple isn't preventing others from having meat elsewhere, just on their wedding day. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer is probably B (they're not in the wrong). They're making a personal choice for their event, not forcing others, and it's their right to have a vegetarian menu. The key points are that they're not imposing on others, just choosing their own meal for their special day.\n"
