      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for having a vegetarian-only wedding. The couple are strict vegetarians and they find the smell or look of meat gross, so they don't want any meat at their wedding. They don't mind others eating meat in general, just their own wedding.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the main points here. The couple is making a personal choice based on their dietary preferences and comfort. Weddings are personal events, and the hosts usually have the right to decide the menu. But there might be arguments from guests who have different dietary needs or preferences. However, the couple mentions they don't have issues with others eating meat, just that they don't want it at their event. \n\nI should think about common practices. Many weddings have specific menus, and it's common to offer vegetarian options. But making the entire reception vegetarian is also a choice. The couple is clear that they're not judging others for eating meat, just avoiding it for their own comfort. \n\nPossible counterarguments: Some might say they should offer meat options because some guests might be used to eating meat. But the couple is providing a vegetarian menu, which is inclusive for vegetarians and those who can eat vegetarian. However, guests who strictly require meat might be inconvenienced. But the couple isn't forcing guests to eat vegetarian; they just aren't serving meat. It's up to the guests to bring their own, though that's not typical. \n\nAlso, the couple is not making a judgment about meat-eaters; they're just personal about their preferences. The question is about whether it's \"in the wrong.\" In most cases, personal choices about their own event are acceptable unless there's a significant oversight. Since they are providing a full vegetarian menu, which can be delicious and satisfying, it's more about their right to choose. \n\nSo, the answer is likely B, the author is not in the wrong. They have the right to choose their wedding menu based on their preferences and comfort, especially since they're not imposing on others but just avoiding what they find uncomfortable.\n"
