      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this question. The user is asking whether the person who is planning a vegetarian-only wedding is in the wrong. The situation is that both they and their partner are strict vegetarians and they don't want any meat at their wedding reception. They don't have a problem with others eating meat in general but prefer not to deal with the smell or look of it on their special day. The question is whether they're at fault for not offering meat options.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The couple is making choices based on their own dietary preferences and comfort. They're not imposing their views on others in general, just in this specific event. They're not trying to convert anyone or make others uncomfortable, but they want their own event to reflect their lifestyle. \n\nNow, thinking about societal norms and event planning, it's common for couples to have specific food choices at their weddings, whether it's vegetarian, vegan, or something else. The main considerations would be guests with dietary restrictions. However, the question here is about the couple's right to have their event as they see fit. \n\nI should also consider if there's any obligation to provide non-vegetarian options. If the couple is paying for the wedding, they have the right to decide the menu. It's their event, so they can make choices that align with their preferences. Unless there's a cultural expectation or a specific guest with a medical need that requires meat, which isn't mentioned here, it's their choice.\n\nAnother angle is the potential backlash. Some guests might be upset if they expected meat, but the couple isn't forcing anyone to eat vegetarian food. They're just not providing meat. It's possible that some guests might bring up the issue, but the couple isn't in the wrong for making their preferences known. \n\nAlso, the fact that they don't say anything when others eat meat around them shows they're not judgmental. They're just applying their preferences to their own event. \n\nSo, putting this all together, the answer seems to be that they're not in the wrong. They have the right to plan their wedding according to their preferences without expecting to provide alternatives they're uncomfortable with. Unless there's a specific reason to accommodate meat-eaters beyond general preferences, like allergies or religious reasons, which aren't mentioned here, the choice is valid.\n"
