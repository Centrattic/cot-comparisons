      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the person in the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong for serving only vegetarian meals at their wedding. Both the person and their partner are strict vegetarians, and they find the smell or look of meat gross. They don't have an issue with others eating meat in general but want their wedding day to be meat-free.\n\nHmm, first, I need to consider the social norms around weddings. Traditionally, weddings are inclusive events where guests' dietary preferences and restrictions are often accommodated. But in this case, the couple is making a choice based on their own preferences, not necessarily accommodating others. They're not forcing their guests to be vegetarian, but they're choosing their own reception menu. \n\nThe user's question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. I need to decide based on common sense and typical social expectations.\n\nOn one hand, some guests might be non-vegetarian and might feel the menu is limiting. But the couple is explaining that they're vegetarian and have a valid reason. They're not excluding anyone from eating meat, just not serving it. The key point is whether it's reasonable for the couple to prioritize their comfort on their special day. Weddings are personal, and couples often make choices based on their preferences, like not serving certain foods they dislike. For example, if someone is allergic to nuts, they might not serve nut-based dishes. Similarly, dietary choices like vegetarianism are a personal choice.\n\nHowever, there might be arguments that guests might have different needs. But the couple isn't saying they won't have alternatives. If they're providing vegetarian meals that are appealing and not forcing guests to eat vegetarian, then it's their right to choose. Plus, they mentioned they don't comment on others eating meat, so it's about their own event, not imposing their views. So the author isn't at fault here. The answer should be B.\n"
