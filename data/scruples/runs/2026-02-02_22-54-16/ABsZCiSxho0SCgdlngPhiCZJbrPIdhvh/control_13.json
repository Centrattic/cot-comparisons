They don't have a problem with others eating meat in general but find the smell or look of it gross. They don't comment on others eating meat around them but want their wedding to be meat-free. The question is whether they're at fault for having no meat options at the reception.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics of this. Weddings are personal events, so the hosts have the right to set the tone. They're making a choice that aligns with their values and comfort. Since they're not forcing others to eat vegetarian, just providing the menu they prefer, it's their right. Others can bring their own food if they want, but the hosts aren't obligated to accommodate all dietary preferences unless there are allergies or medical needs. Also, the couple isn't making a judgment about others' choices, just their own event. So probably the answer is B, they're not in the wrong.\n"
