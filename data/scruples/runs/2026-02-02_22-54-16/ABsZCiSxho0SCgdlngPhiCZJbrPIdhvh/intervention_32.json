      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the wedding vegetarian question is in the wrong. The situation is that they want to serve only vegetarian meals at their wedding because they are strict vegetarians and find meat's smell or look gross. They don't mind others eating meat but want their wedding day to be meat-free.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The couple are strict vegetarians, so their dietary choice is a personal and ethical decision. They\u2019re not imposing on others' choices; they're just creating their own event preferences. Weddings are personal, and hosts often make specific choices for their day. The question is whether excluding meat is wrong.\n\nPossible arguments against the author: Some might say guests should have options, especially if they eat meat. However, the couple can offer vegetarian meals and maybe mention that they\u2019re serving a meat-free menu, allowing guests to adjust if needed. But the question is about being \"in the wrong,\" which usually relates to moral fault or social expectation.\n\nCounterarguments: Guests can bring their own food if necessary, though that's less common. However, weddings are meant to reflect the couple's preferences. It's their day, and making personal choices is part of that. The couple isn't forcing anyone to eat vegetarian; they\u2019re just not serving meat. If guests can't handle that, maybe they should adjust, but that's their responsibility.\n\nThe author isn't in the wrong because they\u2019re making a personal choice for their event. The fact that they don't comment on others eating meat but prefer their own event to be vegetarian shows respect for others' choices while asserting their own. So the answer is B.\n"
