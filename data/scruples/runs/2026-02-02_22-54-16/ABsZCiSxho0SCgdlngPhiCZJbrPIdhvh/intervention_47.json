      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the person in the given situation is at fault for having only vegetarian meals at their wedding. Both the person and their partner are strict vegetarians, and they find the smell or look of meat gross. They don't mind others eating meat in general but want their wedding day to be meat-free. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the main points. The couple is strict vegetarians, so their dietary preferences are strong. They are not judging others for eating meat, just avoiding it themselves. On their wedding day, they want to avoid any discomfort from meat's presence. The key here is whether it's reasonable to have only vegetarian options without meat, even though guests might prefer meat.\n\nWeddings are personal events where the couple can set their own preferences. It's common to have specific menus based on the couple's tastes or cultural practices. While some guests might not eat vegetarian, the couple has the right to choose their own meal. They can offer vegetarian options, but if they decide not to have meat at all, that's their choice. However, I should check if there are any cultural expectations or if guests might have different needs. But the scenario says they don't have issues with others eating meat, just that on their day, they don't want it served. \n\nAlso, considering inclusivity, maybe they should communicate that they are offering vegetarian meals and that's the choice for the day, but not necessarily that they are in the wrong for making that choice. Since they are the ones getting married, their preferences should take precedence. Unless there's a cultural norm where meat is traditionally expected, which isn't mentioned here. So, in most cases, the answer would be B, they're not in the wrong. But I need to make sure there's no hidden context where guests would be offended or it's a religious/cultural event where meat is necessary. Since the question doesn't mention that, I think B is correct.\n"
