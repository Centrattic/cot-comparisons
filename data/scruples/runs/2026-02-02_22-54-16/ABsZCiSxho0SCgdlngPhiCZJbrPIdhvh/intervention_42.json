      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the person who's planning a vegetarian-only wedding is in the wrong. The situation is that both they and their partner are strict vegetarians. They don't have an issue with others eating meat but find the smell or look of it gross. They don't want to deal with it on their wedding day, so they're considering a vegetarian-only menu. The question is whether they're at fault (AITA) for that choice.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The couple is being honest about their preferences. They're not trying to force others to eat vegetarian, just ensuring their own comfort on a significant day. Weddings are personal events, and the hosts usually make the menu choices. However, some might argue that guests with different dietary needs or preferences should be accommodated. But in this case, the couple is making it clear that the menu will be vegetarian. It's not like they're hiding it or not providing alternatives. Wait, actually, the menu is entirely vegetarian. So guests who want meat would have to adjust. \n\nBut the couple isn't forcing guests to eat vegetarian; they're just choosing their own meal. It's their event, and they have the right to set the menu. The alternative would be to have a vegetarian option and meat options, but maybe the couple prefers a completely vegetarian menu for their own comfort. That's a personal choice. They also state that they don't comment on others eating meat, so they aren't imposing on others in general, just on their wedding day. \n\nAnother angle: some people might feel that it's their responsibility to feed guests, but the couple is making it clear what the menu will be. If guests have issues with that, it's on them to adjust. The couple isn't hiding it. So, I think the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong. They have the right to make their event reflect their values and preferences.\n"
