      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for having a vegetarian-only wedding reception. Both the author and their partner are strict vegetarians. They don't have an issue with others eating meat in general, but they find the smell or look of it gross. They don't say anything about others eating around them, but on their wedding day, they want no meat options.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Weddings are personal events, and the couple usually makes choices based on their preferences. Since they are both vegetarian, choosing a vegetarian menu makes sense for their own comfort. The key points here are that they are not forcing others to be vegetarian, just not serving meat. They also don't comment on others eating meat, so it's not about imposing their views, just their own event.\n\nPossible counterarguments: Some guests might want to eat meat and not have that option. But the couple isn't preventing guests from eating meat elsewhere; they're just not serving it at their reception. Also, many weddings have specific dietary options, like vegan, kosher, halal, etc., so this is similar to those cases. The couple is respecting their own preferences without necessarily ignoring others' needs, unless there's a significant number of guests who require meat, but the scenario doesn't mention that. The couple is also not making a statement against meat-eating, just personal choice for their day.\n\nSo, the answer would likely be B (No), as they are within their rights to choose their wedding menu based on their preferences, especially when they are both vegetarian and the issue is about their own comfort on such an important day. They are not forcing others to conform but are simply not serving what they find unpleasant.\n"
