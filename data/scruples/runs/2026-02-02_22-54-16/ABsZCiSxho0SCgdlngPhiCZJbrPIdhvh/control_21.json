      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the given scenario is in the wrong for having a vegetarian-only wedding reception. The situation is that both the person and their partner are strict vegetarians. They don't mind others eating meat but find the smell or look of it gross. They don't say anything about others eating around them, but they want their wedding to be meat-free. The question is if they're in the wrong by not having meat options.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The couple is strict vegetarians, so their dietary choice is a personal one. They are not forcing others to be vegetarian, just choosing their own wedding menu. The question is about whether it's acceptable to have a vegetarian-only reception. \n\nI remember that in similar \"Am I the A$$hole?\" (AITA) scenarios, the general consensus often supports people making personal choices as long as they aren't harming others. Since the couple isn't imposing their beliefs on others, just setting up their own event, it's usually seen as their right to choose. \n\nHowever, I should also think about potential counterarguments. Some might say that guests have different dietary preferences, but the couple is offering vegetarian meals, which is a valid choice. Others might argue that a wedding is a shared event, but the couple is making it clear that this is their choice, not the partner's, and they're not forcing anyone to eat vegetarian. \n\nAlso, the fact that they don't comment on others eating meat but just want their own day to be meat-free seems reasonable. They're not dictating others' behavior, just setting the menu for their own event. \n\nSo, the answer would likely be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. They have the right to choose their wedding menu based on their personal preferences and dietary choices without imposing on others.\n"
