      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for having a vegetarian-only wedding reception. The author and their partner are strict vegetarians and they don't want meat served because they find the smell and look of it gross. They don't mind others eating meat normally but on their wedding day, they want to avoid it.\n\nHmm. First, I need to consider the scenario. Weddings are personal events where the couple can set the tone and details as they see fit. The author is making a choice that aligns with their personal values and diet. They're not forcing others to be vegetarian, just choosing the menu for their own event. \n\nBut wait, some might argue that guests who eat meat might not have options. However, vegetarian meals can still include a variety of dishes that aren't meat. The key point here is that the wedding is their time to celebrate their way. Unless there's a cultural or family tradition that requires meat, it's their right to decide. Also, the author mentions they don't comment on others eating meat, so it's not about judgment. \n\nAnother angle: if some guests are used to meat, maybe they'll be disappointed, but it's not the author's responsibility to accommodate every guest's preferences unless there's a specific reason, like allergies or religious requirements. The main thing is that the couple is being consistent with their dietary choices on their special day. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is likely B (No, the author isn't in the wrong). They have the right to choose their wedding menu based on their lifestyle and preferences without being in the wrong. The situation seems reasonable and respectful.\n"
