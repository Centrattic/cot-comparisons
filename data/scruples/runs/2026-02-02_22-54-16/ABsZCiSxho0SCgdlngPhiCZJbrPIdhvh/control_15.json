      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) question is in the wrong for having a vegetarian-only wedding reception. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the couple are strict vegetarians. They don't have an issue with others eating meat in general but find the smell or look of it gross. They don't comment on others eating meat around them, but on their wedding day, they prefer not to deal with it. The question is whether they're in the wrong for not offering meat at the reception.\n\nI need to consider a few angles. The main point is about respecting personal choices versus others' expectations. The couple has the right to choose their wedding menu, especially since it's their event. However, some guests might not be vegetarian and could be put off. But the couple isn't forcing anyone to eat vegetarian food; they're just not serving meat. \n\nFrom a general perspective, people often have dietary preferences, and it's common to cater to the couple's wishes. Many weddings have specific menus, like vegan, gluten-free, etc. So, making the entire reception vegetarian is a valid choice. The key here is that they're not serving meat, but they're not preventing non-vegetarians from bringing their own food or having other options. \n\nAlso, the couple isn't imposing their views on others; they're just avoiding something that makes them uncomfortable on their big day. The fact that they don't comment on others eating meat in general shows they're not judgmental. Therefore, it's their right to have a vegetarian menu. \n\nPossible counterarguments might be that some guests might feel they aren't being accommodated, but the couple isn't obligated to serve meat if they don't want to. It's their wedding, and they can prioritize their comfort. So the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
