      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person is in the wrong for having a vegetarian-only wedding reception. Let's start by breaking down the details. Both the author and their partner are strict vegetarians. They don't have issues with others eating meat generally but find the smell or look of it gross. They don't comment on others eating meat around them, but they want their wedding day to be free of meat. The question is whether they're in the wrong for not offering meat options.\n\nFirst, I should consider the reasons they're doing this. It's their wedding, a personal event, and they have personal preferences based on their dietary choices. They're not forcing others to be vegetarian, just not serving meat. The key point here is that it's their choice for their own event. \n\nWeddings are personal, and couples often have specific themes or dietary preferences they want to follow. For example, some might have a vegan wedding, a kosher wedding, or a halal wedding. The guests are invited to celebrate the couple's union, so it's reasonable for the couple to set the tone and rules for their event. \n\nHowever, there could be potential issues. Some guests might have dietary restrictions that require meat, but the question doesn't mention that. The couple says they have no problem with others eating meat in general, but they just don't want it at their wedding. Since they're not saying guests can't eat meat elsewhere, just not at the reception, it's their right to choose the menu. \n\nAnother angle is cultural or traditional expectations. In some cultures, serving meat is traditional, so a vegetarian-only menu might be seen as unusual. But the question doesn't mention any cultural conflict. The couple is making a personal choice that aligns with their lifestyle. \n\nAlso, the couple is clear about their reasons being their personal preferences, not a judgment on others. They don't comment on others eating meat, so they're not imposing their views. It's about their comfort on their special day. \n\nPossible counterarguments could be about inclusivity or guest experience, but the couple isn't excluding anyone. They\u2019re just not serving meat, which is a personal choice. Guests can bring their own food if they need, though that's not mentioned here. \n\nIn conclusion, since it's their wedding and they're not forcing others to adopt their dietary choices, just choosing the menu for their event, the author is not in the wrong. They have the right to make personal choices for their own celebration.\n"
