      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wants a vegetarian-only wedding is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the situation. The couple are strict vegetarians. They don't have issues with others eating meat, but they find the smell or look of it gross. They don't say anything when others eat meat around them, but on their wedding day, they want the reception to have no meat options. They're asking if they're in the wrong for doing that.\n\nSo, the question is whether hosting a vegetarian-only wedding makes them the \"asshole.\" The options are A for yes, B for no.\n\nI should consider a few factors. Weddings are personal events, and the couple is allowed to make choices based on their preferences. They're not forcing others to be vegetarian, just ensuring their own event aligns with their values. The key point is that they're not imposing on others' dietary choices but setting their own event's menu. \n\nAnother angle is whether guests might expect meat options. However, the couple is clear about their dietary preferences and the reasoning. If they communicated this to guests, it's respectful. Also, providing vegetarian meals for everyone doesn't mean guests can't bring their own food if needed, though that's less common. \n\nThe couple isn't making any demands beyond their own event. It's their right to choose the menu for their wedding. Unless there's a cultural expectation that requires meat, which varies, but the user hasn't mentioned any such context. \n\nSo, the answer is likely B (No). The couple isn't in the wrong for hosting a vegetarian-only wedding based on their personal preferences and values.\n"
