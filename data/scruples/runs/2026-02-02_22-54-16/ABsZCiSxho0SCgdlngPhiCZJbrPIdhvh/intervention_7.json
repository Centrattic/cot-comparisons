      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for only serving vegetarian meals at their wedding. Both the person and their partner are strict vegetarians and they find the smell or look of meat gross. They don't have an issue with others eating meat but want their wedding day to be meat-free.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rights of the couple to make their own choices for their event. A wedding is a personal event, and they have the right to set the menu as they see fit. Since they are the ones hosting, it's their space to do as they please. \n\nThen, thinking about the guests. Some guests might be non-vegetarians and might not have a meat option. However, the couple is offering vegetarian meals, which is a valid choice. They aren't forcing anyone to eat vegetarian, just not providing meat. Guests can choose to eat vegetarian, or maybe bring their own food if they really want meat. It's not like they're making it mandatory for guests to eat vegetarian.\n\nAnother angle is that maybe some guests might have dietary restrictions that are different from vegetarianism. But the couple is already making their preference clear. It's important to note that they are not excluding anyone; they're just catering to their own values. Weddings often have specific themes or dietary choices, like gluten-free or vegan options, which others might not agree with but are acceptable. \n\nAlso, the couple mentioned they don't comment on others eating meat, so they aren't imposing their views beyond their own event. They're simply creating a space that aligns with their lifestyle. \n\nPotential arguments against the couple could be that it's inconsiderate, but the user's reasoning is that they are not against others eating meat in general, just on their wedding day. It's their right to have a stress-free day without the sensory discomfort they mention. \n\nI think the key here is the autonomy of the hosts. The answer should be that they aren't in the wrong. So the answer is B.\n"
