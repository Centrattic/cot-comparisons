      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for having a vegetarian-only wedding. Let me think through this.\n\nFirst, the scenario: the author and their partner are strict vegetarians. They don't have a problem with others eating meat in general, but they find the smell or look of it gross. They don't comment on others eating around them, but on their wedding day, they want the reception to be meat-free. The question is whether they're in the wrong (AITA) by not offering meat options.\n\nHmm. Well, weddings are personal events. People usually have specific themes or preferences for their big day. If both the author and their partner are vegetarians, it makes sense they'd want the food to align with their values. Also, they mentioned they don't mind others eating meat otherwise, but this is their special day. \n\nBut wait, what about guests who might prefer meat? Could that be an issue? However, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The key here is that it's the author's wedding. They have the right to make choices about their own event. Plus, they're not forcing guests to eat vegetarian; they're just providing options that suit their preferences. \n\nAlso, they never comment on others eating meat in general, so this isn't about imposing their views, just their own event. So, it's their day, and they have the right to set the menu as they see fit. Therefore, the answer is probably B (No, they're not in the wrong).\n"
