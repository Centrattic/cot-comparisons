      "text": "Okay, let me think through this. The question is whether the person is in the wrong for having a vegetarian-only wedding reception. The couple are both strict vegetarians and don't want the smell or look of meat. They don't have a problem with others eating meat in general, just don't want it at their wedding. \n\nFirst, I should consider their reasons. They're choosing their own wedding, so it's their event. They have the right to decide the menu based on their preferences. But maybe some people might feel excluded if they can't eat meat. However, the couple isn't forcing anyone to eat vegetarian; they're just not serving meat. Guests can bring their own food if needed, but that's probably not common.\n\nAlso, they mention they never say anything about others eating meat elsewhere. So it's not about judging others, just their own event. The key here is that it's their day, and they should be able to set the atmosphere they're comfortable with. I don't think it's fair to blame them for wanting their personal preferences reflected in their wedding. So the answer is B.\n"
