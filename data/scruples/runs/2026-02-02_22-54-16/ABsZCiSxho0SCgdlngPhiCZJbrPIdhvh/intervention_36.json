      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wants to have a vegetarian-only wedding is in the wrong. The situation is that both they and their partner are strict vegetarians. They don't mind others eating meat but on their wedding day, they want to avoid it. The question is if they are at fault for not offering meat options at the reception.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Weddings are personal events where the couple's preferences are usually respected. Since both are vegetarians, it makes sense they want the meal to align with their lifestyle. They mentioned they don't comment on others eating meat but just want their day to be meat-free. \n\nPossible counterarguments might be about guests who aren't vegetarian. But typically, weddings can offer vegetarian options without meat. However, in this case, the couple is making it exclusively vegetarian. Some might think that's not considering guests who want meat. But again, the couple's choice is about their own preferences for their special day. It's their event, so they should have the right to set the menu as they wish. \n\nAlso, the couple isn't forcing others to be vegetarian, just not serving meat. Guests can bring their own food or eat elsewhere if they're uncomfortable. But that's a stretch. Most guests would comply with the couple's request. \n\nAnother point: the couple is clear about their reasons. They don't find others eating meat offensive, just the smell or look. They avoid commenting on others, so it's about their own comfort. That's a valid reason for their choice. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer is probably B, the author is not in the wrong. They have the right to make their wedding reflect their values and dietary preferences. The key here is that it's their event, and they're not imposing their views beyond the menu choice.\n"
