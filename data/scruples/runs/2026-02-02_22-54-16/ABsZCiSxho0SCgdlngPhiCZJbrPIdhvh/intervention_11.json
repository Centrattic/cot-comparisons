The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) question is in the wrong for only serving vegetarian meals at their wedding.\n\nThe couple are strict vegetarians and want their wedding to be meat-free. They mention they don't have a problem with others eating meat, but they find the smell or look of it gross. They also say they don't comment on others' meat-eating but want their wedding day to be free of it. \n\nSo, the key points here are their personal preferences and choices. They\u2019re making a decision based on their own dietary preferences and comfort. Weddings are personal events, and it's common for hosts to cater to their preferences. However, some might argue that guests with different dietary needs might not have options. But the question is, is the author in the wrong?\n\nI think the answer is B, No. They\u2019re not obligated to provide meat. It's their day, and they have the right to choose their wedding menu based on their beliefs. Plus, they\u2019re not shaming others for eating meat, just not serving it. If guests want meat, they can bring their own or have other options, but the hosts aren't at fault for their choice. So the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
