      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote about serving only vegetarian meals at their wedding is in the wrong. The scenario is that both the person and their partner are strict vegetarians. They don't have an issue with others eating meat in general but find the smell or look of it gross. They don't comment on others eating meat but want their wedding day to be free of it. The question is whether they're in the wrong (AITA) for not having meat options at the reception.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the typical AITA context. Usually, these situations involve personal choices that might affect others, and the community votes on whether the person is \"in the wrong.\" The key here is the balance between personal preference and the potential impact on guests.\n\nThe couple's choice is about their own wedding. Weddings are personal events where the couple can set the tone, menu, and other details as they see fit. However, some guests might have dietary restrictions that aren't vegetarian, like allergies, religious reasons, or preferences they didn't know they had to bring up. The user mentions that they are strict vegetarians themselves and that they don't comment on others eating meat, so their stance isn't about judging others but about their comfort on their special day.\n\nBut is there a responsibility to accommodate meat-eating guests? Some people might argue that guests should be able to eat what they like, but others would say that the couple has the right to choose the menu based on their own preferences. Also, the couple might have communicated the vegetarian-only policy in advance, giving guests time to prepare. If they didn't, then guests might be inconvenienced. However, the question doesn't mention that the guests were not informed. \n\nAnother angle is cultural or traditional expectations. In some cultures, weddings often include meat, so deviating from that might cause surprise. But personal choice is becoming more accepted. \n\nPotential counterarguments could be that guests might not have a meat option, which could be an issue for those with specific dietary needs. However, the couple isn't preventing guests from eating; they\u2019re just not offering meat. If the vegetarian menu is well-prepared and appealing, guests might not mind. The couple could also consider offering a variety of vegetarian dishes that are satisfying for all guests.\n\nIn terms of AITA, the community often considers intent and impact. The couple's intent is to have a comfortable day for themselves, not to impose their views on others. The impact is that some guests might not get meat, but they\u2019re not forced to eat it. If the menu is good and the guests are informed, the impact is minimal. \n\nSo, based on this, the answer would likely be B, that the author is not in the wrong. They have the right to choose their wedding menu based on their lifestyle and preferences, especially since they're not dictating others' choices beyond their event.\n"
