      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wants a vegetarian-only wedding is in the wrong. The scenario says both they and their partner are strict vegetarians. They don't mind others eating meat in general but find it gross to smell or see it, so they don't want it at their wedding. They\u2019re asking if they're at fault for not having meat options.\n\nHmm, first thought: It's their wedding day, so they should have the right to set the menu according to their preferences. But maybe some people might feel like they should accommodate non-vegetarian guests. However, the key points here are that the couple is strict vegetarians and they're not judging others' choices elsewhere. They're just avoiding it on their day. \n\nWait, but does hosting a vegetarian-only reception exclude others? Maybe some guests have dietary restrictions that aren't related to vegetarianism, like allergies or religious reasons. However, the question is about the author being in the wrong. If they're clear about the menu in advance, guests can bring their own food or adjust. Also, the couple has a valid reason for their choice. \n\nI remember that AITA (Am I the Asshole) posts often hinge on whether the person's actions are reasonable. In this case, the couple is making a personal choice that aligns with their values and preferences. It's not like they're forcing others to eat vegetarian, just not providing meat. So, I think the answer is B, No. They're not in the wrong.\n"
