      "text": "Okay, let's think about this. The user is asking if the person is in the wrong for having a vegetarian-only wedding. The couple are strict vegetarians and they don't want meat served because they find the smell or look unpleasant. They don't mind others eating meat in general, just not on their wedding day.\n\nFirst, a wedding is a personal event. The couple has the right to make choices that align with their values and dietary preferences. They're not stopping guests from eating meat elsewhere; they're just not serving it at their own event. It's their day to celebrate their union, so it makes sense they'd want it to reflect their lifestyle.\n\nBut wait, some guests might not be vegetarian and could be disappointed. However, the couple isn't making others eat vegetarian; they just aren't offering meat. The key point is that the wedding is their choice, and they're not imposing on others unless they have dietary restrictions. Also, the question is about whether they're in the wrong, not about guest satisfaction.\n\nAnother angle: maybe the guests could bring their own meat, but that's impractical. The couple isn't responsible for others' meal choices at their event. They can choose the menu without forcing it on attendees. \n\nSo, the answer seems to be B, No. The couple isn't in the wrong because it's their right to host a vegetarian wedding. They aren't excluding others from eating meat, just not serving it. Everyone is welcome to eat what's provided, and the couple is honoring their personal preferences.\n"
