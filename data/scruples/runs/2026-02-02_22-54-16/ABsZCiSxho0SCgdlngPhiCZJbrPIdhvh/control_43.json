      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wants a vegetarian-only wedding is in the wrong. The situation is that both the person and their partner are strict vegetarians. They don't have issues with others eating meat in general but find the smell or look of it gross. They don't comment on others eating around them, but on their wedding day, they don't want meat served. The question is whether they're in the wrong by having no meat options at the reception.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Weddings are personal events, and the couple usually has the final say on how their day is planned. Choosing a vegetarian menu reflects their dietary preferences and values. Since they mentioned they are strict vegetarians, it's their right to have a menu that aligns with their beliefs.\n\nHowever, I should also think about guests who might prefer or require meat. But the couple isn't banning meat consumption in general; they're just not serving it at their specific event. It's their day, so they can set the menu as they see fit. They might even offer to accommodate dietary restrictions if possible, but the core of the question is about their choice to have a vegetarian-only menu because of their own preferences.\n\nIt's important to note that the couple isn't forcing others to be vegetarian or judging those who eat meat. They're simply choosing their own celebration's menu. So, unless there are specific cultural or family traditions that require meat that they're overriding without consideration, they aren't in the wrong. The key is that it's their wedding, and they have the autonomy to make such choices.\n"
