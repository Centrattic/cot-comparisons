      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wants a vegetarian-only wedding is in the wrong. They both are strict vegetarians, don't mind others eating meat but find the smell or look gross. They don't want to deal with meat on their wedding day. The user thinks the author isn't wrong, but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. The couple has the right to choose their own wedding menu, right? Their dietary choices are their own, and unless they're forcing others to eat the same, it's not an issue. The key point is that they're not imposing their views on guests; they're just making their own celebration align with their preferences. \n\nBut some people might argue that guests who aren't vegetarian might have dietary needs or preferences. However, the question is whether the authors are in the wrong. Since they're providing a meal for their own event, they can choose the menu as they wish. They might even offer alternatives or mention it in the invitations, but the core issue is their right to a vegetarian-only reception.\n\nAnother angle: respecting others' choices. The couple isn't forcing anyone to eat vegetarian, just not serving meat. If guests have dietary restrictions, they can bring their own food or have the couple arrange for some vegetarian options. But the authors are strict vegetarians, so their comfort is important on their big day. It's their event, so personal choice is key here.\n\nSo, based on this, the answer should be B (No, the author isn't in the wrong).\n"
