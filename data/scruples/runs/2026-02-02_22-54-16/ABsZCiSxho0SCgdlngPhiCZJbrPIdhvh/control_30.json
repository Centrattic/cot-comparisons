      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for serving only vegetarian meals at their wedding. The couple are strict vegetarians and don't want to deal with the smell or look of meat on their big day. They don't have a problem with others eating meat in general.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the main points here. The wedding is their day, so they have the right to make decisions about the food based on their preferences. They are not imposing their views on others; they're just avoiding meat because of personal discomfort. The key here is that they're not forcing anyone else to be vegetarian. They're providing vegetarian meals, which might be the only option, but if there are guests who need meat, the couple might need to accommodate them unless they're prepared to handle possible dissatisfaction.\n\nWait, but the original question says that the reception has no meat options. If all guests are served vegetarian meals, then guests who can't eat vegetarian (maybe for religious, cultural, medical, or personal reasons) might be unhappy. However, the couple's reasoning is about their own comfort. The question is whether they are in the wrong for that decision.\n\nIn many cases, people do make personal choices for their weddings, like not serving certain foods. But it's also common to offer alternatives. However, if the couple is strict vegetarians and their preference is to have a vegetarian menu, they might not consider it a problem. But maybe they should offer alternatives. However, the question is whether they are in the wrong. \n\nThe options are A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no). The couple's right to personal preference is a strong point. They are not forcing others to eat vegetarian; they're just avoiding meat. So B (not in the wrong) seems likely. However, if they don't offer meat options, some guests might be left without food they can eat. But if the couple is aware of guests with dietary restrictions and makes accommodations, that's different. The scenario doesn't mention that. It just says they have no meat options. If guests have specific needs, the couple might be in the wrong for not considering them. But the couple's reasoning is based on their own preferences, not a judgment on others. \n\nAnother angle: it's their wedding, so they can make choices. If guests have issues, they can bring their own food or adjust. But that's not practical. Typically, the standard practice is to offer a variety. However, the couple is choosing a vegetarian menu based on their own lifestyle. It's a personal choice. So the answer might be B (not in the wrong). But it depends on the cultural context and expectations. In some places, a wedding menu with only vegetarian might be unusual, but it's their right to do so. The key is that they are not imposing their views on others but just avoiding meat for their own comfort. Therefore, they are not in the wrong.\n"
