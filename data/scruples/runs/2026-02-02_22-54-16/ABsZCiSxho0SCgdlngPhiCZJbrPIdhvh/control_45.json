      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for having a vegetarian-only wedding. The person and their partner are strict vegetarians and they don't want meat served because they find it gross, even though they don't mind others eating meat. The main question is whether serving only vegetarian is wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the principles of personal choice and hospitality. The couple has the right to make choices about their own wedding, especially if it aligns with their dietary preferences and values. Vegetarianism is a personal choice, and many people have strong reasons for it, like health, ethics, or environment. \n\nHowever, there's also the aspect of guests' needs. Some guests might have dietary restrictions that require meat, but the couple mentioned they have no issues with others eating meat in general. The key point here is that they're not forcing anyone to eat vegetarian; they're just not serving meat. Guests are free to bring their own food if necessary, though that's not common. \n\nI should check if there's a cultural or traditional expectation that might be relevant. In some cultures, weddings are expected to have a variety of food, including meat. But the couple's choice is about their personal comfort and preferences. They're not being hostile, just choosing their own menu. \n\nAlso, the couple isn't preventing guests from eating meat elsewhere; they're just not serving it at their event. It's their right to have a menu that reflects their lifestyle. Unless there are guests with specific medical needs that require meat (which isn't mentioned here), it's a personal choice. \n\nSo, the answer would likely be B (No), because the couple isn't in the wrong for making their wedding reflect their dietary choices. They're not forcing anyone to eat vegetarian, just not providing meat, which is a personal decision they have the right to make.\n"
