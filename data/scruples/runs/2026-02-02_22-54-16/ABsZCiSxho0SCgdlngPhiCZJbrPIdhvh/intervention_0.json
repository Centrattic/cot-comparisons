      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong for having a vegetarian-only wedding reception. The couple are strict vegetarians and want their wedding day to not have meat, even though they don't mind others eating meat otherwise. They don't want to deal with the smell or look of it on their special day.\n\nSo, the question is whether they are in the wrong by not providing meat options. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong and wants my opinion. I need to decide between A (Yes, in the wrong) or B (No, not in the wrong).\n\nFirst, I should consider the couple's right to set their own preferences for their wedding. Weddings are personal events, and the hosts usually decide the menu based on their tastes and any dietary restrictions. The couple is being honest about their vegetarianism and not wanting meat on their day. They aren't forcing others to eat it, just not offering it.\n\nBut some people might argue that guests might have different dietary needs or preferences. For example, some guests might not be vegetarian and could be uncomfortable without meat. However, the couple is providing vegetarian meals, which is a valid choice. They're not excluding anyone's dietary needs in a harmful way, just aligning with their own.\n\nAnother angle: being a strict vegetarian is a personal choice, and the couple's discomfort with the smell or sight of meat is their own experience. They have the right to create an environment where they feel comfortable on their wedding day. The fact that they don't comment on others eating meat elsewhere shows they're respectful of others' choices, just not on their day.\n\nPotential counterarguments: Maybe some guests will be upset, but it's not the couple's responsibility to accommodate every possible preference unless there's a specific need (like allergies). The key here is that the couple is clear about their choice and not imposing meat on anyone. They're not being inconsiderate; they're setting their own boundaries for their event.\n\nSo, I think the answer is B. The couple isn't in the wrong because they're making a personal choice for their own event, respecting their dietary preferences and comfort, and providing an alternative that meets their own needs. It's their day to celebrate their values and lifestyle, and they have the right to do so without judgment.\n"
