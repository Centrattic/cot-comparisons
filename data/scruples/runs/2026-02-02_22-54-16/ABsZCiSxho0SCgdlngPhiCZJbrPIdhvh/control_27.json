      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wants a vegetarian-only wedding is in the wrong. The scenario is that both the author and their partner are strict vegetarians. They don't have an issue with others eating meat in general but find the smell or look of it gross. They don't want to comment on others eating meat around them but want their wedding reception to have no meat options.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B). The key points here are personal choice, respect for others, and event planning considerations.\n\nThe couple is making a personal choice based on their dietary preferences and comfort. They're not forcing guests to eat vegetarian; they're just not serving meat. However, some guests might have dietary needs that require meat, like non-vegetarians or those with medical reasons. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nIn many cases, hosting events with specific dietary choices is acceptable as long as guests are informed and alternatives are available if needed. Since the couple is clear about their choice and it's their special day, they have the right to make such decisions. They also mention they don't comment on others eating meat, so it's not about being judgmental, just their own comfort on the day. \n\nPotential counterarguments might be that some guests could feel excluded, but the couple isn't preventing guests from bringing their own food, just not serving meat. It's their event, so they can set the menu as they see fit. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
