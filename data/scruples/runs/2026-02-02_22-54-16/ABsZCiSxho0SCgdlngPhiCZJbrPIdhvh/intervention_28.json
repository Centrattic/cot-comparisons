      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote about serving only vegetarian meals at their wedding is in the wrong. The situation is that both they and their partner are strict vegetarians. They don't have an issue with others eating meat in general, but the smell or look of it is gross to them. They don't comment on others eating meat, but on their wedding day, they want the reception to have no meat. The question is whether they're in the wrong for making the reception vegetarian-only.\n\nHmm, the user thinks the author isn't wrong. So I need to determine if the answer is A or B. Let me break this down. First, the wedding is the couple's event, so they have control over the menu. Being a strict vegetarian, it's their personal choice, and they have the right to set the menu according to their preferences. However, some guests might not be vegetarian and could be inconvenienced. But the couple mentions they don't have a problem with others eating meat generally; they just avoid it themselves. So their choice isn't about forcing others but creating a comfortable environment for themselves on their special day.\n\nIn many cases, people make dietary choices for their events based on their own preferences or values. For example, some people choose vegan weddings, or no alcohol, etc. The key here is that the couple isn't imposing their beliefs on others but setting their own space. However, maybe there's an expectation that weddings should accommodate all guests. But the couple isn't refusing service to non-vegetarians; they're just not serving meat. They might offer vegetarian options, which could include some that aren't meat, but are still varied enough for all guests. \n\nI think the main point is that it's their wedding, and they have the right to decide the menu. As long as they communicate this to the guests in advance so people are aware and can prepare if necessary. Since the couple states they have no issues with others eating meat, their choice isn't about judgment but personal comfort. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong. They're making a personal choice for their event, which is their right.\n"
