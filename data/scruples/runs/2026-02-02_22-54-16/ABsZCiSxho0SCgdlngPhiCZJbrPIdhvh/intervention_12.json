      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for having a vegetarian-only wedding reception. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the couple are strict vegetarians. They don't have an issue with others eating meat generally, but they find the smell or look of it gross. They don't say anything about others eating meat around them, but on their wedding day, they want the reception to be vegetarian-only. The question is whether they're in the wrong by not providing meat options.\n\nI need to consider a few things. Personal choices versus imposing on others. Weddings are big events where the couple's preferences often take precedence. They're not forcing anyone to eat the food, just not serving meat. People can bring their own if they want, but that's not common. Also, the couple has given a reason for their choice: it's their personal comfort. They are not being judgmental about others' choices, just stating their own.\n\nOn the other hand, some guests might be offended or feel excluded, especially if they have dietary preferences they can't accommodate. But the couple isn't making guests eat something they don't want; they're just not offering meat. It's a choice to celebrate their values on their special day. \n\nI think the key here is that the couple is responsible for their own event. They have the right to set the menu according to their beliefs and preferences, as long as it's not discriminatory or harmful. Since they're not forcing anyone to eat something, just not providing meat, it's their right. So the answer is B.\n"
