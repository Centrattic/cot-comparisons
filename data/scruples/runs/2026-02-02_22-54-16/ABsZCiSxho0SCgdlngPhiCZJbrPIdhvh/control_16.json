      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for having only vegetarian meals at their wedding. Let me start by breaking down the scenario.\n\nThe couple are both strict vegetarians. They don't have an issue with others eating meat in general but find the smell or look of it gross. They don't comment on others eating around them, but on their wedding day, they want the reception to be meat-free. The question is whether they're at fault (AITA) for not providing meat options.\n\nFirst, I should consider their reasons. They're following their dietary preferences and values, which is a personal choice. Weddings are personal events, so it's common for couples to make decisions based on their preferences. However, some guests might not be vegetarian and might expect meat options, especially if they're used to traditional wedding menus. But the couple isn't forcing anyone to eat vegetarian; they're just not serving meat. Guests can bring their own food if they need to, but that's not usually expected.\n\nAnother angle is that the couple is being respectful by not explicitly criticizing others' food choices but still making their own event reflect their values. They are not excluding anyone from attending; they're just setting the menu according to their preferences. \n\nIn many cases, people plan events that align with their lifestyles, especially when it's their own celebration. Offering vegetarian meals is a choice that's becoming more common and accepted. However, there might be cultural or family expectations to consider if, for example, certain guests are used to meat-heavy menus. But the question doesn't mention any specific issues with that, just the couple's personal preferences.\n\nSo, the main points are: the couple's right to set their own event's menu, the fact that they're not imposing their views on others, and the growing acceptance of vegetarian options. On the flip side, some guests might not have a meat-free option, but they can opt for other dishes or bring their own. However, in many places, vegetarian menus are standard now, so this might not be an issue.\n\nI think the answer leans towards B (No), because the couple is entitled to make their wedding reflect their personal choices without forcing guests to eat meat. Unless there's a specific reason guests might need meat (like cultural or health reasons), the couple isn't in the wrong here. They should communicate the menu in advance so guests can prepare, but the decision itself isn't inherently wrong.\n"
