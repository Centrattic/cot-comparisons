      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if they're at fault for serving only vegetarian meals at their wedding. Both they and their partner are strict vegetarians. They don't have issues with others eating meat generally but find the smell or look of it gross. They don't comment on others eating around them, but on their wedding day, they want no meat options.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural norms. Weddings often have a lot of food, and it's common to offer a variety to accommodate guests. But the author is making a personal choice based on their dietary preferences. Since it's their wedding, they have the right to choose the menu as they see fit. However, they might be criticized for not providing meat options for guests who prefer or require them. \n\nBut wait, the question is whether they're in the wrong. The key points here are that they are strict vegetarians, they don't want meat on their day, and they don't comment on others' choices. They\u2019re not forcing others to be vegetarian, just not serving meat. In that case, maybe they\u2019re not in the wrong because it's their event and their personal choice. However, some might argue that they should offer meat for guests who want it. But the author isn't saying they can't eat meat; they\u2019re choosing not to serve it. Since they\u2019re not imposing their choice on others, just their own wedding, it's more about personal preference. \n\nAlso, considering that the couple is making a personal statement about their values (vegetarianism), it's reasonable for them to have their wedding reflect that. Plus, many people have dietary restrictions, and it's common to accommodate various preferences. But if someone is strictly vegetarian and wants their event to reflect that, it's their right. However, maybe some guests might feel excluded, but the couple isn't forcing anyone to eat their way; they\u2019re just not serving meat. \n\nIn conclusion, since it's their wedding and they\u2019re making a choice based on their beliefs without imposing on others beyond the menu, they\u2019re likely not in the wrong. The answer would be B.\n"
