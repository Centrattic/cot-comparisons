      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for only serving vegetarian meals at their wedding. The couple are strict vegetarians and find the smell or look of meat gross. They don't mind others eating meat, just not on their wedding day. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the scenario. Weddings are personal events, and the couple usually has the final say on the details. They're both vegetarian, so choosing a vegetarian menu aligns with their personal beliefs and comfort. The key points here are their dietary preferences and their desire for a meat-free day. They also mention they don't judge others for eating meat, just don't want it on their own day. \n\nNow, thinking about possible arguments against them: some guests might not have a meat option, which could be a problem if they have guests with different dietary needs or preferences. But the couple is already making a choice for their own event, so they might have considered that. Maybe they could have mentioned the menu choice in the invitations or provided some options, but the question is about whether they are in the wrong for having no meat at all. \n\nOn the other hand, the couple has the right to make their event reflect their values. It's their wedding, and they can choose the menu as long as they inform guests. Since they didn't say anything about others' choices, just their own, it seems like a personal decision. There's no indication they're imposing their views on others, just setting their own environment for the day. \n\nI should also think about cultural or social norms. In some places, traditional wedding menus do include meat, but that's changing as more people consider dietary restrictions. If the couple is clear about their choice and perhaps offers a variety of vegetarian dishes, it's a valid decision. \n\nSo, the answer is probably B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. They're making a choice for their own event based on their preferences. However, maybe there's a nuance if the majority of guests are non-vegetarian or if there's a cultural expectation to have meat. But the question doesn't mention those factors. The couple's comfort on their special day is important, and they have the right to set that. Unless they're being inconsiderate without prior notice, which isn't the case here, they're not at fault.\n"
