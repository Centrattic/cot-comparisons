      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the question is in the wrong for serving only vegetarian meals at their wedding. Both the author and their partner are strict vegetarians. They don't have an issue with others eating meat, but they find the smell or look of it unpleasant. They don't comment on others eating around them but want their wedding day to be meat-free.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Weddings are personal events, and couples usually have the right to decide the details according to their preferences. Since both partners are vegetarian, it makes sense they might prefer a vegetarian menu. However, they should also consider the guests. The key point here is whether not offering meat is unreasonable or if it infringes on guests' choices.\n\nSome guests might be meat-eaters and expect a variety, but the couple is providing a menu that aligns with their lifestyle. It's their day, and they have the right to make choices that make them comfortable. Additionally, they aren't forcing guests to eat vegetarian; they're just not serving meat. If some guests can't eat vegetarian, the couple could offer alternative options, but the question doesn't mention that. However, the original statement says they have no problems with others eating meat in general, so maybe they are prepared for that.\n\nAnother angle: cultural or religious considerations. If the wedding has a specific culture that traditionally includes meat, maybe there's a conflict. But the question doesn't specify that. It's more about personal preference.\n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the couple's choice is seen as unreasonable. Since they're stating their own preferences and not making others uncomfortable, but also not providing meat, it's a personal choice. The couple isn't in the wrong because it's their event, and guests are expected to accommodate the couple's wishes unless there are specific dietary restrictions they need to address. The answer would likely be B (No).\n"
