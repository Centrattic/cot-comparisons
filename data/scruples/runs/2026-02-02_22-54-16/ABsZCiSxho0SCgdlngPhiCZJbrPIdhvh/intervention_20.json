      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person in the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong for having a vegetarian-only wedding. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe user and their partner are strict vegetarians. They don't have a problem with others eating meat in general, but they find the smell or look of it gross. They don't say anything when others eat meat around them, but on their wedding day, they want to avoid it. The question is whether it's wrong for their wedding reception to have no meat options.\n\nFirst, I should consider the reasons behind their decision. They're making a personal choice based on their dietary preferences and what they find unpleasant. Weddings are personal events where the couple can make choices about the food, decor, etc., according to their preferences. So, it's their event, and they should have the right to decide the menu. \n\nHowever, I should also think about potential guests' reactions. Some guests might be meat-eaters and might not have a vegetarian option if the menu is strictly vegetarian. But the couple isn't forcing anyone to eat meat; they're just not serving it. The key point here is that the couple is respecting their own preferences without imposing their views on others. They are not shaming others for eating meat, just avoiding their own discomfort on their special day.\n\nIn many cultures, weddings often have a variety of food options, but it's also common for couples to cater to their own dietary needs. For example, a vegetarian couple having a vegetarian menu is not uncommon. The couple is not making an active statement against meat; they're simply choosing their own comfort. \n\nAnother angle is whether providing a vegetarian-only menu is reasonable. If the couple is aware of guests with dietary restrictions, they might need to ensure there are enough options. But the question doesn't mention that the couple is ignoring guests' needs. If they're providing vegetarian options that are varied and appealing, then it's a valid choice. Guests who can't eat vegetarian might choose not to attend, but the couple isn't obligated to accommodate every guest's preference.\n\nI think the main issue is the perception of the couple being judgmental. However, the couple isn't expressing judgment; they're just avoiding something that makes them uncomfortable. The fact that they don't comment on others eating meat in general suggests they're respectful of others' choices. \n\nIn terms of social norms, while some people might be surprised or even upset, the couple isn't doing anything wrong. They have the right to make their wedding reflect their personal preferences. So, the answer is likely B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
