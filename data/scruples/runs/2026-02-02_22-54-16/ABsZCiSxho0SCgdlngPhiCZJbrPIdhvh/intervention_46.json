      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for having a vegetarian-only wedding reception. The couple are strict vegetarians and they don't want to deal with the smell or look of meat, even though they don't mind others eating it. They're not saying anything about others, but on their wedding day, they prefer no meat.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical angle here. Weddings are personal events where the couple can set the tone and preferences. Since they're the ones hosting, it's their right to decide the menu. The fact that they are strict vegetarians is a personal choice, and they're not forcing others to eat the same way. The key point is that they're not being judgmental about others' choices but just want their own day to reflect their lifestyle. \n\nNow, some might argue that guests might have dietary restrictions or preferences, but the couple isn't excluding meat-eaters; they're just providing vegetarian meals for everyone. However, the question is about whether they are in the wrong. Since they're not making others uncomfortable or imposing their views beyond their own event, it seems reasonable. \n\nThe answer depends on cultural norms too. In some places, weddings are expected to have a variety, but in others, the couple's choice is respected. The user's partner is also vegetarian, so it's a mutual decision. The response should consider that hosting a vegetarian-only reception is a valid choice, especially when the couple isn't being intolerant of others' choices. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
