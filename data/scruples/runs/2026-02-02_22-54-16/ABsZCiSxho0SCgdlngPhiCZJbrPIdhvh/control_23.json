      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wants a vegetarian-only wedding is in the wrong. The scenario is that both they and their partner are strict vegetarians. They don't have a problem with others eating meat in general but find the smell or look of it gross. They don't comment on others eating meat around them, but on their wedding day, they want to avoid it. The question is whether they're at fault for having a meatless reception.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the arguments for and against. On one side, a wedding is a personal event, and the couple should have the right to make choices about their own event. They're not preventing guests from bringing their own food; they're just not serving meat. Vegetarianism is a personal choice, and if they're comfortable with that lifestyle, it's their right to express it in their wedding. Also, the couple says they don't judge others for eating meat, so it's not about imposing their beliefs but about their own comfort on a special day.\n\nOn the other side, some might argue that guests have dietary preferences or requirements, and not offering meat could inconvenience them. But the couple isn't saying guests can't have meat; maybe they can bring their own if needed. Also, many guests might appreciate the vegetarian options, especially as vegetarianism is becoming more common. The couple isn't forcing anyone to eat what they don't want; they're just curating the menu to their own preferences.\n\nI should also think about the context of the question. The person is asking if they're \"in the wrong,\" which implies they're concerned about being judged. Socially, there's a growing acceptance of personal dietary choices, and hosting a vegetarian wedding is not unusual. The key point is that they're not being judgmental towards others' choices but are making their own for their event. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer is likely B (No, they are not in the wrong). The couple has every right to choose their wedding menu based on their preferences and values. They're not imposing on others, just setting the tone for their own celebration.\n"
