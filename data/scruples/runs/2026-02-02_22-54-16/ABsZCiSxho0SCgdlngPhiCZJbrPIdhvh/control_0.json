      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for having a vegetarian-only wedding reception. The couple are strict vegetarians and they don't want the smell or look of meat on their wedding day. They don't have a problem with others eating meat in general but just don't want it at their wedding.\n\nSo, first, I need to consider the context. Weddings are personal events, and the couple's preferences should be respected. The key points here are that both partners are vegetarians, and they\u2019re making a personal choice about their own event. They\u2019re not imposing their views on others, just avoiding meat for their own comfort. \n\nNow, potential arguments against them might be that some guests could want meat, but the couple isn't forcing anyone to eat vegetarian. They can still bring their own food if necessary, though that's not common. However, it's their right to choose the menu for their wedding. Also, the couple isn't making a judgment about others' dietary choices, just stating their own preference for the day.\n\nI should also think about cultural or social norms. In some places, offering a variety might be expected, but the couple's right to set their own preferences usually overrides that. They might offer alternative options or explanations, but the core issue is their personal choice. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. They have the right to make choices for their own event based on their personal preferences and values.\n"
