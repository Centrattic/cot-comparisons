      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wants to have only vegetarian meals at their wedding is in the wrong. The situation is that both the person and their partner are strict vegetarians. They don't have an issue with others eating meat in general, but they find the smell or look of meat unpleasant. They don't say anything when others eat meat around them, but on their wedding day, they want to avoid having meat served.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the reasons they're making this choice. They're strict vegetarians, so their dietary preferences are personal and not based on judging others. The key point here is that they're not imposing their views on others; they're just choosing their own wedding's menu. The fact that they don't comment on others eating meat shows they're respectful of other people's choices.\n\nNow, in terms of societal norms, people often have different preferences for their weddings. Some might choose vegan, others might have meat, some might offer both. The question is whether choosing a vegetarian-only menu is unreasonable. Since it's their wedding, they have the right to decide the menu as long as it's communicated properly. They\u2019re not forcing anyone to eat vegetarian, just not offering meat. However, some guests might not be vegetarian and might feel inconvenienced. But the couple's right to their own preferences should be balanced against accommodating guests. \n\nBut here, the couple is not offering meat, not that they're being forced to eat it. If they're not serving meat, they might need to ensure there are sufficient vegetarian options for all guests, not just themselves. The issue is whether guests would be left without food choices. But the question doesn't mention that. The couple is making their own choice, which is valid as long as they don't force others. \n\nAlso, the couple has no problem with others eating meat; they just don't want it at their wedding. That seems reasonable. They're making a personal choice for their day. So the answer would be B (No), the author is not in the wrong. They have the right to choose their wedding's menu based on their preferences, as long as it's respectful and they communicate it to guests, which the scenario suggests they would.\n"
