      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person in the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole?) scenario is in the wrong for serving only vegetarian meals at their wedding. Both the author and their partner are strict vegetarians, and they find the smell or look of meat gross, but they don't judge others who eat meat. They're having a wedding and want the reception to be vegetarian.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics of the situation. Weddings are personal events, and hosts usually have the right to set the menu based on their preferences, especially if they have dietary restrictions or beliefs. Since both the couple are vegetarians, it's reasonable for them to choose a vegetarian menu. They're not forcing others to eat vegetarian, just not offering meat. \n\nBut there might be guests who are used to eating meat and might be disappointed. However, the couple isn't making a judgment about others' choices; they're just creating a space that aligns with their own values and comfort. It's important to note that the couple isn't shaming anyone else's dietary choices, just curating their own event.\n\nThere's also the aspect of accommodating guests. Maybe some guests have different dietary needs, but the question doesn't mention that the couple is excluding others. If they're providing vegetarian options and maybe even some non-meat alternatives, it's their right to do so. \n\nOn the flip side, some might argue that a wedding is a social event where hosts should consider a broader range of tastes. But in this case, the hosts have a valid reason based on their own dietary preferences and comfort. They are not imposing their views on others but simply choosing their own celebration setup. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author is not in the wrong. They have the right to make personal choices for their wedding day, especially when it's based on their own lifestyle and comfort, without forcing others to conform.\n"
