      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for having a vegetarian-only wedding. Both they and their partner are strict vegetarians. They don't have a problem with others eating meat, but they find the smell and look of it gross. They don't comment on others eating around them, but on their wedding day, they want no meat options.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Weddings are personal events where the couple can make choices about their own celebration. They have the right to set the menu as they see fit. The fact that they're both vegetarians adds a personal reason. They're not trying to impose on others, just creating a space that's comfortable for them on an important day.\n\nHowever, some people might argue that guests with dietary restrictions or preferences (like wanting meat) might be inconvenienced. But the couple isn't forcing anyone to eat vegetarian; they're just choosing their own menu. It's their day, so prioritizing their comfort makes sense. Also, they didn't mention excluding meat out of judgment, just personal preference. So the answer would lean towards B, they're not in the wrong.\n"
