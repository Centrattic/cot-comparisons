      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wants a vegetarian-only wedding is in the wrong. Both they and their partner are strict vegetarians. They don't have an issue with others eating meat in general, but they find the smell or look of it gross. They don't comment on others eating meat around them, but on their wedding day, they want no meat served.\n\nHmm, so the question is whether it's wrong for them to have a vegetarian-only reception. I need to decide if the answer is A or B. The user thinks the author is not in the wrong. Let me think through this.\n\nFirst, a wedding is a personal event. The couple is hosting it, so they can set the rules. They\u2019re both vegetarian, so their preferences are valid. They\u2019re not forcing others to be vegetarian, just choosing their own meal. Others can bring their own food or maybe have a separate menu, but the couple's right to choose their own celebration is important. \n\nSome people might say guests might not eat, but the couple isn't preventing that. They can offer vegetarian options for everyone. Maybe some guests are vegetarian too, which would make it inclusive. The couple isn't judging others, just avoiding the discomfort they feel with meat. So their choice is about their comfort on their special day. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that not having meat could be inconvenient for non-vegetarian guests. But the couple isn't making a moral stance, just personal choice. I think the key here is that it's their event, so they can decide the menu. They're not imposing their beliefs but stating their own. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
