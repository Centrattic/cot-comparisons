      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" scenario is in the wrong for having a vegetarian-only wedding reception. The author and their partner are strict vegetarians, and they don't want meat served because they find the smell and look of it gross. They don't mind others eating meat otherwise but want their wedding day to be meat-free.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the social norms around weddings. Weddings are personal events where the couple's preferences are usually respected. Guests attend to celebrate the couple, so the couple has the right to set the tone. Vegetarianism is a choice many people make, and it's becoming more common for events to offer plant-based options.\n\nBut some might argue that not providing meat could inconvenience guests who prefer it. However, the couple isn't forcing anyone to eat vegetarian food; they're just not serving meat. It's their event, so they can decide the menu. Also, many vegetarian dishes can be delicious and satisfying for all guests. The key points are the couple's right to their preferences and the ability to cater to all guests without meat. So the answer would be B, No.\n"
