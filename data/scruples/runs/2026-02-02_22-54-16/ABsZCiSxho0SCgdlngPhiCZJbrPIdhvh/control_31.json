      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for having a vegetarian-only wedding. The couple are strict vegetarians and they don't want meat served because they find the smell or look of it gross. They don't mind others eating meat otherwise, just not on their wedding day.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the arguments for both sides. On one hand, a wedding is a personal event, and the couple should be able to set their own preferences for their day. They're not forcing others to eat vegetarian, just not offering meat. So maybe that's their right. On the other hand, some guests might have dietary needs or preferences that require meat, or maybe they're not vegetarian and would prefer a meat option. But the couple isn't stopping them from eating meat elsewhere, just not serving it at the wedding.\n\nI should also think about common practices. I know some weddings have dietary options like vegetarian, vegan, gluten-free, etc. So maybe it's acceptable to offer only vegetarian if that's the couple's choice. However, if there are guests with specific dietary restrictions that aren't vegetarian, the couple might need to accommodate that. But the scenario doesn't mention any issues with other dietary needs, just meat. The couple isn't forcing guests to eat vegetarian; they're just not providing meat. So maybe that's their choice.\n\nAnother point: the couple is being respectful by not commenting on others' meat consumption but wants their own event to reflect their preferences. That seems reasonable. People often personalize events to their lifestyle. Unless there's a cultural expectation in their community that weddings should have meat, which isn't mentioned here, it's their event. So the answer might be B, they're not in the wrong. They're making their personal choice without imposing on others beyond their own preferences.\n"
