      "text": "\nOkay, let's think through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for having a vegetarian-only wedding reception. The author and their partner are strict vegetarians and find the smell or look of meat gross, even though they don't judge others for eating it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural and social norms around weddings. Traditionally, weddings can vary a lot in terms of food, but they often aim to accommodate as many guests as possible. However, the author is making a personal choice based on their own preferences and lifestyle. They\u2019re not forcing others to be vegetarian, just choosing their own event's menu.\n\nNext, the key points here are that the couple is clear about their dietary choices and the reason. They aren't shaming others, just avoiding meat on their wedding day. It's their event, so they have the right to set the menu as they see fit. However, some guests might not eat vegetarian, so the couple might need to ensure there are enough options for non-vegetarians. If the menu is entirely vegetarian but offers a variety that's appealing to all, then it's a personal choice. But if the menu lacks options that non-vegetarians would find satisfying, that could be a problem.\n\nAnother angle is whether the couple is being considerate. They should make sure that the vegetarian menu is delicious and varied enough so that guests, regardless of their usual diet, enjoy the food. If the wedding is in a culture or region where meat is a traditional part of the reception, some guests might find it odd, but it's still a personal choice. The couple's comfort and preferences on their special day should be a priority.\n\nLooking at similar situations, many weddings now have diverse dietary options, including vegetarian, vegan, gluten-free, etc. So it's becoming more common. The author isn't excluding meat-eaters; they're just not serving meat. The question is whether that's reasonable. Since they're not forcing anyone to eat vegetarian, and they're making a choice for their own event, it seems justified. The answer would likely be B, they are not in the wrong.\n"
