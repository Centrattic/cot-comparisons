      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the person in the situation is in the wrong for having a vegetarian-only wedding. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the key points: Both the author and their partner are strict vegetarians. They don't have issues with others eating meat generally but find the smell or look of it gross. They don't comment on others eating around them but want their wedding day to be meat-free. The question is whether they're in the wrong for not offering meat at the reception.\n\nI need to consider cultural norms, personal preferences, and etiquette. Weddings are personal events where couples can set the tone. Vegetarian options are common these days, but making the entire meal vegetarian might raise some eyebrows. However, it's their event, so they should have autonomy. Some might argue that guests with different dietary needs should be accommodated, but the author didn't mention that. They said they don't object to others eating meat in general, just on their day.\n\nAlso, the fact that they don't comment on others eating meat shows they aren't judgmental. Their reasoning is about their personal comfort. Since it's their wedding, they have the right to make choices that suit their lifestyle. So, the answer is probably B (No), they aren't in the wrong. They have the right to set the menu based on their preferences, especially since they're the hosts. It's a personal choice and not about being inconsiderate, as long as they communicate it to guests beforehand.\n"
