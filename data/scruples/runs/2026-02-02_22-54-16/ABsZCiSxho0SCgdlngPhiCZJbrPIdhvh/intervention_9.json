      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for having a vegetarian-only wedding meal. The writer is a strict vegetarian along with their partner, and they find the smell or look of meat unpleasant. They don't mind others eating meat in general but want their wedding day to be meat-free.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Weddings are personal events where couples make choices based on their preferences and values. The author isn't forcing guests to eat vegetarian; they're just not serving meat. Since both partners are strict vegetarians, it's their right to choose the menu that aligns with their dietary and personal preferences. Also, they mentioned they don't comment on others eating meat in general, so this isn't about judging others' choices but about their own comfort on a significant day.\n\nPotential counterarguments might be about guests who prefer meat, but the wedding is the couple's event. If guests have dietary restrictions, they can request alternatives, but the authors aren't providing meat. However, the key point is that the couple is making a personal choice, not imposing on others' choices. It's their day, and they have the autonomy to decide the menu. So I think the answer is B, they're not in the wrong.\n"
