      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) question is in the wrong for serving only vegetarian meals at their wedding. The author and their partner are strict vegetarians and find the smell or look of meat gross, even though they don't judge others for eating it. They don't plan to comment on others' meat consumption but want their wedding to be meat-free. The question is whether they're in the wrong (A for yes, B for no).\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The couple's personal dietary choices are strict vegetarianism. They mention they don't have a problem with others eating meat in general but just want their own wedding to be meat-free. The main issue is whether it's unreasonable to have a vegetarian-only reception.\n\nWeddings are personal events, and the couple is allowed to make choices based on their preferences. The fact that they are strict vegetarians suggests that this is a long-standing choice, not a last-minute decision. They also clarify that they don't judge others for eating meat, so their decision isn't about imposing their beliefs on guests but about their own comfort on their big day.\n\nNow, potential counterarguments might be that some guests might expect a meat option or have dietary needs that aren't vegetarian. However, the couple is providing a reception, which they can choose the menu for. If they communicate this in advance, guests can adjust or bring their own food if necessary. It's their right to choose the menu for their event.\n\nAnother point is that in some cultures or regions, weddings might traditionally have meat, so guests might be surprised. However, that's changing with more vegetarian options becoming common. Plus, the couple's personal choice should take precedence, especially when they've made their dietary preferences clear.\n\nConsidering all this, the couple isn't making a judgment on others but creating a space that aligns with their values and comfort. They aren't forcing anyone to eat vegetarian, just not offering meat. So, the answer is likely B (No, they aren't in the wrong).\n"
