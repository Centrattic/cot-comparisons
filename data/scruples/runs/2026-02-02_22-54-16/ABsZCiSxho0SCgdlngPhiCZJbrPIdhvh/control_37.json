      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wants a vegetarian-only wedding is in the wrong. The situation is that both they and their partner are strict vegetarians and they don't want to deal with the smell or look of meat on their wedding day. They don't have an issue with others eating meat, just their own wedding reception.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural or social norms. Weddings are personal events, and couples usually have the right to make choices about their own event. But some people might argue that guests could have dietary restrictions or preferences that aren't vegetarian. However, the question states that they're not stopping people from eating meat elsewhere, just their own wedding.\n\nAnother angle is whether it's discriminatory. Vegetarianism is a personal choice, so unless there are guests with specific dietary needs (like non-vegetarians or those with allergies), the couple can choose their menu. They might even offer alternative options for non-vegetarian guests, but the question doesn't mention that. However, the user didn't say they're excluding anyone; they're just serving their preferred cuisine.\n\nAlso, weddings are about the couple's preferences. It's their special day, so they should have the autonomy to decide the menu. Unless there's a specific reason guests would be offended or unable to eat, it's their choice. So the answer would likely be B, not in the wrong.\n"
