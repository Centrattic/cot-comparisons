      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the person who wants to have a vegetarian-only wedding is in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the couple are strict vegetarians. They don't have an issue with others eating meat, but they find the smell or look of it gross. They don't say anything when others eat meat around them, but on their wedding day, they want the reception to have no meat. The question is whether they're at fault for that decision.\n\nI need to consider the main points here. Personal dietary choices are usually a personal choice, right? If they're the ones hosting the wedding, they have the right to choose the menu. However, there might be guests who are not vegetarian and might not have a meat-free option. But the couple is clear that they're not against others eating meat in general; they're just avoiding it on their day. \n\nThe key factors here are respect for their own preferences versus accommodating guests. Weddings are personal events, and the hosts typically make the decisions. While some guests might be inconvenienced, the hosts aren't obligated to provide meat unless they have specific guests with dietary needs. But the couple isn't forcing others to be vegetarian, just not serving meat. They could offer vegetarian options, which they are doing. \n\nI should also think about potential pushback. Some people might say that guests should have options, but in many cases, weddings do have specific menus based on the couple's preferences. For example, some couples might have a themed menu or specific cultural dishes. So, this seems similar. \n\nAnother angle: the couple is considerate of others' choices by not commenting on their meat consumption, but they're asserting their own choice for their day. It's mutual respect. Unless there's a guest with a medical need or religious requirement for meat, which isn't mentioned here, the decision seems reasonable.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer would be B (No, the author isn't in the wrong). They have the right to choose their wedding menu based on their personal preferences, especially since they're not imposing their choice on others outside of the event. Guests can bring their own food if needed, or the couple can ensure there are enough vegetarian options. The scenario doesn't indicate any harm or disrespect towards others' choices, just a personal preference for their own event.\n"
