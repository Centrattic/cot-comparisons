      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. The question is whether the person who wants a vegetarian-only wedding is in the wrong. So, they and their partner are strict vegetarians, and they find the smell or look of meat gross. They don't want to serve meat at their wedding reception. The AITA (Am I the Asshole) question is if they're wrong for doing that.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Weddings are personal events where the couple can make choices based on their preferences. Since they're both vegetarians and have no issues with others eating meat in general, just the presence of meat bothering them on their big day, it's their right to decide the menu. They're not forcing guests to eat vegetarian, just choosing what's served. \n\nPossible counterarguments might be about accommodating guests with different dietary needs. But the question is about the author being in the wrong. If they're providing vegetarian options, which they are, then they're not excluding anyone. Some guests might prefer meat, but the couple is within their rights to set the menu according to their values and comfort. \n\nAlso, the couple isn't shaming others for eating meat, just avoiding it on their day. So the answer is likely B (No, they're not in the wrong). They are making a personal choice that doesn't harm others, and it's their special event.\n"
