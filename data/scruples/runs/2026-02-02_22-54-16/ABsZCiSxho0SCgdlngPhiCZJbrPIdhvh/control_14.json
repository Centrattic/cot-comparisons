      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wants to have a vegetarian-only wedding is in the wrong. The scenario says both the person and their partner are strict vegetarians. They don't have an issue with others eating meat in general but find the smell or look of it gross. They don't say anything about others eating around them, but on their wedding day, they prefer not to have meat options. The question is whether they're at fault (AITA).\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The couple is choosing their own wedding, which is their event. They have the right to decide the menu based on their preferences. They aren't forcing others to be vegetarian, just not serving meat. There's no mention of being judgmental or shaming others, which is important. The key here is that they are setting up their own event, which is a private choice. \n\nHowever, there might be guests who are meat-eaters. But the couple is not making it mandatory for guests to eat vegetarian; they're just not providing meat. But wait, if there are no meat options, that could be an issue for guests who prefer or require meat. But the couple is being clear about their choice. The question is about whether the couple is in the wrong. \n\nIn most cases, people choose their wedding menus based on their preferences. If the couple is vegetarian, it's reasonable to have a vegetarian menu. They aren't excluding meat-eaters from the event, just not serving meat. Unless there are cultural or family traditions that might expect meat, but the scenario doesn't mention that. So, unless the choice is causing unnecessary harm without a valid reason, the couple isn't in the wrong. \n\nThe answer would likely be B (No), because it's their right to decide the menu for their own wedding, especially given their personal dietary preferences and the fact that they're not imposing on others. They are not making it a mandatory choice for guests, just setting the menu according to their own values.\n"
