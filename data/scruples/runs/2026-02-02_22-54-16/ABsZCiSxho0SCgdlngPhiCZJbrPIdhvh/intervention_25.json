      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wants to have only vegetarian meals at their wedding is in the wrong. Both the person and their partner are strict vegetarians, and they find the smell or look of meat gross. They don't mind others eating meat generally but want their wedding day to be meat-free. So, answer A or B.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Weddings are personal events where the couple usually makes the decisions. They're celebrating their union, so their preferences should be respected. The fact that they're both vegetarians and have been clear about their preferences adds to the argument. Also, they don't confront others about eating meat, just want their own event to avoid it. \n\nNext, possible counterarguments. Some might say guests have their own dietary needs, but the user didn't mention that they're refusing meat options for guests. Wait, actually, the question is about serving only vegetarian meals. So, are they not providing meat options? The original post says the reception has no meat options. So, if guests want meat, they can't eat it. But in many cultures, weddings do offer a variety of options. However, if the couple is vegetarian, they might choose a vegetarian menu. But then, what about guests who eat meat? \n\nBut the user is asking if they're in the wrong. Since it's their wedding, they have the right to set the menu according to their preferences. They are not forcing others to be vegetarian, just not serving meat. People can choose to eat vegetarian or not attend, but the couple is under no obligation to provide meat. The key here is that they are making a choice for their own event, not imposing on others' choices elsewhere. \n\nAlso, they mention they don't say anything about others eating meat around them, so it's not about judging guests, just their own space. So, the answer is probably B, they are not in the wrong.\n"
