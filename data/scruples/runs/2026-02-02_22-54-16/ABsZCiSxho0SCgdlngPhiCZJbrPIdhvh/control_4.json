      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the person who wants a vegetarian-only wedding is in the wrong. So, the user and their partner are strict vegetarians. They don't have issues with others eating meat, but they find the smell or look of it gross. They don't say anything when others eat meat around them, but on their wedding day, they want the reception to have no meat. Are they at fault?\n\nFirst, I need to consider their reasons. They are both vegetarians, so their dietary preferences are personal and longstanding. They're not imposing their views on others; they just want their own event to align with their values. It's their wedding, after all, so they have the right to set the menu based on their preferences. \n\nBut wait, what about guests who might want to eat meat? The question is whether the hosts are being inconsiderate. However, the hosts have already stated they don't have issues with others eating meat. They're just choosing their own event's menu. It's a bit different from a restaurant where you have to accommodate everyone. In a private event, the hosts can decide the menu based on their preferences. \n\nAlso, the key point is that they are not making it a meat-only event. They're just making it vegetarian. If guests can't have meat there, but the hosts are comfortable with that, it's their choice. Some might argue that it's a big event and should cater to all, but others might say it's their right. \n\nI think the answer here leans towards B (No), because it's their wedding and they can choose their menu. They are not forcing anyone to eat vegetarian, just serving what they prefer. The guests can bring their own food if needed, but the hosts aren't at fault for their choice.\n"
