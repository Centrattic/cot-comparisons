      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person (the author) is in the wrong for having a vegetarian-only wedding reception. Both the author and their partner are strict vegetarians, and they find the smell or look of meat gross. They don't have a problem with others eating meat but don't want it at their wedding. The question is whether they're in the wrong (A) or not (B).\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The couple is entitled to make their own choices for their wedding, right? It's their special day, and they can decide what they want. But maybe some guests might not have vegetarian options, so is that inconsiderate?\n\nBut wait, the user says they never comment on others eating meat around them. They just don't want it at their own wedding. So it's their personal choice for their event. Weddings are personal, so they can set the menu as they like. Also, maybe they can offer vegetarian options for all guests, but the question is about serving only vegetarian meals. So if they're not forcing anyone to eat vegetarian, but just not providing meat, that's their choice. \n\nHowever, maybe some guests might have dietary restrictions that are different. But the author didn't mention that. They said they don't have a problem with others eating meat, but they find it gross. So they're making a personal choice for their own event. \n\nI think the key here is personal choice and autonomy. Unless there's a cultural expectation where meat is a must, but the question doesn't mention that. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
