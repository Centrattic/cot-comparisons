      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person is in the wrong for having a vegetarian-only wedding. The scenario is that both the person and their partner are strict vegetarians and they want the wedding reception to not have meat because they find the smell or look of it gross. They don't mind others eating meat generally but on their wedding day, they prefer it to be vegetarian.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The couple is making personal choices based on their own preferences. They're not forcing others to eat vegetarian, but they're setting their own event's food policy. The question is whether that's being in the wrong.\n\nI should think about the ethics of personal choice versus others' needs. Weddings are personal events, and hosts have the right to set the menu according to their preferences. However, guests might have dietary restrictions or preferences that aren't vegetarian. But the couple here isn't excluding meat-eaters; they're just not serving meat. They might be offering vegetarian options, which is the focus here. \n\nWait, the original post says the reception has no meat options. That means all the meals served are vegetarian. So guests who might have wanted meat aren't getting it. But the couple isn't serving meat because they prefer it, not because they're against others eating it. \n\nSo, is it wrong to have a vegetarian-only wedding? Well, the couple has the right to host their event as they wish. However, maybe they should consider guests with different dietary needs, like those who can't eat certain vegetarian ingredients (e.g., allergies, religious restrictions) or those who prefer meat. But the question is specifically about being in the wrong for not serving meat.\n\nThe user's reasoning is that they don't want to deal with the smell or look of meat. That's their personal comfort. They don't comment on others eating meat, just their own event. So, in terms of \"AITA,\" it's about whether their choice is unreasonable.\n\nI think the answer leans towards B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The couple is making a choice that affects their own event. They can't please everyone, and it's their right to have a vegetarian menu. However, they might want to offer sufficient vegetarian options to accommodate various dietary needs, but the question doesn't mention that. The core issue is about serving meat, not other dietary restrictions. So unless there's a specific cultural expectation or a guest with a medical necessity that requires meat, the couple isn't in the wrong for their choice.\n"
