      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for serving only vegetarian meals at their wedding. Both the person and their partner are strict vegetarians. They don't have an issue with others eating meat in general but find the smell or look of it gross. They don't comment on others eating around them, but want their wedding to be meat-free.\n\nSo, first, I need to consider the context. Weddings are personal events where the couple should have the freedom to make choices that reflect their values and preferences. Since both are vegetarians, it's their right to choose the menu that aligns with their lifestyle. The key points here are that they are not forcing others to be vegetarian, just not serving meat. They are also not commenting on others' choices, which shows respect for others' preferences. \n\nHowever, some guests might have different dietary needs or preferences. But the couple isn't preventing guests from bringing their own food or having alternatives. They're just not serving meat. It's a common practice for couples to have themed or specific menus based on their beliefs. So, unless there's a cultural expectation or a specific guest with a medical need that requires meat, the couple is within their rights. \n\nThe question is whether they're in the wrong. The answer would hinge on whether their choice infringes on others' rights. Since they're not imposing their beliefs but making a choice for their own event, the answer is likely B (No). Also, providing vegetarian options for a vegetarian couple's wedding is reasonable. They aren't being exclusionary beyond their own preferences. So the answer should be B.\n"
