      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA question is in the wrong. The scenario is about a wedding where they want only vegetarian meals because both they and their partner are strict vegetarians. They don't mind others eating meat, but on their wedding day, they don't want meat served. The question is whether they are in the wrong for making the reception meat-free.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The couple is strict vegetarians, so their dietary preferences are a significant part of their identity. They mention that they don't comment on others eating meat but prefer not to have it around on their special day. The main issue is whether it's fair for them to enforce a vegetarian-only menu at their wedding.\n\nIn terms of ethics, personal choice, and hospitality, there are a few angles to consider. On one hand, a wedding is the couple's event, so they have the right to make decisions that align with their values and comfort. They are not forcing guests to eat vegetarian food; they're simply not serving meat. Guests who prefer meat can choose from vegetarian options, which the couple is providing. \n\nOn the other hand, some guests might feel that meat is a traditional or expected part of a wedding menu, and its absence could be inconvenient or disappointing. However, the couple isn't excluding anyone based on their dietary preferences beyond their own. They are accommodating their preferences, which are valid, especially if they have ethical, health, or religious reasons for being vegetarian. \n\nThe couple also states they don't have issues with others eating meat in general, so this isn't about judgment. It's about creating a space that reflects their lifestyle and comfort. Since they are paying for the wedding, they have the autonomy to decide the menu. It's their day, and they're making choices that make them comfortable. \n\nI should also consider if there's any cultural or social expectation that might make this a problem. In some cultures, weddings have traditional foods, but in many modern settings, dietary preferences are more accommodated. The couple isn't forcing anyone to eat a certain way, just not offering meat. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the couple isn't being inconsiderate or judgmental. They are making a personal choice that affects their own event. Guests can adapt or bring their own food if necessary, but the couple isn't at fault here. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
