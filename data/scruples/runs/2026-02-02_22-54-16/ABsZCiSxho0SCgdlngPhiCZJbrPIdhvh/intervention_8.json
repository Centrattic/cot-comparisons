      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for having a vegetarian-only wedding. The couple is strict vegetarians and they want their wedding to be meat-free because they find the smell or look of it gross. They don't mind others eating meat, but on their big day, they want it to be vegetarian.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the perspective of the couple. They\u2019re making a personal choice that aligns with their dietary preferences and values. Weddings are personal events where couples should have the right to make decisions based on their lifestyle. But are there others' needs to consider here?\n\nThe question is whether they\u2019re wrong to exclude meat. The main argument against them could be that some guests might want to eat meat and not have a choice. But the couple isn't forcing anyone to eat what they don't want; they\u2019re just not serving meat. If the wedding is vegetarian, guests can choose to eat what's provided or bring their own. However, weddings typically have catered meals, so guests rely on the menu. So, if someone can't eat vegetarian, it might be an issue. But the couple has a right to their preferences too.\n\nAnother angle: maybe some guests might feel offended or uncomfortable, but the couple isn't imposing their views. They\u2019re just following their own beliefs. Also, the couple mentions they don't comment on others' choices, so they\u2019re respectful in other contexts. On their wedding day, they\u2019re within their right to set the menu as they see fit.\n\nI should also think about common practices. Many weddings have specific themes or dietary restrictions. It's common to have menus that exclude certain foods. For example, some weddings are vegan, all-vegetarian, or have specific cultural cuisines. So, there's a precedent for such choices.\n\nHowever, maybe the issue is about inclusivity. But the couple isn't excluding people based on their dietary choices. They\u2019re just not offering meat. If a guest can't eat vegetarian, that's their choice, but the couple isn't obligated to accommodate every guest's preference. It's their event, after all.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the couple is not in the wrong. They\u2019re making a personal choice for their own event, and they\u2019re not forcing anyone to eat anything. The answer should be B.\n"
