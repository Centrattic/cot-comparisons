      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who wants a vegetarian-only wedding is in the wrong. Let me think through this.\n\nFirst, the couple are strict vegetarians. They don't have issues with others eating meat, but they find the smell or look of it gross. They don't say anything when others eat around them, but on their wedding day, they want no meat. The question is if that's wrong (AITA).\n\nHmm. Well, weddings are personal events, and the couple usually has the right to decide the details. They're the ones getting married, so their preferences should be respected. But maybe some guests have dietary restrictions or preferences that need to be considered. But the couple isn't forcing anyone to eat vegetarian; they're just not serving meat. \n\nWait, the scenario says there are no meat options, but what if some guests can't eat vegetarian for medical or religious reasons? The couple should probably offer alternatives to accommodate those guests. However, the question is about whether they're in the wrong for not serving meat. If they provide vegetarian options and maybe some non-meat options (like fish?), but not beef or pork, that might be okay. But if they're serving only vegetarian and that excludes some guests, maybe they should consider that. However, the couple's comfort is also important. Their wedding day is about them, so it's their choice. \n\nThe key points here are: the couple's choice vs. guests' needs. Since they're the hosts, they can set the menu as they see fit. They might need to communicate clearly and offer alternatives, but the question is about being in the wrong. Since they're not forcing anyone to eat, and it's their event, they aren't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
