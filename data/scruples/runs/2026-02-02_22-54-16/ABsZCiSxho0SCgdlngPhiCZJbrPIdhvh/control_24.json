      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for having a vegetarian-only wedding. The situation is that both the author and their partner are strict vegetarians. They don't have a problem with others eating meat in general but find the smell or look of it gross. They don't comment on others eating around them, but on their wedding day, they want no meat options.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Weddings are personal events where the couple can set their own preferences. The author is not forcing guests to eat vegetarian; they're just choosing the menu based on their own dietary preferences and comfort. They also mention they don't comment on others eating meat otherwise, so it's not about imposing on others generally.\n\nPotential arguments against the author: Some guests might prefer meat and feel excluded. However, the couple has the right to make their event reflect their values. Also, providing vegetarian options exclusively doesn't prevent guests from bringing their own food, but that's not common. However, in most cases, guests eat what's provided, so maybe that's a point against.\n\nOn the other hand, the couple has the right to their own celebration. They can choose the menu as they see fit. It's their day, and they're not making guests eat meat; they're just not serving it. The key is that they're not forcing anyone to eat anything. The guests can choose to eat what's provided or not eat, but the couple isn't responsible for that choice.\n\nAlso, considering that the couple is strict vegetarians, having a vegetarian menu aligns with their lifestyle and comfort. They're not imposing their views on others by not serving meat; they're simply creating a space that suits them. The fact that they don't comment on others eating meat in other contexts shows they're respectful, so this isn't about being judgmental.\n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong. Their choice is a personal one for their event. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
