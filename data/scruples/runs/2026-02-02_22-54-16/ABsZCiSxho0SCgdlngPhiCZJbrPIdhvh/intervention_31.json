      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for having a vegetarian-only wedding reception. Both they and their partner are strict vegetarians. They don't have an issue with others eating meat in general but find the smell or look of it gross. They don't comment on others' choices but want their wedding day to be free of meat.\n\nSo, the question is whether they are at fault. The key points here are personal choice and respect for others. Weddings are personal events, and the couple should have the right to decide the menu based on their dietary preferences and values. Even though some guests might not eat vegetarian, the hosts aren't obligated to provide non-vegetarian options unless they have a specific reason to accommodate. Since they're not imposing their views on others but simply choosing their own celebration, it's reasonable. They also aren't forcing guests to eat vegetarian; they're just not serving meat. So, the answer is likely B, they're not in the wrong.\n"
