      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong. The situation is that they're planning a vegetarian wedding because both they and their partner are strict vegetarians. They don't have a problem with others eating meat in general, but they find the smell or look of it gross. They don't confront others about eating meat around them, but on their wedding day, they want to avoid it entirely. The question is whether they're in the wrong for not having any meat options at the reception.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical and social aspects here. The couple is making a personal choice based on their dietary preferences and comfort. They're not forcing others to be vegetarian, just ensuring their own event aligns with their values. It's their wedding, so they have the right to decide the menu. However, some might argue that guests have their own preferences, but the couple can provide vegetarian options which they are doing. They aren't excluding meat-eaters, just not serving meat. \n\nThe key points are that they are not judgmental, don't comment on others' choices, and are creating a space that's comfortable for them. Weddings are personal events where hosts can set their own rules. Serving only vegetarian food is a valid choice, especially when both hosts prefer it. The answer should be B (No), the author is not in the wrong. They have the right to make their wedding reflect their lifestyle and preferences without being shamed.\n"
