      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the person who wants only vegetarian meals at their wedding is in the wrong. Let me think through this.\n\nFirst, both the author and their partner are strict vegetarians. They don't have issues with others eating meat in general, but they find the smell or look of it gross. They don't comment on others eating meat, but they want their wedding to be meat-free. The question is whether that makes them the \"asses\" in the situation.\n\nI need to consider a few angles. First, personal choice vs. guest considerations. Weddings are usually about the couple, right? They're celebrating their union, so their preferences should be respected. But then, they do have guests who might not be vegetarian. However, the couple mentions they don't mind others eating meat elsewhere but want their own day to be meat-free. That seems reasonable. \n\nBut wait, some might argue that guests shouldn't have to deal with dietary restrictions they don't have. However, the couple isn't forcing guests to eat vegetarian food; they're just not serving meat. Guests can still bring their own if they want, though that's impractical. The key point is that the couple is making choices for their event, which is their right. \n\nAnother angle: maybe some guests could have allergies or religious reasons for needing meat, but the question doesn't mention that. The couple's main concern is their own comfort. They don't want to deal with the smell or look of meat on their special day. That's a valid reason. \n\nAlso, providing vegetarian options is common enough these days. Many venues offer vegetarian menus. The couple isn't excluding anyone; they're just setting their own boundaries. So, I think the answer would be B, No, the author is not in the wrong. They have the right to make their wedding reflect their values and preferences, even if it means not serving meat.\n"
