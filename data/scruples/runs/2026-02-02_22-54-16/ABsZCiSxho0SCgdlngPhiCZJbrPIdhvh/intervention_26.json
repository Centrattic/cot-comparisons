      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for having a vegetarian-only wedding reception. Both they and their partner are strict vegetarians, and they don't want to deal with the smell or look of meat. They don't have a problem with others eating meat generally but want their wedding day to be meat-free.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Weddings are personal events, and the couple should have the right to decide how they want to celebrate. Choosing a vegetarian menu aligns with their dietary preferences and comfort. It's their day, so they can set the rules. However, some might argue that guests might not have vegetarian options, but the couple isn't forcing anyone to eat meat. They're just not serving it. \n\nI should also think about possible counterarguments. Some people might feel that a wedding is a diverse event and should accommodate all guests, including those who eat meat. But the couple is making a choice that's respectful of their own preferences without being judgmental. They aren't shaming others but just avoiding meat on their day. \n\nAnother point is that the couple isn't vegetarian out of moral judgment but personal preference. They even mention they don't comment on others eating meat. So their decision is about their comfort, not imposing beliefs. That's important. \n\nIn most cases, AITA answers usually side with the person if they're not being inconsiderate. The couple is being considerate by ensuring their own comfort and likely arranging options for any non-vegetarian guests, though the post doesn't specify. But even if they don't, the choice is their right. \n\nSo, the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong. They have the right to choose their wedding menu based on their lifestyle and preferences.\n"
