      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for having a vegetarian-only wedding. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe couple are both strict vegetarians. They don't have a problem with others eating meat in general, but they find the smell or look of meat gross. They don't comment on others eating meat around them, but on their wedding day, they want the reception to be meat-free. The question is whether they're in the wrong (AITA) by not serving meat.\n\nFirst, I should consider the reasons they're doing this. They're vegetarians, so their dietary choice is personal and they're sticking to it. They mention they don't judge others for eating meat, just that on their special day, they want to avoid the associated smells or looks. So it's about their comfort on their own event.\n\nWeddings are personal events where the couple can set the tone and cater to their preferences. It's common for couples to make personal choices about the menu, even if it might inconvenience some guests. For example, some might have a specific theme or dietary restrictions they follow.\n\nHowever, there's a consideration for guests who might not be vegetarian. If they don't have meat options, those guests might not have a meal they can eat. But the couple hasn't mentioned that they're forcing guests to eat vegetarian; they're just not providing meat. If the menu is vegetarian, but guests can bring their own meat (though that's unlikely), but in reality, guests rely on the provided food. So the guests who can't eat vegetarian might be inconvenienced.\n\nBut the couple is making a choice based on their own comfort. It's their wedding, so they have the right to set the menu according to their preferences. It's similar to someone having a vegan wedding or a specific cultural cuisine. Unless there's a cultural expectation in their community to include meat, which might vary by region.\n\nAnother angle: the couple isn't trying to impose their beliefs on others, just avoiding meat themselves. They aren't criticizing others, just choosing their own event's menu. It's about their personal space and day. So while some guests might be inconvenienced, the couple isn't in the wrong for prioritizing their own needs on their special day.\n\nBut maybe some people would argue that a wedding is a big event with many guests, and you should accommodate as many as possible. However, it's also about the couple's preferences. It's a balance between their comfort and guests' needs. Since they can't please everyone, but their choice is reasonable given their own dietary restrictions and preferences.\n\nI think the key here is that they're not forcing others to be vegetarian, just not serving meat. They're being respectful of their own needs. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
