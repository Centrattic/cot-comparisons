      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wants to have a vegetarian-only wedding is in the wrong. The situation is that both the person and their partner are strict vegetarians. They don't have an issue with others eating meat in general but find the smell or look of it gross. They don't comment on others eating around them, but on their wedding day, they prefer no meat options. The question is whether they're at fault (AITA) for making the reception vegetarian only.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The couple is making a personal choice based on their dietary preferences and comfort. Weddings are personal events where the hosts can set the tone and rules. They\u2019re not forcing others to eat vegetarian food, just not serving meat. They're strict vegetarians, so this is their lifestyle. The concern is about whether this choice is unreasonable or if it's a valid personal decision.\n\nI should think about similar scenarios. For example, if someone has a food allergy and removes that from the menu, people generally accept that. Vegetarianism is a dietary choice, and if the couple is strict about it, they might not want meat served at their own event. Also, many weddings do have specific dietary options, like vegan, gluten-free, etc. So offering vegetarian-only is a valid choice here.\n\nAnother angle: the couple isn't imposing their beliefs on others. They\u2019re not saying others can't eat meat; they\u2019re just not serving it. Guests can bring their own if they want, but the wedding menu is set by the hosts. People usually expect the hosts to have some say in the menu, especially for a personal event like a wedding.\n\nPossible counterarguments: Some might say that guests might expect some meat options, especially if they\u2019re not vegetarian. But the couple has the right to set the menu as they see fit. Plus, they\u2019re not forcing guests to eat vegetarian; they\u2019re just not offering meat. If a guest has a problem with that, they can bring their own or find alternatives, but the hosts aren\u2019t responsible for that.\n\nAlso, the couple mentions they don\u2019t comment on others eating meat, so they\u2019re respectful of others' choices. Their wedding is their day, and making it vegetarian-only is a personal choice to avoid things they find unpleasant. It's similar to a family having a religious or cultural tradition that influences the menu.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). They have the right to choose their wedding menu based on their preferences and lifestyle without being in the wrong.\n"
