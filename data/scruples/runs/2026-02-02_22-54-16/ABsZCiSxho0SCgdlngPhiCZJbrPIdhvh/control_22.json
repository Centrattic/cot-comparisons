      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the person who wants a vegetarian-only wedding is in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the couple are strict vegetarians. They don't have an issue with others eating meat, but the smell or look of it bothers them. They don't comment on others eating meat, but on their wedding day, they want to avoid it. The question is whether it's wrong for the reception to have no meat options.\n\nI need to consider cultural norms and personal choices. Weddings are personal events, and the couple has the right to decide the menu. Vegetarian diets are common, and many people have dietary preferences, so it's reasonable to cater to their needs. The fact that they're not judging others but just want their own event to be comfortable is important. Some guests might not eat meat anyway, so it's a win-win. However, maybe some guests might expect meat, but the couple has the right to set their own preferences. So the answer is probably B, they're not in the wrong.\n"
