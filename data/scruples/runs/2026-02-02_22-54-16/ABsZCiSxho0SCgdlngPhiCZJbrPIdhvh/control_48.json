      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for having a vegetarian-only wedding reception. The couple are strict vegetarians and find the smell or look of meat gross. They don't comment on others eating meat in general but want their wedding day to be meat-free.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the reasoning. Weddings are personal events where the couple can make choices based on their preferences. Since both partners are vegetarian and it's their special day, it's reasonable they'd want the food to align with their values. However, guests might have dietary restrictions or preferences they rely on. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nI should think about common practices. Many weddings have dietary options, like vegetarian or gluten-free. It's standard to accommodate guests, but if the couple isn't forcing anyone to eat vegetarian, maybe it's okay. The key here is that the wedding is their day, and they can set the menu as they see fit. They're not excluding meat-eaters from eating meat elsewhere, just not serving it at their event. Also, they mention they don't comment on others eating meat, so it's not about judging guests. They just want their own comfort on the day. So the answer is likely B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
