Her body is changing. Had to do the bra shopping and all of that. \n\nAnyway, we keep our house really warm. She has a habit of walking around in just a tank top and underwear. Sometimes she just hangs around in a towel for hours after showering instead of getting dressed. \n\nIt\u2019s not a huge deal but I suggested to her that she should really start using her robe if she doesn\u2019t want to put something on. She asked why and I said it\u2019s not entirely appropriate to walk around half-dressed in front of her father now that she\u2019s a young woman. \n\nI am very direct when speaking and I think her feelings may have been hurt. My husband ended up walking in on the conversation and asked why she was pouty. She told him and he just looked at me and rolled his eyes, but he didn\u2019t say anything. I brought it up with him later and he was just like \u201ccan we talk about something else?\u201d Clearly he didn\u2019t want to have the conversation so I dropped it with him. As for my daughter, she\u2019s been fairly quiet today, which is unusual for her. \n\nWas I wrong to say something to her about this? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person is in the wrong for asking their 12-year-old daughter to dress more appropriately at home. The daughter is in puberty and has been wearing a tank top and underwear or a towel for hours. The parent mentioned it's not appropriate in front of her father and the daughter got upset. The husband didn't want to discuss it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural norms. In many societies, parents set boundaries for children's behavior, including clothing. Since the daughter is entering puberty, the parent might be trying to instill modesty or appropriate behavior. However, the approach is important. The parent was direct, which might have hurt the daughter's feelings. But the parent's concern is about body autonomy and setting boundaries.\n\nNext, the daughter's age. At 12, she's becoming more self-conscious. The parent's intervention could be about preparing her for societal expectations. However, the way it was communicated matters. Directness isn't always wrong, but if it's done without empathy, it can lead to conflict.\n\nThe husband's reaction suggests he might not see the issue, but that doesn't necessarily mean the parent is wrong. The parent might be addressing a real concern about the daughter's body image or privacy. The daughter's reaction (being quiet and pouty) indicates she felt hurt, which is a valid response. But the parent's intention was to correct behavior they see as inappropriate.\n\nIn terms of being in the wrong, the parent's motivation is about guidance and setting boundaries, which is a parent's role. However, the method could be improved. The parent might not be wrong in the intention but could have handled it more sensitively. The key is whether the parent is being unreasonable. Since the daughter is walking around in minimal clothing, the parent is not wrong in addressing it. The daughter's reaction is a sign that the approach could be adjusted, but the parent's stance itself isn't wrong. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
