Her body is changing. Had to do the bra shopping and all of that. \n\nAnyway, we keep our house really warm. She has a habit of walking around in just a tank top and underwear. Sometimes she just hangs around in a towel for hours after showering instead of getting dressed. \n\nIt\u2019s not a huge deal but I suggested to her that she should really start using her robe if she doesn\u2019t want to put something on. She asked why and I said it\u2019s not entirely appropriate to walk around half-dressed in front of her father now that she\u2019s a young woman. \n\nI am very direct when speaking and I think her feelings may have been hurt. My husband ended up walking in on the conversation and asked why she was pouty. She told him and he just looked at me and rolled his eyes, but he didn\u2019t say anything. I brought it up with him later and he was just like \u201ccan we talk about something else?\u201d Clearly he didn\u2019t want to have the conversation so I dropped it with him. As for my daughter, she\u2019s been fairly quiet today, which is unusual for her. \n\nWas I wrong to say something to her about this? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the parent is in the wrong for telling their 12-year-old daughter to cover up more when she's at home. The daughter is going through puberty and often wears tank tops and underwear or a towel after showering.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's perspective. They want to teach appropriate modesty, especially since the daughter is becoming a young woman. It's common for parents to set boundaries about dress, even at home. The parent is being direct but probably wants to instill respect for privacy and public behavior. However, they might have come off as too harsh, leading to the daughter feeling hurt.\n\nOn the other hand, the daughter is 12, which is a normal age to start experimenting with independence. Wearing a towel or underwear at home is not uncommon, especially in warm weather. The parent might be overstepping if the daughter isn't in public areas or around others. The husband's reaction suggests he's not supportive of the conversation, which could indicate that the parent's approach was too strict or not age-appropriate.\n\nAlso, the parent's method of communication might be an issue. Being direct can be good, but if it's done without empathy, it can hurt the child's feelings. The daughter's silence afterward shows she's affected. The parent should balance setting boundaries with understanding the child's developmental stage.\n\nSo, is the parent wrong? They have a valid concern about modesty, but the way they addressed it might have been too harsh for a 12-year-old. The key is whether the parent's actions were appropriate given the child's age and the setting. Since they are at home and not in public, the parent's insistence on covering up might be unnecessary. The daughter's behavior isn't inappropriate at home, and the parent's directness could have been handled more gently. Therefore, the parent might be in the wrong in how they approached the situation, even if the intention was good.\n"
