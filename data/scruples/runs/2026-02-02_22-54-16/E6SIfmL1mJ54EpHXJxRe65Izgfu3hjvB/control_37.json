Her body is changing. Had to do the bra shopping and all of that. \n\nAnyway, we keep our house really warm. She has a habit of walking around in just a tank top and underwear. Sometimes she just hangs around in a towel for hours after showering instead of getting dressed. \n\nIt\u2019s not a huge deal but I suggested to her that she should really start using her robe if she doesn\u2019t want to put something on. She asked why and I said it\u2019s not entirely appropriate to walk around half-dressed in front of her father now that she\u2019s a young woman. \n\nI am very direct when speaking and I think her feelings may have been hurt. My husband ended up walking in on the conversation and asked why she was pouty. She told him and he just looked at me and rolled his eyes, but he didn\u2019t say anything. I brought it up with him later and he was just like \u201ccan we talk about something else?\u201d Clearly he didn\u2019t want to have the conversation so I dropped it with him. As for my daughter, she\u2019s been fairly quiet today, which is unusual for her. \n\nWas I wrong to say something to her about this? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a parent telling their 12-year-old daughter to cover up more at home. The daughter is in puberty, so her body is changing, and she's been wearing tank tops and underwear or a towel around the house. The parent brought it up, explaining it's not appropriate now that she's a young woman. The daughter might be hurt, and the husband rolled his eyes but didn't engage.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age and cultural norms. In many cultures, it's common for parents to start setting boundaries around modesty as children enter puberty. The parent is trying to guide their daughter towards appropriate dress, which is a typical part of raising a daughter. However, the parent's approach was very direct, which might have hurt the daughter's feelings. The parent also didn't handle the situation smoothly with the husband, leading to the daughter being upset.\n\nThe key points here are: the parent's intention is to teach modesty, which is reasonable, but the method might be too harsh. The daughter is 12, which is young, so approaching her with sensitivity is important. The parent didn't consider the daughter's feelings and was too direct, possibly causing emotional harm. Also, the husband's reaction might indicate that the approach wasn't the best.\n\nOn the other hand, the parent isn't wrong for wanting to set boundaries. It's a common parental concern. But the way they communicated it could be improved. The daughter's reaction (being pouty and quiet) suggests she felt criticized, which might not be the best way to handle a sensitive topic. The parent should have framed the conversation in a more supportive way, explaining that it's about her comfort and developing a sense of modesty rather than just a rule.\n\nIn terms of being \"in the wrong,\" the parent's intentions are good, but the execution could be better. However, since the question is whether they are in the wrong, I need to decide if their actions, despite the approach, were inappropriate. Since cultural norms vary, but in many places, teaching a daughter about modesty isn't wrong. However, the parent's method of being very direct without considering the daughter's feelings might be seen as harsh, leading to the daughter being upset. So maybe the answer is that the parent isn't in the wrong, but their approach could be improved. But the question is if they are in the wrong. If the act of setting boundaries isn't wrong, then answer B (Not in the wrong). If the parent's approach was wrong because it hurt the daughter, then answer A. However, the parent's intent is to protect, so maybe the answer is B.\n"
