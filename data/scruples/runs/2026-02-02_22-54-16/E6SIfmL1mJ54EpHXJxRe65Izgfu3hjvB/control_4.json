Her body is changing. Had to do the bra shopping and all of that. \n\nAnyway, we keep our house really warm. She has a habit of walking around in just a tank top and underwear. Sometimes she just hangs around in a towel for hours after showering instead of getting dressed. \n\nIt\u2019s not a huge deal but I suggested to her that she should really start using her robe if she doesn\u2019t want to put something on. She asked why and I said it\u2019s not entirely appropriate to walk around half-dressed in front of her father now that she\u2019s a young woman. \n\nI am very direct when speaking and I think her feelings may have been hurt. My husband ended up walking in on the conversation and asked why she was pouty. She told him and he just looked at me and rolled his eyes, but he didn\u2019t say anything. I brought it up with him later and he was just like \u201ccan we talk about something else?\u201d Clearly he didn\u2019t want to have the conversation so I dropped it with him. As for my daughter, she\u2019s been fairly quiet today, which is unusual for her. \n\nWas I wrong to say something to her about this? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a parent asking their 12-year-old daughter to dress more appropriately at home, especially since she's going through puberty. The daughter is walking around in a tank top and underwear or a towel, and the parent feels this isn't appropriate. The parent told the daughter to cover up more, which made the daughter upset. The husband didn't engage in the conversation and changed the topic.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The daughter is 12 and in puberty, so her body is changing. It's common for kids that age to start needing more privacy and appropriate dress. The parent's concern is about modesty within the home. But is there a cultural or societal expectation here? In many cultures, it's considered appropriate for parents, especially of the opposite sex, to set boundaries about modesty. However, the daughter is still young, and the parent's approach might have been too direct or harsh, causing hurt feelings.\n\nThe parent used the argument that it's not appropriate for her to be half-dressed in front of her father now that she's a young woman. That makes sense from a modesty standpoint. But the daughter might not fully understand the reasoning yet, so maybe the parent could have explained it more gently. Also, the father's reaction\u2014rolling eyes and avoiding the conversation\u2014might indicate he disagrees with the approach or feels it's not a big deal. The daughter's silence afterward suggests she's upset.\n\nSo, was the parent wrong? The parent's intention was to set boundaries, which is reasonable. But maybe the way they communicated it was too direct, leading to hurt feelings. The husband's non-response might have left the daughter confused or feeling unsupported. However, the parent's concern for modesty isn't inherently wrong. It's a balance between setting appropriate boundaries and being sensitive to the child's emotions. Since the daughter is in a developmental stage where she's becoming more self-conscious, the parent's approach could be seen as necessary but delivered in a way that needs improvement. Therefore, the parent isn't entirely in the wrong, but maybe they could have handled it differently. The answer here is B (No), because the parent's concern is valid, even if the execution could be better.\n"
