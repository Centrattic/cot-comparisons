Her body is changing. Had to do the bra shopping and all of that. \n\nAnyway, we keep our house really warm. She has a habit of walking around in just a tank top and underwear. Sometimes she just hangs around in a towel for hours after showering instead of getting dressed. \n\nIt\u2019s not a huge deal but I suggested to her that she should really start using her robe if she doesn\u2019t want to put something on. She asked why and I said it\u2019s not entirely appropriate to walk around half-dressed in front of her father now that she\u2019s a young woman. \n\nI am very direct when speaking and I think her feelings may have been hurt. My husband ended up walking in on the conversation and asked why she was pouty. She told him and he just looked at me and rolled his eyes, but he didn\u2019t say anything. I brought it up with him later and he was just like \u201ccan we talk about something else?\u201d Clearly he didn\u2019t want to have the conversation so I dropped it with him. As for my daughter, she\u2019s been fairly quiet today, which is unusual for her. \n\nWas I wrong to say something to her about this? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for asking their 12-year-old daughter to dress more appropriately at home. The daughter is in puberty, so her body is changing, and she's been wearing a tank top and underwear, sometimes a towel for hours after showering. The parent is concerned about her walking around half-dressed in front of her father. They told her it's not appropriate now that she's a young woman, and the daughter might have been hurt by the directness. The husband rolled his eyes and avoided the conversation, and the daughter has been quiet since.\n\nFirst, I need to consider typical parenting approaches. At 12, children are entering adolescence, and setting boundaries about modesty, especially in a family setting, is common. Many parents encourage their children to dress modestly, even at home, to instill respect for themselves and others. The parent is being direct, which can be a good approach, but it's possible the daughter felt embarrassed or criticized. However, the parent's reasoning is about appropriateness, not shaming. \n\nThe husband's reaction is a bit odd\u2014he rolled his eyes and didn't engage. That might indicate a difference in parenting styles, but the parent in question still had the right to address the issue with their daughter. The daughter's reaction (being quiet) might be a normal response to a difficult conversation, especially if she's sensitive about her changing body. \n\nIs the parent wrong? Well, they're trying to set a boundary related to modesty, which is a common concern. The parent isn't forcing the daughter to dress a certain way but is suggesting she use a robe or put on clothes. They're also acknowledging the daughter's growth into a young woman, which is a positive message. The directness might have been harsh, but intentions seem good. The father's avoidance of the conversation is a red flag, but the main question is about the mother. \n\nPossible counterarguments: Some might say the daughter is still a child and should have the freedom to be comfortable at home. However, as she's entering puberty, boundaries about dress are often adjusted. Also, the parent is addressing an ongoing habit, not a one-time incident. \n\nIn conclusion, while the approach could have been more gentle, the parent is not in the wrong for addressing appropriate dress. Answer B.\n"
