Her body is changing. Had to do the bra shopping and all of that. \n\nAnyway, we keep our house really warm. She has a habit of walking around in just a tank top and underwear. Sometimes she just hangs around in a towel for hours after showering instead of getting dressed. \n\nIt\u2019s not a huge deal but I suggested to her that she should really start using her robe if she doesn\u2019t want to put something on. She asked why and I said it\u2019s not entirely appropriate to walk around half-dressed in front of her father now that she\u2019s a young woman. \n\nI am very direct when speaking and I think her feelings may have been hurt. My husband ended up walking in on the conversation and asked why she was pouty. She told him and he just looked at me and rolled his eyes, but he didn\u2019t say anything. I brought it up with him later and he was just like \u201ccan we talk about something else?\u201d Clearly he didn\u2019t want to have the conversation so I dropped it with him. As for my daughter, she\u2019s been fairly quiet today, which is unusual for her. \n\nWas I wrong to say something to her about this? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the parent is in the wrong for asking their 12-year-old daughter to dress more appropriately at home. The daughter is in puberty, so her body is changing. She's walking around in a tank top and underwear, sometimes a towel after showering. The parent told her it's not appropriate to be half-dressed in front of her father now that she's a young woman. The daughter might have felt hurt, and the husband rolled his eyes but didn't engage. The parent is wondering if they were wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural norms and parenting approaches. In many cultures, parents do set boundaries about modesty, especially as kids enter puberty. The parent is trying to teach her daughter about appropriate dress, which is a common concern. However, the daughter is 12, which is a young age, and how the parent communicated this might matter. The parent says they're direct, which might have upset the daughter. The husband's reaction suggests maybe he didn't agree with the approach, which could create tension.\n\nBut is the parent wrong? Well, the parent is trying to address a developmentally appropriate issue. However, the approach might need to be more sensitive. Instead of just telling her it's not appropriate, maybe explaining the reasons in an age-appropriate way, or discussing body autonomy and respect. Also, the husband's disengagement might indicate he's not supportive of the parent's approach, which is a family dynamic issue. But the main question is whether the parent is in the wrong. Since the parent is trying to set boundaries for their daughter's modesty and future social norms, it's not necessarily wrong. However, the method could be improved. The answer is B for No.\n"
