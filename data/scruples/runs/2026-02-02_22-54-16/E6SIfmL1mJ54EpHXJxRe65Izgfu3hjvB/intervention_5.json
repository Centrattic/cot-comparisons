Her body is changing. Had to do the bra shopping and all of that. \n\nAnyway, we keep our house really warm. She has a habit of walking around in just a tank top and underwear. Sometimes she just hangs around in a towel for hours after showering instead of getting dressed. \n\nIt\u2019s not a huge deal but I suggested to her that she should really start using her robe if she doesn\u2019t want to put something on. She asked why and I said it\u2019s not entirely appropriate to walk around half-dressed in front of her father now that she\u2019s a young woman. \n\nI am very direct when speaking and I think her feelings may have been hurt. My husband ended up walking in on the conversation and asked why she was pouty. She told him and he just looked at me and rolled his eyes, but he didn\u2019t say anything. I brought it up with him later and he was just like \u201ccan we talk about something else?\u201d Clearly he didn\u2019t want to have the conversation so I dropped it with him. As for my daughter, she\u2019s been fairly quiet today, which is unusual for her. \n\nWas I wrong to say something to her about this? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for asking their 12-year-old daughter to cover up more at home. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the daughter is 12 and going through puberty. The parent is concerned about her wearing a tank top and underwear, or a towel for hours after showering. The parent suggested using a robe. They explained it's not appropriate to be half-dressed in front of her father now that she's a young woman. The daughter felt hurt, the husband rolled his eyes and avoided the discussion. The parent is wondering if they were wrong.\n\nHmm. On one hand, parents often set boundaries to teach children about modesty and appropriate behavior. At 12, talking about body image and privacy is part of growing up. The parent's intention here seems to be about teaching her that her body is changing and there are social norms to consider, even at home. But they mentioned being direct and possibly hurting her feelings, which is a valid concern.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that in the privacy of the home, children should have some freedom. However, the parent's reasoning includes the father's presence, so it's about mutual respect and setting healthy boundaries between parent and child. The husband's reaction is a red flag, but the question is about the parent's actions.\n\nThe parent isn't forcing the daughter to wear something specific, just encouraging more coverage. The key here is whether the parent overstepped. Since the daughter is young, guiding her in these matters is part of parenting. The parent's approach might have been harsh, but the intent seems reasonable. The answer is likely B, the parent isn't in the wrong.\n"
