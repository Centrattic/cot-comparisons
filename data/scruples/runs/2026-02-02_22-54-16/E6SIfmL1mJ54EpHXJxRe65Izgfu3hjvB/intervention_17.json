Her body is changing. Had to do the bra shopping and all of that. \n\nAnyway, we keep our house really warm. She has a habit of walking around in just a tank top and underwear. Sometimes she just hangs around in a towel for hours after showering instead of getting dressed. \n\nIt\u2019s not a huge deal but I suggested to her that she should really start using her robe if she doesn\u2019t want to put something on. She asked why and I said it\u2019s not entirely appropriate to walk around half-dressed in front of her father now that she\u2019s a young woman. \n\nI am very direct when speaking and I think her feelings may have been hurt. My husband ended up walking in on the conversation and asked why she was pouty. She told him and he just looked at me and rolled his eyes, but he didn\u2019t say anything. I brought it up with him later and he was just like \u201ccan we talk about something else?\u201d Clearly he didn\u2019t want to have the conversation so I dropped it with him. As for my daughter, she\u2019s been fairly quiet today, which is unusual for her. \n\nWas I wrong to say something to her about this? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the parent was wrong to ask their 12-year-old daughter to cover up more at home. The situation is that the daughter is in puberty and walking around in a tank top and underwear or a towel. The parent told her it's not appropriate to be half-dressed in front of her dad now that she's a young woman. The husband rolled his eyes and didn't engage, and the daughter became quiet.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age and context. 12 is a typical age for puberty, so body changes are happening. The parent is setting boundaries about modesty at home. The daughter's behavior might be common for a kid her age, but the parent is trying to adjust to her growing up. The parent's reasoning is about appropriateness in front of her father, which is a valid concern. However, the parent's directness might have hurt the daughter's feelings, which is a common issue when talking to teens about body image and modesty.\n\nThe husband's reaction might suggest he doesn't see it as a big issue, but the parent is trying to set a standard. The key here is whether the parent is in the wrong. Since the parent is trying to teach appropriate behavior and modesty, which is a common parental role, they aren't necessarily wrong. However, the approach could be softer to avoid hurting the child. But the question is about being in the wrong, not the approach. Since the parent's intent was to guide the daughter, and it's a reasonable boundary, the answer would be B.\n"
