Her body is changing. Had to do the bra shopping and all of that. \n\nAnyway, we keep our house really warm. She has a habit of walking around in just a tank top and underwear. Sometimes she just hangs around in a towel for hours after showering instead of getting dressed. \n\nIt\u2019s not a huge deal but I suggested to her that she should really start using her robe if she doesn\u2019t want to put something on. She asked why and I said it\u2019s not entirely appropriate to walk around half-dressed in front of her father now that she\u2019s a young woman. \n\nI am very direct when speaking and I think her feelings may have been hurt. My husband ended up walking in on the conversation and asked why she was pouty. She told him and he just looked at me and rolled his eyes, but he didn\u2019t say anything. I brought it up with him later and he was just like \u201ccan we talk about something else?\u201d Clearly he didn\u2019t want to have the conversation so I dropped it with him. As for my daughter, she\u2019s been fairly quiet today, which is unusual for her. \n\nWas I wrong to say something to her about this? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for asking their 12-year-old daughter to cover up more at home. The parent's reasoning is that the daughter is going through puberty and they want to instill modesty, considering their presence as a father.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The daughter is 12, which is a typical age for puberty to start. The parent is concerned about her walking around in a tank top and underwear, which they find inappropriate given her new status as a young woman. The parent is direct and mentioned the father's presence, which might be a cultural or personal boundary they're setting.\n\nThe husband's reaction\u2014rolling his eyes and avoiding the conversation\u2014could indicate differing views on the matter. The daughter's pouting suggests she felt hurt, which the parent might have caused by being too direct. However, the parent's intention is to teach modesty, which is a common parental concern.\n\nNow, whether the parent is in the wrong. On one hand, teaching modesty and setting boundaries is part of parenting. On the other, the approach might have been too harsh, leading to hurt feelings. The key is whether the parent crossed a line. Since they're discussing appropriateness in front of the father, it's about respect and setting healthy boundaries. The parent isn't forcing clothing but suggesting alternatives like a robe. The daughter's age and the situation seem to support the parent's stance. However, the method of communication might be an issue\u2014being too direct without considering the daughter's feelings. But the parent isn't in the wrong for the content of the message, even if the delivery could be improved. The answer likely leans towards Not in the wrong (B).\n"
