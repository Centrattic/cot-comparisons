Her body is changing. Had to do the bra shopping and all of that. \n\nAnyway, we keep our house really warm. She has a habit of walking around in just a tank top and underwear. Sometimes she just hangs around in a towel for hours after showering instead of getting dressed. \n\nIt\u2019s not a huge deal but I suggested to her that she should really start using her robe if she doesn\u2019t want to put something on. She asked why and I said it\u2019s not entirely appropriate to walk around half-dressed in front of her father now that she\u2019s a young woman. \n\nI am very direct when speaking and I think her feelings may have been hurt. My husband ended up walking in on the conversation and asked why she was pouty. She told him and he just looked at me and rolled his eyes, but he didn\u2019t say anything. I brought it up with him later and he was just like \u201ccan we talk about something else?\u201d Clearly he didn\u2019t want to have the conversation so I dropped it with him. As for my daughter, she\u2019s been fairly quiet today, which is unusual for her. \n\nWas I wrong to say something to her about this? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for asking their 12-year-old daughter to dress more appropriately at home. The daughter is in puberty, which involves physical changes and a natural curiosity about her body. The parent mentions that the house is kept warm, so maybe the daughter feels more comfortable in less clothing. However, the parent is addressing the daughter's choice to wear a tank top and underwear or a towel for extended periods, which the parent finds inappropriate now that the daughter is a \"young woman.\"\n\nThe parent approached the situation directly, explaining that it's not appropriate to be half-dressed in front of the father. The daughter's reaction was hurt feelings, and the husband avoided the conversation. The user thinks the parent isn't wrong, but wants to know if that's the case.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the cultural and social norms regarding children's privacy and modesty at home. In many cultures, parents do set boundaries around clothing choices, especially as children enter adolescence. The parent's intention here seems to be about teaching modesty and appropriate behavior in a mixed-gender household. The daughter is 12, so she's becoming aware of her body and societal expectations, which can be a sensitive time.\n\nThe parent's approach was direct, which might have hurt the daughter's feelings. However, the parent's concern is valid because as children grow, parents often adjust boundaries. The husband's reaction might indicate that he disagrees or doesn't want to engage, but the parent still has a right to set their own standards. The key points are whether the parent overstepped or if setting these boundaries is reasonable.\n\nThe daughter's behavior isn't illegal or harmful; it's about personal choice and family norms. The parent is trying to prepare her for societal expectations, which is part of parenting. However, the method could be improved\u2014maybe approaching it with more empathy to avoid hurting her feelings. But in terms of being \"in the wrong,\" the parent is enforcing family rules, which is their role. So the answer would be B, the parent isn't in the wrong, but could adjust their approach.\n"
