Her body is changing. Had to do the bra shopping and all of that. \n\nAnyway, we keep our house really warm. She has a habit of walking around in just a tank top and underwear. Sometimes she just hangs around in a towel for hours after showering instead of getting dressed. \n\nIt\u2019s not a huge deal but I suggested to her that she should really start using her robe if she doesn\u2019t want to put something on. She asked why and I said it\u2019s not entirely appropriate to walk around half-dressed in front of her father now that she\u2019s a young woman. \n\nI am very direct when speaking and I think her feelings may have been hurt. My husband ended up walking in on the conversation and asked why she was pouty. She told him and he just looked at me and rolled his eyes, but he didn\u2019t say anything. I brought it up with him later and he was just like \u201ccan we talk about something else?\u201d Clearly he didn\u2019t want to have the conversation so I dropped it with him. As for my daughter, she\u2019s been fairly quiet today, which is unusual for her. \n\nWas I wrong to say something to her about this? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the parent is wrong for asking their 12-year-old daughter to cover up more at home. The daughter is in puberty, wearing tank tops and underwear, sometimes a towel for hours. The parent told her it's not appropriate to be half-dressed in front of her father now that she's a young woman. The husband didn't support the conversation and changed the subject. The daughter is upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural norms. Many people feel that even at home, modesty matters, especially with the opposite parent. But others might think it's okay for kids to be comfortable at home. The daughter is 12, so she's entering adolescence. Parents often set boundaries around dress, especially as kids mature. However, the approach matters. The parent was direct, which might have hurt the daughter's feelings. The husband's reaction suggests he didn't support the conversation, which could affect the family dynamics.\n\nIs the parent wrong? Well, wanting to set boundaries is reasonable. But the way they did it might have been too harsh. Maybe the parent should have explained more gently or considered the daughter's feelings. The daughter is in a sensitive age where body image is important. The parent's intention is to teach modesty, but the method could be improved. However, the core issue of setting appropriate dress standards isn't necessarily wrong. So the answer might be B (not wrong), but there's room for a better approach. The parent isn't in the wrong for the request itself, but the delivery could be better. Since the question is whether they are in the wrong, the answer is B.\n"
