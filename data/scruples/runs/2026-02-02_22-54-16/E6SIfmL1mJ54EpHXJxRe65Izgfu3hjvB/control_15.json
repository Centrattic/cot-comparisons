Her body is changing. Had to do the bra shopping and all of that. \n\nAnyway, we keep our house really warm. She has a habit of walking around in just a tank top and underwear. Sometimes she just hangs around in a towel for hours after showering instead of getting dressed. \n\nIt\u2019s not a huge deal but I suggested to her that she should really start using her robe if she doesn\u2019t want to put something on. She asked why and I said it\u2019s not entirely appropriate to walk around half-dressed in front of her father now that she\u2019s a young woman. \n\nI am very direct when speaking and I think her feelings may have been hurt. My husband ended up walking in on the conversation and asked why she was pouty. She told him and he just looked at me and rolled his eyes, but he didn\u2019t say anything. I brought it up with him later and he was just like \u201ccan we talk about something else?\u201d Clearly he didn\u2019t want to have the conversation so I dropped it with him. As for my daughter, she\u2019s been fairly quiet today, which is unusual for her. \n\nWas I wrong to say something to her about this? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the parent is wrong for asking their 12-year-old daughter to cover up more at home. The daughter is in puberty, so her body is changing, and she's been wearing a tank top and underwear or a towel around the house. The parent told her it's not appropriate to be half-dressed in front of her father now that she's a young woman. The dad didn't back her up and changed the subject.\n\nHmm, first, I need to consider cultural norms. In many cultures, parents set boundaries about modesty, even at home. But at 12, the daughter is becoming a teenager, so there might be a balance between guiding her and respecting her emerging independence. The parent's reasoning is about respect and appropriateness, especially around the father. But was the way she approached it too harsh? She was direct and maybe hurt her daughter's feelings. The husband's reaction suggests he didn't agree with the approach or the topic being discussed. \n\nAlso, the daughter's behavior of wearing a towel for hours might be a habit, so maybe the parent could have approached it differently, like setting a rule gradually instead of a sudden correction. However, it's also about teaching her about body autonomy and societal expectations. \n\nThe key points are: Is setting a boundary wrong? Probably not. But the method and communication style might be an issue. The parent might not be in the wrong, but could have handled it more sensitively. The answer might be B (No), but with the caveat that the approach could be improved. However, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong, so considering standard parenting practices, setting such boundaries is typical. The husband's reaction is more about not wanting to engage, which is his own issue. The parent's action was not wrong.\n"
