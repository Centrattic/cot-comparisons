Her body is changing. Had to do the bra shopping and all of that. \n\nAnyway, we keep our house really warm. She has a habit of walking around in just a tank top and underwear. Sometimes she just hangs around in a towel for hours after showering instead of getting dressed. \n\nIt\u2019s not a huge deal but I suggested to her that she should really start using her robe if she doesn\u2019t want to put something on. She asked why and I said it\u2019s not entirely appropriate to walk around half-dressed in front of her father now that she\u2019s a young woman. \n\nI am very direct when speaking and I think her feelings may have been hurt. My husband ended up walking in on the conversation and asked why she was pouty. She told him and he just looked at me and rolled his eyes, but he didn\u2019t say anything. I brought it up with him later and he was just like \u201ccan we talk about something else?\u201d Clearly he didn\u2019t want to have the conversation so I dropped it with him. As for my daughter, she\u2019s been fairly quiet today, which is unusual for her. \n\nWas I wrong to say something to her about this? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the parent is wrong for asking their 12-year-old daughter to dress more appropriately at home. The daughter is going through puberty and tends to wear very little around the house, like a tank top and underwear or a towel. The parent told her it's not appropriate to be half-dressed in front of her father now that she's a young woman. The husband didn't seem supportive and changed the subject.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age and the context. At 12, kids are entering puberty, and parents often start setting boundaries about modesty. The parent is addressing the daughter's behavior, which could be about teaching appropriate dress even at home. The parent's reasoning is about respect and appropriateness, which is a common parental concern. However, the daughter might feel embarrassed or that her privacy is being invaded. The husband's reaction might suggest he sees it as a minor issue or maybe isn't on the same page with the parent's approach.\n\nThe key is whether the parent's action was wrong. The parent was direct but possibly hurt the daughter's feelings. However, the parent's intent seems to be about setting appropriate boundaries. The husband's dismissal of the issue might indicate a different perspective, but that doesn't necessarily make the parent wrong. In many cultures, parents do set such boundaries, so the parent might not be in the wrong. The daughter's reaction could be typical of her age, being sensitive. So, the answer is probably B (not in the wrong), but I need to check if there's any aspect where the parent overstepped. Since the parent was trying to teach modesty and the daughter's actions might not be harmful, but the parent's approach was direct, it's a judgment call. I think B is the right choice here.\n"
