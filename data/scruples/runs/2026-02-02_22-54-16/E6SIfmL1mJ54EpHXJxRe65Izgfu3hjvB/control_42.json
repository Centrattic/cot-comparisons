Her body is changing. Had to do the bra shopping and all of that. \n\nAnyway, we keep our house really warm. She has a habit of walking around in just a tank top and underwear. Sometimes she just hangs around in a towel for hours after showering instead of getting dressed. \n\nIt\u2019s not a huge deal but I suggested to her that she should really start using her robe if she doesn\u2019t want to put something on. She asked why and I said it\u2019s not entirely appropriate to walk around half-dressed in front of her father now that she\u2019s a young woman. \n\nI am very direct when speaking and I think her feelings may have been hurt. My husband ended up walking in on the conversation and asked why she was pouty. She told him and he just looked at me and rolled his eyes, but he didn\u2019t say anything. I brought it up with him later and he was just like \u201ccan we talk about something else?\u201d Clearly he didn\u2019t want to have the conversation so I dropped it with him. As for my daughter, she\u2019s been fairly quiet today, which is unusual for her. \n\nWas I wrong to say something to her about this? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the parent did the wrong thing by asking their 12-year-old daughter to cover up more at home. The parent mentions that the daughter is in puberty and has been walking around in a tank top and underwear or a towel for hours. The parent explained it's not appropriate, but the daughter got upset, and the husband didn't want to discuss it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age and context. A 12-year-old is entering adolescence, so body image and privacy are important. The parent is concerned about modesty in the house, especially with the father around. The parent was direct, which might have hurt the daughter's feelings. The husband's reaction suggests he might not see the issue, but the parent's intention was to set boundaries.\n\nIs the parent in the wrong? Well, setting boundaries around appropriate attire at home is reasonable. However, the approach might have been too abrupt. The parent should have considered the daughter's feelings more, maybe approached it with more empathy. The daughter is old enough to understand the conversation, but the way it was delivered might have been harsh. The husband's avoidance could indicate differing views on the matter.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, there's a balance between teaching modesty and respecting a child's growing autonomy. The parent's intention is valid, but the method might need adjustment. So, the answer might be B (No), but there's room for improvement in communication. However, if the daughter's behavior isn't affecting others and the parent's approach was hurtful, maybe A (Yes). But given the context, B seems more appropriate because the parent's concern is legitimate, even if the delivery could be better.\n"
