Her body is changing. Had to do the bra shopping and all of that. \n\nAnyway, we keep our house really warm. She has a habit of walking around in just a tank top and underwear. Sometimes she just hangs around in a towel for hours after showering instead of getting dressed. \n\nIt\u2019s not a huge deal but I suggested to her that she should really start using her robe if she doesn\u2019t want to put something on. She asked why and I said it\u2019s not entirely appropriate to walk around half-dressed in front of her father now that she\u2019s a young woman. \n\nI am very direct when speaking and I think her feelings may have been hurt. My husband ended up walking in on the conversation and asked why she was pouty. She told him and he just looked at me and rolled his eyes, but he didn\u2019t say anything. I brought it up with him later and he was just like \u201ccan we talk about something else?\u201d Clearly he didn\u2019t want to have the conversation so I dropped it with him. As for my daughter, she\u2019s been fairly quiet today, which is unusual for her. \n\nWas I wrong to say something to her about this? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the parent is wrong for telling their 12-year-old daughter to cover up more at home. The daughter is in puberty, so her body is changing. The parent mentioned the house is warm, and the daughter often wears just a tank top and underwear or a towel after showering. The parent tried to explain that it's not appropriate for her to be half-dressed in front of her dad now that she's a young woman. The daughter got upset, and the husband didn't support the conversation, avoiding it.\n\nFirst, the parent's intention seems to be about setting boundaries and teaching appropriate behavior. At 12, puberty is a natural time for such discussions. The parent is trying to prepare the daughter for societal norms regarding modesty. However, the approach might be too direct, causing hurt feelings. The parent's husband didn't support the approach, which could affect the daughter's perception of the message's validity.\n\nBut considering the daughter's age, it's reasonable for parents to discuss body autonomy and modesty. The parent isn't punishing her but teaching. The issue might be the delivery\u2014being too harsh. The parent might have handled it more gently, maybe by having a private conversation without the husband interrupting. The husband's reaction could undermine the parent's efforts, but the parent isn't entirely at fault here. The parent's concern is valid, so the answer is probably B. They're not wrong, but could have approached it differently.\n"
