Her body is changing. Had to do the bra shopping and all of that. \n\nAnyway, we keep our house really warm. She has a habit of walking around in just a tank top and underwear. Sometimes she just hangs around in a towel for hours after showering instead of getting dressed. \n\nIt\u2019s not a huge deal but I suggested to her that she should really start using her robe if she doesn\u2019t want to put something on. She asked why and I said it\u2019s not entirely appropriate to walk around half-dressed in front of her father now that she\u2019s a young woman. \n\nI am very direct when speaking and I think her feelings may have been hurt. My husband ended up walking in on the conversation and asked why she was pouty. She told him and he just looked at me and rolled his eyes, but he didn\u2019t say anything. I brought it up with him later and he was just like \u201ccan we talk about something else?\u201d Clearly he didn\u2019t want to have the conversation so I dropped it with him. As for my daughter, she\u2019s been fairly quiet today, which is unusual for her. \n\nWas I wrong to say something to her about this? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for asking their 12-year-old daughter to cover up more at home. The daughter is going through puberty, which is a natural time for body changes. The parent mentions that the house is kept warm, and the daughter often wears a tank top and underwear or a towel for long periods. The parent tried to explain that it's not appropriate for her to be half-dressed in front of her father now that she's a young woman. The husband didn't support the conversation and avoided it, making the situation more tense.\n\nFirst, the parent's intention seems to be about setting appropriate boundaries regarding modesty at home. It's a common concern when children enter puberty. However, the approach might have been too direct, possibly hurting the daughter's feelings. The daughter's reaction (being pouty and quiet) suggests she was upset. The parent acknowledges being direct, which might not have been the best way to handle the situation with a 12-year-old who is sensitive during this stage.\n\nThe father's lack of support complicates things. The parent might feel isolated in their concern, but it's also important to consider the daughter's emotional state. While the parent's intent is good, the method and the husband's reaction could have been handled better. The key is whether the parent's actions were reasonable. Since the parent is trying to instill modesty and appropriate behavior, and given that the daughter is in a developmental stage where such guidance is typical, the parent isn't necessarily in the wrong. However, the approach might need adjustment for sensitivity. So the answer is B (not in the wrong), but with the note that communication could improve.\n"
