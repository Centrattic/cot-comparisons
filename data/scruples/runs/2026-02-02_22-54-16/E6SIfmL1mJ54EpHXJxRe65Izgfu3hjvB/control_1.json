Her body is changing. Had to do the bra shopping and all of that. \n\nAnyway, we keep our house really warm. She has a habit of walking around in just a tank top and underwear. Sometimes she just hangs around in a towel for hours after showering instead of getting dressed. \n\nIt\u2019s not a huge deal but I suggested to her that she should really start using her robe if she doesn\u2019t want to put something on. She asked why and I said it\u2019s not entirely appropriate to walk around half-dressed in front of her father now that she\u2019s a young woman. \n\nI am very direct when speaking and I think her feelings may have been hurt. My husband ended up walking in on the conversation and asked why she was pouty. She told him and he just looked at me and rolled his eyes, but he didn\u2019t say anything. I brought it up with him later and he was just like \u201ccan we talk about something else?\u201d Clearly he didn\u2019t want to have the conversation so I dropped it with him. As for my daughter, she\u2019s been fairly quiet today, which is unusual for her. \n\nWas I wrong to say something to her about this? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the parent is wrong for asking their 12-year-old daughter to dress more modestly at home. The daughter is going through puberty, which is a natural stage. The parent mentions that she walks around in a tank top and underwear, or a towel for hours after showering. The parent told her it's not appropriate to be half-dressed in front of her father now that she's a young woman. The husband didn't support the conversation, which might be a factor.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural and societal norms around modesty. In some families, it's common to dress a certain way even at home, especially as children grow. However, others are more relaxed. The parent is acting out of what they perceive as appropriateness, but maybe the daughter is within her rights to be comfortable at home. At 12, children are becoming more aware of their bodies and privacy, so the parent's approach might affect the daughter's self-esteem or sense of autonomy.\n\nThe parent's direct approach might have been harsh, causing the daughter to be upset. The husband's reaction (rolling eyes) suggests he might not agree with the parent's stance, which could create tension. The daughter's silence afterward indicates she's hurt, which is a red flag. It's possible the parent is trying to set boundaries, but the method might be inappropriate. The father's lack of support complicates the situation further.\n\nI should also consider if the daughter's behavior is typical for her age. Walking around in a towel is common for kids, even as they go through puberty. The parent's concern might be overstepping, especially if the daughter isn't aware of societal norms yet. But the parent's intention is to teach appropriateness. The key issue is whether the parent's actions were necessary or if they were being overly strict. The daughter's reaction suggests that the parent's way of handling it was problematic, leading to hurt feelings. Therefore, the parent might be in the wrong for not handling the situation more sensitively.\n"
