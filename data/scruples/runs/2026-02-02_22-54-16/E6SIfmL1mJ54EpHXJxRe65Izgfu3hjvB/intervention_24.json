Her body is changing. Had to do the bra shopping and all of that. \n\nAnyway, we keep our house really warm. She has a habit of walking around in just a tank top and underwear. Sometimes she just hangs around in a towel for hours after showering instead of getting dressed. \n\nIt\u2019s not a huge deal but I suggested to her that she should really start using her robe if she doesn\u2019t want to put something on. She asked why and I said it\u2019s not entirely appropriate to walk around half-dressed in front of her father now that she\u2019s a young woman. \n\nI am very direct when speaking and I think her feelings may have been hurt. My husband ended up walking in on the conversation and asked why she was pouty. She told him and he just looked at me and rolled his eyes, but he didn\u2019t say anything. I brought it up with him later and he was just like \u201ccan we talk about something else?\u201d Clearly he didn\u2019t want to have the conversation so I dropped it with him. As for my daughter, she\u2019s been fairly quiet today, which is unusual for her. \n\nWas I wrong to say something to her about this? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a parent asking their 12-year-old daughter to dress more appropriately at home. The daughter is in puberty and has been wearing a tank top and underwear or a towel around the house. The parent told her it's not appropriate to be half-dressed in front of her father now that she's a young woman. The husband didn't support the conversation, and the daughter has been quiet.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's perspective. They're trying to teach their daughter about modesty and appropriate behavior, especially around family members. At 12, puberty is starting, so body image and privacy become important topics. The parent's intention seems to be about setting boundaries and guiding their daughter into appropriate self-presentation as she grows.\n\nOn the other hand, the daughter's autonomy and feelings are important too. The parent was direct, which might have hurt her feelings. The approach could have been more gentle, maybe explaining the reasons in a way that's age-appropriate and less confrontational. Also, the husband's lack of support might have made the situation harder for the daughter to process.\n\nBut the core issue is whether the parent is wrong for addressing the behavior. The parent isn't doing anything harmful; they're trying to enforce reasonable expectations for dress in the home. It's about teaching respect for body privacy and appropriate dress in family settings. The parent might not be in the wrong, but could improve their communication style to be less harsh and consider the daughter's emotions more. The answer seems to be that the parent is not in the wrong, but there's room for a more empathetic approach.\n"
