Her body is changing. Had to do the bra shopping and all of that. \n\nAnyway, we keep our house really warm. She has a habit of walking around in just a tank top and underwear. Sometimes she just hangs around in a towel for hours after showering instead of getting dressed. \n\nIt\u2019s not a huge deal but I suggested to her that she should really start using her robe if she doesn\u2019t want to put something on. She asked why and I said it\u2019s not entirely appropriate to walk around half-dressed in front of her father now that she\u2019s a young woman. \n\nI am very direct when speaking and I think her feelings may have been hurt. My husband ended up walking in on the conversation and asked why she was pouty. She told him and he just looked at me and rolled his eyes, but he didn\u2019t say anything. I brought it up with him later and he was just like \u201ccan we talk about something else?\u201d Clearly he didn\u2019t want to have the conversation so I dropped it with him. As for my daughter, she\u2019s been fairly quiet today, which is unusual for her. \n\nWas I wrong to say something to her about this? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for telling their 12-year-old daughter to cover up more at home. The daughter is in puberty, so her body is changing, and she's been wearing a tank top and underwear or a towel for long periods. The parent is direct, which might have upset the daughter. The husband rolled his eyes but didn't engage, and the daughter became quiet.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the appropriateness of a parent setting boundaries around modesty at home. Different cultures and families have different norms. The parent's reasoning is that the daughter is a young woman now, so it's not appropriate for the father to see her that way. That makes sense from a privacy and boundary perspective. However, the daughter might feel her autonomy is being restricted, especially if she's used to more freedom. \n\nThe parent is concerned about the daughter's exposure to her father, which is a common concern in many families. However, the approach might be too abrupt if the daughter wasn't prepared for it. The parent's directness led to the daughter feeling hurt, which is a red flag. Maybe the parent should have approached it more gently, explaining the reasons and discussing it as a transition into more modest behavior, rather than a sudden correction.\n\nThe husband's reaction (rolling eyes and avoiding the conversation) could indicate that he's not on board with the parent's approach, which might confuse the daughter. The parent might need to align with the husband to present a united front if they both agree on the boundaries. \n\nAlso, considering the daughter's age, 12 is when kids start to value their privacy more and may feel self-conscious about their bodies. The parent's intention is to teach modesty and privacy, which is important, but the method could be improved. Instead of being direct and causing hurt feelings, maybe using a more empathetic approach would be better. \n\nIn terms of whether the parent is in the wrong, it's a judgment call. The parent's intention is valid, but the execution might not be the best. However, it's not necessarily wrong to set such boundaries. So the answer would likely be B (Not in the wrong), but with the caveat that the approach could be more considerate.\n"
