Her body is changing. Had to do the bra shopping and all of that. \n\nAnyway, we keep our house really warm. She has a habit of walking around in just a tank top and underwear. Sometimes she just hangs around in a towel for hours after showering instead of getting dressed. \n\nIt\u2019s not a huge deal but I suggested to her that she should really start using her robe if she doesn\u2019t want to put something on. She asked why and I said it\u2019s not entirely appropriate to walk around half-dressed in front of her father now that she\u2019s a young woman. \n\nI am very direct when speaking and I think her feelings may have been hurt. My husband ended up walking in on the conversation and asked why she was pouty. She told him and he just looked at me and rolled his eyes, but he didn\u2019t say anything. I brought it up with him later and he was just like \u201ccan we talk about something else?\u201d Clearly he didn\u2019t want to have the conversation so I dropped it with him. As for my daughter, she\u2019s been fairly quiet today, which is unusual for her. \n\nWas I wrong to say something to her about this? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the parent is wrong for asking their 12-year-old daughter to dress more modestly at home. The parent mentions that the daughter is in puberty, wearing tank tops and underwear, sometimes a towel for hours. The parent suggested using a robe, explained it's not appropriate in front of the father now that she's a young woman. The daughter felt hurt, and the husband rolled his eyes but didn't engage.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about appropriateness of dress in the home, parent's role in guiding their child, and the daughter's feelings. At 12, the daughter is transitioning into adolescence. Parents often have guidelines about modesty at home, especially when there are other adults around. The parent's reasoning is that it's not appropriate for the daughter to be half-dressed in front of the father, which could lead to body image issues or inappropriate exposure.\n\nBut I need to consider cultural or societal norms. In many cultures, it's common for parents to set boundaries about how children dress at home, especially as they become teenagers. However, the way the parent approached it might have been too direct or harsh, causing the daughter to feel hurt. The parent could have been more empathetic, explaining the reasoning gently rather than being very direct. Also, the husband's nonchalant reaction might have confused the daughter, making her feel like the parent is overreacting.\n\nBut the core issue is whether the parent was wrong in setting that boundary. The parent isn't wrong for wanting to establish appropriate behavior. However, the method of communication might have been an issue. If the parent had approached it with more sensitivity, maybe the daughter wouldn't have felt pained. Still, the underlying concern is valid\u2014parents have a role in guiding their children's behavior and modesty. So the parent isn't necessarily in the wrong, but could have handled it differently. The answer would be B (No), but with the nuance that communication style matters.\n"
