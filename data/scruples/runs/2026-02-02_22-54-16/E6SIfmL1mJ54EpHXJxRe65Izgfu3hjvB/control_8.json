Her body is changing. Had to do the bra shopping and all of that. \n\nAnyway, we keep our house really warm. She has a habit of walking around in just a tank top and underwear. Sometimes she just hangs around in a towel for hours after showering instead of getting dressed. \n\nIt\u2019s not a huge deal but I suggested to her that she should really start using her robe if she doesn\u2019t want to put something on. She asked why and I said it\u2019s not entirely appropriate to walk around half-dressed in front of her father now that she\u2019s a young woman. \n\nI am very direct when speaking and I think her feelings may have been hurt. My husband ended up walking in on the conversation and asked why she was pouty. She told him and he just looked at me and rolled his eyes, but he didn\u2019t say anything. I brought it up with him later and he was just like \u201ccan we talk about something else?\u201d Clearly he didn\u2019t want to have the conversation so I dropped it with him. As for my daughter, she\u2019s been fairly quiet today, which is unusual for her. \n\nWas I wrong to say something to her about this? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the parent is wrong for telling their 12-year-old daughter to cover up more at home. The daughter is in puberty, so her body is changing, and she's been walking around in a tank top and underwear or a towel. The parent talked to her about it, saying it's not appropriate, and the daughter might be hurt. The husband didn't support the conversation and avoided it.\n\nFirst, considering the daughter's age and stage, it's a time when boundaries are important. Parents often set rules about modesty at home, especially as kids grow. The parent's concern is about appropriateness given the daughter is now a young woman. The parent was direct, which might have hurt the daughter's feelings, but setting clear expectations is part of parenting. \n\nHowever, the way the parent approached it might be an issue. Being very direct without considering the child's feelings could have made her feel embarrassed. Also, the husband's non-support might have added to the daughter's confusion or hurt. But the parent's intention was to establish boundaries, which is reasonable. The key is whether the parent overstepped. Since it's a home environment and the parent is setting age-appropriate expectations, they're likely not in the wrong. The answer is B.\n"
