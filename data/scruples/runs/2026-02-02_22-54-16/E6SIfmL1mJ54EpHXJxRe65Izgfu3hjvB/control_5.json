Her body is changing. Had to do the bra shopping and all of that. \n\nAnyway, we keep our house really warm. She has a habit of walking around in just a tank top and underwear. Sometimes she just hangs around in a towel for hours after showering instead of getting dressed. \n\nIt\u2019s not a huge deal but I suggested to her that she should really start using her robe if she doesn\u2019t want to put something on. She asked why and I said it\u2019s not entirely appropriate to walk around half-dressed in front of her father now that she\u2019s a young woman. \n\nI am very direct when speaking and I think her feelings may have been hurt. My husband ended up walking in on the conversation and asked why she was pouty. She told him and he just looked at me and rolled his eyes, but he didn\u2019t say anything. I brought it up with him later and he was just like \u201ccan we talk about something else?\u201d Clearly he didn\u2019t want to have the conversation so I dropped it with him. As for my daughter, she\u2019s been fairly quiet today, which is unusual for her. \n\nWas I wrong to say something to her about this? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for asking their 12-year-old daughter to cover up more at home. The daughter is going through puberty, so her body is changing. She's been wearing tank tops and underwear, or a towel after showers. The parent told her it's not appropriate to be half-dressed in front of her father now that she's a young woman. The daughter got upset, and the husband didn't want to discuss it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural norms around modesty in the home. In many cultures, it's common for parents to set boundaries about dress, especially for teenagers. But some might argue that children's homes can be more relaxed. However, the daughter is 12, entering puberty, so the parent's concern about appropriateness might be valid. The parent's approach was direct, which might have hurt the daughter's feelings. Maybe the parent could have handled it more gently, but the intention is about setting boundaries.\n\nThe husband's reaction suggests he wasn't as concerned, but that doesn't mean the parent is wrong. The key here is whether the parent overstepped. The parent is trying to teach the daughter about body autonomy and modesty in front of the father. The daughter might not realize the significance, so the parent's instruction is about preparing her for societal norms. However, the parent should consider the daughter's feelings and perhaps have a more open conversation to explain the reasons, rather than being abrupt. So the parent isn't entirely in the wrong, but could have handled it better. The answer is likely B, not in the wrong.\n"
