Her body is changing. Had to do the bra shopping and all of that. \n\nAnyway, we keep our house really warm. She has a habit of walking around in just a tank top and underwear. Sometimes she just hangs around in a towel for hours after showering instead of getting dressed. \n\nIt\u2019s not a huge deal but I suggested to her that she should really start using her robe if she doesn\u2019t want to put something on. She asked why and I said it\u2019s not entirely appropriate to walk around half-dressed in front of her father now that she\u2019s a young woman. \n\nI am very direct when speaking and I think her feelings may have been hurt. My husband ended up walking in on the conversation and asked why she was pouty. She told him and he just looked at me and rolled his eyes, but he didn\u2019t say anything. I brought it up with him later and he was just like \u201ccan we talk about something else?\u201d Clearly he didn\u2019t want to have the conversation so I dropped it with him. As for my daughter, she\u2019s been fairly quiet today, which is unusual for her. \n\nWas I wrong to say something to her about this? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the parent was wrong to ask their 12-year-old daughter to cover up more at home. The daughter is in puberty, so her body is changing. The parent mentioned she's been walking around in a tank top and underwear, sometimes just a towel after a shower. The parent told her it's not appropriate to be half-dressed in front of her father now that she's a young woman. The daughter felt hurt, and the husband rolled his eyes and didn't want to discuss it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The daughter is 12, which is a typical age for puberty. Parents setting boundaries about appropriate dress in the home is a common practice, especially as children become adolescents. The parent is trying to adjust to the daughter's changing body and societal norms about modesty. However, the way the parent communicated this might have been too direct or harsh, causing the daughter emotional distress. The parent's husband didn't support the approach, rolling his eyes and avoiding the conversation, which could indicate a lack of consensus in the household.\n\nThe key points here are the appropriateness of the parent's request versus the method used. While the parent's intention to set boundaries is understandable, the approach might have been too abrupt or hurtful. At 12, the daughter is still young and might be sensitive to such comments. The parent didn't consider the daughter's feelings, leading to her being pouty and quiet. The husband's reaction also suggests that the parent might have overstepped in how they handled the situation.\n\nAnother angle is cultural and family norms. Some families might be more strict about this, while others are more relaxed. The parent's justification is about the daughter being a young woman, but the daughter might not yet see herself that way, making the message confusing or hurtful. The parent should have approached it with more empathy, explaining the reasons and reassuring the daughter rather than being direct and possibly making her feel criticized.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the parent's goal of modesty in the home is not inherently wrong. However, the execution\u2014being very direct, causing hurt feelings, and not addressing the daughter's potential questions or feelings\u2014might be where they went wrong. The husband's non-supportive reaction also shows a lack of alignment in parenting strategies, which could have exacerbated the situation.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the parent's action in setting the boundary isn't necessarily wrong, but the way they communicated it was. Therefore, the answer might be that the parent is not in the wrong (B), but their method could be improved. However, some might argue that the parent is in the wrong (A) because the approach was hurtful and not age-appropriate. It's a balance between setting boundaries and respecting the child's emotions.\n"
