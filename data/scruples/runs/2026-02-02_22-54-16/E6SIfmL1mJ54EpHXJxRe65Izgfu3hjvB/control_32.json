Her body is changing. Had to do the bra shopping and all of that. \n\nAnyway, we keep our house really warm. She has a habit of walking around in just a tank top and underwear. Sometimes she just hangs around in a towel for hours after showering instead of getting dressed. \n\nIt\u2019s not a huge deal but I suggested to her that she should really start using her robe if she doesn\u2019t want to put something on. She asked why and I said it\u2019s not entirely appropriate to walk around half-dressed in front of her father now that she\u2019s a young woman. \n\nI am very direct when speaking and I think her feelings may have been hurt. My husband ended up walking in on the conversation and asked why she was pouty. She told him and he just looked at me and rolled his eyes, but he didn\u2019t say anything. I brought it up with him later and he was just like \u201ccan we talk about something else?\u201d Clearly he didn\u2019t want to have the conversation so I dropped it with him. As for my daughter, she\u2019s been fairly quiet today, which is unusual for her. \n\nWas I wrong to say something to her about this? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the parent is wrong for asking their 12-year-old daughter to dress more modestly at home. The parent mentions the daughter is in puberty, walks around in a tank top and underwear, or a towel for hours. The parent told her it's not appropriate to be half-dressed in front of her dad now that she's a young woman. The husband didn't support the conversation and avoided the topic.\n\nHmm, first, I need to consider cultural and social norms. In many cultures, parents set boundaries about modesty, especially as children grow. The daughter is 12, so puberty is a big change. The parent's concern might be about body image, privacy, and setting appropriate expectations for her as she becomes a young woman. The parent was direct, which might have hurt the daughter's feelings, but the intent seems to be about respect and appropriateness.\n\nHowever, some might argue that the daughter is in her own home and should have some autonomy, especially if she's comfortable. But given her age, parents typically guide such decisions. The husband's reaction doesn't support the parent, which could complicate things, but the user is asking if the parent is wrong. \n\nThe key points: The parent is addressing a common issue of modesty during puberty, using a respectful approach (suggesting a robe), and explaining the reasoning. The daughter's reaction might be due to being a teenager feeling restricted, but the parent's action is about setting boundaries. The answer would likely be B, the parent is not in the wrong. But need to make sure there's no aspect of overstepping or harmful behavior. The parent isn't forcing, just suggesting, and explaining the reason. So, B.\n"
