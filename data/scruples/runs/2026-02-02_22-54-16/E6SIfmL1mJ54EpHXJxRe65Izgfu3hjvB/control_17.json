Her body is changing. Had to do the bra shopping and all of that. \n\nAnyway, we keep our house really warm. She has a habit of walking around in just a tank top and underwear. Sometimes she just hangs around in a towel for hours after showering instead of getting dressed. \n\nIt\u2019s not a huge deal but I suggested to her that she should really start using her robe if she doesn\u2019t want to put something on. She asked why and I said it\u2019s not entirely appropriate to walk around half-dressed in front of her father now that she\u2019s a young woman. \n\nI am very direct when speaking and I think her feelings may have been hurt. My husband ended up walking in on the conversation and asked why she was pouty. She told him and he just looked at me and rolled his eyes, but he didn\u2019t say anything. I brought it up with him later and he was just like \u201ccan we talk about something else?\u201d Clearly he didn\u2019t want to have the conversation so I dropped it with him. As for my daughter, she\u2019s been fairly quiet today, which is unusual for her. \n\nWas I wrong to say something to her about this? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for asking their 12-year-old daughter to cover up more when she's in the house. \n\nFirst, the daughter is 12 and going through puberty. She's wearing tank tops and underwear, sometimes a towel after showering. The parent thinks it's not appropriate for her to be half-dressed in front of her father now that she's a young woman. \n\nThe parent did talk to her about it, suggesting using a robe. The daughter was hurt by the directness. The husband rolled his eyes and didn't engage further. The daughter has been quiet since.\n\nHmm. So, is the parent wrong? Well, setting boundaries around modesty, especially in a family setting, is common. At 12, children are becoming aware of their bodies, so parents might want to guide them. However, the approach matters. The parent was direct, which might have been hurtful. But the intention is about appropriateness. \n\nThe husband's reaction suggests he might not agree with the parent's approach, but that's between them. The key here is whether the parent's action was wrong. Since the parent is trying to teach appropriate behavior, but the method might have been harsh. However, the question is if they're in the wrong. \n\nIn many cultures, parents do set such expectations. The parent isn't forcing her to wear specific clothes but is encouraging more coverage. Unless there's any coercion or inappropriate behavior, the parent isn't necessarily wrong. The daughter's feelings were hurt, so maybe the parent could have been more gentle, but the act of setting a boundary isn't wrong. \n\nSo, answer B (No) the parent isn't in the wrong. They're addressing a reasonable concern, even if the delivery could be improved.\n"
