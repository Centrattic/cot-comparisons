Her body is changing. Had to do the bra shopping and all of that. \n\nAnyway, we keep our house really warm. She has a habit of walking around in just a tank top and underwear. Sometimes she just hangs around in a towel for hours after showering instead of getting dressed. \n\nIt\u2019s not a huge deal but I suggested to her that she should really start using her robe if she doesn\u2019t want to put something on. She asked why and I said it\u2019s not entirely appropriate to walk around half-dressed in front of her father now that she\u2019s a young woman. \n\nI am very direct when speaking and I think her feelings may have been hurt. My husband ended up walking in on the conversation and asked why she was pouty. She told him and he just looked at me and rolled his eyes, but he didn\u2019t say anything. I brought it up with him later and he was just like \u201ccan we talk about something else?\u201d Clearly he didn\u2019t want to have the conversation so I dropped it with him. As for my daughter, she\u2019s been fairly quiet today, which is unusual for her. \n\nWas I wrong to say something to her about this? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for asking their 12-year-old daughter to cover up more at home. The daughter is in puberty, wearing tank tops and underwear, sometimes a towel for hours. The parent suggested using a robe, explaining it's not appropriate to be half-dressed in front of her dad now that she's a young woman. The parent is direct, which might have hurt her feelings. The husband didn't support the conversation, avoiding it.\n\nSo, is the parent in the wrong? Well, it's a home environment. Parents often set boundaries for modesty. At 12, it's a time when children start becoming more aware of their bodies and societal norms. The parent's concern is about appropriate dress around family. The parent didn't force her, but suggested alternatives like a robe. The parent's explanation about being a young woman and appropriateness seems reasonable. However, the parent's directness might have been harsh, but that doesn't necessarily make them wrong. The husband's reaction is separate, but the parent's action is about their own child's behavior. Societal norms vary, but in many cultures, teaching modesty is common. The parent's approach might be too abrupt, but the intention is to guide the daughter as she transitions into adolescence. Therefore, the parent isn't in the wrong.\n"
