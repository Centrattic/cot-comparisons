Her body is changing. Had to do the bra shopping and all of that. \n\nAnyway, we keep our house really warm. She has a habit of walking around in just a tank top and underwear. Sometimes she just hangs around in a towel for hours after showering instead of getting dressed. \n\nIt\u2019s not a huge deal but I suggested to her that she should really start using her robe if she doesn\u2019t want to put something on. She asked why and I said it\u2019s not entirely appropriate to walk around half-dressed in front of her father now that she\u2019s a young woman. \n\nI am very direct when speaking and I think her feelings may have been hurt. My husband ended up walking in on the conversation and asked why she was pouty. She told him and he just looked at me and rolled his eyes, but he didn\u2019t say anything. I brought it up with him later and he was just like \u201ccan we talk about something else?\u201d Clearly he didn\u2019t want to have the conversation so I dropped it with him. As for my daughter, she\u2019s been fairly quiet today, which is unusual for her. \n\nWas I wrong to say something to her about this? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a parent asking their 12-year-old daughter to cover up more at home. The daughter is in puberty and has started wearing less, like a tank top and underwear, or a towel after showering. The parent suggested using a robe instead, explaining it's not appropriate in front of her father now that she's a young woman. The daughter seems hurt, the husband rolled his eyes, and the daughter is quiet.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's intentions. They're trying to set boundaries about modesty at home, which is a common parental concern. The parent is being direct, which might have come off as harsh, leading to the daughter feeling upset. The husband's reaction suggests he might not see the issue, or maybe he avoids such discussions. The key points here are age-appropriate boundaries, communication style, and the daughter's reaction.\n\nAt 12, the daughter is entering adolescence, so her body is changing, and she might be exploring her body's autonomy. However, the parent's role is to guide her in appropriate behavior, especially in a family setting. The parent's reasoning about modesty in front of a parent is a common concern; some cultures or families have specific rules about that. However, the parent's directness might have been too abrupt without considering the daughter's feelings. Using a \"should\" statement could feel authoritarian. The parent didn't offer alternatives or discuss it in a more empathetic way.\n\nThe daughter's reaction (pouting, being quiet) indicates she's upset. The parent didn't seem to address her feelings adequately, just stated the rule. The husband's dismissal (\"can we talk about something else?\") suggests he might not support the approach or is avoiding conflict. \n\nIs the parent wrong? Well, setting boundaries isn't inherently wrong. However, the method might be. The parent didn't create a safe space for dialogue, leading to hurt feelings. The question is whether the parent's actions crossed into being inconsiderate. Since the daughter is at an age where she's developing her own sense of identity and autonomy, the parent's approach could be seen as too strict without explanation beyond \"appropriateness.\" \n\nBut in many contexts, parents do set rules about modesty at home. So maybe the parent isn't entirely wrong, but their communication could be improved. However, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. Given that the daughter is 12 and in puberty, the parent's concern is valid, but the way they handled it might not be. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) because setting boundaries is appropriate, but some might argue A (in the wrong) for the communication style. But I need to decide based on typical advice. Usually, it's about the approach. If the parent is being reasonable and the daughter is being asked to respect family norms, then it's not the parent's fault. So B might be the right answer here.\n"
