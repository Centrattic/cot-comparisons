Her body is changing. Had to do the bra shopping and all of that. \n\nAnyway, we keep our house really warm. She has a habit of walking around in just a tank top and underwear. Sometimes she just hangs around in a towel for hours after showering instead of getting dressed. \n\nIt\u2019s not a huge deal but I suggested to her that she should really start using her robe if she doesn\u2019t want to put something on. She asked why and I said it\u2019s not entirely appropriate to walk around half-dressed in front of her father now that she\u2019s a young woman. \n\nI am very direct when speaking and I think her feelings may have been hurt. My husband ended up walking in on the conversation and asked why she was pouty. She told him and he just looked at me and rolled his eyes, but he didn\u2019t say anything. I brought it up with him later and he was just like \u201ccan we talk about something else?\u201d Clearly he didn\u2019t want to have the conversation so I dropped it with him. As for my daughter, she\u2019s been fairly quiet today, which is unusual for her. \n\nWas I wrong to say something to her about this? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for telling their 12-year-old daughter to cover up more at home.\n\nFirst, the daughter is 12 and going through puberty. She's wearing tank tops and underwear, sometimes a towel for hours. The parent is concerned about modesty, especially since she's in front of her father. They told her it's not appropriate now that she's a young woman. The daughter might feel hurt, and the husband is avoiding the topic.\n\nHmm, so the parent's intention is about teaching modesty and body awareness. But at 12, kids are at an age where they're becoming more aware of their bodies and social norms. However, the parent's approach was direct and might have been too harsh, leading to hurt feelings. The daughter's behavior might be typical for a pre-teen, who often push boundaries.\n\nBut the parent is trying to set boundaries. Is that wrong? On one hand, parents have the right to set rules about dress in their home. On the other hand, the way it's communicated matters. The parent didn't consider the daughter's feelings and the husband's nonchalant reaction might have added to the child's confusion.\n\nAlso, the parent didn't provide context or reasoning beyond \"it's not appropriate,\" which might not help the daughter understand why. Maybe the parent should have explained more, or involved the husband in the conversation to present a united front. Since the husband is avoiding it, maybe that's a point against the parent.\n\nSo, was the parent in the wrong? Not entirely. They had a valid concern about modesty, but their approach could have been more sensitive. The answer might be B (No) because the parent isn't wrong for setting boundaries, but they could have handled it better. However, since the question is about being \"in the wrong,\" if the parent's method was hurtful without cause, maybe A. But I think the parent's intention is good, so likely B.\n"
