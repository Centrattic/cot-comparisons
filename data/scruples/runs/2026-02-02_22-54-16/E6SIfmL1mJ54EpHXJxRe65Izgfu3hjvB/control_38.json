Her body is changing. Had to do the bra shopping and all of that. \n\nAnyway, we keep our house really warm. She has a habit of walking around in just a tank top and underwear. Sometimes she just hangs around in a towel for hours after showering instead of getting dressed. \n\nIt\u2019s not a huge deal but I suggested to her that she should really start using her robe if she doesn\u2019t want to put something on. She asked why and I said it\u2019s not entirely appropriate to walk around half-dressed in front of her father now that she\u2019s a young woman. \n\nI am very direct when speaking and I think her feelings may have been hurt. My husband ended up walking in on the conversation and asked why she was pouty. She told him and he just looked at me and rolled his eyes, but he didn\u2019t say anything. I brought it up with him later and he was just like \u201ccan we talk about something else?\u201d Clearly he didn\u2019t want to have the conversation so I dropped it with him. As for my daughter, she\u2019s been fairly quiet today, which is unusual for her. \n\nWas I wrong to say something to her about this? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the parent was wrong for telling their 12-year-old daughter to cover up more at home. The daughter is in puberty, so her body is changing, and she's been wearing tank tops and underwear or a towel. The parent suggested using a robe or dressing more appropriately, explaining it's not right to be half-dressed in front of her father now that she's a young woman. The husband didn't support the conversation and avoided it.\n\nFirst, the parent's intention seems to be about setting boundaries related to modesty and body awareness. Since the daughter is in puberty, this is a common topic for parents to address. However, the daughter's behavior might be typical for her age; kids her age often don't think about modesty in the same way adults do, and they might feel more comfortable in the house. The parent was direct, which might have hurt her feelings. The father's reaction (rolling eyes) could indicate he disagrees with the approach or the necessity of the conversation.\n\nIs it wrong to address this? It depends on cultural norms and family values. In many families, teaching children about appropriate dress at home is part of their upbringing. However, the parent could have handled it more gently, perhaps by explaining the reasons without making the daughter feel criticized. The key points are: the parent's right to set household rules vs. the daughter's developmental stage and comfort. The parent's approach might be correct in intent but could have been delivered more sensitively. The husband's lack of support might affect the daughter's perception of the issue. Ultimately, whether it's \"wrong\" is subjective, but the parent's concern is valid. So the answer is B (No), but with the note that the delivery could have been better.\n"
