Her body is changing. Had to do the bra shopping and all of that. \n\nAnyway, we keep our house really warm. She has a habit of walking around in just a tank top and underwear. Sometimes she just hangs around in a towel for hours after showering instead of getting dressed. \n\nIt\u2019s not a huge deal but I suggested to her that she should really start using her robe if she doesn\u2019t want to put something on. She asked why and I said it\u2019s not entirely appropriate to walk around half-dressed in front of her father now that she\u2019s a young woman. \n\nI am very direct when speaking and I think her feelings may have been hurt. My husband ended up walking in on the conversation and asked why she was pouty. She told him and he just looked at me and rolled his eyes, but he didn\u2019t say anything. I brought it up with him later and he was just like \u201ccan we talk about something else?\u201d Clearly he didn\u2019t want to have the conversation so I dropped it with him. As for my daughter, she\u2019s been fairly quiet today, which is unusual for her. \n\nWas I wrong to say something to her about this? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The parent is asking if they were wrong to tell their 12-year-old daughter to cover up more at home. The daughter is going through puberty and often wears a tank top and underwear or a towel after showering. The parent explained it's not appropriate to be half-dressed in front of the father now that she's a young woman. The dad is direct, which might have hurt her feelings, and the husband rolled his eyes and avoided the conversation.\n\nFirst, the parent's intention seems to be about setting boundaries as the daughter grows. It's a common issue during puberty where kids start to understand modesty and appropriate behavior. The parent is trying to guide her, which is a responsible approach. However, the way they communicated it might have been harsh. The daughter's reaction of being pouty suggests she felt hurt or embarrassed. The husband's reaction of rolling eyes could indicate he didn't support the approach or found it unnecessary.\n\nBut the key here is whether the parent was wrong. The parent is addressing a developmentally appropriate concern. Teaching modesty and respect for family boundaries is important. However, the method could have been more empathetic. The parent might not be in the wrong for the topic but could have handled the conversation differently to avoid hurting the daughter's feelings. The husband's avoidance might complicate things, but the parent's action itself isn't necessarily wrong. So the answer is B.\n"
