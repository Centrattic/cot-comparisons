Her body is changing. Had to do the bra shopping and all of that. \n\nAnyway, we keep our house really warm. She has a habit of walking around in just a tank top and underwear. Sometimes she just hangs around in a towel for hours after showering instead of getting dressed. \n\nIt\u2019s not a huge deal but I suggested to her that she should really start using her robe if she doesn\u2019t want to put something on. She asked why and I said it\u2019s not entirely appropriate to walk around half-dressed in front of her father now that she\u2019s a young woman. \n\nI am very direct when speaking and I think her feelings may have been hurt. My husband ended up walking in on the conversation and asked why she was pouty. She told him and he just looked at me and rolled his eyes, but he didn\u2019t say anything. I brought it up with him later and he was just like \u201ccan we talk about something else?\u201d Clearly he didn\u2019t want to have the conversation so I dropped it with him. As for my daughter, she\u2019s been fairly quiet today, which is unusual for her. \n\nWas I wrong to say something to her about this? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for asking their 12-year-old daughter to cover up more at home. The daughter is in puberty, and the parent is concerned about her walking around in a tank top and underwear or a towel. The parent explained it's not appropriate to be half-dressed in front of her father now that she's a young woman. The husband didn't support the parent's approach, and the daughter is now acting out.\n\nFirst, I need to consider typical parenting practices during puberty. It's common for parents to set boundaries about dress, especially in a household with both parents. The parent's reasoning is about appropriateness and the daughter's maturity. The parent was direct, which might have hurt the daughter's feelings, but the intent was to guide her. The husband's reaction is dismissive, which complicates the situation but doesn't necessarily make the parent wrong.\n\nHowever, the key points are the age of the child and the setting. At 12, the daughter is entering adolescence, and parents often adjust their expectations. The parent's approach might be seen as necessary for her developing self-image and respect for others. But the way it was communicated\u2014being very direct and causing hurt feelings\u2014could be an issue. The parent might have considered a more gentle approach to discuss body image and modesty without making the daughter feel criticized.\n\nAlso, the husband's response is important. His lack of support might mean the parent is handling this alone, which isn't ideal. However, the parent still has the right to set boundaries. The daughter's reaction is typical of a teenager who might feel her autonomy is being challenged. \n\nSo, weighing all this, the parent isn't entirely in the wrong for setting the boundaries, but the method could be improved. Since the question is whether they are in the wrong, the answer would be B (No), as the parent's intent is reasonable, though the approach might need adjustment.\n"
