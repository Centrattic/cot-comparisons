Her body is changing. Had to do the bra shopping and all of that. \n\nAnyway, we keep our house really warm. She has a habit of walking around in just a tank top and underwear. Sometimes she just hangs around in a towel for hours after showering instead of getting dressed. \n\nIt\u2019s not a huge deal but I suggested to her that she should really start using her robe if she doesn\u2019t want to put something on. She asked why and I said it\u2019s not entirely appropriate to walk around half-dressed in front of her father now that she\u2019s a young woman. \n\nI am very direct when speaking and I think her feelings may have been hurt. My husband ended up walking in on the conversation and asked why she was pouty. She told him and he just looked at me and rolled his eyes, but he didn\u2019t say anything. I brought it up with him later and he was just like \u201ccan we talk about something else?\u201d Clearly he didn\u2019t want to have the conversation so I dropped it with him. As for my daughter, she\u2019s been fairly quiet today, which is unusual for her. \n\nWas I wrong to say something to her about this? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the parent is in the wrong for telling their 12-year-old daughter to cover up more in the house. The daughter is in puberty, wearing tank tops and underwear, sometimes a towel for hours. The parent suggested using a robe or dressing more appropriately, explaining that it's not right in front of her father now that she's a young woman. The daughter was upset, and the husband didn't support the conversation.\n\nHmm. The parent's intention seems to be about teaching modesty and appropriate behavior in front of her father. But at 12, the daughter is still a child, and body autonomy is a topic. However, parents do have a role in setting boundaries. The parent was direct, which might have hurt the daughter's feelings. But is that inconsiderate? Or is it a necessary part of parenting?\n\nOn one hand, the parent is addressing a reasonable concern about modesty and the child's transition into adolescence. On the other hand, the approach might have been too abrupt without considering the daughter's feelings. The husband's reaction adds another layer, maybe indicating differing parenting styles. But the question is whether the parent is in the wrong. \n\nI think the parent isn't in the wrong. They're trying to guide their daughter through a developmental stage. However, the way they handled it could be improved. But the act of setting boundaries isn't wrong. So answer B.\n"
