Her body is changing. Had to do the bra shopping and all of that. \n\nAnyway, we keep our house really warm. She has a habit of walking around in just a tank top and underwear. Sometimes she just hangs around in a towel for hours after showering instead of getting dressed. \n\nIt\u2019s not a huge deal but I suggested to her that she should really start using her robe if she doesn\u2019t want to put something on. She asked why and I said it\u2019s not entirely appropriate to walk around half-dressed in front of her father now that she\u2019s a young woman. \n\nI am very direct when speaking and I think her feelings may have been hurt. My husband ended up walking in on the conversation and asked why she was pouty. She told him and he just looked at me and rolled his eyes, but he didn\u2019t say anything. I brought it up with him later and he was just like \u201ccan we talk about something else?\u201d Clearly he didn\u2019t want to have the conversation so I dropped it with him. As for my daughter, she\u2019s been fairly quiet today, which is unusual for her. \n\nWas I wrong to say something to her about this? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the parent is wrong for telling their 12-year-old daughter to cover up more at home. The daughter is in puberty, so her body is changing. She's been wearing tank tops and underwear, or a towel for hours after showers. The parent told her it's not appropriate to be half-dressed in front of her dad now that she's a young woman. The daughter got upset, and the husband didn't want to discuss it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural norms. In many Western cultures, parents do set boundaries about modesty at home, especially as children reach puberty. The parent is trying to teach appropriate behavior for her age. The daughter is 12, so it's reasonable to start discussing body image and modesty.\n\nThe parent's approach was direct, which might have hurt the daughter's feelings. Maybe they could have been softer, but the intention seems good. The husband's reaction is a bit of a red flag\u2014avoiding the conversation might not help the daughter feel supported. However, the parent's action itself isn't wrong. They're addressing a common issue for teenagers.\n\nAlso, safety and modesty are important. Even at home, there's a shift in how one presents themselves as they grow up. The parent is preparing her for societal expectations. The key here is whether the parent overstepped. Since the daughter is walking around in a state that the parent finds inappropriate, it's within their rights to set boundaries. The parent isn't being cruel, just firm. So probably the answer is B, the parent isn't in the wrong. But maybe there's a nuance. The parent should have considered the daughter's feelings more, but the action itself is justified.\n"
