Her body is changing. Had to do the bra shopping and all of that. \n\nAnyway, we keep our house really warm. She has a habit of walking around in just a tank top and underwear. Sometimes she just hangs around in a towel for hours after showering instead of getting dressed. \n\nIt\u2019s not a huge deal but I suggested to her that she should really start using her robe if she doesn\u2019t want to put something on. She asked why and I said it\u2019s not entirely appropriate to walk around half-dressed in front of her father now that she\u2019s a young woman. \n\nI am very direct when speaking and I think her feelings may have been hurt. My husband ended up walking in on the conversation and asked why she was pouty. She told him and he just looked at me and rolled his eyes, but he didn\u2019t say anything. I brought it up with him later and he was just like \u201ccan we talk about something else?\u201d Clearly he didn\u2019t want to have the conversation so I dropped it with him. As for my daughter, she\u2019s been fairly quiet today, which is unusual for her. \n\nWas I wrong to say something to her about this? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The question is whether the parent is in the wrong for asking their 12-year-old daughter to cover up more at home. The daughter is in puberty, wearing tank tops and underwear, sometimes a towel for hours after showering. The parent suggested using a robe or dressing properly, explaining it's not appropriate in front of the father now that she's a young woman. The daughter was upset, the husband rolled eyes and didn't engage further. The parent is wondering if they were wrong.\n\nHmm. So, the key points here are about appropriateness in the home, parental guidance during puberty, and the daughter's reaction. First, the parent is addressing a change in behavior due to the daughter's age and physical development. It's common for parents to set boundaries around modesty, especially as children become teenagers. The parent's reasoning is that the daughter is becoming a young woman and needs to be more modest in front of her father. \n\nBut wait, is there a cultural or societal norm here? In many cultures, parents do establish such rules to teach modesty and prepare teens for adult social norms. However, some might argue that at home, especially with family, there's more flexibility. But the parent's concern is about the daughter being in the presence of her father, which could be a point about respecting both the daughter's and father's comfort. \n\nThe daughter is 12, so around that age, but still a child. The parent's approach was direct, which might have been too abrupt for the daughter, causing her to feel hurt. The husband's reaction was dismissive, not supporting the parent's approach. However, the parent's intention seems to be about guiding the daughter appropriately. \n\nIs the parent in the wrong? Well, they were trying to teach their daughter about modesty and appropriate behavior. But there's a question of how they communicated it. Being direct is one thing, but if it hurt the daughter's feelings, maybe a more empathetic approach could have been better. However, the parent isn't necessarily wrong for setting the boundary. The husband's lack of support adds complexity, but the main issue is the parent's action. \n\nSo, considering all that, the parent isn't in the wrong for addressing the behavior. They're fulfilling a parental role in guiding their child. The method might be debatable, but the intent is valid. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
