Her body is changing. Had to do the bra shopping and all of that. \n\nAnyway, we keep our house really warm. She has a habit of walking around in just a tank top and underwear. Sometimes she just hangs around in a towel for hours after showering instead of getting dressed. \n\nIt\u2019s not a huge deal but I suggested to her that she should really start using her robe if she doesn\u2019t want to put something on. She asked why and I said it\u2019s not entirely appropriate to walk around half-dressed in front of her father now that she\u2019s a young woman. \n\nI am very direct when speaking and I think her feelings may have been hurt. My husband ended up walking in on the conversation and asked why she was pouty. She told him and he just looked at me and rolled his eyes, but he didn\u2019t say anything. I brought it up with him later and he was just like \u201ccan we talk about something else?\u201d Clearly he didn\u2019t want to have the conversation so I dropped it with him. As for my daughter, she\u2019s been fairly quiet today, which is unusual for her. \n\nWas I wrong to say something to her about this? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the parent is in the wrong for asking their 12-year-old daughter to dress more appropriately at home. The daughter is in puberty, so her body is changing, and she's been wearing tank tops and underwear or a towel for long periods. The parent suggested using a robe, explaining it's not appropriate to be half-dressed in front of her dad now that she's a young woman. The daughter felt hurt, and the husband rolled his eyes and avoided the conversation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural norms. In many Western cultures, there's a shift in how children are expected to dress as they enter puberty, especially in mixed-gender settings. The parent is trying to set boundaries, which is common. However, the daughter is 12, still a child, and the parent's approach might have been too direct or not age-appropriate. The parent's explanation mentions walking around in front of her father, which is a valid concern about modesty and boundaries. \n\nBut the daughter is still a child, and the parent's method of communication may have been harsh, leading to hurt feelings. The husband's reaction suggests he might not agree with the approach or the timing. The question is whether the parent was wrong to bring it up. \n\nOn one hand, setting boundaries is necessary. On the other hand, the parent might not have considered the daughter's emotional state or the way the message was delivered. The parent's directness could have been jarring for a 12-year-old. Also, the husband's avoidance of the topic could indicate differing views on how to approach the situation. \n\nIs the parent in the wrong? The parent's intention is reasonable\u2014promoting modesty and appropriate behavior. However, the method and the directness might have been problematic. The daughter is still a child, and the parent could have handled it more gently. But the parent isn't in the wrong for wanting to set boundaries. The answer is probably B (No), as the parent is not in the wrong, but the approach could have been better.\n"
