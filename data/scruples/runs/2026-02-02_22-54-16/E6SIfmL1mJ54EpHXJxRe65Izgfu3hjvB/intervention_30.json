Her body is changing. Had to do the bra shopping and all of that. \n\nAnyway, we keep our house really warm. She has a habit of walking around in just a tank top and underwear. Sometimes she just hangs around in a towel for hours after showering instead of getting dressed. \n\nIt\u2019s not a huge deal but I suggested to her that she should really start using her robe if she doesn\u2019t want to put something on. She asked why and I said it\u2019s not entirely appropriate to walk around half-dressed in front of her father now that she\u2019s a young woman. \n\nI am very direct when speaking and I think her feelings may have been hurt. My husband ended up walking in on the conversation and asked why she was pouty. She told him and he just looked at me and rolled his eyes, but he didn\u2019t say anything. I brought it up with him later and he was just like \u201ccan we talk about something else?\u201d Clearly he didn\u2019t want to have the conversation so I dropped it with him. As for my daughter, she\u2019s been fairly quiet today, which is unusual for her. \n\nWas I wrong to say something to her about this? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for asking their 12-year-old daughter to cover up more at home. The parent is concerned because the daughter is in puberty and has started walking around in a tank top and underwear, or a towel for hours after showers. The parent told her it's not appropriate to be half-dressed in front of her father, and the daughter was upset. The husband didn't support the parent and avoided the conversation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the appropriateness of the situation. At 12, the daughter is entering puberty, so body changes are natural. The parent's concern about modesty in the house, especially around the father, is a common issue. But the daughter is a child, so the parent has a responsibility to set boundaries. However, the way the parent addressed it was direct and might have hurt the daughter's feelings. The parent is being strict about dress code at home, which can be a point of contention. \n\nOn one hand, the parent is right to guide the daughter towards more modesty as she grows up. On the other hand, the approach might have been too abrupt or not age-appropriate. The daughter might not fully understand the reasoning, leading to hurt feelings. Also, the husband's lack of support could have made the daughter feel like only her mom was upset, which might have added to her distress.\n\nAnother angle: the home environment. If the house is warm, maybe the daughter is just trying to stay comfortable. The parent's suggestion to use a robe is reasonable, but the way it was communicated matters. Was the parent respectful and explained it in a way the daughter could understand? The parent said it's not appropriate to be half-dressed in front of the father because she's a young woman. That makes sense from a modesty standpoint, but a 12-year-old might not grasp the social norms the parent is referring to.\n\nAlso, the daughter's reaction\u2014being pouty and quiet\u2014suggests she felt embarrassed or upset. The parent's directness might have been too harsh for her age. It's possible the parent is right in setting a boundary but could have handled it with more sensitivity. The husband's reaction (rolling eyes, avoiding the conversation) might not help the daughter feel supported in understanding the parent's perspective.\n\nIn terms of cultural or societal norms, different people have different views on modesty at home. Some families are more relaxed, others more strict. The parent's approach is within their right as a parent to set household rules, but the method and tone are important. The key is whether the parent is being unreasonable or if the daughter's behavior is genuinely inappropriate in the context they've set.\n\nI think the parent isn't in the wrong because they have a valid concern about modesty and are trying to prepare the daughter for appropriate behavior as she grows up. However, the way it was handled could be improved. But the question is if the parent is in the wrong. Since the parent's intent is to set a boundary that's reasonable (covering up at home in front of the father), the answer would lean towards B, not in the wrong. The parent's approach might need adjustment, but the action itself isn't wrong.\n"
