Her body is changing. Had to do the bra shopping and all of that. \n\nAnyway, we keep our house really warm. She has a habit of walking around in just a tank top and underwear. Sometimes she just hangs around in a towel for hours after showering instead of getting dressed. \n\nIt\u2019s not a huge deal but I suggested to her that she should really start using her robe if she doesn\u2019t want to put something on. She asked why and I said it\u2019s not entirely appropriate to walk around half-dressed in front of her father now that she\u2019s a young woman. \n\nI am very direct when speaking and I think her feelings may have been hurt. My husband ended up walking in on the conversation and asked why she was pouty. She told him and he just looked at me and rolled his eyes, but he didn\u2019t say anything. I brought it up with him later and he was just like \u201ccan we talk about something else?\u201d Clearly he didn\u2019t want to have the conversation so I dropped it with him. As for my daughter, she\u2019s been fairly quiet today, which is unusual for her. \n\nWas I wrong to say something to her about this? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for asking their 12-year-old daughter to cover up more at home. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the daughter is 12, going through puberty. She's walking around in a tank top and underwear, or a towel for hours. The parent is concerned about appropriateness, especially since she's a young woman now. The parent told her it's not appropriate to be half-dressed in front of her father. The daughter might be hurt, and the husband didn't support the discussion, avoiding the topic.\n\nHmm. So, the key issues here are about modesty, parental guidance, and the approach taken. The parent's intention is to set boundaries as the child becomes a teenager. But the daughter might feel her autonomy is being restricted. At 12, children are developing their sense of independence, so being direct might have come off as harsh. The parent could have approached it more gently, explaining the reasoning without making the daughter feel criticized. The husband's reaction also suggests there's some tension in how the parent handled it.\n\nBut is the parent wrong? Well, setting boundaries is part of parenting. However, the method and communication style matter. The parent might not be in the wrong for wanting to establish appropriate behavior, but the way it was done could have been more considerate. The daughter's feelings being hurt indicates that the approach might need adjustment. The parent might need to balance guidance with empathy. So, the answer isn't a clear yes or no, but based on the options given, the parent isn't in the wrong (B) because their intention is valid, but they could improve their approach.\n"
