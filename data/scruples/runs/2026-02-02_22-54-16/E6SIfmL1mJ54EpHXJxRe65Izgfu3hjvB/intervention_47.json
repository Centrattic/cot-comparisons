Her body is changing. Had to do the bra shopping and all of that. \n\nAnyway, we keep our house really warm. She has a habit of walking around in just a tank top and underwear. Sometimes she just hangs around in a towel for hours after showering instead of getting dressed. \n\nIt\u2019s not a huge deal but I suggested to her that she should really start using her robe if she doesn\u2019t want to put something on. She asked why and I said it\u2019s not entirely appropriate to walk around half-dressed in front of her father now that she\u2019s a young woman. \n\nI am very direct when speaking and I think her feelings may have been hurt. My husband ended up walking in on the conversation and asked why she was pouty. She told him and he just looked at me and rolled his eyes, but he didn\u2019t say anything. I brought it up with him later and he was just like \u201ccan we talk about something else?\u201d Clearly he didn\u2019t want to have the conversation so I dropped it with him. As for my daughter, she\u2019s been fairly quiet today, which is unusual for her. \n\nWas I wrong to say something to her about this? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the parent is wrong for asking their 12-year-old daughter to cover up more at home. The daughter is in puberty, wearing tank tops and underwear, or a towel for hours. The parent told her it's not appropriate to be half-dressed in front of her dad now that she's a young woman. The husband didn't support the parent and changed the subject. The daughter is upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider societal norms. In many cultures, there's a shift in modesty expectations as kids become teenagers. Parents often set boundaries about clothing, even at home. The parent's reasoning is about respect and appropriateness in front of the father. That makes sense, as it's common to encourage more modesty during puberty.\n\nBut maybe the approach was too direct or harsh, causing the daughter to feel hurt. The parent might not have considered her feelings, leading to a pouty reaction. The husband's lack of support might have added to the child's confusion or distress. However, the parent's intention was to guide the daughter, which is a responsibility. So, while the method could be improved, the action itself isn't necessarily wrong. The key is balancing setting boundaries with empathy. The answer is likely B (not in the wrong), but with a note about communication style.\n"
