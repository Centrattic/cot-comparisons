Her body is changing. Had to do the bra shopping and all of that. \n\nAnyway, we keep our house really warm. She has a habit of walking around in just a tank top and underwear. Sometimes she just hangs around in a towel for hours after showering instead of getting dressed. \n\nIt\u2019s not a huge deal but I suggested to her that she should really start using her robe if she doesn\u2019t want to put something on. She asked why and I said it\u2019s not entirely appropriate to walk around half-dressed in front of her father now that she\u2019s a young woman. \n\nI am very direct when speaking and I think her feelings may have been hurt. My husband ended up walking in on the conversation and asked why she was pouty. She told him and he just looked at me and rolled his eyes, but he didn\u2019t say anything. I brought it up with him later and he was just like \u201ccan we talk about something else?\u201d Clearly he didn\u2019t want to have the conversation so I dropped it with him. As for my daughter, she\u2019s been fairly quiet today, which is unusual for her. \n\nWas I wrong to say something to her about this? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The question is whether the parent is in the wrong for asking their 12-year-old daughter to cover up more at home.\n\nFirst, the daughter is 12 and going through puberty. The parent mentions she's wearing tank tops and underwear, or a towel for hours after showering. The parent is concerned about appropriateness, especially regarding being a young woman now and being in front of her father. The parent directly told her, which might have hurt her feelings. The husband rolled his eyes and avoided the conversation.\n\nI need to consider cultural norms here. In many societies, there's an expectation that as children grow into adolescence, there's a shift in how they dress, especially in mixed company. The parent is trying to set boundaries about modesty in the home, which is a common parenting approach. However, the daughter is 12, which is a young age, and her behavior might be typical for her age before she's aware of such expectations. \n\nThe parent's approach was direct, which could be appropriate, but maybe the way they communicated it could be softened. However, the parent's reasoning is about appropriateness, not about control or shame. The husband's reaction is a separate issue; the parent isn't wrong if their intention is to teach modesty. The daughter's quietness might indicate she's processing the conversation, but the parent isn't necessarily wrong for having it. \n\nThere's no indication of abuse or shaming here. The parent is trying to guide their daughter into appropriate behavior as she grows up. So, considering all that, the answer is likely B (not in the wrong). The parent is setting reasonable boundaries for a daughter entering adolescence.\n"
