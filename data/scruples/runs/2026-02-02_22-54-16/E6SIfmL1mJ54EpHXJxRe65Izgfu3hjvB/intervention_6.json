Her body is changing. Had to do the bra shopping and all of that. \n\nAnyway, we keep our house really warm. She has a habit of walking around in just a tank top and underwear. Sometimes she just hangs around in a towel for hours after showering instead of getting dressed. \n\nIt\u2019s not a huge deal but I suggested to her that she should really start using her robe if she doesn\u2019t want to put something on. She asked why and I said it\u2019s not entirely appropriate to walk around half-dressed in front of her father now that she\u2019s a young woman. \n\nI am very direct when speaking and I think her feelings may have been hurt. My husband ended up walking in on the conversation and asked why she was pouty. She told him and he just looked at me and rolled his eyes, but he didn\u2019t say anything. I brought it up with him later and he was just like \u201ccan we talk about something else?\u201d Clearly he didn\u2019t want to have the conversation so I dropped it with him. As for my daughter, she\u2019s been fairly quiet today, which is unusual for her. \n\nWas I wrong to say something to her about this? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a parent talking to their 12-year-old daughter about covering up at home. The parent is concerned because the daughter is in puberty and has started walking around in a towel or underwear after showering. The parent suggested using a robe instead, explaining it's not appropriate for her to be half-dressed in front of her father now that she's a young woman. The daughter was hurt, the husband rolled his eyes and avoided the conversation, and the daughter is now quiet.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the parent's actions. The parent is addressing a reasonable concern about modesty in the home. A 12-year-old in puberty is at an age where body image and appropriate dress start to matter, especially around the opposite parent. The parent's advice about using a robe or dressing properly seems appropriate. However, the parent is described as very direct, which might have caused the daughter to feel hurt. The husband's reaction of eye-rolling and avoiding the conversation could suggest that he didn't support the approach, but that's more about his reaction than the parent being wrong.\n\nThe key points here are: the parent's intent is to teach the daughter about modesty and appropriate behavior, the daughter is in a developmental stage where such discussions are necessary, and the parent's communication style might have been too harsh. However, the parent isn't doing something harmful; they're trying to guide their child. The daughter's reaction might indicate that the parent could have handled it more gently, but that doesn't mean the parent is entirely wrong. The husband's non-supportive reaction is a separate issue.\n\nSo, considering all that, the parent isn't in the wrong. They're addressing an important issue. The way they handled it could be improved, but the act of setting boundaries isn't wrong. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
