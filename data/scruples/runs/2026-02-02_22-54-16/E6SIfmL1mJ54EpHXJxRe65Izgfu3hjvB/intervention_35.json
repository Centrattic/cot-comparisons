Her body is changing. Had to do the bra shopping and all of that. \n\nAnyway, we keep our house really warm. She has a habit of walking around in just a tank top and underwear. Sometimes she just hangs around in a towel for hours after showering instead of getting dressed. \n\nIt\u2019s not a huge deal but I suggested to her that she should really start using her robe if she doesn\u2019t want to put something on. She asked why and I said it\u2019s not entirely appropriate to walk around half-dressed in front of her father now that she\u2019s a young woman. \n\nI am very direct when speaking and I think her feelings may have been hurt. My husband ended up walking in on the conversation and asked why she was pouty. She told him and he just looked at me and rolled his eyes, but he didn\u2019t say anything. I brought it up with him later and he was just like \u201ccan we talk about something else?\u201d Clearly he didn\u2019t want to have the conversation so I dropped it with him. As for my daughter, she\u2019s been fairly quiet today, which is unusual for her. \n\nWas I wrong to say something to her about this? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The parent is asking if they were wrong to ask their 12-year-old daughter to cover up more at home. The daughter is in puberty and often wears a tank top and underwear or a towel for hours after showering. The parent told her it's not appropriate to be half-dressed in front of her father now that she's a young woman. The dad is direct and the daughter might be upset. The husband rolled his eyes and didn't want to discuss it further, leading the parent to drop the topic. Now, the parent is wondering if they were in the wrong.\n\nFirst, consider the age and developmental stage. At 12, puberty is common, and body image is crucial. The parent's concern is about modesty within the home, specifically around the father. The parent's approach was direct, which might come off as harsh, but the intention is to set boundaries. However, the daughter's reaction suggests she might feel her privacy or autonomy is being invaded. \n\nIs it appropriate to set such boundaries? Some parents might argue that children should be comfortable in their own home, and that modesty in front of parents isn't necessary unless there's a cultural or religious context. Others might think it's a good idea to teach body respect and set norms as the child becomes a young woman. \n\nThe parent's method could be too abrupt. Instead of being direct and making the daughter feel criticized, a more empathetic approach might have been better. But was the parent in the wrong? The intention was to set a boundary, which is reasonable. However, the way it was communicated might have been hurtful. The husband's reaction suggests he didn't support the approach, which complicates things. \n\nLegally and socially, there's no law against a parent setting such rules. However, the parent's actions could be seen as overstepping if the daughter is merely being a child and the parent is imposing adult expectations too soon. But since the daughter is in puberty, the parent's concern about her body image and appropriate behavior in the home is understandable. \n\nIn terms of parenting styles, some might argue that the parent is being too strict, while others might support teaching the child about modesty. The key is whether the parent's actions were harmful. The daughter's silence indicates emotional impact, but it's not clear if the parent truly was wrong. The parent was trying to address a reasonable concern, albeit perhaps not in the best way. So the answer might be B\u2014Not in the wrong\u2014but with the caveat that the approach could be improved.\n"
