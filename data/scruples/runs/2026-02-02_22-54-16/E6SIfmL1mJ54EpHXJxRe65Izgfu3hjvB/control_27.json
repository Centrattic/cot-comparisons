Her body is changing. Had to do the bra shopping and all of that. \n\nAnyway, we keep our house really warm. She has a habit of walking around in just a tank top and underwear. Sometimes she just hangs around in a towel for hours after showering instead of getting dressed. \n\nIt\u2019s not a huge deal but I suggested to her that she should really start using her robe if she doesn\u2019t want to put something on. She asked why and I said it\u2019s not entirely appropriate to walk around half-dressed in front of her father now that she\u2019s a young woman. \n\nI am very direct when speaking and I think her feelings may have been hurt. My husband ended up walking in on the conversation and asked why she was pouty. She told him and he just looked at me and rolled his eyes, but he didn\u2019t say anything. I brought it up with him later and he was just like \u201ccan we talk about something else?\u201d Clearly he didn\u2019t want to have the conversation so I dropped it with him. As for my daughter, she\u2019s been fairly quiet today, which is unusual for her. \n\nWas I wrong to say something to her about this? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for asking their 12-year-old daughter to cover up more at home. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The daughter is 12 and in puberty, so her body is changing. She's walking around in a tank top and underwear or a towel for hours. The parent thinks it's not appropriate now that she's a young woman. The parent is direct, which might have hurt the daughter's feelings. The husband didn't support the conversation and avoided it.\n\nNow, the question is whether the parent is in the wrong. On one hand, parents have a responsibility to set boundaries and guide their children, especially regarding modesty and appropriate behavior. It's reasonable to expect a daughter to dress appropriately at home, especially considering the parent's presence. The parent's reasoning is about the daughter being a young woman now and the importance of modesty.\n\nOn the other hand, the daughter is 12, which is a time when kids start seeking independence and might be sensitive about their bodies. The parent's directness might have been harsh, leading to the daughter feeling hurt. However, the parent's intentions seem to be about setting healthy boundaries rather than shaming her. The husband's reaction is also a factor, but that's between the parents and doesn't directly affect the daughter's situation.\n\nI should also consider cultural norms. In many cultures, it's customary for children, especially teenagers, to cover up at home for modesty reasons. The parent is trying to adjust to her daughter's growing up. The key here is whether the parent's approach was appropriate. While the method could be improved (maybe more gentle communication), the act of setting the boundary itself isn't wrong. The parent isn't shaming the daughter for her body changes but teaching her about appropriate dress in a family setting.\n\nThe daughter walking around in underwear and a tank top might not be safe or appropriate, especially with a father present. The parent's concern is valid in terms of privacy and respect. So, the parent is not in the wrong for setting that expectation. The issue might be how it was communicated, but the act itself is justified.\n"
