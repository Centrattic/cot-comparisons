Her body is changing. Had to do the bra shopping and all of that. \n\nAnyway, we keep our house really warm. She has a habit of walking around in just a tank top and underwear. Sometimes she just hangs around in a towel for hours after showering instead of getting dressed. \n\nIt\u2019s not a huge deal but I suggested to her that she should really start using her robe if she doesn\u2019t want to put something on. She asked why and I said it\u2019s not entirely appropriate to walk around half-dressed in front of her father now that she\u2019s a young woman. \n\nI am very direct when speaking and I think her feelings may have been hurt. My husband ended up walking in on the conversation and asked why she was pouty. She told him and he just looked at me and rolled his eyes, but he didn\u2019t say anything. I brought it up with him later and he was just like \u201ccan we talk about something else?\u201d Clearly he didn\u2019t want to have the conversation so I dropped it with him. As for my daughter, she\u2019s been fairly quiet today, which is unusual for her. \n\nWas I wrong to say something to her about this? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the parent is wrong for telling their 12-year-old daughter to cover up more at home. The daughter is in puberty, wearing tank tops and underwear, sometimes a towel for hours after a shower. The parent suggested using a robe instead. The parent is direct, which might have hurt the daughter's feelings. The husband rolled his eyes but didn't engage, and the daughter is now quiet.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural and family norms. In many cultures, parents set boundaries about modesty, even at home. The daughter is 12, so it's a time of body changes, and the parent is addressing appropriate attire in the house. However, the approach was direct, which might have been harsh. The parent didn't explain the reasoning in a gentle way, leading to hurt feelings. The husband's reaction suggests he's more laid-back about it, creating a conflict in parenting styles.\n\nIs the parent in the wrong? The parent is trying to set boundaries, which is reasonable. However, the method used might have been too abrupt, not considering the daughter's feelings. The key issue is whether setting such a boundary is appropriate. Since it's about modesty and respecting family norms, the parent isn't necessarily wrong. However, the way they communicated it could be improved. But the question is whether they're in the wrong. Since the parent had a valid concern but handled it poorly, maybe the answer isn't clear-cut. However, in terms of right vs. wrong, the parent's intent was to teach modesty, which is acceptable. The mistake was the communication style, not the act of setting a boundary. So the parent isn't in the wrong, but could have handled it better. Answer B.\n"
