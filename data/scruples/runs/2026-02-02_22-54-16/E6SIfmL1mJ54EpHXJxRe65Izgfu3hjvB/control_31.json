Her body is changing. Had to do the bra shopping and all of that. \n\nAnyway, we keep our house really warm. She has a habit of walking around in just a tank top and underwear. Sometimes she just hangs around in a towel for hours after showering instead of getting dressed. \n\nIt\u2019s not a huge deal but I suggested to her that she should really start using her robe if she doesn\u2019t want to put something on. She asked why and I said it\u2019s not entirely appropriate to walk around half-dressed in front of her father now that she\u2019s a young woman. \n\nI am very direct when speaking and I think her feelings may have been hurt. My husband ended up walking in on the conversation and asked why she was pouty. She told him and he just looked at me and rolled his eyes, but he didn\u2019t say anything. I brought it up with him later and he was just like \u201ccan we talk about something else?\u201d Clearly he didn\u2019t want to have the conversation so I dropped it with him. As for my daughter, she\u2019s been fairly quiet today, which is unusual for her. \n\nWas I wrong to say something to her about this? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the parent was wrong for asking their 12-year-old daughter to dress more appropriately at home. The daughter is in puberty, so her body is changing, which is a normal part of growing up. The parent mentions the house is kept warm, and the daughter walks around in a tank top and underwear or a towel for hours. The parent tried to explain that it's not appropriate for her to be half-dressed in front of her father now that she's becoming a young woman.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the appropriateness of the parent's actions. The parent is trying to set boundaries regarding modesty within the home. It's common for parents to adjust expectations as their children enter puberty, especially regarding privacy and dress. The parent was direct, which might have hurt the daughter's feelings. However, the parent's intention is likely to teach appropriate behavior and respect for family norms. \n\nThe husband's reaction is also a point to consider. He rolled his eyes and avoided the conversation, which might indicate he doesn't see the issue. But the parent is still responsible for their own approach. The daughter's reaction being pouty and quiet suggests that the parent's method might have been a bit harsh or not age-appropriate. At 12, a child is developing autonomy, so communication style matters. The parent could have approached it with more empathy, explaining the reasons gently rather than being direct. However, the core issue of setting boundaries isn't inherently wrong. So, the answer might hinge on the approach rather than the act itself. \n\nIn terms of cultural norms, some might argue that the parent is enforcing modesty, which is a common parenting practice. Others might say it's overstepping if the daughter isn't violating any rules except the parent's preferences. But since the parent is trying to prepare her for societal norms and the transition to adolescence, it's a valid concern. The key here is whether the parent's actions are respectful and age-appropriate. The parent's directness might have been the issue, but the act of setting boundaries isn't necessarily wrong. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
