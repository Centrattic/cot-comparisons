Her body is changing. Had to do the bra shopping and all of that. \n\nAnyway, we keep our house really warm. She has a habit of walking around in just a tank top and underwear. Sometimes she just hangs around in a towel for hours after showering instead of getting dressed. \n\nIt\u2019s not a huge deal but I suggested to her that she should really start using her robe if she doesn\u2019t want to put something on. She asked why and I said it\u2019s not entirely appropriate to walk around half-dressed in front of her father now that she\u2019s a young woman. \n\nI am very direct when speaking and I think her feelings may have been hurt. My husband ended up walking in on the conversation and asked why she was pouty. She told him and he just looked at me and rolled his eyes, but he didn\u2019t say anything. I brought it up with him later and he was just like \u201ccan we talk about something else?\u201d Clearly he didn\u2019t want to have the conversation so I dropped it with him. As for my daughter, she\u2019s been fairly quiet today, which is unusual for her. \n\nWas I wrong to say something to her about this? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the parent is in the wrong for asking their 12-year-old daughter to dress more appropriately at home. The daughter is in puberty, so her body is changing, and she's been wearing tank tops and underwear or a towel. The parent suggests using a robe instead, explaining that it's not appropriate to be half-dressed in front of her father now that she's becoming a young woman. The daughter's feelings might have been hurt, the husband rolled his eyes, and the daughter is acting out.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural norms. In many societies, as children enter puberty, parents often set boundaries around modesty, especially regarding privacy and appropriate clothing in the presence of the opposite parent. The parent is trying to teach her about body autonomy and societal expectations. However, the approach is direct and might not consider the daughter's feelings. The parent's intention seems good, but the method could be harsh.\n\nNext, the daughter's age is 12. At this age, children are becoming more self-conscious. The parent's comment might come across as critical, especially if the daughter isn't used to such direct feedback. The parent could have addressed the issue in a more gentle way, maybe by discussing body respect without making it a gendered issue or making the daughter feel embarrassed.\n\nThe husband's reaction of rolling eyes suggests he might not agree with the approach, but he's avoiding the conversation. This could mean the parent is handling it alone, which might not be the best strategy. Family discussions about such matters often require a united front or at least supportive communication. The parent's directness might have caused the daughter to feel misunderstood or upset.\n\nIs the parent in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. On one hand, setting boundaries regarding modesty and privacy is reasonable. On the other hand, the way it was communicated might have been too abrupt, not considering the daughter's emotional state. The key is whether the parent's intent was to protect and guide, which it seems like, but the method could be improved. Therefore, the answer would be B (not in the wrong), but with the caveat that the approach could be more empathetic.\n"
