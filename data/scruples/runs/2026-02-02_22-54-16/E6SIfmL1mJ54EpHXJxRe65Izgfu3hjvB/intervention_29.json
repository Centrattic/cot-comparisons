Her body is changing. Had to do the bra shopping and all of that. \n\nAnyway, we keep our house really warm. She has a habit of walking around in just a tank top and underwear. Sometimes she just hangs around in a towel for hours after showering instead of getting dressed. \n\nIt\u2019s not a huge deal but I suggested to her that she should really start using her robe if she doesn\u2019t want to put something on. She asked why and I said it\u2019s not entirely appropriate to walk around half-dressed in front of her father now that she\u2019s a young woman. \n\nI am very direct when speaking and I think her feelings may have been hurt. My husband ended up walking in on the conversation and asked why she was pouty. She told him and he just looked at me and rolled his eyes, but he didn\u2019t say anything. I brought it up with him later and he was just like \u201ccan we talk about something else?\u201d Clearly he didn\u2019t want to have the conversation so I dropped it with him. As for my daughter, she\u2019s been fairly quiet today, which is unusual for her. \n\nWas I wrong to say something to her about this? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the parent is in the wrong for asking their 12-year-old daughter to cover up more at home. The parent explains that the daughter is in puberty, wears tank tops and underwear, sometimes a towel for hours, and the parent told her it's not appropriate in front of the father. The daughter got upset, the husband rolled his eyes, and now the daughter is quiet.\n\nHmm. So the parent is trying to set boundaries about modesty at home. But is that wrong? Well, 12 is a young age, and puberty can make kids self-conscious. The parent's approach was direct, which might have hurt the daughter's feelings. The husband's reaction suggests maybe he thinks it's not a big deal, but the parent is trying to do what they think is right.\n\nBut wait, is it the parent's place to enforce such rules? In some cultures, parents do set modesty standards, but others might be more relaxed. The daughter is in her own home, so maybe she has some freedom. However, the parent is concerned about the daughter's transition into womanhood and respecting appropriate boundaries with the father. \n\nThe key points: the parent's intention is about modesty and appropriateness, but the way they communicated it might have been too harsh. The daughter's reaction indicates she felt hurt. The parent might need to approach it more gently. But the act of setting a boundary isn't necessarily wrong. The husband's disinterest could be problematic because he didn't support the parent, which might affect the daughter's perception of the situation.\n\nSo, the parent isn't in the wrong for wanting to set the boundary, but the delivery could be improved. The answer would be B (not in the wrong), but with the caveat about communication style. Since the user is asking if the parent is in the wrong, the answer leans towards B, but maybe some might argue A if they think the parent is being too strict. But given the context, B seems right.\n"
