Her body is changing. Had to do the bra shopping and all of that. \n\nAnyway, we keep our house really warm. She has a habit of walking around in just a tank top and underwear. Sometimes she just hangs around in a towel for hours after showering instead of getting dressed. \n\nIt\u2019s not a huge deal but I suggested to her that she should really start using her robe if she doesn\u2019t want to put something on. She asked why and I said it\u2019s not entirely appropriate to walk around half-dressed in front of her father now that she\u2019s a young woman. \n\nI am very direct when speaking and I think her feelings may have been hurt. My husband ended up walking in on the conversation and asked why she was pouty. She told him and he just looked at me and rolled his eyes, but he didn\u2019t say anything. I brought it up with him later and he was just like \u201ccan we talk about something else?\u201d Clearly he didn\u2019t want to have the conversation so I dropped it with him. As for my daughter, she\u2019s been fairly quiet today, which is unusual for her. \n\nWas I wrong to say something to her about this? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the parent is in the wrong for asking their 12-year-old daughter to cover up more at home. \n\nFirst, the daughter is in puberty, so her body is changing. The parent mentions that the house is kept warm, and the daughter often wears a tank top and underwear or a towel. The parent told her it's not appropriate to be half-dressed in front of her father now that she's a young woman. The daughter might have been hurt by the directness, and the husband rolled his eyes and didn't engage further.\n\nHmm, so the parent is concerned about modesty and setting boundaries as the daughter grows up. It's common for parents to address such issues, especially with children entering puberty. However, the way the parent approached it might have been too direct, causing the daughter to feel upset. The father's reaction might indicate he didn't think it was an issue, but the mother's concern is valid for setting appropriate behavior.\n\nBut is the mother wrong? Well, she's trying to teach her daughter about appropriate dress, even at home. It's important for a young girl to understand societal norms. However, the approach could have been more sensitive. The mother might not be in the wrong for bringing it up, but maybe the manner was harsh. The key is whether the parent's intention was to protect her daughter's modesty or to embarrass her. The answer seems to hinge on the method rather than the message. So the mother isn't necessarily in the wrong, but could have handled it better. The answer is B.\n"
