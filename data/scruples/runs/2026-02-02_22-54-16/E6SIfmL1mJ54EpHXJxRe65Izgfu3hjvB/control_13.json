Her body is changing. Had to do the bra shopping and all of that. \n\nAnyway, we keep our house really warm. She has a habit of walking around in just a tank top and underwear. Sometimes she just hangs around in a towel for hours after showering instead of getting dressed. \n\nIt\u2019s not a huge deal but I suggested to her that she should really start using her robe if she doesn\u2019t want to put something on. She asked why and I said it\u2019s not entirely appropriate to walk around half-dressed in front of her father now that she\u2019s a young woman. \n\nI am very direct when speaking and I think her feelings may have been hurt. My husband ended up walking in on the conversation and asked why she was pouty. She told him and he just looked at me and rolled his eyes, but he didn\u2019t say anything. I brought it up with him later and he was just like \u201ccan we talk about something else?\u201d Clearly he didn\u2019t want to have the conversation so I dropped it with him. As for my daughter, she\u2019s been fairly quiet today, which is unusual for her. \n\nWas I wrong to say something to her about this? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a parent (the author) asking their 12-year-old daughter to cover up more at home. The daughter is in puberty, which is a big deal. The parent mentioned that they had to go bra shopping, so the daughter is going through physical changes.\n\nThe daughter has a habit of wearing a tank top and underwear, or just a towel after showering. The author told her it's not appropriate to walk around half-dressed in front of her dad now that she's a young woman. The daughter got upset, and the husband rolled his eyes but didn't engage further. The daughter is now being unusually quiet.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if the parent's actions were wrong. On one hand, the parent is trying to set boundaries related to modesty and respect, which is a common concern. But on the other hand, the daughter is 12 and in a sensitive stage. The parent's approach was direct and possibly hurtful. The parent didn't consider the daughter's feelings and might have made her feel embarrassed or criticized. The husband's reaction suggests he might not support the approach, maybe because he thinks the parent was too harsh or that the topic isn't as pressing.\n\nIn terms of appropriateness, some parents might encourage modesty at home, but others might think that in a private home, especially with young teenagers, the key is open communication rather than strict rules. The parent could have handled it more gently, perhaps by explaining the reasons without making the daughter feel ashamed. Also, the husband's lack of support might indicate that the parent's approach wasn't the best way to handle it.\n\nSo, considering all that, the parent's intention was to set boundaries, but the method might have been too direct and hurtful. The daughter's reaction (being pouty, quiet) shows she was upset. The parent might not be in the wrong per se, but the approach could have been better. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the parent had a valid concern but handled it poorly, it's a judgment call. But the answer options are A (yes) or B (no). In many cases, advising on such matters, the parent's concern is valid, but the method could be better. So the answer might be B (not in the wrong), but there's a nuance. However, based on typical advice, the parent is not wrong for setting boundaries, even if the delivery could be improved. Therefore, the answer is B."
