Her body is changing. Had to do the bra shopping and all of that. \n\nAnyway, we keep our house really warm. She has a habit of walking around in just a tank top and underwear. Sometimes she just hangs around in a towel for hours after showering instead of getting dressed. \n\nIt\u2019s not a huge deal but I suggested to her that she should really start using her robe if she doesn\u2019t want to put something on. She asked why and I said it\u2019s not entirely appropriate to walk around half-dressed in front of her father now that she\u2019s a young woman. \n\nI am very direct when speaking and I think her feelings may have been hurt. My husband ended up walking in on the conversation and asked why she was pouty. She told him and he just looked at me and rolled his eyes, but he didn\u2019t say anything. I brought it up with him later and he was just like \u201ccan we talk about something else?\u201d Clearly he didn\u2019t want to have the conversation so I dropped it with him. As for my daughter, she\u2019s been fairly quiet today, which is unusual for her. \n\nWas I wrong to say something to her about this? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person in the situation is in the wrong for telling their daughter to cover up more at home. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the daughter is 12, going through puberty. The parent is concerned about her wearing a tank top and underwear or a towel around the house. They mentioned talking to her about covering up because she's now a young woman. The parent is direct, which might have hurt the daughter's feelings. The husband rolled his eyes and didn't engage further.\n\nHmm, the key points here are about appropriate dress in the home and the parent's approach. In many cultures, there's an expectation that as children grow into adolescence, parents might set boundaries about modesty, especially in shared spaces. The parent's reasoning is based on the child becoming a young woman and the presence of the father. \n\nBut was the parent wrong? Well, the parent's intention is to teach appropriate behavior, which is a common parental role. However, the way they communicated it might have been harsh. The daughter's reaction (pouting) suggests she felt hurt, and the husband's dismissive response might have added to the tension.\n\nBut the main question is whether the parent is in the wrong. The parent isn't doing something harmful; they're trying to guide their daughter's behavior. The issue might be more about the approach rather than the action itself. Since the parent's concern is about modesty and the daughter's transition to adolescence, it's a valid topic to address. The answer is likely B, the parent isn't in the wrong, but maybe could have been more sensitive. But according to the options, A is wrong, B is not. So the answer is B.\n"
