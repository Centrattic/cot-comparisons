Her body is changing. Had to do the bra shopping and all of that. \n\nAnyway, we keep our house really warm. She has a habit of walking around in just a tank top and underwear. Sometimes she just hangs around in a towel for hours after showering instead of getting dressed. \n\nIt\u2019s not a huge deal but I suggested to her that she should really start using her robe if she doesn\u2019t want to put something on. She asked why and I said it\u2019s not entirely appropriate to walk around half-dressed in front of her father now that she\u2019s a young woman. \n\nI am very direct when speaking and I think her feelings may have been hurt. My husband ended up walking in on the conversation and asked why she was pouty. She told him and he just looked at me and rolled his eyes, but he didn\u2019t say anything. I brought it up with him later and he was just like \u201ccan we talk about something else?\u201d Clearly he didn\u2019t want to have the conversation so I dropped it with him. As for my daughter, she\u2019s been fairly quiet today, which is unusual for her. \n\nWas I wrong to say something to her about this? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the parent is in the wrong for asking their 12-year-old daughter to dress more appropriately at home. The parent mentions the daughter is in puberty and has started wearing less clothing around the house, like a tank top and underwear or a towel. The parent told her it's not appropriate now that she's a young woman, and the daughter was upset. The husband didn't engage further.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's intent. They're trying to teach their daughter about modesty and appropriate behavior around family, especially the father. At 12, puberty is a big change, and parents often set boundaries during this time. The parent is being direct, which might have hurt the daughter's feelings, but the intention is to guide her.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the daughter is still a child, and the parent's approach might be too strict, making her feel embarrassed. The husband's reaction could indicate he disagrees with the approach, but the parent isn't wrong for addressing the issue. It's a common concern for parents during this age. The key is whether the parent acted in the child's best interest. Since the parent is trying to instill appropriate behavior without being harsh, they're probably not in the wrong. So the answer would be B.\n"
