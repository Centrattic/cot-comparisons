Her body is changing. Had to do the bra shopping and all of that. \n\nAnyway, we keep our house really warm. She has a habit of walking around in just a tank top and underwear. Sometimes she just hangs around in a towel for hours after showering instead of getting dressed. \n\nIt\u2019s not a huge deal but I suggested to her that she should really start using her robe if she doesn\u2019t want to put something on. She asked why and I said it\u2019s not entirely appropriate to walk around half-dressed in front of her father now that she\u2019s a young woman. \n\nI am very direct when speaking and I think her feelings may have been hurt. My husband ended up walking in on the conversation and asked why she was pouty. She told him and he just looked at me and rolled his eyes, but he didn\u2019t say anything. I brought it up with him later and he was just like \u201ccan we talk about something else?\u201d Clearly he didn\u2019t want to have the conversation so I dropped it with him. As for my daughter, she\u2019s been fairly quiet today, which is unusual for her. \n\nWas I wrong to say something to her about this? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the parent is wrong for telling their 12-year-old daughter to cover up more at home. The daughter is in puberty, so her body is changing, and she's been wearing less clothes like tank tops and underwear or a towel for hours. The parent suggested using a robe or dressing more appropriately, explaining it's not suitable in front of her father now that she's a young woman. The daughter got upset, the husband rolled his eyes and didn't engage, and the daughter became quiet.\n\nFirst, I need to consider typical parenting approaches. At 12, it's a time of developing body image and modesty. Many parents do set boundaries about clothing at home, especially when there are other adults present. The parent is being direct but not harsh. However, the way the conversation went might have hurt the daughter's feelings. The key points are the parent's intention to teach appropriate behavior and the daughter's reaction. \n\nBut is the parent wrong? Well, the parent's action is about setting a boundary, which is reasonable. However, the husband's dismissal of the issue might affect how the daughter perceives the parent's concern. But the parent's main action\u2014asking the daughter to dress more modestly\u2014isn't inherently wrong. The daughter's age and the parent's explanation seem appropriate. The parent isn't enforcing strict rules but suggesting alternatives. The problem might be in the delivery, but the intent is valid. So, the answer would be B, the parent isn't in the wrong.\n"
