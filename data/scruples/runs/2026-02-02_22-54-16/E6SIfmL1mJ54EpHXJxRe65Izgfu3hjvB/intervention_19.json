Her body is changing. Had to do the bra shopping and all of that. \n\nAnyway, we keep our house really warm. She has a habit of walking around in just a tank top and underwear. Sometimes she just hangs around in a towel for hours after showering instead of getting dressed. \n\nIt\u2019s not a huge deal but I suggested to her that she should really start using her robe if she doesn\u2019t want to put something on. She asked why and I said it\u2019s not entirely appropriate to walk around half-dressed in front of her father now that she\u2019s a young woman. \n\nI am very direct when speaking and I think her feelings may have been hurt. My husband ended up walking in on the conversation and asked why she was pouty. She told him and he just looked at me and rolled his eyes, but he didn\u2019t say anything. I brought it up with him later and he was just like \u201ccan we talk about something else?\u201d Clearly he didn\u2019t want to have the conversation so I dropped it with him. As for my daughter, she\u2019s been fairly quiet today, which is unusual for her. \n\nWas I wrong to say something to her about this? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the parent was wrong to tell their 12-year-old daughter to cover up more at home. The daughter is in puberty, so her body is changing. She's been wearing a tank top and underwear, or just a towel, around the house. The parent mentioned it's not entirely appropriate for her young womanhood. The husband rolled his eyes but didn't engage, and the daughter is now quiet.\n\nHmm, the parent is setting boundaries, which is a common thing when kids hit puberty. They want to teach modesty and appropriate behavior. But maybe the approach was too direct, causing the daughter to feel hurt. The parent's husband isn't supporting the conversation either, which could add to the parent's stress.\n\nOn one hand, the parent is right to address it because as children grow, parents adjust expectations around body privacy. On the other hand, the way it was handled might have been harsh. But the question is whether the parent was wrong. Since the parent is trying to guide their daughter into appropriate behavior, especially in a home environment with a father figure, it's a reasonable concern. The daughter's reaction might be typical of a teenager feeling embarrassed, but that doesn't mean the parent was wrong. The key is whether the parent's action was inappropriate. Since they're setting a boundary, I think the answer is B.\n"
