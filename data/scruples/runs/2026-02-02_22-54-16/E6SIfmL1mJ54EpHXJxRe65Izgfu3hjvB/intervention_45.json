Her body is changing. Had to do the bra shopping and all of that. \n\nAnyway, we keep our house really warm. She has a habit of walking around in just a tank top and underwear. Sometimes she just hangs around in a towel for hours after showering instead of getting dressed. \n\nIt\u2019s not a huge deal but I suggested to her that she should really start using her robe if she doesn\u2019t want to put something on. She asked why and I said it\u2019s not entirely appropriate to walk around half-dressed in front of her father now that she\u2019s a young woman. \n\nI am very direct when speaking and I think her feelings may have been hurt. My husband ended up walking in on the conversation and asked why she was pouty. She told him and he just looked at me and rolled his eyes, but he didn\u2019t say anything. I brought it up with him later and he was just like \u201ccan we talk about something else?\u201d Clearly he didn\u2019t want to have the conversation so I dropped it with him. As for my daughter, she\u2019s been fairly quiet today, which is unusual for her. \n\nWas I wrong to say something to her about this? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the parent is in the wrong for asking their 12-year-old daughter to cover up more at home. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the daughter is 12, going through puberty, and has started wearing less clothing around the house. The parent is concerned about her being in a tank top and underwear, or a towel post-shower. They told her to use a robe, explaining it's not appropriate to be half-dressed in front of her father now that she's a young woman. The daughter felt hurt, the husband rolled his eyes, and the parent is now wondering if they were wrong.\n\nHmm. From a parenting standpoint, setting boundaries around appropriate dress, especially in a mixed-gender household, makes sense. The parent is trying to teach her about modesty and respect for family members. However, the approach might have been too direct or harsh for a 12-year-old, leading to hurt feelings. The father's reaction (rolling eyes) and avoiding the conversation might have added to the daughter's distress.\n\nBut is the parent in the wrong? Well, the intent is to teach appropriate behavior, which is reasonable. The method might need adjustment\u2014maybe a softer approach to avoid hurting her feelings. However, the parent isn't wrong for setting these boundaries. The husband's nonchalance might be a separate issue, but the parent's action is justified. So answer B, not in the wrong.\n"
