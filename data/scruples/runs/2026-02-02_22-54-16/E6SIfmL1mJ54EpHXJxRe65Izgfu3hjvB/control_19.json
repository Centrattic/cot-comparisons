Her body is changing. Had to do the bra shopping and all of that. \n\nAnyway, we keep our house really warm. She has a habit of walking around in just a tank top and underwear. Sometimes she just hangs around in a towel for hours after showering instead of getting dressed. \n\nIt\u2019s not a huge deal but I suggested to her that she should really start using her robe if she doesn\u2019t want to put something on. She asked why and I said it\u2019s not entirely appropriate to walk around half-dressed in front of her father now that she\u2019s a young woman. \n\nI am very direct when speaking and I think her feelings may have been hurt. My husband ended up walking in on the conversation and asked why she was pouty. She told him and he just looked at me and rolled his eyes, but he didn\u2019t say anything. I brought it up with him later and he was just like \u201ccan we talk about something else?\u201d Clearly he didn\u2019t want to have the conversation so I dropped it with him. As for my daughter, she\u2019s been fairly quiet today, which is unusual for her. \n\nWas I wrong to say something to her about this? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for asking their 12-year-old daughter to cover up more at home. The daughter is in puberty, wearing tank tops and underwear, sometimes a towel for hours after showering. The parent told her it's not appropriate to be half-dressed in front of her dad now that she's a young woman. The husband rolled his eyes and didn't want to talk about it. The daughter is now quiet.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the parent's action was wrong. The key points: the daughter is 12, in puberty, and the parent is addressing her clothing choice at home. The parent's reasoning is about appropriateness in front of the father. The husband didn't support the conversation, and the daughter is upset.\n\nSo, the parent's intention is to set boundaries as the daughter is becoming a young woman. But the approach was direct, possibly causing hurt feelings. The husband's reaction might indicate he disagrees or doesn't want to engage. The question is whether the parent was wrong.\n\nIn terms of parenting, it's common to set boundaries around modesty, especially as kids enter puberty. However, the manner of delivery matters. Being direct can be okay, but if it's done without sensitivity, it might hurt the child. The daughter's reaction (being quiet, pouting) suggests she felt embarrassed or upset. The parent might not be in the wrong for the content of the message but perhaps in how it was delivered. However, the situation is nuanced. The parent is trying to teach appropriate behavior, which is a valid concern. The husband's non-supportive response is a red flag, but that's his issue, not the parent's.\n\nSo, the parent's action is about setting a boundary, which is reasonable. The issue might be the approach rather than the content. Since the question is whether the parent was wrong, the answer is likely B (not in the wrong). Unless there's a cultural or context-specific norm that makes it wrong, but the scenario doesn't suggest that. The parent's reasoning is based on the daughter's age and appropriateness in the home environment. So, the parent is not in the wrong.\n"
