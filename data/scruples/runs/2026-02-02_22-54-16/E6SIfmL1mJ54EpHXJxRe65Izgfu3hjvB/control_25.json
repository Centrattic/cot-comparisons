Her body is changing. Had to do the bra shopping and all of that. \n\nAnyway, we keep our house really warm. She has a habit of walking around in just a tank top and underwear. Sometimes she just hangs around in a towel for hours after showering instead of getting dressed. \n\nIt\u2019s not a huge deal but I suggested to her that she should really start using her robe if she doesn\u2019t want to put something on. She asked why and I said it\u2019s not entirely appropriate to walk around half-dressed in front of her father now that she\u2019s a young woman. \n\nI am very direct when speaking and I think her feelings may have been hurt. My husband ended up walking in on the conversation and asked why she was pouty. She told him and he just looked at me and rolled his eyes, but he didn\u2019t say anything. I brought it up with him later and he was just like \u201ccan we talk about something else?\u201d Clearly he didn\u2019t want to have the conversation so I dropped it with him. As for my daughter, she\u2019s been fairly quiet today, which is unusual for her. \n\nWas I wrong to say something to her about this? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for telling their 12-year-old daughter to dress more appropriately at home. The daughter is in puberty, so her body is changing. She's walking around in a tank top and underwear or a towel for hours.\n\nThe parent talked to her about using a robe or dressing more appropriately because they're a young woman now. The parent is direct, maybe hurt the daughter's feelings. The husband rolled his eyes and didn't engage further. The daughter became quiet.\n\nHmm, so the parent is concerned about modesty and setting boundaries as the child grows up. But is that wrong? Well, at 12, kids are entering adolescence. Parents often start setting boundaries around dressing modestly, especially in mixed company or within the home. The parent is trying to prepare the daughter for societal norms. However, the approach might have been too harsh or not age-appropriate. The daughter might feel her autonomy is being restricted, but she's still a child. \n\nBut the parent's intention seems good. They didn't force her to dress a certain way, just suggested using a robe. The parent addressed it respectfully by explaining it's not appropriate. The husband's reaction might indicate he sees it as unnecessary, but that's his opinion. \n\nIs there a cultural aspect here? In some cultures, modesty is emphasized more. The parent might be acting in line with their family's values. The daughter's reaction\u2014being pouty and quiet\u2014could be typical of a tween dealing with body image and parent expectations. \n\nBut is the parent wrong? Probably not. They're teaching boundaries and respect, which is part of parenting. The parent isn't forcing her to wear something, just suggesting alternatives. So the answer would be B (No), the parent isn't in the wrong. They're addressing an age-appropriate issue in a reasonable way, even if the communication could be improved.\n"
