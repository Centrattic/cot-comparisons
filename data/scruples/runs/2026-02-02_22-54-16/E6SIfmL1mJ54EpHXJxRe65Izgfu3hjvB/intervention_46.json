Her body is changing. Had to do the bra shopping and all of that. \n\nAnyway, we keep our house really warm. She has a habit of walking around in just a tank top and underwear. Sometimes she just hangs around in a towel for hours after showering instead of getting dressed. \n\nIt\u2019s not a huge deal but I suggested to her that she should really start using her robe if she doesn\u2019t want to put something on. She asked why and I said it\u2019s not entirely appropriate to walk around half-dressed in front of her father now that she\u2019s a young woman. \n\nI am very direct when speaking and I think her feelings may have been hurt. My husband ended up walking in on the conversation and asked why she was pouty. She told him and he just looked at me and rolled his eyes, but he didn\u2019t say anything. I brought it up with him later and he was just like \u201ccan we talk about something else?\u201d Clearly he didn\u2019t want to have the conversation so I dropped it with him. As for my daughter, she\u2019s been fairly quiet today, which is unusual for her. \n\nWas I wrong to say something to her about this? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for telling their 12-year-old daughter to cover up more at home. The parent is a woman, and the daughter is walking around in a tank top and underwear or a towel. The parent explained that since she's in puberty, it's not appropriate to be half-dressed in front of her father.\n\nHmm, first, I need to consider cultural norms. In many Western societies, parents often set boundaries about modesty, especially as kids enter puberty. The parent is trying to instill a sense of appropriateness regarding body exposure, even at home. But there's also the aspect of the daughter's autonomy here. At 12, she's a child, so the parent has the right to set rules. However, the approach matters. The parent was direct and maybe hurt the daughter's feelings. But was that wrong?\n\nThe husband rolled his eyes and didn't engage, which might indicate some conflict in the parenting style. But the user isn't asking about the husband\u2014just the parent in question. The parent's intention is to teach modesty and respect for family boundaries. However, some people might argue that a child should feel comfortable in her own home and that the parent is being overly strict. But considering the daughter is in puberty, body changes, and the parent's role in guiding her. \n\nAlso, the parent mentioned the daughter is walking around in a towel for hours. That might be a bit much, even in a warm house. The parent is trying to avoid the daughter being inappropriately dressed around her father. It's about teaching her to respect her body and the presence of others. So, I think the parent is not in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
