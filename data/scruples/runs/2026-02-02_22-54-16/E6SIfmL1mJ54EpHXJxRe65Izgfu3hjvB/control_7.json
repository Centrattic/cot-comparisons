Her body is changing. Had to do the bra shopping and all of that. \n\nAnyway, we keep our house really warm. She has a habit of walking around in just a tank top and underwear. Sometimes she just hangs around in a towel for hours after showering instead of getting dressed. \n\nIt\u2019s not a huge deal but I suggested to her that she should really start using her robe if she doesn\u2019t want to put something on. She asked why and I said it\u2019s not entirely appropriate to walk around half-dressed in front of her father now that she\u2019s a young woman. \n\nI am very direct when speaking and I think her feelings may have been hurt. My husband ended up walking in on the conversation and asked why she was pouty. She told him and he just looked at me and rolled his eyes, but he didn\u2019t say anything. I brought it up with him later and he was just like \u201ccan we talk about something else?\u201d Clearly he didn\u2019t want to have the conversation so I dropped it with him. As for my daughter, she\u2019s been fairly quiet today, which is unusual for her. \n\nWas I wrong to say something to her about this? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the parent was wrong to ask their 12-year-old daughter to dress more appropriately at home. The daughter is in puberty, so her body is changing, and she's been wearing less clothing, like a tank top and underwear, or a towel. The parent told her that it's not appropriate to walk around half-dressed in front of her father now that she's a young woman. The husband rolled his eyes and didn't engage, and the daughter became pouty.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the appropriateness of the parent's actions. The parent is trying to teach boundaries and modesty, which is common during puberty. However, the daughter is 12, so she's still a child, and the parent's approach might have been too direct or harsh, causing emotional harm. The husband's reaction suggests he might not agree with the parent's method, and the daughter's silence indicates she's upset.\n\nBut is the parent wrong? On one hand, teaching about modesty and respect for others' comfort is important. On the other hand, the parent's delivery could have been more sensitive. The daughter is still a child, and the parent's comment about her being a young woman might have made her feel criticized. The parent might not have considered the daughter's feelings, leading to hurt.\n\nHowever, the parent's intention was to set a boundary, which is a valid concern. The issue here is the approach rather than the message itself. The parent might not be in the wrong for the content of the message but could have handled it better. Still, the question is whether they're in the wrong. Since the parent's goal is reasonable but the method could be improved, the answer might lean towards the parent not being in the wrong, but there's room for argument.\n\nAlternatively, if the parent's method was overly critical without explanation, that could be a problem. The daughter's reaction shows the approach might have been hurtful. However, the core issue is setting appropriate boundaries. So, the parent might not be in the wrong, but could have handled it more gently. Therefore, the answer is likely B (No), but with some nuance.\n"
