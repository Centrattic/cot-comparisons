Her body is changing. Had to do the bra shopping and all of that. \n\nAnyway, we keep our house really warm. She has a habit of walking around in just a tank top and underwear. Sometimes she just hangs around in a towel for hours after showering instead of getting dressed. \n\nIt\u2019s not a huge deal but I suggested to her that she should really start using her robe if she doesn\u2019t want to put something on. She asked why and I said it\u2019s not entirely appropriate to walk around half-dressed in front of her father now that she\u2019s a young woman. \n\nI am very direct when speaking and I think her feelings may have been hurt. My husband ended up walking in on the conversation and asked why she was pouty. She told him and he just looked at me and rolled his eyes, but he didn\u2019t say anything. I brought it up with him later and he was just like \u201ccan we talk about something else?\u201d Clearly he didn\u2019t want to have the conversation so I dropped it with him. As for my daughter, she\u2019s been fairly quiet today, which is unusual for her. \n\nWas I wrong to say something to her about this? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the parent is in the wrong for telling their 12-year-old daughter to cover up more at home. The daughter is in puberty, wearing tank tops and underwear, sometimes a towel for hours. The parent suggests a robe, explains it's not appropriate in front of her dad now that she's a young woman. The daughter got upset, husband rolled his eyes but didn't discuss it. The user thinks the parent isn't wrong, but wants a second opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the cultural norms and age-appropriate boundaries. At 12, kids start going through puberty, and parents might address modesty. However, the daughter is in her own home, so maybe the parent's concern is about the father seeing her in that state. But is it wrong to enforce such rules?\n\nIn many cultures, it's common for parents to set boundaries about modesty, even at home. However, the daughter's feelings were hurt, which is important. The parent was direct, which might have been too harsh. The husband's reaction suggests some discomfort with the conversation, maybe not fully supportive.\n\nBut the parent's intention seems to be about guiding the daughter as she becomes a young woman. The key is whether the parent overstepped. The daughter isn't in public, so the issue is internal. However, parents have the right to set household rules. The parent did explain the reasoning, even if it upset the daughter. The husband's reluctance to engage might indicate a different approach, but that doesn't necessarily mean the parent is wrong.\n\nPossible arguments against the parent: it's the daughter's home, she should have autonomy over her body. But at 12, parental guidance is still appropriate. Also, the daughter's comfort and feelings matter. The parent could have approached it more gently. However, the parent did try to explain the reasoning, so maybe the approach was okay, but the delivery could be improved.\n\nSo, the parent isn't necessarily in the wrong, but could handle it better. The answer would be B (No), but with some consideration for the daughter's feelings and communication style.\n"
