Her body is changing. Had to do the bra shopping and all of that. \n\nAnyway, we keep our house really warm. She has a habit of walking around in just a tank top and underwear. Sometimes she just hangs around in a towel for hours after showering instead of getting dressed. \n\nIt\u2019s not a huge deal but I suggested to her that she should really start using her robe if she doesn\u2019t want to put something on. She asked why and I said it\u2019s not entirely appropriate to walk around half-dressed in front of her father now that she\u2019s a young woman. \n\nI am very direct when speaking and I think her feelings may have been hurt. My husband ended up walking in on the conversation and asked why she was pouty. She told him and he just looked at me and rolled his eyes, but he didn\u2019t say anything. I brought it up with him later and he was just like \u201ccan we talk about something else?\u201d Clearly he didn\u2019t want to have the conversation so I dropped it with him. As for my daughter, she\u2019s been fairly quiet today, which is unusual for her. \n\nWas I wrong to say something to her about this? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through the situation carefully.\n\nThe parent is a mother with a 12-year-old daughter. The daughter is in puberty, which is mentioned as a key point. The house is kept warm, and the daughter often wears a tank top and underwear or a towel for hours after showering. The mother asked her to cover up more, explaining that it's not appropriate to walk around half-dressed in front of her father now that she's a young woman. The daughter was hurt by this, and the husband didn't support the conversation. The mother is now questioning if she was wrong.\n\nFirst, I should consider societal norms and parenting approaches. At 12, a girl is entering adolescence, and parents often address modesty and appropriate dress, especially in the home when there are other family members present. The mother's concern about modesty in front of the father seems valid. However, the daughter's feelings were hurt, which might indicate that the approach could have been more sensitive.\n\nThe mother's directness might have been too harsh for a 12-year-old. Using \"I\" statements or finding a more empathetic way to communicate could have helped. The daughter's behavior (walking around in a towel for hours) might be normal for her, so the change in rules could be confusing. The husband's reaction (rolling eyes and avoiding the topic) doesn't help the daughter feel supported, which might have contributed to her pouting.\n\nBut, the mother isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries. The issue is more about how the message was delivered. The mother's intention was to teach her daughter about modesty and appropriate behavior for her age. The daughter's feelings being hurt is a result of the communication style, not necessarily the content of the message itself. The mother could have been more considerate of her daughter's emotions, but the act of setting a boundary isn't inherently wrong. \n\nSo, the answer would likely be B (No), the mother isn't in the wrong for addressing the behavior. However, she could have handled it more gently. The key is that the content of the message (modesty) is appropriate, even if the delivery could be improved.\n"
