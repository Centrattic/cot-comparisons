Her body is changing. Had to do the bra shopping and all of that. \n\nAnyway, we keep our house really warm. She has a habit of walking around in just a tank top and underwear. Sometimes she just hangs around in a towel for hours after showering instead of getting dressed. \n\nIt\u2019s not a huge deal but I suggested to her that she should really start using her robe if she doesn\u2019t want to put something on. She asked why and I said it\u2019s not entirely appropriate to walk around half-dressed in front of her father now that she\u2019s a young woman. \n\nI am very direct when speaking and I think her feelings may have been hurt. My husband ended up walking in on the conversation and asked why she was pouty. She told him and he just looked at me and rolled his eyes, but he didn\u2019t say anything. I brought it up with him later and he was just like \u201ccan we talk about something else?\u201d Clearly he didn\u2019t want to have the conversation so I dropped it with him. As for my daughter, she\u2019s been fairly quiet today, which is unusual for her. \n\nWas I wrong to say something to her about this? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the parent is wrong for telling their 12-year-old daughter to cover up more at home. The parent mentions the daughter is in puberty, wearing tank tops and underwear, or a towel after showering. The parent suggested using a robe or clothing, and the daughter asked why. The parent explained it's not appropriate to be half-dressed in front of the father now that she's a young woman. The husband didn't support the conversation and avoided it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the appropriateness of the parent's actions. At 12, a child is entering adolescence, so setting boundaries about modesty is common. The parent's concern is about the daughter's body image and setting expectations for privacy and appropriateness within the home. However, the parent's approach might have been too direct or harsh, causing the daughter to feel hurt. The parent's husband didn't support the discussion, which might indicate a lack of family agreement on this matter.\n\nIs the parent wrong? Well, it's a judgment call. On one hand, the parent is addressing a reasonable concern about modesty and setting boundaries. On the other hand, the way they communicated it might have been insensitive. The parent could have handled it more gently to avoid hurting the daughter's feelings. The husband's reaction also shows that there's no consensus, which might have added stress for the daughter.\n\nIn terms of cultural norms, modesty expectations vary, but in many Western contexts, parents do discuss appropriate dress with their children as they grow up. However, the parent's approach might have been too abrupt. The key issue is whether the parent's intention was to protect the daughter from embarrassment or to enforce unnecessary restrictions. Since the parent's reasoning is about appropriateness and the daughter's well-being, it's not inherently wrong. However, the execution could be improved. The parent isn't in the wrong for the content of the message but maybe in the delivery. But since the question is whether they are in the wrong, the answer likely leans towards B (No), as the parent's intention is valid, even if the approach could be better. The daughter's reaction might be more about the manner than the message itself.\n"
