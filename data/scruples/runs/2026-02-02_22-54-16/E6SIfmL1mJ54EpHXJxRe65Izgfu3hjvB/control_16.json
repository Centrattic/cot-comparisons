Her body is changing. Had to do the bra shopping and all of that. \n\nAnyway, we keep our house really warm. She has a habit of walking around in just a tank top and underwear. Sometimes she just hangs around in a towel for hours after showering instead of getting dressed. \n\nIt\u2019s not a huge deal but I suggested to her that she should really start using her robe if she doesn\u2019t want to put something on. She asked why and I said it\u2019s not entirely appropriate to walk around half-dressed in front of her father now that she\u2019s a young woman. \n\nI am very direct when speaking and I think her feelings may have been hurt. My husband ended up walking in on the conversation and asked why she was pouty. She told him and he just looked at me and rolled his eyes, but he didn\u2019t say anything. I brought it up with him later and he was just like \u201ccan we talk about something else?\u201d Clearly he didn\u2019t want to have the conversation so I dropped it with him. As for my daughter, she\u2019s been fairly quiet today, which is unusual for her. \n\nWas I wrong to say something to her about this? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling her 12-year-old daughter to cover up more at home. The daughter is in puberty, wearing tank tops and underwear, sometimes a towel for hours. The mother told her it's not appropriate to be half-dressed in front of the father now that she's a young woman. The daughter was upset, husband was dismissive.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural norms. In many cultures, parents do set boundaries about clothing, especially regarding modesty. The daughter is young, so the mother is probably trying to teach her about appropriate behavior. However, the daughter's reaction and the husband's dismissal might indicate a conflict in parenting styles.\n\nThe mother's approach was direct, which might have been too harsh for a 12-year-old. Maybe she didn't explain the reasoning well enough or was too abrupt, causing the daughter to feel hurt. The husband's reaction of rolling eyes suggests he disagrees with the mother's approach, but he avoids the conversation. That could lead to inconsistency in parenting.\n\nIs the mother wrong? Well, she's trying to instill values, but the method might be the issue. The daughter is in a sensitive age where body image is developing. The mother's intention is valid, but the execution could be improved. The husband's lack of support might also play a role in making the daughter feel unsupported. So, the answer is probably B (not in the wrong) because the mother's intent is reasonable, but she might need a more gentle approach and better communication with her husband.\n"
