Her body is changing. Had to do the bra shopping and all of that. \n\nAnyway, we keep our house really warm. She has a habit of walking around in just a tank top and underwear. Sometimes she just hangs around in a towel for hours after showering instead of getting dressed. \n\nIt\u2019s not a huge deal but I suggested to her that she should really start using her robe if she doesn\u2019t want to put something on. She asked why and I said it\u2019s not entirely appropriate to walk around half-dressed in front of her father now that she\u2019s a young woman. \n\nI am very direct when speaking and I think her feelings may have been hurt. My husband ended up walking in on the conversation and asked why she was pouty. She told him and he just looked at me and rolled his eyes, but he didn\u2019t say anything. I brought it up with him later and he was just like \u201ccan we talk about something else?\u201d Clearly he didn\u2019t want to have the conversation so I dropped it with him. As for my daughter, she\u2019s been fairly quiet today, which is unusual for her. \n\nWas I wrong to say something to her about this? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for asking their 12-year-old daughter to cover up more at home. The parent mentions their daughter is going through puberty and has started wearing less, like tank tops and underwear, or a towel for hours after showers. The parent told her it's not appropriate to be half-dressed in front of the father now that she's a young woman. The husband didn't support the conversation and avoided it, making the daughter quiet.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. At 12, puberty is common, and body changes can lead to such discussions. The parent is setting boundaries about modesty in the home. But is that appropriate? Well, in many cultures, parents do set rules about privacy and modesty, especially in mixed-gender households. However, the daughter is still a child, so the approach might matter. The parent was direct, which might have hurt her feelings. The husband's reaction suggests he didn't support the approach, possibly seeing it as overstepping or not necessary at her age. The daughter being pouty and quiet shows she's upset.\n\nIs the parent wrong? Well, the parent's intention is to set boundaries, which is a normal part of parenting. But the way they did it\u2014being very direct without considering the daughter's feelings\u2014could be an issue. Also, the daughter is 12, still a child, so maybe the parent's expectation is too strict. However, the parent is addressing a real concern about modesty and privacy. The key here is whether the parent overstepped. Since the daughter is in her own home, parents do have a role in setting such rules. However, the parent's approach caused emotional distress, which might indicate they could have handled it more sensitively. But the act of asking her to cover up isn't inherently wrong. The husband's dismissal might contribute to the problem, but the question is about the parent's action. So, the answer is likely B (Not in the wrong), but with a note that the approach could be improved.\n"
