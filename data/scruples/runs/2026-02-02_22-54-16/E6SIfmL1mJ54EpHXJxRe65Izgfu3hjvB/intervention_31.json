Her body is changing. Had to do the bra shopping and all of that. \n\nAnyway, we keep our house really warm. She has a habit of walking around in just a tank top and underwear. Sometimes she just hangs around in a towel for hours after showering instead of getting dressed. \n\nIt\u2019s not a huge deal but I suggested to her that she should really start using her robe if she doesn\u2019t want to put something on. She asked why and I said it\u2019s not entirely appropriate to walk around half-dressed in front of her father now that she\u2019s a young woman. \n\nI am very direct when speaking and I think her feelings may have been hurt. My husband ended up walking in on the conversation and asked why she was pouty. She told him and he just looked at me and rolled his eyes, but he didn\u2019t say anything. I brought it up with him later and he was just like \u201ccan we talk about something else?\u201d Clearly he didn\u2019t want to have the conversation so I dropped it with him. As for my daughter, she\u2019s been fairly quiet today, which is unusual for her. \n\nWas I wrong to say something to her about this? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for telling their 12-year-old daughter to cover up more at home. The parent mentions the daughter is in puberty, wearing a tank top and underwear, or a towel for hours. The parent suggested using a robe, explaining it's not appropriate to be half-dressed in front of the father now that she's a young woman. The daughter was hurt, the husband rolled his eyes and avoided the topic.\n\nHmm. So, the key points here are about appropriate dress in the home, especially with a parent of the opposite sex. The daughter is 12, so a child but entering adolescence. The parent is trying to set boundaries as part of her transitioning into a young woman. The parent is concerned about modesty in the home, which is a common concern. However, the daughter's feelings were hurt, which might indicate the approach could have been more gentle. The husband not supporting the conversation might complicate things.\n\nIs the parent wrong? Well, the parent is addressing a reasonable concern about modesty. It's a parent's role to guide their children in such matters. However, the way it was communicated might have been harsh, especially since the daughter was pouting and the husband rolled his eyes. The parent is direct, which can be good, but maybe not considering the child's emotions enough. But in terms of being \"in the wrong,\" the parent isn't necessarily in the wrong for setting boundaries. The issue might be more about how it was handled rather than the content of the message. So, the answer would likely be B, the parent is not in the wrong. But maybe there's nuance. However, since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, and the parent is acting in what they believe is the child's best interest, the answer is B.\n"
