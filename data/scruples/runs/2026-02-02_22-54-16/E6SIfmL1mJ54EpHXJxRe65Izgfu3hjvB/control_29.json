Her body is changing. Had to do the bra shopping and all of that. \n\nAnyway, we keep our house really warm. She has a habit of walking around in just a tank top and underwear. Sometimes she just hangs around in a towel for hours after showering instead of getting dressed. \n\nIt\u2019s not a huge deal but I suggested to her that she should really start using her robe if she doesn\u2019t want to put something on. She asked why and I said it\u2019s not entirely appropriate to walk around half-dressed in front of her father now that she\u2019s a young woman. \n\nI am very direct when speaking and I think her feelings may have been hurt. My husband ended up walking in on the conversation and asked why she was pouty. She told him and he just looked at me and rolled his eyes, but he didn\u2019t say anything. I brought it up with him later and he was just like \u201ccan we talk about something else?\u201d Clearly he didn\u2019t want to have the conversation so I dropped it with him. As for my daughter, she\u2019s been fairly quiet today, which is unusual for her. \n\nWas I wrong to say something to her about this? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the parent is wrong for asking their 12-year-old daughter to dress more appropriately at home. The daughter is in puberty, so her body is changing. The parent mentions that the house is kept warm, and the daughter often wears a tank top and underwear or a towel for hours after showering. The parent suggested using a robe or dressing more appropriately, explaining that it's not suitable for her father now that she's a young woman. The daughter was upset, the husband was dismissive, and the daughter is quiet now.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural norms. In many cultures, parents set boundaries about dress, especially for their children's modesty. The parent is trying to teach her daughter about appropriate behavior as she grows up. However, at 12, the daughter is in a sensitive age where she's becoming more aware of her body and autonomy. The parent's approach was direct, which might have hurt her feelings. The parent's reasoning makes sense\u2014modesty in front of the father as she becomes a young woman\u2014but the delivery might have been too harsh or not age-appropriate. The father's reaction (rolling eyes) could have undermined the message, making the daughter feel that it's not important, which might contribute to her being pouty.\n\nIs the parent wrong? It's about balancing teaching modesty with respecting the child's feelings. The parent's intention is valid, but the approach could have been more gentle, especially considering the daughter's age and the emotional impact. The parent might not be entirely wrong, but the way they handled it could use improvement. However, the question is whether the parent is in the wrong. Since the parent's main concern is about appropriateness and teaching boundaries, which is a common parental role, the answer might be that they're not wrong. But there's room for them to adjust their method to be more considerate of the daughter's emotions.\n"
