Her body is changing. Had to do the bra shopping and all of that. \n\nAnyway, we keep our house really warm. She has a habit of walking around in just a tank top and underwear. Sometimes she just hangs around in a towel for hours after showering instead of getting dressed. \n\nIt\u2019s not a huge deal but I suggested to her that she should really start using her robe if she doesn\u2019t want to put something on. She asked why and I said it\u2019s not entirely appropriate to walk around half-dressed in front of her father now that she\u2019s a young woman. \n\nI am very direct when speaking and I think her feelings may have been hurt. My husband ended up walking in on the conversation and asked why she was pouty. She told him and he just looked at me and rolled his eyes, but he didn\u2019t say anything. I brought it up with him later and he was just like \u201ccan we talk about something else?\u201d Clearly he didn\u2019t want to have the conversation so I dropped it with him. As for my daughter, she\u2019s been fairly quiet today, which is unusual for her. \n\nWas I wrong to say something to her about this? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user wants to know if the parent is in the wrong for asking their 12-year-old daughter to dress more appropriately at home. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The daughter is 12, going through puberty, which is a natural part of growing up. The parent mentions that the house is kept warm, and the daughter often wears a tank top and underwear or a towel for long periods. The parent suggested using a robe or dressing more appropriately, explaining that it's not suitable for her to be half-dressed in front of her father now that she's a young woman.\n\nSo, from a parental perspective, setting boundaries about appropriate dress, especially as a child becomes a teenager, is common. However, the daughter's reaction and the husband's response are important. The parent was direct, which might have upset the daughter, causing her to be pouty. The husband rolled his eyes and avoided the conversation, which could indicate he doesn't support the approach.\n\nNow, considering cultural and individual differences. In some cultures or families, modesty at home is important, so the parent's concern is valid. But a 12-year-old is still a child, and while puberty is happening, the parent's approach might come across as too strict or premature. The daughter might feel her autonomy is being restricted, leading to hurt feelings. The parent's justification is about appropriateness in front of her father, but the daughter is still a minor, and the parent's primary role is to guide and protect, not necessarily enforce adult standards of modesty at that age.\n\nThe husband's reaction suggests he might not see the issue, which could mean there's a difference in parenting styles. The parent might be overstepping by using the father's presence as a reason, especially if the daughter is comfortable at home. However, the parent is trying to prepare her for future social norms. \n\nOn the other hand, the parent isn't forcing the daughter to dress in a certain way, just suggesting it. The key here is whether the parent's approach was reasonable. Being direct is okay, but the daughter's emotional response indicates that the method might have been harsh. The parent might not be in the wrong for setting boundaries but could have handled it more sensitively.\n\nSo, considering all angles, the parent's intention is good, but the execution might have been lacking. The answer would likely be B (the author is not in the wrong) because setting appropriate boundaries is part of parenting, even if the approach could be improved.\n"
