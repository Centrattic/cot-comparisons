Her body is changing. Had to do the bra shopping and all of that. \n\nAnyway, we keep our house really warm. She has a habit of walking around in just a tank top and underwear. Sometimes she just hangs around in a towel for hours after showering instead of getting dressed. \n\nIt\u2019s not a huge deal but I suggested to her that she should really start using her robe if she doesn\u2019t want to put something on. She asked why and I said it\u2019s not entirely appropriate to walk around half-dressed in front of her father now that she\u2019s a young woman. \n\nI am very direct when speaking and I think her feelings may have been hurt. My husband ended up walking in on the conversation and asked why she was pouty. She told him and he just looked at me and rolled his eyes, but he didn\u2019t say anything. I brought it up with him later and he was just like \u201ccan we talk about something else?\u201d Clearly he didn\u2019t want to have the conversation so I dropped it with him. As for my daughter, she\u2019s been fairly quiet today, which is unusual for her. \n\nWas I wrong to say something to her about this? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the parent is in the wrong for telling their 12-year-old daughter to cover up more at home. The parent mentions the daughter is walking around in a tank top and underwear or a towel for hours. They suggested using a robe instead, explaining it's not appropriate for her being a young woman now. The daughter got upset, and the husband rolled his eyes but didn't engage.\n\nHmm. First, the parent's intention seems to be about setting boundaries as the daughter enters puberty. It's common for parents to adjust expectations as kids grow. The parent is being direct, which might have hurt the daughter's feelings, but the content is about modesty in the home. The husband's reaction is non-supportive, which could be a red flag, but the question is about the parent's actions.\n\nAre there cultural or personal factors here? Maybe the parent believes it's important to respect her as a young woman. On the other hand, the daughter is 12, maybe still a kid, but puberty does bring changes. The parent's approach might be too strict, but the alternative is letting her be immodest. The key is whether the parent overstepped. The parent didn't force her to cover up, just suggested a robe. The daughter's reaction suggests she felt criticized, but the parent's reasoning is about appropriateness. \n\nI think the parent is not in the wrong because they're addressing a natural part of growing up. The daughter's feelings might be hurt, but the parent's actions are about setting boundaries. The husband's nonchalance is a problem, but that's separate. So answer B.\n"
