Her body is changing. Had to do the bra shopping and all of that. \n\nAnyway, we keep our house really warm. She has a habit of walking around in just a tank top and underwear. Sometimes she just hangs around in a towel for hours after showering instead of getting dressed. \n\nIt\u2019s not a huge deal but I suggested to her that she should really start using her robe if she doesn\u2019t want to put something on. She asked why and I said it\u2019s not entirely appropriate to walk around half-dressed in front of her father now that she\u2019s a young woman. \n\nI am very direct when speaking and I think her feelings may have been hurt. My husband ended up walking in on the conversation and asked why she was pouty. She told him and he just looked at me and rolled his eyes, but he didn\u2019t say anything. I brought it up with him later and he was just like \u201ccan we talk about something else?\u201d Clearly he didn\u2019t want to have the conversation so I dropped it with him. As for my daughter, she\u2019s been fairly quiet today, which is unusual for her. \n\nWas I wrong to say something to her about this? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the parent is in the wrong for telling their 12-year-old daughter to cover up more at home. The daughter is in puberty, and she's been wearing a tank top and underwear or a towel for a long time after showering. The parent told her it's not appropriate to walk around half-dressed in front of her father now that she's a young woman. The daughter got hurt feelings, the husband rolled his eyes and didn't want to discuss it, and the daughter is quiet now.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age and context. At 12, puberty is starting, so body changes are happening. Wearing a tank top and underwear at home might be common for a younger child, but as a pre-teen, societal norms might shift towards more modesty, especially in a co-ed household. The parent's concern is about appropriateness in front of the father. However, it's important to note that in many cultures, even after puberty, wearing a towel or minimal clothing at home is acceptable, especially in private settings. The key here is whether the parent's request was reasonable and delivered in a sensitive manner.\n\nThe parent's approach was direct, which might have been jarring for the daughter. The daughter's reaction of being pouty suggests she felt embarrassed or upset. The husband's reaction of rolling eyes indicates he might not see the issue, which could create a conflict in the household. The parent's reasoning is based on the daughter being a \"young woman\" now, but the daughter is still a child. The parent's intention is likely to set boundaries, but the manner and the message might be confusing or hurtful.\n\nAnother angle is the daughter's autonomy. At 12, she's old enough to have some input in her clothing choices, especially at home. The parent's insistence might be overstepping, especially if the daughter isn't being immodest in public. The husband's avoidance of the discussion also suggests a lack of support, which might mean the parent is handling it alone without a united front, which can confuse the child.\n\nHowever, the parent is also trying to address a normal part of growing up. There's a balance between allowing comfort and setting boundaries. The parent isn't wrong in wanting to discuss modesty, but the approach could be improved. The question is whether the parent is in the wrong. The answer would depend on cultural norms and the specific family dynamics. In many cases, parents guide their children on modesty, but the method here might not be the best. However, the parent isn't necessarily in the wrong for trying to set such a boundary, especially considering the daughter's age and the father's presence. But there's room for a more empathetic approach.\n"
