Her body is changing. Had to do the bra shopping and all of that. \n\nAnyway, we keep our house really warm. She has a habit of walking around in just a tank top and underwear. Sometimes she just hangs around in a towel for hours after showering instead of getting dressed. \n\nIt\u2019s not a huge deal but I suggested to her that she should really start using her robe if she doesn\u2019t want to put something on. She asked why and I said it\u2019s not entirely appropriate to walk around half-dressed in front of her father now that she\u2019s a young woman. \n\nI am very direct when speaking and I think her feelings may have been hurt. My husband ended up walking in on the conversation and asked why she was pouty. She told him and he just looked at me and rolled his eyes, but he didn\u2019t say anything. I brought it up with him later and he was just like \u201ccan we talk about something else?\u201d Clearly he didn\u2019t want to have the conversation so I dropped it with him. As for my daughter, she\u2019s been fairly quiet today, which is unusual for her. \n\nWas I wrong to say something to her about this? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The question is about whether it's appropriate for a parent to ask their 12-year-old daughter to cover up more at home. \n\nFirst, the daughter is in puberty, so her body is changing. The parent mentions that the house is kept warm, and she's wearing a tank top and underwear, or just a towel after showering. The parent told her it's not appropriate to walk around half-dressed in front of the father now that she's a young woman. The parent is direct, which might have hurt the daughter's feelings. The husband didn't support the conversation and wanted to avoid the topic.\n\nSo, the main points are about modesty in the home and parent-child communication. The parent is trying to set boundaries as the daughter is growing up. The daughter's behavior might be typical for her age, but the parent is enforcing a rule. The question is whether the parent was wrong to do so.\n\nConsidering cultural norms, many parents do set boundaries about modesty at home, especially as children reach puberty. However, the way the parent communicated it might have been harsh. The daughter is 12, so she's becoming more aware of her body and might be sensitive. The parent being very direct and causing the daughter to feel hurt could be a problem in terms of communication style. The husband's reaction also suggests that the parent might have overstepped or handled it poorly.\n\nBut from another angle, the parent is trying to teach the daughter about appropriate behavior and modesty, which is a valid concern. The key issue here is whether the parent's approach was wrong. If the parent's intention is good but the method was hurtful, then maybe they are partly at fault. However, if the parent is just setting reasonable boundaries, then they might not be in the wrong.\n\nI need to consider if there's a consensus on this. Some might say the parent is justified in setting such rules, while others might say that the parent should be more understanding of the daughter's feelings and use a gentler approach. The daughter hanging around in a towel or underwear might be considered normal for some families but not for others. The parent's directness could have been a mistake in terms of how it was delivered.\n\nSo, the answer might depend on the balance between setting appropriate boundaries and the manner in which they are communicated. If the parent's actions were about safety and respect, they might be okay. But if the parent's way of saying it caused unnecessary hurt without a clear reason, then maybe they're at fault. Given the context, the parent's intention seems to be about modesty, which is acceptable, but the method might have been too harsh. However, the daughter is 12, and some level of parental guidance is expected. \n\nI think the answer leans towards B (not in the wrong) because the parent is addressing a reasonable concern about modesty as the daughter grows up. However, the communication style could be improved. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the answer options are A or B, and the parent's action is about setting boundaries, which is acceptable, but the hurt feelings come from communication style. The main issue isn't the act of setting the rule but how it was done. So maybe the author is not in the wrong for setting the rule, but perhaps the delivery was poor. However, the question is specifically about being in the wrong. Since the parent's intention is valid, the answer is B.\n"
