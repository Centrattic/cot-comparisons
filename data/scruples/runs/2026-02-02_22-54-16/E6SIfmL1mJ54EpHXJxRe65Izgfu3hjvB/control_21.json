Her body is changing. Had to do the bra shopping and all of that. \n\nAnyway, we keep our house really warm. She has a habit of walking around in just a tank top and underwear. Sometimes she just hangs around in a towel for hours after showering instead of getting dressed. \n\nIt\u2019s not a huge deal but I suggested to her that she should really start using her robe if she doesn\u2019t want to put something on. She asked why and I said it\u2019s not entirely appropriate to walk around half-dressed in front of her father now that she\u2019s a young woman. \n\nI am very direct when speaking and I think her feelings may have been hurt. My husband ended up walking in on the conversation and asked why she was pouty. She told him and he just looked at me and rolled his eyes, but he didn\u2019t say anything. I brought it up with him later and he was just like \u201ccan we talk about something else?\u201d Clearly he didn\u2019t want to have the conversation so I dropped it with him. As for my daughter, she\u2019s been fairly quiet today, which is unusual for her. \n\nWas I wrong to say something to her about this? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the parent is in the wrong for telling their 12-year-old daughter to cover up more at home. The daughter is in puberty, wearing tank tops and underwear, sometimes a towel for hours. The parent told her it's not appropriate to be half-dressed in front of her father now that she's a young woman. The husband didn't support the parent's approach.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the appropriateness of the parent's actions. At 12, a daughter is entering puberty, so body changes are happening. The parent is trying to set boundaries about modesty at home. But the question is whether that's wrong.\n\nCultural norms matter here. In some cultures, it's normal for kids to be more naked at home, but others set boundaries. The parent's reasoning is that now she's a young woman, so modesty is expected. The daughter might feel her privacy is invaded if she's being told to cover up in her own home, especially if she's used to being more comfortable.\n\nThe parent's approach was direct, which might have hurt the daughter's feelings. The husband didn't back them up, leading to tension. The daughter's reaction\u2014being quiet and pouty\u2014suggests she's upset. The parent could have handled it differently, maybe with more empathy, explaining the reasons calmly instead of being abrupt.\n\nHowever, the parent isn't wrong in wanting to set boundaries as the child becomes an adolescent. It's about teaching body respect and appropriateness in mixed company (father). The key is whether the method was wrong. The parent's concern is valid, but the delivery might have been harsh. So, the parent isn't entirely in the wrong, but could improve communication. The answer is B, not in the wrong.\n"
