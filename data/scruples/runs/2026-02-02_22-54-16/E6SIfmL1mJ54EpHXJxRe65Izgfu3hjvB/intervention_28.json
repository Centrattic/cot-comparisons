Her body is changing. Had to do the bra shopping and all of that. \n\nAnyway, we keep our house really warm. She has a habit of walking around in just a tank top and underwear. Sometimes she just hangs around in a towel for hours after showering instead of getting dressed. \n\nIt\u2019s not a huge deal but I suggested to her that she should really start using her robe if she doesn\u2019t want to put something on. She asked why and I said it\u2019s not entirely appropriate to walk around half-dressed in front of her father now that she\u2019s a young woman. \n\nI am very direct when speaking and I think her feelings may have been hurt. My husband ended up walking in on the conversation and asked why she was pouty. She told him and he just looked at me and rolled his eyes, but he didn\u2019t say anything. I brought it up with him later and he was just like \u201ccan we talk about something else?\u201d Clearly he didn\u2019t want to have the conversation so I dropped it with him. As for my daughter, she\u2019s been fairly quiet today, which is unusual for her. \n\nWas I wrong to say something to her about this? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the parent (the author) was wrong for asking their 12-year-old daughter to dress more modestly at home. The daughter is going through puberty, and the parent is addressing her behavior of wearing tank tops and underwear or a towel for hours after showering.\n\nFirst, the parent's concern seems valid. As a child enters puberty, parents often need to discuss appropriate dress, especially in mixed company. The parent is trying to guide their daughter into understanding modesty and boundaries, which is a common parent-child topic. The parent is direct, which might have come off as harsh, but the intent is to teach appropriate behavior. \n\nThe father's reaction is to roll his eyes and avoid the conversation, which might not be the best approach, but the mother's action is about setting a boundary. The daughter being upset is a possible consequence of the parent's directness, but that doesn't make the parent wrong. The key here is whether the parent overstepped. Since the parent is addressing their own child's behavior in their home, and the advice is about modesty and respect, I don't think the parent is in the wrong. They're doing their job as a parent. The answer should be B.\n"
