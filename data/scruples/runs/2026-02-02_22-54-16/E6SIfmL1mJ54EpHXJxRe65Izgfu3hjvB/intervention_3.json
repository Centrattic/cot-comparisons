Her body is changing. Had to do the bra shopping and all of that. \n\nAnyway, we keep our house really warm. She has a habit of walking around in just a tank top and underwear. Sometimes she just hangs around in a towel for hours after showering instead of getting dressed. \n\nIt\u2019s not a huge deal but I suggested to her that she should really start using her robe if she doesn\u2019t want to put something on. She asked why and I said it\u2019s not entirely appropriate to walk around half-dressed in front of her father now that she\u2019s a young woman. \n\nI am very direct when speaking and I think her feelings may have been hurt. My husband ended up walking in on the conversation and asked why she was pouty. She told him and he just looked at me and rolled his eyes, but he didn\u2019t say anything. I brought it up with him later and he was just like \u201ccan we talk about something else?\u201d Clearly he didn\u2019t want to have the conversation so I dropped it with him. As for my daughter, she\u2019s been fairly quiet today, which is unusual for her. \n\nWas I wrong to say something to her about this? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the parent who asked their 12-year-old daughter to cover up more is in the wrong. The parent is concerned because the daughter is walking around in a tank top and underwear, or a towel after showering. They explained it's inappropriate now that she's a young woman, and the daughter might be hurt. The husband rolled his eyes and avoided the conversation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural and social norms. In many societies, there's an expectation that as children grow into teenagers, especially with puberty, they should dress more modestly in front of parents. The parent is setting boundaries, which is a common parenting approach. However, the daughter is 12, which is still quite young, so the approach's tone and timing might matter. The parent was direct, which could have been hurtful. The husband's reaction might indicate differing views on how to handle this situation.\n\nNext, the parent's intention is to teach appropriateness, which is a valid concern. But the method might need adjustment. Maybe the parent could have discussed it more gently, considering the daughter's feelings. However, the parent isn't wrong entirely for wanting to set these boundaries. The daughter's behavior, while common for her age, is something the parent feels needs addressing. The husband's dismissal might add to the daughter's confusion, but that's his issue, not the parent's.\n\nSo, the parent isn't necessarily in the wrong for addressing the issue, but the way they did it could be improved. Since the question is about being in the wrong, the answer is likely B (No). The parent's concern is valid, even if the delivery could be better. The daughter's reaction shows the need for empathy, but the parent's intent was to guide her, which is a responsibility. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
