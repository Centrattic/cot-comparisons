Her body is changing. Had to do the bra shopping and all of that. \n\nAnyway, we keep our house really warm. She has a habit of walking around in just a tank top and underwear. Sometimes she just hangs around in a towel for hours after showering instead of getting dressed. \n\nIt\u2019s not a huge deal but I suggested to her that she should really start using her robe if she doesn\u2019t want to put something on. She asked why and I said it\u2019s not entirely appropriate to walk around half-dressed in front of her father now that she\u2019s a young woman. \n\nI am very direct when speaking and I think her feelings may have been hurt. My husband ended up walking in on the conversation and asked why she was pouty. She told him and he just looked at me and rolled his eyes, but he didn\u2019t say anything. I brought it up with him later and he was just like \u201ccan we talk about something else?\u201d Clearly he didn\u2019t want to have the conversation so I dropped it with him. As for my daughter, she\u2019s been fairly quiet today, which is unusual for her. \n\nWas I wrong to say something to her about this? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the parent was wrong to tell their 12-year-old daughter to cover up. The situation is that the daughter is walking around in a tank top and underwear, sometimes in a towel for hours. The parent explained it's not appropriate to be half-dressed in front of her dad now that she's a young woman.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of the child. At 12, she's entering puberty, so body changes are happening. Parents often set boundaries about modesty in the home. But the parent's approach might be key here. They were direct and maybe hurt the daughter's feelings. The dad didn't support the conversation either, which might have left the daughter confused or upset.\n\nIs the parent wrong? Well, setting boundaries about appropriate dress at home is common. However, the way it was communicated might be an issue. The parent didn't mention if they had a prior conversation about this, so maybe the daughter felt blindsided. The dad's reaction of rolling eyes and avoiding the conversation could add to the problem, making the daughter feel like the parent was overstepping. \n\nBut from a societal perspective, many parents do address modesty in their homes, especially as kids become teenagers. The parent's intention seems to be about respect and appropriateness. The daughter's reaction might be typical for a pre-teen who's sensitive to criticism. \n\nI think the parent isn't necessarily wrong in setting the boundary, but their approach could have been more empathetic. However, the question is whether they're in the wrong. If the parent's intention is good and the rule is reasonable, then maybe not. The answer might be B (not in the wrong), but the method could be improved. Alternatively, if the parent's approach was too harsh without explanation, maybe A. But given the context, the parent's reasoning is about appropriateness, so I'm leaning towards B.\n"
