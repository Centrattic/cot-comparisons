Her body is changing. Had to do the bra shopping and all of that. \n\nAnyway, we keep our house really warm. She has a habit of walking around in just a tank top and underwear. Sometimes she just hangs around in a towel for hours after showering instead of getting dressed. \n\nIt\u2019s not a huge deal but I suggested to her that she should really start using her robe if she doesn\u2019t want to put something on. She asked why and I said it\u2019s not entirely appropriate to walk around half-dressed in front of her father now that she\u2019s a young woman. \n\nI am very direct when speaking and I think her feelings may have been hurt. My husband ended up walking in on the conversation and asked why she was pouty. She told him and he just looked at me and rolled his eyes, but he didn\u2019t say anything. I brought it up with him later and he was just like \u201ccan we talk about something else?\u201d Clearly he didn\u2019t want to have the conversation so I dropped it with him. As for my daughter, she\u2019s been fairly quiet today, which is unusual for her. \n\nWas I wrong to say something to her about this? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a parent addressing their 12-year-old daughter's clothing choices at home. The parent is concerned because the daughter is in puberty and has started walking around in a tank top and underwear or a towel for long periods. The parent told her to cover up, explaining it's not appropriate for a young woman in front of her father. The daughter felt hurt, and the husband was dismissive.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's intent. They're trying to set boundaries as their child enters adolescence, which is a common concern. It's about body respect and modesty. But the daughter is 12, so maybe the parent's approach was too direct or harsh for her age? The parent is being direct, which is good, but the daughter's reaction suggests it might have been delivered without enough empathy.\n\nThe husband's reaction is also a factor. He rolled his eyes and changed the subject, which might indicate he didn't support the approach. The parent might have handled the situation better by discussing it with the husband first or approaching the daughter with more sensitivity.\n\nBut the core question is whether the parent was wrong. On one hand, setting appropriate boundaries is important. On the other, the method used might have been too abrupt. The parent's intention is valid, but the execution could be improved. So the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because the concern is reasonable, but there's room for a more considerate approach. The parent isn't wrong for addressing the issue, but could have handled it more gently.\n"
