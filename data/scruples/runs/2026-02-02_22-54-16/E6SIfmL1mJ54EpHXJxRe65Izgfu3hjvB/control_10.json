Her body is changing. Had to do the bra shopping and all of that. \n\nAnyway, we keep our house really warm. She has a habit of walking around in just a tank top and underwear. Sometimes she just hangs around in a towel for hours after showering instead of getting dressed. \n\nIt\u2019s not a huge deal but I suggested to her that she should really start using her robe if she doesn\u2019t want to put something on. She asked why and I said it\u2019s not entirely appropriate to walk around half-dressed in front of her father now that she\u2019s a young woman. \n\nI am very direct when speaking and I think her feelings may have been hurt. My husband ended up walking in on the conversation and asked why she was pouty. She told him and he just looked at me and rolled his eyes, but he didn\u2019t say anything. I brought it up with him later and he was just like \u201ccan we talk about something else?\u201d Clearly he didn\u2019t want to have the conversation so I dropped it with him. As for my daughter, she\u2019s been fairly quiet today, which is unusual for her. \n\nWas I wrong to say something to her about this? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the parent was wrong to tell their 12-year-old daughter to cover up more at home. The daughter is in puberty, wearing tank tops and underwear, sometimes a towel for hours. The parent suggested using a robe or dressing more appropriately, explaining it's not suitable for her father now that she's a young woman. The daughter might have been hurt, the husband rolled his eyes and didn't engage.\n\nFirst, the parent's intention is to set boundaries as the child grows. It's reasonable to teach modesty and respect, especially in co-ed households. The parent's directness might have been harsh, but the concern is valid. The daughter is entering a new phase, and adjusting dress for privacy is common. However, the parent could have handled it more gently to avoid hurting her feelings. The husband's reaction isn't helping, but that's a separate issue.\n\nThe question is whether the parent was wrong. The parent had a legitimate reason to address the situation, but the approach might have been too abrupt. However, the core issue isn't about being wrong but about communication style. Since the parent's goal was appropriate, even if the delivery was harsh, the answer is likely B (not wrong). The parent isn't in the wrong for addressing the behavior, just maybe how they did it.\n"
