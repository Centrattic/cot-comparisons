Her body is changing. Had to do the bra shopping and all of that. \n\nAnyway, we keep our house really warm. She has a habit of walking around in just a tank top and underwear. Sometimes she just hangs around in a towel for hours after showering instead of getting dressed. \n\nIt\u2019s not a huge deal but I suggested to her that she should really start using her robe if she doesn\u2019t want to put something on. She asked why and I said it\u2019s not entirely appropriate to walk around half-dressed in front of her father now that she\u2019s a young woman. \n\nI am very direct when speaking and I think her feelings may have been hurt. My husband ended up walking in on the conversation and asked why she was pouty. She told him and he just looked at me and rolled his eyes, but he didn\u2019t say anything. I brought it up with him later and he was just like \u201ccan we talk about something else?\u201d Clearly he didn\u2019t want to have the conversation so I dropped it with him. As for my daughter, she\u2019s been fairly quiet today, which is unusual for her. \n\nWas I wrong to say something to her about this? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the parent was wrong to ask their 12-year-old daughter to cover up more in the house. The daughter is in puberty, which is a common time for such discussions.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's intent. They mention they wanted to teach their daughter about modesty, especially since she's entering womanhood. That seems reasonable. The parent is concerned about her wearing a tank top and underwear or a towel for long periods. They suggested a robe or dressing appropriately. The parent's reasoning is about respect and appropriateness, not about prudishness.\n\nNext, the parent's approach. They were direct and it's possible they hurt the daughter's feelings. The daughter asked why, and the parent explained it's not appropriate in front of the father. The husband didn't support the discussion and avoided the topic. The daughter became quiet, which is a sign she might be upset.\n\nNow, whether the parent was in the wrong. The parent had a valid concern about modesty and setting boundaries. However, the way they handled it might have been too abrupt, especially for a 12-year-old. Puberty is a time when kids become more self-conscious, so a direct approach could be hurtful. The father's lack of support might have added to the daughter's confusion or distress.\n\nBut the parent's intention wasn't malicious. They wanted to guide their daughter, which is a responsibility. The key here is balancing the message with the delivery. The parent might not be in the wrong for the content of the message but could have handled it more sensitively. The daughter's reaction suggests that the approach could be improved, but the parent's concern is valid.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the parent isn't in the wrong for having the conversation, but maybe the method could have been adjusted. The answer would be B (No), but with the caveat that the approach might need refinement.\n"
