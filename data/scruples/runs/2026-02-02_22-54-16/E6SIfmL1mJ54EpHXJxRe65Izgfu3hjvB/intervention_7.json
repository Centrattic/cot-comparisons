Her body is changing. Had to do the bra shopping and all of that. \n\nAnyway, we keep our house really warm. She has a habit of walking around in just a tank top and underwear. Sometimes she just hangs around in a towel for hours after showering instead of getting dressed. \n\nIt\u2019s not a huge deal but I suggested to her that she should really start using her robe if she doesn\u2019t want to put something on. She asked why and I said it\u2019s not entirely appropriate to walk around half-dressed in front of her father now that she\u2019s a young woman. \n\nI am very direct when speaking and I think her feelings may have been hurt. My husband ended up walking in on the conversation and asked why she was pouty. She told him and he just looked at me and rolled his eyes, but he didn\u2019t say anything. I brought it up with him later and he was just like \u201ccan we talk about something else?\u201d Clearly he didn\u2019t want to have the conversation so I dropped it with him. As for my daughter, she\u2019s been fairly quiet today, which is unusual for her. \n\nWas I wrong to say something to her about this? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the parent (the author) is at fault for telling their 12-year-old daughter to dress more appropriately at home. The daughter is going through puberty, walks around in a tank top and underwear, or a towel after showers. The parent addressed it, explaining it's not appropriate to be half-dressed in front of her father now that she's a young woman. The husband didn't support the conversation, and the daughter was upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural norms and parenting practices. In many Western cultures, it's common for parents to discuss body privacy with children as they enter puberty. The parent is trying to teach her daughter about modesty in the presence of others, especially a parent of the opposite sex. The daughter's behavior, while perhaps not harmful, is being addressed to set boundaries. \n\nThe parent's approach was direct, which might have hurt the daughter's feelings. However, the parent's intention seems to be about setting appropriate boundaries, not being overly strict. The husband's reaction (rolling eyes, avoiding the topic) might indicate a different parenting style, but the author isn't in the wrong for having that conversation. \n\nPossible arguments against the author: Maybe the daughter isn't old enough for such rules, or the parent is being too strict. But 12 is a typical age for puberty, and this is a natural part of parenting. The parent isn't punishing her; they're setting expectations. The key here is whether the parent's actions are reasonable. Since the daughter is in a public space (the house) and the parent is addressing body privacy, it's a valid concern. \n\nSo, the answer is B. The author is not in the wrong. They're handling a typical parenting challenge with a reasonable approach, even if the delivery could be softened.\n"
