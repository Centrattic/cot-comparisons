Her body is changing. Had to do the bra shopping and all of that. \n\nAnyway, we keep our house really warm. She has a habit of walking around in just a tank top and underwear. Sometimes she just hangs around in a towel for hours after showering instead of getting dressed. \n\nIt\u2019s not a huge deal but I suggested to her that she should really start using her robe if she doesn\u2019t want to put something on. She asked why and I said it\u2019s not entirely appropriate to walk around half-dressed in front of her father now that she\u2019s a young woman. \n\nI am very direct when speaking and I think her feelings may have been hurt. My husband ended up walking in on the conversation and asked why she was pouty. She told him and he just looked at me and rolled his eyes, but he didn\u2019t say anything. I brought it up with him later and he was just like \u201ccan we talk about something else?\u201d Clearly he didn\u2019t want to have the conversation so I dropped it with him. As for my daughter, she\u2019s been fairly quiet today, which is unusual for her. \n\nWas I wrong to say something to her about this? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the parent was wrong to ask their 12-year-old daughter to cover up more at home.\n\nFirst, the daughter is in puberty, which is a natural time for body changes. The parent is concerned about her wearing a tank top and underwear, or a towel, around the house. The parent explained it's not appropriate to walk around half-dressed in front of her father now that she's a young woman. The daughter was upset, and the husband didn't engage the conversation.\n\nSo, is the parent wrong? Well, the parent is addressing a reasonable concern about modesty and setting boundaries, especially with a father-daughter dynamic. However, the approach might be too direct for a 12-year-old, possibly hurting her feelings. But the parent was clear about expectations, which is important. The husband's reaction of avoiding the topic might have left the daughter confused or unsupported. \n\nThe key points: The parent had a valid reason to set boundaries, but communication style might need adjustment. The daughter's feelings being hurt is a red flag, suggesting the method was too harsh. However, the parent's intent was to guide her into appropriate behavior for her age. It's a balance between being supportive and setting necessary limits. \n\nIn many cultures, parents do address modesty as children enter adolescence. The parent's mistake might be not considering the daughter's emotional state and not involving the husband more effectively. But overall, the concern is valid, and the parent isn't entirely at fault. So, the answer would likely be B (not in the wrong) but with a note about communication style.\n"
