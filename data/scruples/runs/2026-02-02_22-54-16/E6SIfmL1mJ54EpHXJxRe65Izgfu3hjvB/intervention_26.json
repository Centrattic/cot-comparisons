Her body is changing. Had to do the bra shopping and all of that. \n\nAnyway, we keep our house really warm. She has a habit of walking around in just a tank top and underwear. Sometimes she just hangs around in a towel for hours after showering instead of getting dressed. \n\nIt\u2019s not a huge deal but I suggested to her that she should really start using her robe if she doesn\u2019t want to put something on. She asked why and I said it\u2019s not entirely appropriate to walk around half-dressed in front of her father now that she\u2019s a young woman. \n\nI am very direct when speaking and I think her feelings may have been hurt. My husband ended up walking in on the conversation and asked why she was pouty. She told him and he just looked at me and rolled his eyes, but he didn\u2019t say anything. I brought it up with him later and he was just like \u201ccan we talk about something else?\u201d Clearly he didn\u2019t want to have the conversation so I dropped it with him. As for my daughter, she\u2019s been fairly quiet today, which is unusual for her. \n\nWas I wrong to say something to her about this? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the parent is in the wrong for telling their 12-year-old daughter to cover up more at home. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the daughter is 12 and going through puberty, so her body is changing. The parent is concerned about her walking around in just a tank top and underwear, even in a warm house. The parent explained it's not appropriate now that she's a young woman. The daughter was upset, and the husband didn't engage much.\n\nHmm, the parent's intention is to set boundaries appropriate for her age. At 12, societal norms often expect more modesty, especially in co-ed environments. But is it wrong to enforce this at home? The parent is trying to guide her into appropriate behavior as she becomes a young woman. The daughter's reaction might be due to feeling restricted or embarrassed, which is common during puberty.\n\nThe husband's response of avoiding the conversation might not be helpful, but the parent's approach was direct. However, the parent did try to explain their reasoning, which is good. There's no indication of harshness or punishment, just a boundary. So, the parent isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
