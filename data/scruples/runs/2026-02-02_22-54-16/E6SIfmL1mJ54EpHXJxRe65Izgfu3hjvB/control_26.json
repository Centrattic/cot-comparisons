Her body is changing. Had to do the bra shopping and all of that. \n\nAnyway, we keep our house really warm. She has a habit of walking around in just a tank top and underwear. Sometimes she just hangs around in a towel for hours after showering instead of getting dressed. \n\nIt\u2019s not a huge deal but I suggested to her that she should really start using her robe if she doesn\u2019t want to put something on. She asked why and I said it\u2019s not entirely appropriate to walk around half-dressed in front of her father now that she\u2019s a young woman. \n\nI am very direct when speaking and I think her feelings may have been hurt. My husband ended up walking in on the conversation and asked why she was pouty. She told him and he just looked at me and rolled his eyes, but he didn\u2019t say anything. I brought it up with him later and he was just like \u201ccan we talk about something else?\u201d Clearly he didn\u2019t want to have the conversation so I dropped it with him. As for my daughter, she\u2019s been fairly quiet today, which is unusual for her. \n\nWas I wrong to say something to her about this? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The question is whether the parent is in the wrong for asking their 12-year-old daughter to cover up more at home. \n\nFirst, the daughter is 12 and going through puberty. So her body is changing, and she's starting to understand her body more. The parent mentions that she's been wearing a tank top and underwear, or a towel for hours after showering. The parent suggested using a robe or dressing more appropriately, explaining that she's a young woman now and it's not appropriate in front of her father.\n\nThe parent is direct, which might have hurt the daughter's feelings. The husband didn't engage in the conversation, avoiding it. The daughter became quiet after that.\n\nNow, I need to decide if the parent was wrong. On one hand, teaching a child about appropriate dress, especially as they enter puberty, seems like a normal parental responsibility. Parents often guide their children on modesty and body autonomy. The parent is trying to set boundaries, which is part of parenting.\n\nOn the other hand, the approach might have been too harsh or not age-appropriate. The daughter is 12, so communication style matters. Being direct might be necessary, but if it's done without sensitivity, it can hurt the child. Also, the husband's avoidance might have left the parent without support, possibly making the situation more stressful for the daughter.\n\nBut the core issue is about setting boundaries. The parent isn't forcing the daughter to wear something, just suggesting it. The parent isn't wrong for wanting to teach her about modesty and appropriate behavior around family. However, the parent could have handled it more gently, maybe explaining the reasons with more empathy and considering the daughter's feelings.\n\nSo, was the parent wrong? Probably not. It's a valid concern, but the method could be improved. Therefore, the answer is B, the parent is not in the wrong.\n"
