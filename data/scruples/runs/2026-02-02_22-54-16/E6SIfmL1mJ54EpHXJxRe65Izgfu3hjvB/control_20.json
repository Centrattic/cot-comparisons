Her body is changing. Had to do the bra shopping and all of that. \n\nAnyway, we keep our house really warm. She has a habit of walking around in just a tank top and underwear. Sometimes she just hangs around in a towel for hours after showering instead of getting dressed. \n\nIt\u2019s not a huge deal but I suggested to her that she should really start using her robe if she doesn\u2019t want to put something on. She asked why and I said it\u2019s not entirely appropriate to walk around half-dressed in front of her father now that she\u2019s a young woman. \n\nI am very direct when speaking and I think her feelings may have been hurt. My husband ended up walking in on the conversation and asked why she was pouty. She told him and he just looked at me and rolled his eyes, but he didn\u2019t say anything. I brought it up with him later and he was just like \u201ccan we talk about something else?\u201d Clearly he didn\u2019t want to have the conversation so I dropped it with him. As for my daughter, she\u2019s been fairly quiet today, which is unusual for her. \n\nWas I wrong to say something to her about this? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the parent was wrong to ask their 12-year-old daughter to cover up more at home. The daughter is in puberty, walking around in a tank top and underwear, sometimes a towel for hours. The parent told her it's not appropriate in front of the father now that she's a young woman. The husband rolled his eyes and didn't want to discuss it further.\n\nFirst, the age of the daughter is 12, which is a common age for puberty to start. The parent's concern is about modesty in the home, especially regarding a parent's presence. It's a common parenting issue where kids start becoming more aware of their bodies and privacy. The parent is trying to set boundaries, which seems reasonable. However, the daughter might feel embarrassed or hurt because of the direct approach. The husband's reaction suggests he might not see it as a big issue, but the parent's intention was to guide the daughter.\n\nI need to consider cultural norms here. Some families might be more lenient, while others enforce stricter dress codes at home. The parent's action is about setting appropriate boundaries as the child grows. The key points are: the parent is addressing a developmental stage, using a direct approach which might have caused hurt feelings, but the intention is to teach modesty and respect. The husband's nonchalance might not mean the parent is wrong, just a difference in perspective.\n\nSo, the parent isn't necessarily wrong because they are addressing a normal part of parenting. The mistake might be in how it was communicated, but the act of setting boundaries isn't. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
