Her body is changing. Had to do the bra shopping and all of that. \n\nAnyway, we keep our house really warm. She has a habit of walking around in just a tank top and underwear. Sometimes she just hangs around in a towel for hours after showering instead of getting dressed. \n\nIt\u2019s not a huge deal but I suggested to her that she should really start using her robe if she doesn\u2019t want to put something on. She asked why and I said it\u2019s not entirely appropriate to walk around half-dressed in front of her father now that she\u2019s a young woman. \n\nI am very direct when speaking and I think her feelings may have been hurt. My husband ended up walking in on the conversation and asked why she was pouty. She told him and he just looked at me and rolled his eyes, but he didn\u2019t say anything. I brought it up with him later and he was just like \u201ccan we talk about something else?\u201d Clearly he didn\u2019t want to have the conversation so I dropped it with him. As for my daughter, she\u2019s been fairly quiet today, which is unusual for her. \n\nWas I wrong to say something to her about this? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the mother is in the wrong for asking her 12-year-old daughter to cover up more at home. So first, I need to consider the context. The daughter is in puberty, which means her body is changing, and she's wearing less clothing at home, like a tank top and underwear or a towel for hours. The mother told her it's not appropriate to be half-dressed in front of her father now that she's a young woman. The daughter might have felt hurt, and the husband didn't support the mother when the daughter told him.\n\nNow, the question is whether the mother was wrong. The mother's intention is to set boundaries as her daughter is growing up. It's common for parents to address modesty issues during puberty. However, the approach might matter. The mother was direct, which might have hurt the daughter's feelings. The daughter is 12, so she's still a child, but she's entering adolescence, so she might be more sensitive about her body. The mother's reasoning is about appropriateness in front of the father, which is a valid concern for many parents. However, the husband's reaction (rolling eyes and avoiding the conversation) might indicate a different perspective or discomfort. \n\nBut the key here is whether the mother's actions were wrong. Since the mother is addressing a common concern about modesty and body autonomy, especially with a father-daughter dynamic, it's a matter of parental guidance. However, the way she communicated it might have been harsh. But the question is about being in the wrong, not about the communication style. The mother's actions are to correct behavior she deems inappropriate. In many cultures, parents do set such boundaries. The daughter's reaction is understandable, but the mother isn't necessarily wrong for trying to guide her. So the answer is likely B (No, the author is not in the wrong). But I need to check if the mother's request is reasonable. Since the daughter is in her own home, some might argue that privacy is important, but the mother's stance is about appropriate behavior. The mother's actions are within her parental rights.\n"
