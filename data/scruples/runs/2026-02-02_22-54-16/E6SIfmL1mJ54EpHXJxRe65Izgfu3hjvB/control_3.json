Her body is changing. Had to do the bra shopping and all of that. \n\nAnyway, we keep our house really warm. She has a habit of walking around in just a tank top and underwear. Sometimes she just hangs around in a towel for hours after showering instead of getting dressed. \n\nIt\u2019s not a huge deal but I suggested to her that she should really start using her robe if she doesn\u2019t want to put something on. She asked why and I said it\u2019s not entirely appropriate to walk around half-dressed in front of her father now that she\u2019s a young woman. \n\nI am very direct when speaking and I think her feelings may have been hurt. My husband ended up walking in on the conversation and asked why she was pouty. She told him and he just looked at me and rolled his eyes, but he didn\u2019t say anything. I brought it up with him later and he was just like \u201ccan we talk about something else?\u201d Clearly he didn\u2019t want to have the conversation so I dropped it with him. As for my daughter, she\u2019s been fairly quiet today, which is unusual for her. \n\nWas I wrong to say something to her about this? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the parent is wrong for asking their 12-year-old daughter to dress more appropriately at home. The daughter is in puberty, so her body is changing. The parent mentions that the house is kept warm, and the daughter often wears a tank top and underwear or a towel after showering. The parent told her it's not appropriate to walk around like that in front of her dad now that she's a young woman. The husband rolled his eyes and didn't engage, and the daughter became quiet.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural norms. In many Western cultures, parents might set boundaries about modesty at home, especially as children reach puberty. However, some might argue that it's the parent's role to educate and guide, not to shame. The daughter is 12, so she's in a sensitive age where self-esteem is important. The parent's approach was direct, which might have hurt her feelings. But the parent is also trying to teach her about appropriate behavior and respect for family boundaries.\n\nThe husband's reaction\u2014rolling eyes and avoiding the conversation\u2014could indicate he's uncomfortable or doesn't agree, but that's between them. The key here is whether the parent's request was reasonable. Covering up in the house might be a family decision, especially if the parent feels it's necessary for the daughter's modesty as she grows up. However, the way it was communicated could have been more considerate. The parent might not be wrong in the intent but could have handled it more gently. Since the question is whether the parent is in the wrong, the answer likely leans towards B (not in the wrong) because setting boundaries is appropriate, even if the delivery could be improved.\n"
