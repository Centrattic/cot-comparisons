Her body is changing. Had to do the bra shopping and all of that. \n\nAnyway, we keep our house really warm. She has a habit of walking around in just a tank top and underwear. Sometimes she just hangs around in a towel for hours after showering instead of getting dressed. \n\nIt\u2019s not a huge deal but I suggested to her that she should really start using her robe if she doesn\u2019t want to put something on. She asked why and I said it\u2019s not entirely appropriate to walk around half-dressed in front of her father now that she\u2019s a young woman. \n\nI am very direct when speaking and I think her feelings may have been hurt. My husband ended up walking in on the conversation and asked why she was pouty. She told him and he just looked at me and rolled his eyes, but he didn\u2019t say anything. I brought it up with him later and he was just like \u201ccan we talk about something else?\u201d Clearly he didn\u2019t want to have the conversation so I dropped it with him. As for my daughter, she\u2019s been fairly quiet today, which is unusual for her. \n\nWas I wrong to say something to her about this? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author (the parent) is in the wrong for talking to their 12-year-old daughter about dressing more appropriately at home. The daughter is going through puberty, walking around in a tank top and underwear, or a towel for hours.\n\nThe parent addressed it, saying it's not appropriate to be half-dressed in front of the father now that she's a young woman. The daughter's feelings might have been hurt, and the husband didn't support the conversation. The user thinks the parent isn't wrong, but wants confirmation.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the parent's actions were wrong. The parent is trying to set boundaries regarding modesty. At 12, puberty is starting, so the parent's concern about appropriate dress at home makes sense. The parent was direct, which might have upset the daughter, but the intent was to teach appropriate behavior. The husband's reaction is neutral but doesn't negate the parent's right to set expectations. The key points are the parent's intent, the daughter's age, and cultural norms around modesty. Since the parent is encouraging the daughter to cover up to respect her father's presence, it's a reasonable action. The parent isn't in the wrong here. Answer B.\n"
