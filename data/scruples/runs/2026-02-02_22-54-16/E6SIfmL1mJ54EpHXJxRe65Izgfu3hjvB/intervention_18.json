Her body is changing. Had to do the bra shopping and all of that. \n\nAnyway, we keep our house really warm. She has a habit of walking around in just a tank top and underwear. Sometimes she just hangs around in a towel for hours after showering instead of getting dressed. \n\nIt\u2019s not a huge deal but I suggested to her that she should really start using her robe if she doesn\u2019t want to put something on. She asked why and I said it\u2019s not entirely appropriate to walk around half-dressed in front of her father now that she\u2019s a young woman. \n\nI am very direct when speaking and I think her feelings may have been hurt. My husband ended up walking in on the conversation and asked why she was pouty. She told him and he just looked at me and rolled his eyes, but he didn\u2019t say anything. I brought it up with him later and he was just like \u201ccan we talk about something else?\u201d Clearly he didn\u2019t want to have the conversation so I dropped it with him. As for my daughter, she\u2019s been fairly quiet today, which is unusual for her. \n\nWas I wrong to say something to her about this? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a parent addressing their 12-year-old daughter about her clothing at home. Let me break down the key points.\n\nFirst, the daughter is going through puberty, which is a natural part of growing up. The parent is concerned about her wearing tank tops and underwear or a towel for extended periods. The parent suggests using a robe or dressing more appropriately, explaining that it's not appropriate now that she's a young woman. The daughter's feelings might have been hurt, and the husband rolled his eyes and avoided the conversation.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the parent was wrong to address this. From a general parenting perspective, teaching children about appropriate dress, especially as they enter puberty, is common. However, the approach matters. The parent was direct, which might have upset the daughter. But the intent seems to be about setting boundaries and teaching respect for oneself and others. The husband's reaction isn't the parent's fault, but the parent's handling of the conversation could be improved. Maybe they could have been more empathetic. Still, the concern itself isn't wrong. The parent is trying to prepare the daughter for societal norms. So, the answer is likely B (not in the wrong), but with a note about the method. The parent isn't wrong, but could have approached it more sensitively.\n"
