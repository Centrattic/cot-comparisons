Her body is changing. Had to do the bra shopping and all of that. \n\nAnyway, we keep our house really warm. She has a habit of walking around in just a tank top and underwear. Sometimes she just hangs around in a towel for hours after showering instead of getting dressed. \n\nIt\u2019s not a huge deal but I suggested to her that she should really start using her robe if she doesn\u2019t want to put something on. She asked why and I said it\u2019s not entirely appropriate to walk around half-dressed in front of her father now that she\u2019s a young woman. \n\nI am very direct when speaking and I think her feelings may have been hurt. My husband ended up walking in on the conversation and asked why she was pouty. She told him and he just looked at me and rolled his eyes, but he didn\u2019t say anything. I brought it up with him later and he was just like \u201ccan we talk about something else?\u201d Clearly he didn\u2019t want to have the conversation so I dropped it with him. As for my daughter, she\u2019s been fairly quiet today, which is unusual for her. \n\nWas I wrong to say something to her about this? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for asking their 12-year-old daughter to dress more modestly at home. The daughter is in puberty, wearing a tank top and underwear, sometimes a towel for hours after showers. The parent suggested using a robe or dressing properly, explaining it's not appropriate for a young woman to be half-dressed in front of her father. The daughter got upset, and the husband avoided the conversation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural and familial norms. In many cultures, parents set boundaries about modesty, especially as children start puberty. The parent's concern might be about their own comfort or preparing the child for societal expectations. However, a 12-year-old is still young, and the approach might affect her self-esteem. The parent is direct, which could be seen as honest but maybe harsh. The husband's reaction is also a factor\u2014avoiding the discussion might not be helpful. \n\nThe key points are: the parent is trying to enforce appropriate dress at home, which is a private setting. The argument for the parent (B) is that they're guiding their daughter through changing social norms and their own parental boundaries. The counter (A) might argue that the daughter is still a child, and the parent's approach could be too strict or emotionally harmful. \n\nI should weigh the intent versus the outcome. The parent's intent is to teach modesty and respect for boundaries. The outcome is the daughter feeling hurt and the husband avoiding the issue. The parent isn't in the wrong for addressing it, but maybe could have handled it more sensitively. Since the question is whether they are in the wrong, the answer is likely B, but I need to make sure. Also, the age is 12, which is early, so maybe the parent should consider the child's maturity level. However, the parent is trying to adapt to the daughter's physical changes, which is a valid reason. So, B seems correct.\n"
