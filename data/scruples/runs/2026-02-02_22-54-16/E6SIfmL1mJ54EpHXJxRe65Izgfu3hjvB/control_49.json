Her body is changing. Had to do the bra shopping and all of that. \n\nAnyway, we keep our house really warm. She has a habit of walking around in just a tank top and underwear. Sometimes she just hangs around in a towel for hours after showering instead of getting dressed. \n\nIt\u2019s not a huge deal but I suggested to her that she should really start using her robe if she doesn\u2019t want to put something on. She asked why and I said it\u2019s not entirely appropriate to walk around half-dressed in front of her father now that she\u2019s a young woman. \n\nI am very direct when speaking and I think her feelings may have been hurt. My husband ended up walking in on the conversation and asked why she was pouty. She told him and he just looked at me and rolled his eyes, but he didn\u2019t say anything. I brought it up with him later and he was just like \u201ccan we talk about something else?\u201d Clearly he didn\u2019t want to have the conversation so I dropped it with him. As for my daughter, she\u2019s been fairly quiet today, which is unusual for her. \n\nWas I wrong to say something to her about this? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the parent is wrong for asking their 12-year-old daughter to cover up more at home. The daughter is in puberty, so her body is changing. She's been walking around in a tank top and underwear or a towel, and the parent wants her to wear a robe or dress more appropriately. The parent had a conversation with her, which might have hurt her feelings, and the husband didn't want to discuss it.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about setting boundaries and teaching appropriate behavior. At 12, she's starting to become a young woman, so parents might want to start addressing modesty. The parent is trying to guide her, not necessarily being overbearing. The daughter might feel embarrassed or hurt, but the parent's intention is to teach her about clothing in her new stage of life. The husband's reaction might indicate he's uncomfortable discussing it, but that doesn't mean the parent is wrong. The parent isn't forcing her to wear specific clothes outside the home, just in the house where modesty norms apply. I think the parent is doing their job by setting these boundaries. So the answer is B.\n"
