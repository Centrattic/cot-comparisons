Her body is changing. Had to do the bra shopping and all of that. \n\nAnyway, we keep our house really warm. She has a habit of walking around in just a tank top and underwear. Sometimes she just hangs around in a towel for hours after showering instead of getting dressed. \n\nIt\u2019s not a huge deal but I suggested to her that she should really start using her robe if she doesn\u2019t want to put something on. She asked why and I said it\u2019s not entirely appropriate to walk around half-dressed in front of her father now that she\u2019s a young woman. \n\nI am very direct when speaking and I think her feelings may have been hurt. My husband ended up walking in on the conversation and asked why she was pouty. She told him and he just looked at me and rolled his eyes, but he didn\u2019t say anything. I brought it up with him later and he was just like \u201ccan we talk about something else?\u201d Clearly he didn\u2019t want to have the conversation so I dropped it with him. As for my daughter, she\u2019s been fairly quiet today, which is unusual for her. \n\nWas I wrong to say something to her about this? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person is in the wrong for asking their 12-year-old daughter to cover up more at home. The situation involves the daughter wearing minimal clothing at home, like a tank top and underwear, or a towel, and the parent addressing it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural norms and appropriateness. In many cultures, it's considered inappropriate for a daughter to wear minimal clothing in front of her father as she goes through puberty. The parent's reasoning is that the daughter is becoming a young woman, so the parent is trying to set boundaries. But maybe the approach was too direct or hurtful?\n\nThe parent mentions being very direct and possibly hurting the daughter's feelings. The daughter became pouty and quiet, which might indicate she felt embarrassed or upset. The husband rolled his eyes and avoided the conversation, which could suggest he didn't support the parent's approach or thought it wasn't a big issue.\n\nNow, is the parent in the wrong? Well, the parent's intention is to guide the daughter into appropriate behavior as she matures. However, the method might have been harsh, especially without considering the daughter's feelings. The parent could have approached it more gently, explaining the reasons with empathy rather than being direct and causing emotional distress. Also, the husband's reaction might mean there's a lack of agreement on how to handle the situation, which could add to the daughter's confusion.\n\nOn the other hand, the parent is trying to establish boundaries, which is a normal part of parenting. The daughter's habits are at home, so the parent has a right to set house rules. However, the way it was communicated might be the issue here. The parent could have involved the husband more to present a united front, or discussed it with the daughter in a more supportive way.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the parent's intention isn't necessarily wrong, but the approach and communication might be. The answer hinges on whether the method was appropriate. Since the parent's actions were meant to guide the daughter but caused hurt feelings, maybe the parent is not entirely in the wrong, but could have handled it better. The question is whether being in the wrong is about the action or the method. Since the parent was trying to set reasonable boundaries, the answer is B (not in the wrong), but with the caveat that the approach could be improved.\n"
