Her body is changing. Had to do the bra shopping and all of that. \n\nAnyway, we keep our house really warm. She has a habit of walking around in just a tank top and underwear. Sometimes she just hangs around in a towel for hours after showering instead of getting dressed. \n\nIt\u2019s not a huge deal but I suggested to her that she should really start using her robe if she doesn\u2019t want to put something on. She asked why and I said it\u2019s not entirely appropriate to walk around half-dressed in front of her father now that she\u2019s a young woman. \n\nI am very direct when speaking and I think her feelings may have been hurt. My husband ended up walking in on the conversation and asked why she was pouty. She told him and he just looked at me and rolled his eyes, but he didn\u2019t say anything. I brought it up with him later and he was just like \u201ccan we talk about something else?\u201d Clearly he didn\u2019t want to have the conversation so I dropped it with him. As for my daughter, she\u2019s been fairly quiet today, which is unusual for her. \n\nWas I wrong to say something to her about this? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the parent was wrong to ask their 12-year-old daughter to dress more appropriately at home. The daughter is in puberty, so her body is changing, and she's been wearing tank tops and underwear or a towel. The parent explained it's not appropriate in front of the father now that she's a young woman. The husband didn't engage, and the daughter is acting out.\n\nFirst, the parent's intention is to set boundaries regarding modesty. At 12, kids are entering adolescence, so talking about body privacy and appropriate dress, even at home, is part of parenting. However, the approach here was direct and maybe hurt her feelings. The parent acknowledges that, noting the daughter was pouty. The husband's reaction was dismissive, which could add tension.\n\nThe key points are: Is it reasonable to expect a 12-year-old to cover up at home? Yes, especially considering the parent's role in guiding them towards appropriate behavior. However, the method could be improved. Being direct without considering the child's feelings might be harsh. The parent might have handled it better with more empathy to avoid hurting her. But the core issue of setting boundaries isn't wrong. The daughter's behavior (wearing a towel for hours) could also be a sign of her adjusting to her body changes, so the parent's intervention is part of teaching self-respect and societal norms.\n\nSo, the parent isn't in the wrong for setting the expectation, but could have been more sensitive. The answer should be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
