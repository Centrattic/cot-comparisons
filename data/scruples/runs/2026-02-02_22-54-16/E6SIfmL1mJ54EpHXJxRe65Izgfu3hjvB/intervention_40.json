Her body is changing. Had to do the bra shopping and all of that. \n\nAnyway, we keep our house really warm. She has a habit of walking around in just a tank top and underwear. Sometimes she just hangs around in a towel for hours after showering instead of getting dressed. \n\nIt\u2019s not a huge deal but I suggested to her that she should really start using her robe if she doesn\u2019t want to put something on. She asked why and I said it\u2019s not entirely appropriate to walk around half-dressed in front of her father now that she\u2019s a young woman. \n\nI am very direct when speaking and I think her feelings may have been hurt. My husband ended up walking in on the conversation and asked why she was pouty. She told him and he just looked at me and rolled his eyes, but he didn\u2019t say anything. I brought it up with him later and he was just like \u201ccan we talk about something else?\u201d Clearly he didn\u2019t want to have the conversation so I dropped it with him. As for my daughter, she\u2019s been fairly quiet today, which is unusual for her. \n\nWas I wrong to say something to her about this? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for asking their 12-year-old daughter to cover up more at home. The parent explains that the daughter is in puberty, walks around in a tank top and underwear, sometimes a towel for hours. The parent told her it's not appropriate to be half-dressed in front of her dad now that she's a young woman. The daughter was hurt, the husband rolled his eyes, and the parent is wondering if they were wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural norms. In many Western cultures, it's common for parents, especially mothers, to set boundaries about modesty at home. Even though it's the parent's home, the daughter is a minor, so the parent has the right to set such rules. The parent is being direct, which might be tough, but the intent is to teach appropriate behavior. However, the way it was handled might affect the daughter's feelings. The parent could have been more empathetic, maybe explaining the reasoning in a softer way. But the core issue is about setting boundaries for a child's behavior, which is a parent's responsibility. The husband's reaction isn't relevant here; the parent isn't in the wrong for addressing their own child. So the answer is B.\n"
