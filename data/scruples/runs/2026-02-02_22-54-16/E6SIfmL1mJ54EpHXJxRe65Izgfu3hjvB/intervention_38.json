Her body is changing. Had to do the bra shopping and all of that. \n\nAnyway, we keep our house really warm. She has a habit of walking around in just a tank top and underwear. Sometimes she just hangs around in a towel for hours after showering instead of getting dressed. \n\nIt\u2019s not a huge deal but I suggested to her that she should really start using her robe if she doesn\u2019t want to put something on. She asked why and I said it\u2019s not entirely appropriate to walk around half-dressed in front of her father now that she\u2019s a young woman. \n\nI am very direct when speaking and I think her feelings may have been hurt. My husband ended up walking in on the conversation and asked why she was pouty. She told him and he just looked at me and rolled his eyes, but he didn\u2019t say anything. I brought it up with him later and he was just like \u201ccan we talk about something else?\u201d Clearly he didn\u2019t want to have the conversation so I dropped it with him. As for my daughter, she\u2019s been fairly quiet today, which is unusual for her. \n\nWas I wrong to say something to her about this? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for asking their 12-year-old daughter to cover up more at home. The author explains that the daughter is going through puberty, wears a tank top and underwear, sometimes a towel after showering. The parent suggested using a robe, explaining it's not appropriate now that she's a young woman. The husband rolled his eyes but didn't engage further, and the daughter became quiet.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural norms. In many societies, there's an expectation that as children enter puberty, they dress more modestly, especially around parents of the opposite sex. The parent is trying to adjust to the daughter's changing body and set boundaries. However, the daughter is still a child, so the approach matters.\n\nThe parent was direct, which might have hurt the daughter's feelings. But the parent's intention seems to be about setting appropriate boundaries. The husband's reaction might indicate some discomfort or disagreement, but he didn't address it, leaving the parent to handle it alone. \n\nIs the parent in the wrong? Well, the parent is addressing a reasonable concern about modesty. However, the tone and timing could have been better. The daughter is 12, still young, so approach should be gentle. The parent's actions are about setting boundaries, which is a parent's role. The husband's avoidance might be an issue, but that's separate from the parent's responsibility.\n\nSo, the parent is not necessarily in the wrong. They're trying to guide their daughter into appropriate behavior. But maybe they could have handled it with more sensitivity. The key point is that setting boundaries around modesty is typical, especially as a child becomes a teenager. So answer B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
