Her body is changing. Had to do the bra shopping and all of that. \n\nAnyway, we keep our house really warm. She has a habit of walking around in just a tank top and underwear. Sometimes she just hangs around in a towel for hours after showering instead of getting dressed. \n\nIt\u2019s not a huge deal but I suggested to her that she should really start using her robe if she doesn\u2019t want to put something on. She asked why and I said it\u2019s not entirely appropriate to walk around half-dressed in front of her father now that she\u2019s a young woman. \n\nI am very direct when speaking and I think her feelings may have been hurt. My husband ended up walking in on the conversation and asked why she was pouty. She told him and he just looked at me and rolled his eyes, but he didn\u2019t say anything. I brought it up with him later and he was just like \u201ccan we talk about something else?\u201d Clearly he didn\u2019t want to have the conversation so I dropped it with him. As for my daughter, she\u2019s been fairly quiet today, which is unusual for her. \n\nWas I wrong to say something to her about this? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the parent is in the wrong for telling their 12-year-old daughter to cover up more at home. The daughter is in puberty and prefers wearing tank tops and underwear, or a towel for long periods.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age and the cultural context. A 12-year-old is entering adolescence, so body image and modesty can be sensitive topics. The parent's concern about appropriateness, especially in front of her father, is a common issue during this time. But the way the parent approached it might matter. They were direct and the daughter's feelings were hurt. The husband's reaction was dismissive, which could add to the daughter's distress.\n\nI should think about what's considered appropriate in most families. It's typical for parents to set boundaries regarding clothing, especially as children grow. The parent wants their daughter to feel respected and to understand modesty in a family setting. However, the approach here seems a bit abrupt. The daughter is clearly in a vulnerable stage, and the parent's directness might have been a shock. Maybe the parent could have approached it with more empathy, explaining the reasons and being more supportive instead of just stating it's not appropriate.\n\nAlso, the husband's nonchalant attitude might be a problem. If he's not engaging in the conversation, the daughter might feel unsupported. The parent's intention is good, but the method of communication might be where they went wrong. It's important to balance setting boundaries with sensitivity to the child's emotions. So while the parent isn't necessarily in the wrong for wanting to set limits, their approach could be seen as harsh, leading to the daughter feeling hurt. Therefore, the parent might need to adjust their communication style to be more understanding.\n"
