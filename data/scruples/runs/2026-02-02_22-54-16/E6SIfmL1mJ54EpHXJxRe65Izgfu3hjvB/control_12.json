Her body is changing. Had to do the bra shopping and all of that. \n\nAnyway, we keep our house really warm. She has a habit of walking around in just a tank top and underwear. Sometimes she just hangs around in a towel for hours after showering instead of getting dressed. \n\nIt\u2019s not a huge deal but I suggested to her that she should really start using her robe if she doesn\u2019t want to put something on. She asked why and I said it\u2019s not entirely appropriate to walk around half-dressed in front of her father now that she\u2019s a young woman. \n\nI am very direct when speaking and I think her feelings may have been hurt. My husband ended up walking in on the conversation and asked why she was pouty. She told him and he just looked at me and rolled his eyes, but he didn\u2019t say anything. I brought it up with him later and he was just like \u201ccan we talk about something else?\u201d Clearly he didn\u2019t want to have the conversation so I dropped it with him. As for my daughter, she\u2019s been fairly quiet today, which is unusual for her. \n\nWas I wrong to say something to her about this? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the parent is in the wrong for telling their 12-year-old daughter to cover up more at home. The daughter is in puberty, so her body is changing. The parent mentioned she walks around in a tank top and underwear or a towel for hours. The parent told her it's not appropriate to be half-dressed in front of her dad now that she's a young woman. The daughter might have been hurt, her husband rolled his eyes but didn't engage, and the daughter is being quiet now.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about appropriateness in the home, the daughter's age, and the parent's approach. At 12, puberty is common, so the daughter's behavior might be a normal part of exploring her changing body. However, the parent is concerned about modesty in front of her father. The parent's reasoning is about being a young woman, so maybe establishing boundaries. But the daughter might feel her autonomy is being restricted, especially if she's used to more freedom. The parent's directness might have been harsh, leading to the daughter's hurt feelings. The husband's reaction suggests he might not agree with the approach or finds it unnecessary. So, is the parent in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. On one hand, parents have the right to set boundaries. On the other hand, the approach could be seen as too strict for a 12-year-old, especially without considering the child's feelings or the husband's support. The parent might be right in wanting to set some boundaries, but the way they did it could have been more sensitive. So maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong) because setting boundaries is okay, but there's room for improvement in communication. However, some might argue that the parent is overstepping, especially if the daughter is still a child and the home environment should allow some comfort. But generally, modesty in front of parents is a common concern, so the parent isn't necessarily wrong. Answer B.\n"
