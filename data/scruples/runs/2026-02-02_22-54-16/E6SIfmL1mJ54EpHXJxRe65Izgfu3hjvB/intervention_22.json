Her body is changing. Had to do the bra shopping and all of that. \n\nAnyway, we keep our house really warm. She has a habit of walking around in just a tank top and underwear. Sometimes she just hangs around in a towel for hours after showering instead of getting dressed. \n\nIt\u2019s not a huge deal but I suggested to her that she should really start using her robe if she doesn\u2019t want to put something on. She asked why and I said it\u2019s not entirely appropriate to walk around half-dressed in front of her father now that she\u2019s a young woman. \n\nI am very direct when speaking and I think her feelings may have been hurt. My husband ended up walking in on the conversation and asked why she was pouty. She told him and he just looked at me and rolled his eyes, but he didn\u2019t say anything. I brought it up with him later and he was just like \u201ccan we talk about something else?\u201d Clearly he didn\u2019t want to have the conversation so I dropped it with him. As for my daughter, she\u2019s been fairly quiet today, which is unusual for her. \n\nWas I wrong to say something to her about this? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the parent is in the wrong for asking their 12-year-old daughter to cover up more at home.\n\nFirst, the daughter is 12 and going through puberty, which is a natural time for her body to change. She's wearing tank tops and underwear, maybe a towel after showering. The parent is concerned about her being \"half-dressed\" in front of her father now that she's a young woman. They told her it's not appropriate, and she might have been upset. The husband didn't engage in the discussion, which might have made things awkward.\n\nSo, the parent's reasoning is about appropriateness and boundaries. In many cultures, there are norms about modesty, even at home, especially as children grow into adolescence. The parent is trying to set those boundaries, which is a common part of parenting during puberty. However, the daughter's reaction suggests she might not see it that way yet. She's 12, so maybe she doesn't fully grasp the concept of privacy or societal expectations. \n\nThe parent's approach was direct, which might have hurt her feelings. But is that necessarily wrong? Parents often have to have these tough conversations. The key here is whether the parent's actions were unreasonable. The daughter was in her own home, so some people might argue that it's her body and she should have some autonomy. But others would say the parent is responsible for guiding her towards appropriate behavior, especially in mixed-gender settings.\n\nThe husband's reaction is interesting. He rolled his eyes and didn't want to talk about it. That might indicate he doesn't see the issue the same way the parent does. But that's between them. The main question is about the parent's actions towards the daughter.\n\nI think the parent is trying to do what's right by setting boundaries, even if the approach was a bit harsh. The daughter is old enough to start understanding these things, so the parent isn't wrong. The problem might be in how it was communicated rather than the act itself. So the answer is B, the parent isn't in the wrong.\n"
