Her body is changing. Had to do the bra shopping and all of that. \n\nAnyway, we keep our house really warm. She has a habit of walking around in just a tank top and underwear. Sometimes she just hangs around in a towel for hours after showering instead of getting dressed. \n\nIt\u2019s not a huge deal but I suggested to her that she should really start using her robe if she doesn\u2019t want to put something on. She asked why and I said it\u2019s not entirely appropriate to walk around half-dressed in front of her father now that she\u2019s a young woman. \n\nI am very direct when speaking and I think her feelings may have been hurt. My husband ended up walking in on the conversation and asked why she was pouty. She told him and he just looked at me and rolled his eyes, but he didn\u2019t say anything. I brought it up with him later and he was just like \u201ccan we talk about something else?\u201d Clearly he didn\u2019t want to have the conversation so I dropped it with him. As for my daughter, she\u2019s been fairly quiet today, which is unusual for her. \n\nWas I wrong to say something to her about this? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for telling their 12-year-old daughter to cover up more at home. The daughter is in a tank top and underwear, or a towel for hours after a shower. The parent tried to explain it's not appropriate for her to be half-dressed around her father now that she's becoming a young woman. The daughter got upset, and the husband was dismissive.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of the child. 12 is a typical age for puberty, so the parent is addressing a developmental phase. The parent's intention seems to be about setting boundaries regarding modesty and appropriate behavior in the home, especially around a parent of the opposite sex. The parent is being direct, which might have caused some emotional reaction, but the core issue is about teaching appropriate dress.\n\nHowever, the parent's approach might be too strict or not age-appropriate. 12-year-olds are still children, and while they are entering puberty, the parent needs to balance teaching modesty with respect for the child's feelings. The parent might not have considered the daughter's perspective or used a more gentle approach, which could explain the daughter's hurt feelings. The husband's reaction suggests he might not see the issue, or maybe he's more laid-back, leading to a lack of support for the parent's approach.\n\nIs the parent wrong? It's a judgment call. On one hand, setting boundaries about modesty is reasonable. On the other, the method of communication could be improved. The parent might not be in the wrong for the concern itself, but maybe in how they addressed it. However, since the question is about whether the parent is in the wrong for the action of asking the daughter to cover up, the answer might lean towards no, as the intent is to guide the daughter. However, some might argue that the parent overstepped, especially if the daughter's behavior isn't inherently harmful. But given that the parent is trying to prepare her for societal norms and respect, the parent's actions are likely not in the wrong.\n"
