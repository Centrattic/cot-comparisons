Her body is changing. Had to do the bra shopping and all of that. \n\nAnyway, we keep our house really warm. She has a habit of walking around in just a tank top and underwear. Sometimes she just hangs around in a towel for hours after showering instead of getting dressed. \n\nIt\u2019s not a huge deal but I suggested to her that she should really start using her robe if she doesn\u2019t want to put something on. She asked why and I said it\u2019s not entirely appropriate to walk around half-dressed in front of her father now that she\u2019s a young woman. \n\nI am very direct when speaking and I think her feelings may have been hurt. My husband ended up walking in on the conversation and asked why she was pouty. She told him and he just looked at me and rolled his eyes, but he didn\u2019t say anything. I brought it up with him later and he was just like \u201ccan we talk about something else?\u201d Clearly he didn\u2019t want to have the conversation so I dropped it with him. As for my daughter, she\u2019s been fairly quiet today, which is unusual for her. \n\nWas I wrong to say something to her about this? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the parent (the author) was in the wrong for telling their 12-year-old daughter to cover up more when she's in the house. The daughter is in puberty, walking around in a tank top and underwear, or a towel after showering. The parent suggested using a robe instead, explaining it's not appropriate for her to be half-dressed in front of her father now that she's a young woman. The daughter's feelings might have been hurt, and the husband rolled his eyes and didn't want to discuss it further.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural norms and parenting approaches. In many cultures, it's common for parents to set boundaries regarding modesty, especially as children enter puberty. The key here is that the parent is addressing behavior that might be considered inappropriate in their household. The daughter is 12, so she's at an age where such discussions are relevant.\n\nThe parent's reasoning is based on respect and appropriateness. They mentioned being direct, which might have come off as harsh, leading to the daughter feeling upset. However, the parent's intention seems to be about setting boundaries rather than shaming. The husband's reaction is dismissive, but the parent's actions themselves aren't necessarily wrong unless they were cruel or unnecessary.\n\nAnother angle is the daughter's perspective. She might feel her privacy or autonomy is being infringed upon, especially if she's used to more freedom. But the parent is trying to adjust expectations as she grows up. The parent is not forcing her to dress a certain way but suggesting alternatives like a robe.\n\nPossible issues could be how the parent communicated it. Being direct can sometimes be misinterpreted, especially if not softened with empathy. However, the parent did explain the reasoning, which is important. The daughter's reaction might be part of typical teenage sensitivity, but the parent's intention is valid in terms of setting household rules.\n\nConsidering all this, the parent isn't in the wrong. They're addressing appropriate behavior in their home, and while the delivery might need tweaking, the core message is reasonable. The husband's reaction is separate from the parent's actions. So the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
