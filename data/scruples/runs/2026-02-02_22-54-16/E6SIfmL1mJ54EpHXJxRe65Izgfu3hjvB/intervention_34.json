Her body is changing. Had to do the bra shopping and all of that. \n\nAnyway, we keep our house really warm. She has a habit of walking around in just a tank top and underwear. Sometimes she just hangs around in a towel for hours after showering instead of getting dressed. \n\nIt\u2019s not a huge deal but I suggested to her that she should really start using her robe if she doesn\u2019t want to put something on. She asked why and I said it\u2019s not entirely appropriate to walk around half-dressed in front of her father now that she\u2019s a young woman. \n\nI am very direct when speaking and I think her feelings may have been hurt. My husband ended up walking in on the conversation and asked why she was pouty. She told him and he just looked at me and rolled his eyes, but he didn\u2019t say anything. I brought it up with him later and he was just like \u201ccan we talk about something else?\u201d Clearly he didn\u2019t want to have the conversation so I dropped it with him. As for my daughter, she\u2019s been fairly quiet today, which is unusual for her. \n\nWas I wrong to say something to her about this? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for telling their 12-year-old daughter to cover up more at home. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the daughter is 12 and going through puberty. She's wearing tank tops and underwear, sometimes just a towel after showering. The parent thinks it's inappropriate, given she's a young woman now. The parent was direct, which might have hurt the daughter's feelings. The husband rolled his eyes and avoided the conversation. The daughter is now quiet.\n\nThe parent is asking if they're at fault. The user thinks the parent isn't wrong but wants confirmation. The possible answers are A (yes, wrong) or B (no, not wrong).\n\nHmm. From a societal perspective, parents do set boundaries for their children's behavior, especially regarding modesty. However, how the parent communicated this might matter. Being direct can be effective, but if it's done without considering the child's feelings, it might backfire. The parent's intention is to teach appropriate behavior, which is reasonable. But the daughter's reaction suggests the conversation might have been handled more sensitively. The husband's reaction also shows some conflict in the household.\n\nBut the core issue is whether the parent was wrong to set the boundary. In most cases, parents have the right to set such rules. However, the approach could be improved. Since the question is about being in the wrong, not about the method, the parent isn't wrong for setting the boundary. So the answer would be B. However, there's room to suggest that the approach could be better, but the act of setting the boundary isn't wrong.\n"
