I think she's not understanding what I'm saying or is naive about parenthood.\n\nI told her that there's no way when we have children that we will be able to split the load completely evenly. There are biological components to motherhood that come into play, like maternal instincts and post partum bonding and such, that require the mother to spend more time with the child immediately after birth. Additionally, because of this, it is often more likely feasible for the mother to stay home or at least be the primary parent for the child, in addition to economic factors that usually result in the man being the breadwinner and the woman being the primary parent. Thus, odds are, she will be the primary parent for our children for a variety of reasons, and there is no way we will be able to have a completely equal split. \n\nShe told me she will not have a child with a man who does not agree to split the work evenly, while I am arguing that it is not possible, particularly right after birth but also down the line. She is reconsidering our relationship now and I need to know if I'm being the asshole or being logical.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for telling their girlfriend that fatherhood and motherhood are fundamentally different. The key points are about splitting parenting responsibilities and the biological aspects of motherhood.\n\nThe author argues that it's not possible to split the load evenly because of maternal instincts, postpartum bonding, and economic factors where the man is often the breadwinner. The girlfriend is upset because she wants an equal split, and she's reconsidering the relationship.\n\nHmm, the author is making a point based on biological and societal factors. But does that mean they're right or in the wrong? Well, the author is stating their view, but maybe they didn't consider the girlfriend's perspective enough. The girlfriend might feel that the author is dismissing the possibility of shared responsibility or not seeing her as equal in parenting. Even if there are biological factors, assuming the woman must be the primary parent due to those factors could be seen as reinforcing traditional gender roles, which the girlfriend might find problematic. Also, the author says there's no way to have an equal split, but maybe the girlfriend expects that both would adjust their roles to share equally despite challenges. So, the author might be seen as not being open to alternative arrangements or underestimating the couple's ability to work together. That could come off as dismissive of her wishes and not taking her perspective seriously, hence being in the wrong. But some might argue that the author is just being realistic. It's a bit of a balancing act between expectations and reality. I think the key here is whether the author was rigid in their stance without room for compromise. If the author's argument is that it's impossible to split evenly, and the girlfriend's expectation is equality, there's a mismatch. So, maybe the author is in the wrong because they didn't acknowledge that both could adapt their roles to share the load, even if there are challenges. Therefore, answer A.\n"
