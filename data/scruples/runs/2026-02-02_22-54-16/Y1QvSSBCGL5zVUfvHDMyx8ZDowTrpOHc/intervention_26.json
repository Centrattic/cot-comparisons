I think she's not understanding what I'm saying or is naive about parenthood.\n\nI told her that there's no way when we have children that we will be able to split the load completely evenly. There are biological components to motherhood that come into play, like maternal instincts and post partum bonding and such, that require the mother to spend more time with the child immediately after birth. Additionally, because of this, it is often more likely feasible for the mother to stay home or at least be the primary parent for the child, in addition to economic factors that usually result in the man being the breadwinner and the woman being the primary parent. Thus, odds are, she will be the primary parent for our children for a variety of reasons, and there is no way we will be able to have a completely equal split. \n\nShe told me she will not have a child with a man who does not agree to split the work evenly, while I am arguing that it is not possible, particularly right after birth but also down the line. She is reconsidering our relationship now and I need to know if I'm being the asshole or being logical.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a disagreement between a guy and his girlfriend about how parenting responsibilities will be divided once they have kids.\n\nThe guy argues that motherhood and fatherhood are fundamentally different because of biological factors like maternal instincts, postpartum bonding, and the economic reality where men are often the primary earners. He believes they can't split parenting duties equally, especially right after the child is born, and that the mother (his girlfriend) would likely be the primary parent. The girlfriend, however, refuses to have kids with someone who doesn't agree to an equal split, leading to her considering ending the relationship.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong but wants an opinion. The task is to answer A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no, not in the wrong).\n\nFirst, I need to analyze both sides. The author's reasoning is based on biological and economic factors. He's pointing out that the mother will have more physical and emotional connections post-birth, and societal norms might push the mother to be the primary caregiver. He's not saying he won't help, but that an equal split isn't feasible.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's stance is that she wants equality in parenting. She might feel that the author is underestimating his role or making assumptions that don't align with her values. Her reaction is strong\u2014rethinking the relationship\u2014so this is a significant issue for her.\n\nI should consider if the author's statements are based on stereotypes or assumptions. For example, the idea that men are the breadwinners is a traditional gender role that doesn't hold true anymore for many couples. Also, assuming that the mother must be the primary parent could overlook the father's ability or desire to be more involved, or the couple's potential to negotiate roles differently.\n\nThe author is making a logical argument, but perhaps he's not considering that societal changes might allow for more flexibility. Additionally, by stating that equality isn't possible, he might be dismissing the girlfriend's desire for equality, which is important to her. This could be seen as not respecting her perspective.\n\nAnother angle: the author might be right that biological factors make some aspects unequal, but the expectation can still be to share as equally as possible given those factors. The girlfriend might see his stance as a refusal to share responsibility, even if it's not 50/50. If the author is open to being the primary provider so she can be the primary parent, that's a compromise, but maybe the girlfriend wants a more active role from him.\n\nIs the author wrong for stating his views? Well, expressing that there are differences is one thing, but if he's unwilling to compromise or not listening to her needs, that's a problem. The girlfriend's reaction is about her boundaries; if equality is non-negotiable for her, the author's stance is violating that. So maybe the author is in the wrong because he's not meeting her needs, even if his reasoning is logical.\n\nBut the user says the author thinks the girlfriend is naive. That could come off as dismissive. If he's not acknowledging her perspective, that's a problem. The question is about whether he's in the wrong. If the issue is about communication and respect for each other's values, the author's approach might be at fault here.\n"
