I think she's not understanding what I'm saying or is naive about parenthood.\n\nI told her that there's no way when we have children that we will be able to split the load completely evenly. There are biological components to motherhood that come into play, like maternal instincts and post partum bonding and such, that require the mother to spend more time with the child immediately after birth. Additionally, because of this, it is often more likely feasible for the mother to stay home or at least be the primary parent for the child, in addition to economic factors that usually result in the man being the breadwinner and the woman being the primary parent. Thus, odds are, she will be the primary parent for our children for a variety of reasons, and there is no way we will be able to have a completely equal split. \n\nShe told me she will not have a child with a man who does not agree to split the work evenly, while I am arguing that it is not possible, particularly right after birth but also down the line. She is reconsidering our relationship now and I need to know if I'm being the asshole or being logical.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for stating that fatherhood and motherhood are fundamentally different. The author's main points are about biological factors like maternal instincts, postpartum bonding, and economic roles leading to the mother being the primary caregiver. The girlfriend is upset because she wants an equal split, which the author says isn't possible.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the author's statements are factually accurate. There's some truth to the biological aspects\u2014pregnancy, childbirth, and postpartum bonding are typically associated with the mother. However, the author also mentions economic factors making the man the breadwinner, which is less true in many modern contexts where women are often primary earners or both parents work. So maybe the author is generalizing.\n\nBut the key issue here isn't just facts; it's about the relationship conflict. The author is making assumptions about roles that might not align with the girlfriend's views. The girlfriend wants equality, which could include shared responsibilities regardless of traditional roles. The author's stance might come off as dismissive of her desire for equality or as reinforcing gender stereotypes, which could be hurtful even if there's some truth in the biological aspects.\n\nAlso, the author's argument assumes that equality means an exact 50/50 split, which the girlfriend might interpret as not valuing her perspective. The author might be overlooking the importance of mutual effort and flexibility rather than fixed roles. Even if there are initial differences post-birth, the author's rigid stance might make the girlfriend feel her wishes aren't respected.\n\nSo while the author brings up valid points, how those points are communicated and the underlying assumptions about roles could be problematic. The girlfriend's reaction suggests that the author's approach is causing significant distress. The question is whether being \"logical\" about these issues justifies the outcome. In relationships, communication and respect for each other's values are crucial. If the author isn't willing to meet in the middle or consider evolving roles, that could be seen as being in the wrong, even if some points are factually correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer might lean towards A (the author is in the wrong) because the approach could be seen as rigid and not accommodating the girlfriend's valid concerns about equality, regardless of biological or traditional factors.\n"
