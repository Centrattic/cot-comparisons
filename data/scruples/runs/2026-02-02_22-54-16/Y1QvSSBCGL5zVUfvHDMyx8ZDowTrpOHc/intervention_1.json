I think she's not understanding what I'm saying or is naive about parenthood.\n\nI told her that there's no way when we have children that we will be able to split the load completely evenly. There are biological components to motherhood that come into play, like maternal instincts and post partum bonding and such, that require the mother to spend more time with the child immediately after birth. Additionally, because of this, it is often more likely feasible for the mother to stay home or at least be the primary parent for the child, in addition to economic factors that usually result in the man being the breadwinner and the woman being the primary parent. Thus, odds are, she will be the primary parent for our children for a variety of reasons, and there is no way we will be able to have a completely equal split. \n\nShe told me she will not have a child with a man who does not agree to split the work evenly, while I am arguing that it is not possible, particularly right after birth but also down the line. She is reconsidering our relationship now and I need to know if I'm being the asshole or being logical.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong in the situation described. The author is talking about their belief that motherhood and fatherhood are fundamentally different, leading to an unequal split in parenting responsibilities. The girlfriend is upset because she wants an equal split, and now she's reconsidering the relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the arguments presented. The author mentions biological factors like maternal instincts and postpartum bonding, suggesting the mother would naturally spend more time with the child. They also bring up economic factors, where the man is typically the breadwinner. The girlfriend, on the other hand, states she won't have a child with someone who doesn't agree to split work evenly.\n\nIs the author being logical or is this a harmful stereotype? The key here is whether the author's statements are based on outdated or restrictive gender roles. While there are biological differences (like pregnancy and postpartum), those don't necessarily dictate parenting roles. Many modern couples share responsibilities, and the economic factor is changing as more women enter the workforce and men take on more domestic roles. The author's assumption that the mother must be the primary parent due to biological or economic reasons could be seen as reinforcing traditional gender roles. The girlfriend's stance on equality is valid because she's asserting her right to have a partnership that values shared responsibility. The author might be dismissing her desire for equality by stating it's \"not possible,\" which could be seen as inflexible and not considering changing societal norms. So, the author might be in the wrong for not acknowledging the possibility of shared parenting and for reinforcing stereotypes. The answer would likely be A, yes, the author is in the wrong.\n"
