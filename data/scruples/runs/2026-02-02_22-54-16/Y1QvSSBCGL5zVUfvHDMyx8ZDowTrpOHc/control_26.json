I think she's not understanding what I'm saying or is naive about parenthood.\n\nI told her that there's no way when we have children that we will be able to split the load completely evenly. There are biological components to motherhood that come into play, like maternal instincts and post partum bonding and such, that require the mother to spend more time with the child immediately after birth. Additionally, because of this, it is often more likely feasible for the mother to stay home or at least be the primary parent for the child, in addition to economic factors that usually result in the man being the breadwinner and the woman being the primary parent. Thus, odds are, she will be the primary parent for our children for a variety of reasons, and there is no way we will be able to have a completely equal split. \n\nShe told me she will not have a child with a man who does not agree to split the work evenly, while I am arguing that it is not possible, particularly right after birth but also down the line. She is reconsidering our relationship now and I need to know if I'm being the asshole or being logical.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for stating that motherhood and fatherhood are fundamentally different, leading to an unequal split in parenting responsibilities. \n\nFirst, the author argues that biological factors like maternal instincts and postpartum bonding mean the mother will naturally spend more time with the child initially. They also mention economic factors where men are often the primary earners, making it feasible for the mother to be the primary parent.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction is that she won't have children with someone who doesn't agree to an equal split. The author is now questioning if he's the asshole or just being logical.\n\nHmm. The key points here are the assumptions about biology and economics. The author seems to be making generalizations that may not hold true for everyone. For instance, maternal instincts and postpartum bonding are biological, but these can vary, and modern parenting often challenges traditional roles. Also, the economic assumption that men are the primary earners is shifting, and many couples share financial responsibilities differently.\n\nBy stating that equality isn't possible, the author might be dismissing the girlfriend's desire for shared responsibility. Even if there are biological differences, it's possible to aim for equality despite those factors. The author's stance could be seen as rigid, not considering that both partners can adapt and share duties beyond traditional roles.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction, while strong, stems from her belief in equal partnership. The author's refusal to acknowledge the possibility of balancing responsibilities despite challenges might be the issue here. It's not just about biology or economics but also about mutual respect for each other's perspectives. The author might be in the wrong for not being open to alternative views on parenting roles, which could lead to the breakdown of the relationship.\n"
