I think she's not understanding what I'm saying or is naive about parenthood.\n\nI told her that there's no way when we have children that we will be able to split the load completely evenly. There are biological components to motherhood that come into play, like maternal instincts and post partum bonding and such, that require the mother to spend more time with the child immediately after birth. Additionally, because of this, it is often more likely feasible for the mother to stay home or at least be the primary parent for the child, in addition to economic factors that usually result in the man being the breadwinner and the woman being the primary parent. Thus, odds are, she will be the primary parent for our children for a variety of reasons, and there is no way we will be able to have a completely equal split. \n\nShe told me she will not have a child with a man who does not agree to split the work evenly, while I am arguing that it is not possible, particularly right after birth but also down the line. She is reconsidering our relationship now and I need to know if I'm being the asshole or being logical.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for saying that fatherhood and motherhood are fundamentally different. The situation is that the author and their girlfriend are discussing future plans, and she's reconsidering the relationship because he doesn't agree to split parenting duties evenly. The author argues that due to biological factors like maternal instincts and postpartum bonding, the mother (himself?) will likely be the primary parent, and that a completely equal split isn't feasible.\n\nHmm, first, the author's points are based on biological and economic factors. But wait, the author refers to \"my girlfriend,\" so he's male. If he's the one making the argument, he's not the mother. Wait, maybe there's a miscommunication here. The author is male, so he can't be the mother. Wait, the author is a man, right? So when he says \"the mother to spend more time,\" he's not the mother. So he's assuming the girlfriend would be the mother, which is correct if they have a child together. So the argument is that because of biological factors (like maternal instinct, postpartum bonding), the mother (his girlfriend) would need to be the primary parent, and because of traditional economic roles (man as breadwinner), she would be the primary parent. Therefore, he's saying that a 50-50 split isn't possible.\n\nNow, the girlfriend is offended and wants to split the work evenly. The author thinks she's being naive. The question is whether he's in the wrong. \n\nFirst, the author's argument is based on stereotypes and traditional gender roles. He's assuming that the mother will naturally take on more parenting duties due to biology and that the man should be the breadwinner. These are traditional views that modern relationships might challenge. The girlfriend's stance is that she expects an equal split, which is a more egalitarian view. \n\nIs the author correct in saying that it's not possible to split evenly? Well, in reality, some couples do manage equal splits, but it's often challenging and requires effort from both partners. The author is making a generalization that it's not possible, which might not be fair. He's also assuming that his girlfriend will take on the primary caregiver role because of biology, which can be seen as reinforcing gender stereotypes. \n\nAdditionally, the fact that the author is a man making this argument might come off as dismissive of his partner's expectations and the possibility of challenging traditional roles. The girlfriend's reaction is understandable if she values equality and feels that the author is not committed to sharing the workload equally. \n\nSo, while the author might be stating his beliefs, he's not considering the possibility of changing roles and the importance of mutual agreement in a relationship. By stating that an equal split isn't possible, he's not addressing the girlfriend's needs and expectations, which could be seen as being in the wrong.\n"
