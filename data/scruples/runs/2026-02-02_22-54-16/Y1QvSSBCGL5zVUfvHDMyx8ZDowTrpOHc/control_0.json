I think she's not understanding what I'm saying or is naive about parenthood.\n\nI told her that there's no way when we have children that we will be able to split the load completely evenly. There are biological components to motherhood that come into play, like maternal instincts and post partum bonding and such, that require the mother to spend more time with the child immediately after birth. Additionally, because of this, it is often more likely feasible for the mother to stay home or at least be the primary parent for the child, in addition to economic factors that usually result in the man being the breadwinner and the woman being the primary parent. Thus, odds are, she will be the primary parent for our children for a variety of reasons, and there is no way we will be able to have a completely equal split. \n\nShe told me she will not have a child with a man who does not agree to split the work evenly, while I am arguing that it is not possible, particularly right after birth but also down the line. She is reconsidering our relationship now and I need to know if I'm being the asshole or being logical.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a disagreement with their girlfriend regarding fatherhood and motherhood.\n\nThe author argues that it's impossible to split parenting duties equally because of biological factors like maternal instincts, postpartum bonding, and traditional economic roles. The girlfriend, on the other hand, refuses to have children with someone who doesn't agree to an equal split. Now she's reconsidering the relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the author is being wrong. The key points here are the assumptions the author is making. The author brings up biological differences and traditional roles. However, modern discussions often emphasize the importance of shared responsibility regardless of gender. The author might be making generalizations that don't account for the fact that many couples do share responsibilities equally, and that societal norms are changing. \n\nBy stating that it's \"fundamentally different\" and that the mother must be the primary parent, the author could be reinforcing stereotypes that women are inherently more suited for primary caregiving. This could be seen as dismissive of the girlfriend's stance on equality. The girlfriend's refusal isn't about the author not wanting to help, but about expecting an equal partnership, which the author is arguing against based on traditional views.\n\nAdditionally, the author's argument seems to suggest that equality isn't feasible, which might not consider mutual adjustments both parents can make. The use of phrases like \"odds are\" and \"more likely feasible\" implies a fixed role, which might not be respectful of the girlfriend's desire for equality. \n\nIn terms of communication, the author might have presented their view in a way that's rigid rather than open to dialogue. The girlfriend's reaction indicates that she values equality as a non-negotiable, and the author's stance is conflicting with that. Since relationships require compromise, the author's unwillingness to consider equal sharing despite the girlfriend's clear boundary could be problematic. \n\nTherefore, the author's position is based on traditional gender roles and might not align with the girlfriend's expectations. This could make the author the asshole for not respecting her perspective on equality in parenting. So the answer is A.\n"
