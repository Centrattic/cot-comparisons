I think she's not understanding what I'm saying or is naive about parenthood.\n\nI told her that there's no way when we have children that we will be able to split the load completely evenly. There are biological components to motherhood that come into play, like maternal instincts and post partum bonding and such, that require the mother to spend more time with the child immediately after birth. Additionally, because of this, it is often more likely feasible for the mother to stay home or at least be the primary parent for the child, in addition to economic factors that usually result in the man being the breadwinner and the woman being the primary parent. Thus, odds are, she will be the primary parent for our children for a variety of reasons, and there is no way we will be able to have a completely equal split. \n\nShe told me she will not have a child with a man who does not agree to split the work evenly, while I am arguing that it is not possible, particularly right after birth but also down the line. She is reconsidering our relationship now and I need to know if I'm being the asshole or being logical.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for saying that fatherhood and motherhood are fundamentally different, leading to an argument with his girlfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the points each side is making. The author argues that there are biological factors\u2014like maternal instincts, postpartum bonding, and the physical aspects of childbirth\u2014that make the mother the primary parent initially. He also mentions economic factors where men are often the primary breadwinners. He believes a completely equal split isn't feasible, especially right after birth.\n\nThe girlfriend's response is that she won't have a child with someone who doesn't agree to split the work evenly. Now, she's reconsidering the relationship because of this disagreement.\n\nTo determine if the author is in the wrong, I should think about societal views on parenting roles. There's a growing emphasis on equality in parenting, challenging traditional gender roles. The idea that mothers must be the primary parent is being questioned, with many advocating for shared responsibilities regardless of biology. The author's stance might be seen as reinforcing outdated stereotypes, assuming that women are naturally more suited for primary caregiving. \n\nHowever, the author isn't dismissing the idea of equality entirely. He's acknowledging that while the split can't be perfectly even immediately post-birth, it could be more balanced later. But his girlfriend's stance is absolute\u2014she wants an even split from the start. The problem might be the author's framing of these biological factors as insurmountable, which could be dismissive of her perspective. \n\nAdditionally, the economic argument about men being breadwinners is a traditional view that doesn't account for changing roles where women often are the primary earners. By emphasizing these factors, the author might be overlooking the possibility of shared roles through mutual agreement and support, rather than defaulting to traditional splits.\n\nThe key here is whether the author's position is rigid or if he's open to negotiation. If he's dismissing her desire for equality as naive, that could be problematic. The girlfriend is setting a boundary based on her values, which is valid. The author's response might not respect her boundaries, especially if he's not willing to explore flexible arrangements that align with her expectations.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author has valid points about biological and economic factors, framing the discussion in a way that seems to accept traditional roles without room for alternative approaches might be the issue. The girlfriend's boundary is about her non-negotiable stance on equality. The author's refusal to compromise on the initial split could be seen as not respecting her perspective, making him the asshole in this scenario.\n"
