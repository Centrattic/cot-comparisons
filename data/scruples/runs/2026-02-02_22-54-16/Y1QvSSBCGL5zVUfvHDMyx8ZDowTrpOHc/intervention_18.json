I think she's not understanding what I'm saying or is naive about parenthood.\n\nI told her that there's no way when we have children that we will be able to split the load completely evenly. There are biological components to motherhood that come into play, like maternal instincts and post partum bonding and such, that require the mother to spend more time with the child immediately after birth. Additionally, because of this, it is often more likely feasible for the mother to stay home or at least be the primary parent for the child, in addition to economic factors that usually result in the man being the breadwinner and the woman being the primary parent. Thus, odds are, she will be the primary parent for our children for a variety of reasons, and there is no way we will be able to have a completely equal split. \n\nShe told me she will not have a child with a man who does not agree to split the work evenly, while I am arguing that it is not possible, particularly right after birth but also down the line. She is reconsidering our relationship now and I need to know if I'm being the asshole or being logical.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for saying that fatherhood and motherhood are fundamentally different, leading to an unequal split in child-rearing responsibilities. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the arguments both parties present. The author states that biological factors like maternal instincts and postpartum bonding mean the mother has to spend more time with the child immediately after birth. They also mention economic factors where the man is more likely to be the breadwinner, making the woman the primary parent. The girlfriend, however, refuses to have a child with someone who doesn't agree to an equal split.\n\nThe key here is whether the author's reasoning is valid. The author is making a generalization based on biological and societal trends. However, there's a growing emphasis on shared parenting and challenging traditional gender roles. The author's stance might be seen as reinforcing stereotypes, which could be problematic. Even if their reasoning is based on current realities, suggesting that equality isn't possible might undermine efforts towards more equitable partnerships. The girlfriend's reaction could stem from a desire for equality and a rejection of traditional roles. \n\nBut then, the author is trying to be realistic about what's feasible. The question is whether being realistic in this context is acceptable or if it's setting a harmful precedent. If the author is dismissing the possibility of equality despite both wanting to work towards it, that's an issue. However, if they're just stating current trends without being dismissive, it's more nuanced.\n\nAlso, the girlfriend's reaction is significant. If she's using this as a deal-breaker, it might not be about the argument itself but how it's presented. The author might need to listen more and find a middle ground rather than insisting on their stance. But the core of the question is whether the author is wrong for their initial statement. \n\nConsidering societal shifts, the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong because they're perpetuating traditional gender roles. However, if the author is honest about the challenges and both parties are willing to adapt, it's a discussion point rather than a deal-breaker. The problem arises if the author is unwilling to consider shared responsibilities despite the biological aspects. \n\nIn conclusion, the author's argument is based on current realities, but the expectation of equality in the relationship is valid. The answer might be that the author isn't in the wrong for stating their view, but they need to engage in a more collaborative discussion rather than being rigid. However, given the girlfriend's strong reaction, the author's stance might not align with her values, which could be a point of contention. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong, not whether their girlfriend is right. Given that the author is stating their perspective and the girlfriend is reacting based on her values, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. So the answer would be B.\n"
