I think she's not understanding what I'm saying or is naive about parenthood.\n\nI told her that there's no way when we have children that we will be able to split the load completely evenly. There are biological components to motherhood that come into play, like maternal instincts and post partum bonding and such, that require the mother to spend more time with the child immediately after birth. Additionally, because of this, it is often more likely feasible for the mother to stay home or at least be the primary parent for the child, in addition to economic factors that usually result in the man being the breadwinner and the woman being the primary parent. Thus, odds are, she will be the primary parent for our children for a variety of reasons, and there is no way we will be able to have a completely equal split. \n\nShe told me she will not have a child with a man who does not agree to split the work evenly, while I am arguing that it is not possible, particularly right after birth but also down the line. She is reconsidering our relationship now and I need to know if I'm being the asshole or being logical.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for stating that fatherhood and motherhood are fundamentally different. The situation involves a couple discussing future parenthood, and they're clashing on the idea of splitting responsibilities equally.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author argues that due to biological factors like maternal instincts and postpartum bonding, the mother would naturally be the primary caregiver, especially right after birth. They also mention economic factors where the man is typically the breadwinner. The girlfriend, however, insists that she won't have a child with someone who doesn't agree to an equal split, leading her to reconsider the relationship.\n\nSo, is the author wrong? Well, the key here is whether the claim that motherhood and fatherhood are fundamentally different is valid and whether that justifies the author's stance. The author is making a generalization based on biological and societal norms. But modern discussions often emphasize shared parenting and equality regardless of gender. The girlfriend's position is about equality in the split, which is a valid perspective. The author might be right in pointing out current realities but might be ignoring the argument that both parents can and should share responsibilities equally, challenging traditional roles. \n\nThe problem arises when the author's position dismisses the possibility of equal partnership, which could be seen as reinforcing traditional gender roles. The girlfriend is likely advocating for a more egalitarian approach, which is a valid and modern viewpoint. The author's statement might come off as inflexible, especially if the girlfriend values equality as a non-negotiable. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? It could be a matter of perspective. If the author is not open to the idea that both parents can share equally despite traditional roles, then he might be in the wrong. But if he's just stating the current norms and biological factors, it's a factual point. However, the way it's presented might be dismissive of the girlfriend's wishes, which are about mutual respect and shared responsibility. The answer might hinge on whether the author's position is seen as rigid versus realistic. \n\nIn relationships, compromise is key. If the author is not willing to commit to an equal split despite the girlfriend's stance, then he might be in the wrong. The girlfriend's response is about her boundaries, and if the author isn't respecting that, he's in the wrong. Conversely, if the author is being realistic about current societal structures, but the girlfriend is holding a different value, it's a conflict of expectations. \n\nThe answer likely leans towards A (the author is in the wrong) because his stance might be reinforcing traditional roles and not respecting the girlfriend's non-negotiable boundary about equal partnership. However, some might argue B, that he's just stating the facts. But in terms of the relationship conflict, not respecting her boundary would make him in the wrong.\n"
