I think she's not understanding what I'm saying or is naive about parenthood.\n\nI told her that there's no way when we have children that we will be able to split the load completely evenly. There are biological components to motherhood that come into play, like maternal instincts and post partum bonding and such, that require the mother to spend more time with the child immediately after birth. Additionally, because of this, it is often more likely feasible for the mother to stay home or at least be the primary parent for the child, in addition to economic factors that usually result in the man being the breadwinner and the woman being the primary parent. Thus, odds are, she will be the primary parent for our children for a variety of reasons, and there is no way we will be able to have a completely equal split. \n\nShe told me she will not have a child with a man who does not agree to split the work evenly, while I am arguing that it is not possible, particularly right after birth but also down the line. She is reconsidering our relationship now and I need to know if I'm being the asshole or being logical.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the question is in the wrong. The situation is about a disagreement between him and his girlfriend regarding splitting parental responsibilities equally.\n\nFirst, the author argues that fatherhood and motherhood aren't the same because of biological factors like maternal instincts and postpartum bonding. He also mentions economic factors where men are more likely to be the breadwinner. He's saying that it's not feasible to split the load evenly, especially right after birth. His girlfriend, however, won't have kids with someone who doesn't agree to an equal split.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is wrong. Let me break it down. The author is making claims about inherent differences in motherhood and practical economic realities. But is he oversimplifying? For example, the idea of maternal instincts being stronger is a traditional view but not everyone agrees with it. Some people argue that parenting roles can be more flexible with support and choice. Also, the economic factor isn't a given anymore; many women are primary earners now, and there's a growing movement towards shared parenting.\n\nThe author's stance might come off as rigid or not considering modern perspectives where couples choose different roles based on personal circumstances rather than traditional gender roles. By stating that equality isn't possible, he might be dismissing his girlfriend's desire for equality, which is a valid perspective for her. His response could be seen as not valuing her viewpoint, leading to the conflict.\n\nOn the other hand, he's trying to be realistic about biological and practical aspects. However, framing it as an absolute where equality is impossible might not account for the possibility of adjusting roles or challenging traditional norms. The girlfriend's reaction is about respecting her choice in how she wants to parent, which is important in a relationship.\n\nSo, considering both sides, the author's reasoning might not be wrong factually, but the way he's presenting it could be seen as not respecting his partner's values. In relationships, communication and mutual respect matter a lot. If he's not open to the idea that they could find a different arrangement, even if it's not equal, that might be where the issue lies. Therefore, the answer might lean towards him being in the wrong because he's not considering alternative viewpoints and is being rigid.\n"
