I think she's not understanding what I'm saying or is naive about parenthood.\n\nI told her that there's no way when we have children that we will be able to split the load completely evenly. There are biological components to motherhood that come into play, like maternal instincts and post partum bonding and such, that require the mother to spend more time with the child immediately after birth. Additionally, because of this, it is often more likely feasible for the mother to stay home or at least be the primary parent for the child, in addition to economic factors that usually result in the man being the breadwinner and the woman being the primary parent. Thus, odds are, she will be the primary parent for our children for a variety of reasons, and there is no way we will be able to have a completely equal split. \n\nShe told me she will not have a child with a man who does not agree to split the work evenly, while I am arguing that it is not possible, particularly right after birth but also down the line.

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's start by breaking down the situation. The author is talking about a disagreement with his girlfriend about fatherhood and motherhood. He says that when they have kids, they can't split the responsibilities evenly because of biological factors like maternal instincts and postpartum bonding. He also mentions that economically, it's more feasible for the mom to be the primary parent. The girlfriend, on the other hand, says she won't have a child with someone who doesn't agree to an equal split.\n\nFirst, I should consider the arguments each side is making. The author is making a case based on biology and traditional economic roles. He's saying that there are inherent reasons why the mother would be the primary parent. But I wonder if that's a stereotype. Like, are there studies that support the idea that maternal instincts are so strong that the mother must be the primary parent? Or is that just a traditional view that might not hold in modern contexts where many fathers are equally involved?\n\nThen there's the economic point. The author assumes that the man will be the breadwinner, which might not be the case anymore. In today's world, many women are the primary earners, and some couples choose different arrangements. So maybe the author is relying on outdated assumptions here.\n\nThe girlfriend's stance is that she wants an equal split. That could be a valid personal choice. She's setting a boundary that if he can't commit to equal parenting, she can't see a future with him. Is that unreasonable? If someone values equality in parenting, then her reaction might be justified.\n\nThe author also says there's no way to split the load evenly, but he's not accounting for the possibility that both parents could adjust and find a way to share responsibilities as much as possible. Even if the initial period is more for the mother, maybe over time they can balance things out. The author's argument seems to dismiss the father's role or potential to be equally involved, which could be problematic.\n\nAnother angle: the author is making assumptions about his future partner's role based on her being a woman. That might come off as sexist, even if he doesn't mean it that way. Assuming that she will naturally take the primary role without discussing how they can both adapt could be seen as not respecting her autonomy or his own potential role.\n\nAlso, the author is framing his position as logical, but it's possible that his logic is rooted in societal norms rather than actual facts. If the girlfriend wants equality, and he's not willing to commit to that regardless of the circumstances, that's a dealbreaker for her. So maybe his argument is less about logic and more about not wanting to challenge traditional gender roles.\n\nIn terms of relationships, communication is key. If they can't find common ground, it's a problem. The author might not be in the wrong if he's sticking to his beliefs, but if those beliefs are causing friction and he's unwilling to compromise, that could be an issue. The girlfriend is asserting her needs, which is valid. If he's not willing to meet her halfway, then he might be the one in the wrong because he's not respecting her boundaries.\n\nSo putting it all together, the author's arguments could be seen as reinforcing gender stereotypes and not considering changing societal norms. The girlfriend is standing firm on her values, so the author might be the asshole here.\n"
