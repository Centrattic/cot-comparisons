I think she's not understanding what I'm saying or is naive about parenthood.\n\nI told her that there's no way when we have children that we will be able to split the load completely evenly. There are biological components to motherhood that come into play, like maternal instincts and post partum bonding and such, that require the mother to spend more time with the child immediately after birth. Additionally, because of this, it is often more likely feasible for the mother to stay home or at least be the primary parent for the child, in addition to economic factors that usually result in the man being the breadwinner and the woman being the primary parent. Thus, odds are, she will be the primary parent for our children for a variety of reasons, and there is no way we will be able to have a completely equal split. \n\nShe told me she will not have a child with a man who does not agree to split the work evenly, while I am arguing that it is not possible, particularly right after birth but also down the line. She is reconsidering our relationship now and I need to know if I'm being the asshole or being logical.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for saying that fatherhood and motherhood are fundamentally different. The author's main points are about the biological aspects like maternal instincts, postpartum bonding, and the economic factors that usually lead the mother to be the primary parent.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if the author is making an invalid assumption. They mention biological components, which is a common belief, but it's also a topic of debate. Some might argue that these roles are socially constructed rather than innate. By stating that the mother should be the primary parent, the author might be reinforcing traditional gender roles. The girlfriend wants an equal split, which could be her way of advocating for shared responsibility regardless of biology.\n\nThe author's argument could be seen as dismissing the girlfriend's perspective, which might make her feel unheard. Even if the author believes they're being logical, the way they present their argument could come across as inflexible. The girlfriend's reaction is significant here\u2014she's reconsidering the relationship because of this, which suggests that the author's stance is a deal-breaker for her. \n\nAlso, the author's mention of economic factors assuming the man is the breadwinner is a stereotype. In many relationships, both partners might earn similar incomes, or the woman might be the primary earner. The author's assumption here could be outdated or not applicable to their specific situation. \n\nSo, while the author may feel they're being realistic, their approach might be seen as not respecting the girlfriend's desire for equality, regardless of traditional roles. It's possible that the author isn't in the wrong, but their communication could be improved. However, the question is whether they're in the wrong. Since the girlfriend's perspective is equally valid and the author's stance is based on assumptions that may not align with the girlfriend's values, the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong. But I'm a bit conflicted. The key here is understanding mutual respect and compromise in a relationship. If the author is unwilling to consider alternative viewpoints, that could be problematic. So, considering all angles, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
