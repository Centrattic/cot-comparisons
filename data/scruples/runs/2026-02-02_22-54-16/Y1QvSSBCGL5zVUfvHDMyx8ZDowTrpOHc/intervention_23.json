I think she's not understanding what I'm saying or is naive about parenthood.\n\nI told her that there's no way when we have children that we will be able to split the load completely evenly. There are biological components to motherhood that come into play, like maternal instincts and post partum bonding and such, that require the mother to spend more time with the child immediately after birth. Additionally, because of this, it is often more likely feasible for the mother to stay home or at least be the primary parent for the child, in addition to economic factors that usually result in the man being the breadwinner and the woman being the primary parent. Thus, odds are, she will be the primary parent for our children for a variety of reasons, and there is no way we will be able to have a completely equal split. \n\nShe told me she will not have a child with a man who does not agree to split the work evenly, while I am arguing that it is not possible, particularly right after birth but also down the line. She is reconsidering our relationship now and I need to know if I'm being the asshole or being logical.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for stating that fatherhood and motherhood are fundamentally different. The author argues that biological factors like maternal instincts and postpartum bonding mean the mother will likely be the primary parent, making an equal split impossible. The girlfriend is upset and considering ending the relationship.\n\nFirst, the author's points are based on biological and economic factors. They mention maternal instincts and postpartum bonding, which are real things. But does that mean it's impossible for the father to be the primary parent? The author seems to assume that these factors make the mother's role more fixed, but that's a generalization. Not all mothers feel the same, and societal changes are shifting towards more shared parenting roles. Also, economic factors are changing, with more women being the primary earners. So the author's stance might be based on outdated assumptions.\n\nThe girlfriend's response is firm: she won't have children with someone who doesn't agree to an equal split. That's her boundary, which is valid. The author's argument might come across as dismissive of her desire for equality. Even if there are biological differences, the author's statement could be seen as not valuing shared responsibility, which is a key aspect of modern relationships. The author might be underestimating the couple's ability to adapt and share parenting roles beyond traditional gender roles.\n\nAlso, framing the situation as \"not possible\" might be too rigid. While there are challenges, many couples do manage to share parenting more equally. The author's approach might be closing the door to compromise. The girlfriend's reaction, though strong, is a response to feeling unheard or not respected in her values. So, the author's argument, while possibly based on some truths, could be contributing to a conflict by not acknowledging the possibility of shared parenting or the importance of mutual effort. \n\nIn terms of whether the author is in the wrong, it's about perspective. The author is sharing their viewpoint, but if the girlfriend feels that their future together is incompatible because the author isn't open to shared parenting, then the author's stance might be the issue. The key is whether the author is dismissive of their partner's needs or if they're just stating their view. The author's conclusion that there's \"no way\" for equality could be seen as inflexible, leading to the conflict. So, maybe the author is in the wrong because they're not considering the possibility of shared responsibility despite challenges.\n"
