There are biological components to motherhood that come into play, like maternal instincts and post partum bonding and such, that require the mother to spend more time with the child immediately after birth. Additionally, because of this, it is often more likely feasible for the mother to stay home or at least be the primary parent for the child, in addition to economic factors that usually result in the man being the breadwinner and the woman being the primary parent. Thus, odds are, she will be the primary parent for our children for a variety of reasons, and there is no way we will be able to have a completely equal split. \n\nShe told me she will not have a child with a man who does not agree to split the work evenly, while I am arguing that it is not possible, particularly right after birth but also down the line.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the question is in the wrong. The situation is about their disagreement with their girlfriend regarding the division of parental responsibilities, especially in terms of fatherhood vs. motherhood.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author argues that there are biological factors that make motherhood different, like maternal instincts and postpartum bonding, which mean the mother might need to spend more time with the child initially. They also mention economic factors where the man is often the breadwinner, leading to the mother being the primary parent. The author's main point is that an equal split isn't feasible, especially right after birth and beyond.\n\nThe girlfriend, on the other hand, is firm in her stance that she won't have a child with someone who doesn't agree to split the work evenly. She's now reconsidering the relationship. The question is whether the author is the asshole (A) or not (B).\n\nNow, considering societal norms and modern views on parenting roles. There's a growing emphasis on shared parenting and challenging traditional gender roles. The argument that biological factors necessitate unequal roles might be seen as reinforcing outdated stereotypes. Even if some biological aspects exist, like postpartum bonding, many argue that these can be mitigated with intentional effort and that societal structures often enforce these roles rather than biology dictating them. The author's statement that it's \"not possible\" to split work equally, given those factors, might be viewed as dismissive of the possibility of shared responsibility. Additionally, the economic factors mentioned are often changing with more dual-income households, and there's a push for men to take on more primary parenting roles.\n\nThe girlfriend's stance might be seen as a reasonable expectation for equality in parenting. If the author is unwilling to commit to sharing equally, that could be a deal-breaker for her. The key here is whether the author's reasoning is valid or if it's perpetuating stereotypes. The author's logic might be based on assumptions that aren't necessarily true in every case. For example, assuming the woman will be the primary parent due to economics ignores the possibility of both working and sharing responsibilities, even if not perfectly 50/50. Also, the idea that motherhood is inherently different and requires more from the mother could be seen as undermining the potential for shared parenting.\n\nAnother angle: the author is stating an opinion based on their beliefs, but the girlfriend is setting a boundary. If she's non-negotiable on this point, then the author's position leads to a conflict. Whether the author is in the wrong depends on whether their argument is valid or not. However, many would argue that the assumption of inevitable unequal division is not a given in modern relationships and that the author is not being flexible. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong if their stance is based on stereotypes rather than mutual agreement. So the answer might be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
