I think she's not understanding what I'm saying or is naive about parenthood.\n\nI told her that there's no way when we have children that we will be able to split the load completely evenly. There are biological components to motherhood that come into play, like maternal instincts and post partum bonding and such, that require the mother to spend more time with the child immediately after birth. Additionally, because of this, it is often more likely feasible for the mother to stay home or at least be the primary parent for the child, in addition to economic factors that usually result in the man being the breadwinner and the woman being the primary parent. Thus, odds are, she will be the primary parent for our children for a variety of reasons, and there is no way we will be able to have a completely equal split. \n\nShe told me she will not have a child with a man who does not agree to split the work evenly, while I am arguing that it is not possible, particularly right after birth but also down the line.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a disagreement between a couple regarding the division of parenting responsibilities.\n\nThe author argues that motherhood and fatherhood are fundamentally different due to biological factors, like maternal instincts and postpartum bonding, which he says require the mother to spend more time with the child immediately after birth. He also mentions economic factors where the man is typically the breadwinner, so the mother would likely be the primary parent. Therefore, he believes an equal split isn't possible. His girlfriend, however, insists that she won't have a child with someone who doesn't agree to an equal split, leading her to reconsider the relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the author's points. He brings up biological and economic factors. Biologically, it's true that pregnancy and childbirth are physical processes that the mother undergoes, and postpartum bonding is often emphasized. However, the idea that maternal instincts are so strong and inherent that the mother must be the primary parent is a point of debate. Many studies and modern parenting approaches emphasize that parenting can be shared and that fathers can just as effectively bond with their children. The concept of \"maternal instinct\" is sometimes criticized as a societal construct rather than a biological necessity.\n\nEconomically, the author assumes that the man will be the breadwinner. This is an outdated assumption, as many households now have dual incomes or the mother as the primary earner. The assumption might stem from traditional gender roles, which are increasingly being challenged. The author's stance could be seen as reinforcing gender stereotypes, even if they are based on current trends.\n\nThe girlfriend's perspective is about equality. She wants an equal split, which is a valid desire. Her reaction is based on the principle that both parents should share responsibilities equally, regardless of traditional roles. The author's argument that equality isn't feasible might come off as dismissive of her values. Even if he's being \"logical\" based on his view of reality, if the girlfriend's values are non-negotiable, the conflict is about differing priorities.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. From a modern perspective, promoting equal sharing of parenting duties is seen as progressive. The author's stance, while based on traditional views, might be perceived as not being open to the possibility of shared parenting. By not acknowledging that societal norms and personal arrangements can evolve, he might be seen as rigid. The girlfriend is asserting her right to a partnership where she expects equal contribution, which is a reasonable expectation in many relationships today.\n\nSo, while the author might not be factually incorrect in pointing out current trends and biological aspects, his unwillingness to consider shared parenting as a feasible or desired model could be problematic. The key here is the conflict between his practical assessment and her principled stance. If the girlfriend's deal-breaker is non-negotiable, the author's refusal to meet her expectation could be seen as not respecting her values, thus making him the asshole in the situation. However, if the author is just stating his views without pressuring her, the fault line is thinner. The situation likely depends on how the argument was conducted\u2014was he dismissive or open to discussion? The post suggests he's arguing it's not possible, which might not leave room for compromise, leading to her reconsidering the relationship. \n\nTherefore, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because he's holding to traditional roles that may not align with his partner's expectations, and his stance could be seen as invalidating her desire for equality. Even if his points have some basis in reality, the inability to meet her non-negotiable condition could make him the asshole.\n"
