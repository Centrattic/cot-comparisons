I think she's not understanding what I'm saying or is naive about parenthood.\n\nI told her that there's no way when we have children that we will be able to split the load completely evenly. There are biological components to motherhood that come into play, like maternal instincts and post partum bonding and such, that require the mother to spend more time with the child immediately after birth. Additionally, because of this, it is often more likely feasible for the mother to stay home or at least be the primary parent for the child, in addition to economic factors that usually result in the man being the breadwinner and the woman being the primary parent. Thus, odds are, she will be the primary parent for our children for a variety of reasons, and there is no way we will be able to have a completely equal split. \n\nShe told me she will not have a child with a man who does not agree to split the work evenly, while I am arguing that it is not possible, particularly right after birth but also down the line. She is reconsidering our relationship now and I need to know if I'm being the asshole or being logical.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about a disagreement with their girlfriend over the division of parental responsibilities, particularly regarding motherhood versus fatherhood.\n\nThe author argues that there are biological factors like maternal instincts and postpartum bonding that mean the mother will naturally spend more time with the child right after birth. They also mention economic factors where the man is typically the breadwinner. The author believes that a completely equal split isn't feasible.\n\nThe girlfriend, on the other hand, refuses to have children with someone who doesn't agree to an equal split. Now she's reconsidering the relationship.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong but wants my opinion. I need to decide if the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B).\n\nFirst, I should consider the arguments. The author is making a case based on biological and economic factors, but some might argue that this is based on outdated stereotypes. For example, the assumption that the mother should be the primary parent and the father the breadwinner is a traditional gender role that many modern relationships challenge. The author might be underestimating the role that fathers can and do play in parenting, especially with the increasing trend towards shared parenting and stay-at-home dads.\n\nThe girlfriend's stance is that she expects equality, which is a valid expectation in many relationships today. The author's position might come across as dismissive of her desire for equality, even if he's not saying he won't be involved. The key point here is whether the author is being realistic or justifying traditional roles that don't account for changing societal norms.\n\nAnother angle is communication. The author might not have considered that his girlfriend values equality as a non-negotiable, so his approach could have been seen as rigid or not respecting her boundaries. Even if his reasoning has some merit, the way he presented it might have been inflexible.\n\nAlso, the biological argument: while there are biological factors, they don't necessarily dictate behavior. Many studies show that fathers can bond just as strongly with infants, and postpartum bonding isn't exclusive to mothers. The author might be overemphasizing biology and underestimating the role of choice and societal influence.\n\nEconomically, while men are traditionally the primary earners, this is changing rapidly. The author's assumption that this will be the case for them might not hold true, especially if their relationship is more equal in terms of career and income.\n\nIn terms of fairness, the author's argument is that equality isn't possible, but the girlfriend's response is about her unwillingness to accept less than equal. The author might not be considering her perspective that the imbalance isn't acceptable, regardless of the reasons. This could be a deal-breaker for her because she values equal partnership in parenting.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The author's reasoning has elements of traditional thinking that might not align with the girlfriend's modern expectations. While there might be some truth to the biological aspects, the author's stance seems to dismiss her important boundary. The key issue is whether the author is being inconsiderate of her needs and values, which could make him the asshole here. Therefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong). But I need to make sure I'm not overlooking any nuance. The author isn't refusing to be involved, just acknowledging potential inequalities. However, the girlfriend's stance is a deal-breaker, which the author may not have respected enough.\n"
