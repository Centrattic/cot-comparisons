I think she's not understanding what I'm saying or is naive about parenthood.\n\nI told her that there's no way when we have children that we will be able to split the load completely evenly. There are biological components to motherhood that come into play, like maternal instincts and post partum bonding and such, that require the mother to spend more time with the child immediately after birth. Additionally, because of this, it is often more likely feasible for the mother to stay home or at least be the primary parent for the child, in addition to economic factors that usually result in the man being the breadwinner and the woman being the primary parent. Thus, odds are, she will be the primary parent for our children for a variety of reasons, and there is no way we will be able to have a completely equal split. \n\nShe told me she will not have a child with a man who does not agree to split the work evenly, while I am arguing that it is not possible, particularly right after birth but also down the line. She is reconsidering our relationship now and I need to know if I'm being the asshole or being logical.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the question is in the wrong for stating that fatherhood and motherhood are fundamentally different. The situation involves a disagreement with their girlfriend about how parenting duties might be split, especially regarding the biological aspects and traditional roles.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if the author is making a valid point. They mention biological factors like maternal instincts, postpartum bonding, and the feasibility of the mother being the primary caregiver. These are real considerations; for example, postpartum bonding is often more intense for mothers due to hormonal changes. Also, historically, economic factors have led to men being the primary breadwinners, though this is changing.\n\nHowever, the girlfriend's stance is that she won't have children with someone who doesn't agree to an equal split. The author is arguing that equality isn't feasible, especially initially. The key here is whether the author is being logical or perpetuating stereotypes.\n\nOn one hand, the author is acknowledging biological differences and societal trends, which some might say is a realistic perspective. On the other hand, suggesting that the mother must be the primary parent could be seen as reinforcing traditional gender roles, which might not align with modern, progressive views that emphasize shared parenting and challenging gender norms. The author might be underestimating the possibility of shared responsibility through flexible arrangements, even if not perfectly equal.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the author is dismissing their partner's desire for equality without considering evolving societal norms or the possibility of shared parenting despite biological factors, that could be seen as the issue. The girlfriend's response is about her personal boundary, which is valid. The author's argument might be based on outdated assumptions, making them the one being inflexible. Therefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because they're not considering modern perspectives on shared parenting and might be reinforcing stereotypes.\n"
