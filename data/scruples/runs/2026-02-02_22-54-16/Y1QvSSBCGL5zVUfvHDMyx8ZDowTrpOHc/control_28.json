I think she's not understanding what I'm saying or is naive about parenthood.\n\nI told her that there's no way when we have children that we will be able to split the load completely evenly. There are biological components to motherhood that come into play, like maternal instincts and post partum bonding and such, that require the mother to spend more time with the child immediately after birth. Additionally, because of this, it is often more likely feasible for the mother to stay home or at least be the primary parent for the child, in addition to economic factors that usually result in the man being the breadwinner and the woman being the primary parent. Thus, odds are, she will be the primary parent for our children for a variety of reasons, and there is no way we will be able to have a completely equal split. \n\nShe told me she will not have a child with a man who does not agree to split the work evenly, while I am arguing that it is not possible, particularly right after birth but also down the line.

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author is a guy who told his girlfriend that fatherhood and motherhood are fundamentally different. He argues that it's not possible to split parenting responsibilities equally because of biological factors like maternal instincts, postpartum bonding, and economic reasons where men are more likely to be the primary breadwinners. His girlfriend is upset and considering ending the relationship because she won't have a child with someone who doesn't agree to an equal split. The question is whether the author is the asshole (AITA) or if he's just being logical.\n\nFirst, I should consider the arguments on both sides. The author is making claims about biological and economic factors making equal parenting impossible. His girlfriend wants an equal split, which he's saying isn't feasible. The core issue here seems to be their differing views on parenting roles and whether equality is possible or even desirable.\n\nThe author brings up maternal instincts and postpartum bonding. I know that some studies say that maternal instincts are more pronounced, but others argue that bonding is possible for fathers too. The economic point about men being breadwinners might not hold as strongly in many modern contexts where women are often primary earners or both partners work. However, societal expectations might still influence this, even if they're outdated.\n\nThe key here is whether the author's statements are factually accurate or if he's making assumptions. Saying that it's \"fundamentally different\" and that equality is impossible could be seen as making broad generalizations. While there are biological differences, like pregnancy and childbirth being the mother's role, the extent to which these affect parenting roles is debated. Plus, many couples manage to share responsibilities more equally, even if not perfectly. The author's stance might be contributing to gender stereotypes, implying that the mother should be the primary caregiver, which could be seen as dismissive of the girlfriend's desire for equality.\n\nOn the other side, the girlfriend is clear in her stance that she won't have children with someone who doesn't agree to an equal split. Her position might be based on her values or experiences, and she's not willing to compromise. The author's response might have been perceived as dismissing her values or not respecting her stance, leading to the conflict.\n\nIs the author wrong? Well, making sweeping statements about gender roles in parenting can be problematic. While there are biological factors, the author's argument could be seen as reinforcing traditional gender roles rather than acknowledging the possibility of shared parenting. The assumption that the mother must be the primary parent due to economic factors might also be outdated, as dual-income households are common, and sharing responsibilities is increasingly feasible.\n\nHowever, the author is also stating his perspective based on what he believes is logical. He's not necessarily wrong in his opinion, but the way he's presenting it as an absolute (that equality is impossible) might be the issue. It could come off as not valuing his partner's wishes and not being open to negotiation or compromise.\n\nIn relationships, respecting each other's values is crucial. If the girlfriend is clear that she wants an equal split and the author is not willing to agree, that's a significant point of contention. The author might not be factually wrong in his arguments, but ethically, he might be in the wrong if he's not respecting her boundaries and expectations for the future.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because he's not respecting his partner's non-negotiable requirement and is making assumptions that could be reinforcing gender stereotypes, even if he believes he's being logical.\n"
