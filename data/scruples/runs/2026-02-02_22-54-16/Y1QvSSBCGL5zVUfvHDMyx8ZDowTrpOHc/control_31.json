I think she's not understanding what I'm saying or is naive about parenthood.\n\nI told her that there's no way when we have children that we will be able to split the load completely evenly. There are biological components to motherhood that come into play, like maternal instincts and post partum bonding and such, that require the mother to spend more time with the child immediately after birth. Additionally, because of this, it is often more likely feasible for the mother to stay home or at least be the primary parent for the child, in addition to economic factors that usually result in the man being the breadwinner and the woman being the primary parent. Thus, odds are, she will be the primary parent for our children for a variety of reasons, and there is no way we will be able to have a completely equal split. \n\nShe told me she will not have a child with a man who does not agree to split the work evenly, while I am arguing that it is not possible, particularly right after birth but also down the line.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author told his girlfriend that fatherhood and motherhood are fundamentally different, leading to a disagreement about how they would share parenting responsibilities. She's upset and considering ending the relationship because he doesn't agree to an equal split.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author argues that there are biological factors that make it so the mother can't split the parenting equally. He mentions maternal instincts, postpartum bonding, and economic factors where the man is usually the breadwinner. So he's saying that these factors make it so the mother would naturally be the primary parent. The girlfriend, on the other hand, wants an equal split and is upset because he's not on board with that. She's now rethinking the relationship.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The author is making statements based on biological and societal norms. But is that valid? Are there studies or data that support the idea that mothers must be primary parents due to biology? I know that while there are biological differences (like the mother's body producing milk and the initial bonding period), modern parenting approaches emphasize shared responsibilities. Also, societal roles are changing; more fathers are taking on equal parenting roles, and there are more dual-income households. So maybe the author is generalizing based on outdated or traditional views.\n\nThe girlfriend's stance is that she wants equality. She might be advocating for a more modern, equal approach to parenting. By the author stating that equality isn't possible, he might be dismissing her values. Even if there are biological factors, maybe the author could still commit to sharing as much as possible, even if it's not 50-50. The author's position seems to assume that the mother must take the majority, which might be a rigid stance.\n\nAlso, communication is key in relationships. The author might have expressed this in a way that was dismissive of his girlfriend's feelings or expectations. If she values equal partnership, his refusal to agree could be a deal-breaker for her, which is her right. The author might be in the wrong because he's not being flexible or empathetic to her needs, even if his reasoning has some elements of truth.\n\nBut wait, is the author just being realistic? He's pointing out practical challenges. Maybe he's not wrong in his assessment but is failing to consider that the couple could work together to find a solution that meets both their needs. However, if the girlfriend's non-negotiable is equality, then the author's stance is incompatible with her desires. In that case, maybe the author is in the wrong because he's not willing to adjust his position, even if he believes it's logical.\n\nAnother angle: the author is making assumptions about biological factors that might not be entirely accurate or could be overemphasizing them. For example, while there are maternal instincts, paternal bonds can also be strong. The idea that the mother must stay home due to biology ignores the choice and the changing roles in society. So, by stating that it's not possible to split equally, he might be reinforcing stereotypes.\n\nIn terms of relationship dynamics, respecting each other's values is crucial. If the girlfriend's value is equal parenting and the author's stance is that it's impossible, there's a fundamental mismatch. The author's perspective might be seen as dismissive of her values, leading to conflict. Therefore, even if he has logical points, the way he's presenting them could be hurtful or disrespectful.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author might have valid points about challenges in equal parenting, his refusal to consider the possibility of shared parenting and his rigid stance could be seen as the problem. The girlfriend is within her right to seek a partner who aligns with her values of equality. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong because he's not being flexible and is using biological arguments to justify traditional roles, which could be hurtful in the context of their relationship.\n"
