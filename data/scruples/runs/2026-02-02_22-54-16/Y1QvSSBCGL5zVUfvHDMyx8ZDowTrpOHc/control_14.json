I think she's not understanding what I'm saying or is naive about parenthood.\n\nI told her that there's no way when we have children that we will be able to split the load completely evenly. There are biological components to motherhood that come into play, like maternal instincts and post partum bonding and such, that require the mother to spend more time with the child immediately after birth. Additionally, because of this, it is often more likely feasible for the mother to stay home or at least be the primary parent for the child, in addition to economic factors that usually result in the man being the breadwinner and the woman being the primary parent. Thus, odds are, she will be the primary parent for our children for a variety of reasons, and there is no way we will be able to have a completely equal split. \n\nShe told me she will not have a child with a man who does not agree to split the work evenly, while I am arguing that it is not possible, particularly right after birth but also down the line. She is reconsidering our relationship now and I need to know if I'm being the asshole or being logical.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling his girlfriend that fatherhood and motherhood are fundamentally different. The situation is about their future plans and how they'll handle parenthood.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the arguments. The author says that it's not possible to split parenting duties evenly because of biological factors like maternal instincts and postpartum bonding. He also mentions that societal and economic factors often lead the mother to be the primary parent. His girlfriend is upset because she wants an equal split, and now she's rethinking the relationship.\n\nI should consider the validity of his points. Are there biological differences between motherhood and fatherhood? Well, yes, biologically, women carry the child and give birth, which can influence immediate bonding. However, the idea that mothers must be primary parents is more of a social construct than a biological necessity. Many studies show that fathers can be just as nurturing and that societal roles are changing.\n\nThe author's argument might be based on outdated gender roles. Assuming that the man will be the breadwinner and the woman the primary parent overlooks the fact that many couples now have dual incomes or different arrangements. The author's stance could be seen as not supporting the possibility of equal sharing, which might disappoint his girlfriend who values equality.\n\nBut is the author wrong? He's stating his view based on his understanding. However, by insisting that equality isn't possible, he might be dismissing his partner's valid perspective. Healthy relationships require compromise and understanding each other's values. If the girlfriend feels her needs for equality aren't respected, that's a significant issue.\n\nSo, the author isn't factually wrong about some biological aspects, but his conclusion that equality isn't possible might stem from societal norms rather than reality. His girlfriend's stance is about her values, and if he isn't willing to support her in that, it's a problem. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong because he's not acknowledging the possibility of shared parenting and is reinforcing traditional roles, which might not align with his partner's expectations.\n"
