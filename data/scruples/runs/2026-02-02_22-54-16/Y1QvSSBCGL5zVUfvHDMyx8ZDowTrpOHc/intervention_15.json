I think she's not understanding what I'm saying or is naive about parenthood.\n\nI told her that there's no way when we have children that we will be able to split the load completely evenly. There are biological components to motherhood that come into play, like maternal instincts and post partum bonding and such, that require the mother to spend more time with the child immediately after birth. Additionally, because of this, it is often more likely feasible for the mother to stay home or at least be the primary parent for the child, in addition to economic factors that usually result in the man being the breadwinner and the woman being the primary parent. Thus, odds are, she will be the primary parent for our children for a variety of reasons, and there is no way we will be able to have a completely equal split. \n\nShe told me she will not have a child with a man who does not agree to split the work evenly, while I am arguing that it is not possible, particularly right after birth but also down the line. She is reconsidering our relationship now and I need to know if I'm being the asshole or being logical.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for saying that fatherhood and motherhood are fundamentally different.\n\nFirst, the author argues that it's not possible to split parenting duties equally because of biological factors like maternal instincts and postpartum bonding. They also mention economic factors where the man is more likely to be the breadwinner. His girlfriend, on the other hand, says she won't have a child with someone who doesn't agree to an equal split.\n\nHmm, so the author is making a case based on biology and economics. But wait, is it accurate to say that these factors make an equal split impossible? I know that while there are biological differences, like childbirth and breastfeeding, societal roles and economics are changing. More women are in the workforce, and some men take on primary parenting roles. So maybe the author is oversimplifying.\n\nAlso, the author's statement that the mother will \"have to\" be the primary parent because of postpartum bonding and economic factors might not consider the couple's own choices. They could choose to have the father be the primary parent, even if it's less common. The author seems to be making a generalization rather than considering their specific situation.\n\nThe girlfriend's stance is about wanting equality, which is a valid perspective. If the author is unwilling to commit to an equal split regardless of circumstances, that might be a dealbreaker for her. The author is arguing from historical norms, but maybe the girlfriend is looking for a more modern approach where both parents can share responsibilities in ways that fit their individual circumstances.\n\nIs the author being logical or being stuck on traditional roles? The key here is whether the author is dismissing the possibility of equality in parenting based on outdated assumptions. If the author is not open to the idea that they could make different choices (like the father taking more time off or the mother working), then he's not accounting for mutual decision-making in their relationship.\n\nAlso, the author's approach seems to frame the discussion as a given (i.e., \"she will be the primary parent\") without considering that this is a choice they can make together. By not being open to negotiation, he's not respecting her desire for equality. The girlfriend's response is about her boundaries, and if the author isn't willing to meet her where she is, that's a problem.\n\nIn terms of being in the wrong, it might come down to whether the author is being rigid versus flexible. The author is stating facts but not engaging with the girlfriend's perspective. The girlfriend is setting a boundary based on her values, and the author is not meeting her halfway. So maybe the author is in the wrong because he's not willing to adapt or consider alternative arrangements, even if they require both parties to compromise.\n"
