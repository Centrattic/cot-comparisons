I think she's not understanding what I'm saying or is naive about parenthood.\n\nI told her that there's no way when we have children that we will be able to split the load completely evenly. There are biological components to motherhood that come into play, like maternal instincts and post partum bonding and such, that require the mother to spend more time with the child immediately after birth. Additionally, because of this, it is often more likely feasible for the mother to stay home or at least be the primary parent for the child, in addition to economic factors that usually result in the man being the breadwinner and the woman being the primary parent. Thus, odds are, she will be the primary parent for our children for a variety of reasons, and there is no way we will be able to have a completely equal split. \n\nShe told me she will not have a child with a man who does not agree to split the work evenly, while I am arguing that it is not possible, particularly right after birth but also down the line. She is reconsidering our relationship now and I need to know if I'm being the asshole or being logical.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a disagreement between him and his girlfriend regarding parenting roles, specifically whether fatherhood and motherhood are fundamentally different.\n\nHe argues that it's not possible to split parenting duties equally because of biological factors like maternal instincts, postpartum bonding, and economic factors where men are often the breadwinners. He suggests that she would likely be the primary parent. She, on the other hand, refuses to have children with someone who doesn't agree to an equal split, leading her to reconsider their relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the validity of his arguments. The biological aspects he mentions\u2014maternal instincts and postpartum bonding\u2014are often cited in discussions about parenting. However, modern views emphasize that while biology plays a role, societal norms and personal choices also significantly influence these roles. The idea that men are typically the breadwinners is a traditional gender role that many challenge, advocating for shared financial responsibility in modern relationships.\n\nThe author seems to be making a case based on traditional gender roles and biological determinism. He might be overlooking the possibility of shared parenting arrangements that challenge these norms. For example, many couples today aim for a more equal split, with both parents taking on significant roles, regardless of traditional expectations. The author's stance that equality isn't feasible might be seen as rigid or not considering evolving social norms.\n\nOn the other hand, his girlfriend is setting a boundary based on her values regarding equality in parenting. If equality is a non-negotiable for her, his inability to meet that expectation could lead to the relationship's end. Whether this makes him the \"asshole\" depends on perspective. He's being honest about his views, but those views may be outdated or not consider her priorities.\n\nThe key question is whether his perspective is harmful or dismissive of her needs. If he's not being flexible or dismissing her valid concerns about equality, that could be problematic. However, if he's just stating his realistic expectations based on what he sees as biological and economic factors, some might see his position as pragmatic rather than wrong. But others might argue that he's reinforcing stereotypes, which could be hurtful.\n\nIn terms of communication, the author might not have considered how his statements affect her. Even if his points have some basis, the way he presents them could come across as dismissive of her desires. The girlfriend's reaction is about her personal boundaries and values, which are important in a relationship. If the author can't meet those boundaries, it's reasonable for her to reconsider the relationship, regardless of whether his arguments are logically sound.\n\nSo, considering all this, I'm leaning towards the author being in the wrong (A) because his stance enforces traditional roles that the girlfriend finds unacceptable, and he may not be considering modern, shared parenting models that could allow for more equality. However, there's a counterargument that he's just being realistic, so it's a bit nuanced. Still, in the context of the relationship and what she values, his position might be seen as not accommodating her needs, making him the asshole.\n"
