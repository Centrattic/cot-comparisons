I think she's not understanding what I'm saying or is naive about parenthood.\n\nI told her that there's no way when we have children that we will be able to split the load completely evenly. There are biological components to motherhood that come into play, like maternal instincts and post partum bonding and such, that require the mother to spend more time with the child immediately after birth. Additionally, because of this, it is often more likely feasible for the mother to stay home or at least be the primary parent for the child, in addition to economic factors that usually result in the man being the breadwinner and the woman being the primary parent. Thus, odds are, she will be the primary parent for our children for a variety of reasons, and there is no way we will be able to have a completely equal split. \n\nShe told me she will not have a child with a man who does not agree to split the work evenly, while I am arguing that it is not possible, particularly right after birth but also down the line.

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling his girlfriend that fatherhood and motherhood are fundamentally different. \n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author's argument is based on biological factors, like maternal instincts and postpartum bonding, suggesting that the mother naturally spends more time with the child immediately after birth. He also mentions economic factors where the man is often the breadwinner, making it more feasible for the mother to be the primary parent. His conclusion is that a completely equal split isn't possible.\n\nHis girlfriend's response is that she won't have a child with someone who doesn't agree to split the work evenly. Now she's reconsidering the relationship. The author is asking if he's being logical or an asshole.\n\nHmm. The key here is whether his statements are factually accurate or if they're making assumptions that are problematic. Let's break it down.\n\nBiologically, while it's true that pregnancy and childbirth are female processes, the idea of maternal instincts and postpartum bonding being exclusive to mothers is more of a stereotype. While some women do experience these, they are not universal, and fathers can also form strong bonds with their children right from birth. Also, the concept of maternal instincts is often used to reinforce traditional gender roles, which might not account for the diversity in how families function.\n\nEconomically, the author points out that men are often the breadwinners. However, this is changing as more women enter the workforce and some men choose to be stay-at-home parents. Assuming that the woman should be the primary parent based on economic factors could be seen as reinforcing outdated gender norms. The author's argument seems to be based on societal norms rather than individual circumstances, which might not consider their specific situation or future choices.\n\nThe author's stance that an equal split isn't possible could also be dismissive of the girlfriend's perspective. If she's insisting on an equal split, maybe she's challenging traditional roles and wants a more egalitarian approach. By stating it's impossible, the author might not be acknowledging her values or the possibility of shared parenting arrangements that can work even with initial imbalances.\n\nMoreover, the author's conclusion that the current economic structure necessitates the mother being the primary parent could be seen as accepting the status quo without considering the potential for change or mutual adjustments in their partnership. It might also overlook the importance of mutual support and flexibility in a relationship when planning for parenthood.\n\nIn terms of communication, the author might have come across as dismissive or inflexible. If the girlfriend is upset because she feels her wishes aren't being respected, then the author's approach could be seen as not valuing her input. Even if his points have some basis in reality, the way he presented them might not have been considerate enough of her feelings and expectations.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might be trying to be realistic about the challenges of parenting. It's possible that he's concerned about being able to meet her expectations if he feels certain roles are biologically or economically determined. However, presenting it as an absolute truth without room for discussion or compromise could be problematic.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's arguments are based on assumptions that may not account for individual differences or the evolving nature of family roles. By not acknowledging the possibility of shared parenting and by not being open to his partner's perspective, he might be contributing to the conflict. Therefore, he could be in the wrong for not validating her stance and for reinforcing traditional gender roles rather than collaborating on a solution that works for both of them.\n"
