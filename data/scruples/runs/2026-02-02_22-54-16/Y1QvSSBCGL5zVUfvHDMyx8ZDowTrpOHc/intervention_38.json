I think she's not understanding what I'm saying or is naive about parenthood.\n\nI told her that there's no way when we have children that we will be able to split the load completely evenly. There are biological components to motherhood that come into play, like maternal instincts and post partum bonding and such, that require the mother to spend more time with the child immediately after birth. Additionally, because of this, it is often more likely feasible for the mother to stay home or at least be the primary parent for the child, in addition to economic factors that usually result in the man being the breadwinner and the woman being the primary parent. Thus, odds are, she will be the primary parent for our children for a variety of reasons, and there is no way we will be able to have a completely equal split. \n\nShe told me she will not have a child with a man who does not agree to split the work evenly, while I am arguing that it is not possible, particularly right after birth but also down the line.

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let's start by breaking down the situation. The author is in a relationship and had a discussion with his girlfriend about future parenthood. He's saying that fatherhood and motherhood are fundamentally different, especially in terms of how responsibilities and time split might work. His main points are about the biological aspects, like maternal instincts, postpartum bonding, and the economic factors that often lead to the mother being the primary caregiver.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction is that she won't have a child with someone who doesn't agree to an equal split. The author is arguing that it's not feasible to split things evenly, especially right after birth, and maybe even later. She's now reconsidering the relationship, and he's asking if he's the asshole or being logical.\n\nFirst, I should consider the arguments both sides are making. The author is making a logical case based on biological and societal factors. He's not saying he doesn't want to be involved, but he's stating that there's a natural tendency for the mother to take on more, which I guess is a traditional view. However, the girlfriend is asserting her expectation of equality, which is a valid stance in modern relationships where equality is often a priority.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's think about the possible angles. If the author is basing his argument on outdated or sexist stereotypes, that could be problematic. For example, saying that mothers have maternal instincts and thus will naturally spend more time with the child might reinforce the idea that women are inherently better caregivers, which can be seen as discriminatory. It might also ignore the possibility of shared parenting or the father's role in bonding with the child.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is pointing out practical realities: postpartum bonding is often a real biological process, and societal structures do often have the mother as the primary caregiver due to workplace policies, societal expectations, etc. So there's some truth to his statements. However, his conclusion that an equal split is impossible might be part of the issue. The girlfriend is looking for partnership and equality, and his stance might seem dismissive of her desire for shared responsibility.\n\nAnother angle is communication. The author might not be approaching the conversation in a way that's collaborative. If he's stating that the split isn't possible, he's not leaving room for negotiation or finding a middle ground. The girlfriend's stance is clear: she wants equality. If the author can't meet her halfway or at least show openness to working towards equality despite the challenges, that could be problematic.\n\nAlso, the idea that there are \"fundamentally\" different roles might be part of the problem. Modern relationships often value partnership where both parents share responsibilities, even if not perfectly 50/50. The author's position might come across as rigid, not allowing for flexibility or growth in how they approach parenthood together.\n\nIn terms of whether this makes him the asshole, it's a bit of a judgment call. If his statements are based on facts but presented in a way that dismisses her wishes, that's a problem. If he's being realistic but not considering her needs, that's an issue. The key here is whether he respects her autonomy and her right to set boundaries. If she's clear that equality is non-negotiable for her, and he's not willing to meet that, then he might be in the wrong because he's not respecting her dealbreaker.\n\nBut if he's genuinely trying to be logical about practical challenges and she's being inflexible, maybe she's the one being unreasonable. However, the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The fact that the girlfriend is reconsidering the relationship because of this suggests that the author's stance is a major dealbreaker for her. If he can't or won't compromise on this, he might be holding outdated views that conflict with her values, which could make him at fault.\n\nSo, putting it all together: the author's arguments have some factual basis, but presenting them as absolute and not being open to shared parenting models might be the issue. The girlfriend has a valid right to expect equality in the partnership. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong because he's not engaging with her perspective and is enforcing traditional roles that she finds unacceptable.\n"
