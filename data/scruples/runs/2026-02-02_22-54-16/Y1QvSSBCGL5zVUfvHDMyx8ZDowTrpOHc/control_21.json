I think she's not understanding what I'm saying or is naive about parenthood.\n\nI told her that there's no way when we have children that we will be able to split the load completely evenly. There are biological components to motherhood that come into play, like maternal instincts and post partum bonding and such, that require the mother to spend more time with the child immediately after birth. Additionally, because of this, it is often more likely feasible for the mother to stay home or at least be the primary parent for the child, in addition to economic factors that usually result in the man being the breadwinner and the woman being the primary parent. Thus, odds are, she will be the primary parent for our children for a variety of reasons, and there is no way we will be able to have a completely equal split. \n\nShe told me she will not have a child with a man who does not agree to split the work evenly, while I am arguing that it is not possible, particularly right after birth but also down the line. She is reconsidering our relationship now and I need to know if I'm being the asshole or being logical.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person is in the wrong for saying that fatherhood and motherhood are fundamentally different. The situation is about a disagreement with their girlfriend about splitting parenting responsibilities.\n\nFirst, the author argues that it's not possible to split the load evenly because of biological factors like maternal instincts and postpartum bonding, plus economic factors where the man is the breadwinner. The girlfriend wants an equal split and is reconsidering the relationship.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about gender roles and whether the author's statements are based on stereotypes or actual facts. The author mentions biological components, but I know that a lot of what's considered \"biological\" is actually socialized expectations. For example, maternal instincts might be more about societal conditioning rather than biology. Also, the idea that men are the primary breadwinners is a traditional role that's changing as more women enter the workforce and men take on more parenting roles.\n\nThe author's argument might be reinforcing traditional gender roles, which could be problematic. Even if there are some biological differences (like pregnancy and childbirth), the assumption that mothers must spend more time with the child is a choice that can be influenced by societal norms. The author is also assuming that the economic factors will lead to the man being the breadwinner, which isn't always the case in modern relationships.\n\nThe girlfriend's stance is about equality, which is a valid perspective. By stating that an equal split isn't possible, the author might be dismissing her values and expectations for an equitable partnership. Even if the author's points have some basis, the way it's presented could be seen as rigid and not open to alternative arrangements. The author might be in the wrong if they're not considering that both partners can negotiate roles based on their circumstances rather than defaulting to traditional roles.\n\nSo, considering that the author is reinforcing stereotypes and not being flexible about shared responsibilities, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong). However, if the author is just stating their perspective without being judgmental, maybe not. But given the girlfriend's reaction and the fact that the author is dismissing her desire for equality, A seems more likely.\n"
