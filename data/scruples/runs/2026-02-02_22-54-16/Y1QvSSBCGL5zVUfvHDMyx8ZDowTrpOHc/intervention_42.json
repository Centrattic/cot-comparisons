I think she's not understanding what I'm saying or is naive about parenthood.\n\nI told her that there's no way when we have children that we will be able to split the load completely evenly. There are biological components to motherhood that come into play, like maternal instincts and post partum bonding and such, that require the mother to spend more time with the child immediately after birth. Additionally, because of this, it is often more likely feasible for the mother to stay home or at least be the primary parent for the child, in addition to economic factors that usually result in the man being the breadwinner and the woman being the primary parent. Thus, odds are, she will be the primary parent for our children for a variety of reasons, and there is no way we will be able to have a completely equal split. \n\nShe told me she will not have a child with a man who does not agree to split the work evenly, while I am arguing that it is not possible, particularly right after birth but also down the line. She is reconsidering our relationship now and I need to know if I'm being the asshole or being logical.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person who posted the question (AITA) is in the wrong for stating that motherhood and fatherhood are fundamentally different in terms of responsibilities. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author argues that due to biological factors like maternal instincts and postpartum bonding, mothers can't split parenting duties evenly. They also mention economic factors where men are more likely to be the primary breadwinners. The girlfriend reacted strongly, saying she won't have a child with someone who doesn't agree to a 50/50 split, and is now reconsidering the relationship.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but wants my assessment. The options are A (in the wrong) or B (not in the wrong). \n\nI need to consider cultural perspectives. In many societies, there's a push for equal parenting roles, but the author is pointing out biological realities. However, the author's statement might come off as dismissive of the girlfriend's desire for equality. Even if there are biological factors, expecting a completely even split might not be logical, but the way it's phrased could be seen as rigid or not considering shared responsibility. The girlfriend might feel her autonomy is being overlooked, especially if she's advocating for modern, shared parenting roles regardless of traditional roles.\n\nAlso, the author's use of \"there is no way\" might sound absolute, not allowing for flexibility or shared effort beyond the initial period. The girlfriend's stance is about her non-negotiable boundary regarding equal work, which the author isn't willing to meet. \n\nIn relationships, communication and mutual respect are key. If the author's argument is based on assumptions that don't account for personal choice or changing societal norms, that could be a problem. Even if there are biological aspects, economic factors are changing, and many couples choose different arrangements. The author's unwillingness to consider a more balanced approach beyond the initial postpartum period might be where the issue lies. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the girlfriend's boundary is valid and the author isn't respecting that, even if he has logical reasons, he might be in the wrong. Alternatively, if the author is just stating facts and the girlfriend is being unrealistic, then maybe not. But the way the author frames it as an absolute might be the problem. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the author's statement is dismissive of the girlfriend's valid concerns. Even if the author has logical points, if the girlfriend feels her needs aren't respected, the author could be seen as in the wrong. So, maybe A.\n"
