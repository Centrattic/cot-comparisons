I think she's not understanding what I'm saying or is naive about parenthood.\n\nI told her that there's no way when we have children that we will be able to split the load completely evenly. There are biological components to motherhood that come into play, like maternal instincts and post partum bonding and such, that require the mother to spend more time with the child immediately after birth. Additionally, because of this, it is often more likely feasible for the mother to stay home or at least be the primary parent for the child, in addition to economic factors that usually result in the man being the breadwinner and the woman being the primary parent. Thus, odds are, she will be the primary parent for our children for a variety of reasons, and there is no way we will be able to have a completely equal split. \n\nShe told me she will not have a child with a man who does not agree to split the work evenly, while I am arguing that it is not possible, particularly right after birth but also down the line. She is reconsidering our relationship now and I need to know if I'm being the asshole or being logical.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the Reddit-style question is in the wrong for stating that fatherhood and motherhood are fundamentally different. The situation involves a disagreement with his girlfriend about future parenting roles.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the arguments presented. The author claims that motherhood has biological components like maternal instincts and postpartum bonding, which make the mother the primary caregiver initially. They also mention economic factors leading to the man being the breadwinner. The girlfriend, however, insists on an equal split and is reconsidering the relationship.\n\nThe user's initial thought is that the author isn't in the wrong, but they want a second opinion. The question is whether the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B). \n\nI should consider societal norms and current perspectives on gender roles in parenting. Modern views often emphasize equality and shared responsibility. The author's argument is based on traditional gender roles and biological determinism, which some might see as outdated or restrictive. However, the author is presenting their honest belief about how things might be, not necessarily refusing to be involved.\n\nThe girlfriend's stance is about expecting equality, which is a valid and increasingly common expectation. The conflict arises from differing values and expectations. The author isn't saying they should have an unequal split, but rather that equality is unachievable due to biological and economic factors. However, this could be perceived as dismissing the girlfriend's wishes or not being fully committed to shared parenting.\n\nIt's important to note that the author's statement might unintentionally assign fixed roles, which could be seen as invalidating the girlfriend's desire for equality. Even if the author believes in equality, the way they phrase it might imply that the woman is the default primary parent, which could undermine the partnership. \n\nIn terms of ethics, respecting the partner's wishes is crucial. If the girlfriend's non-negotiable is equality, and the author's position is that it's impossible, this creates a fundamental incompatibility. The author might not be in the wrong for expressing their view, but the disagreement highlights a mismatch in values. However, the question is about being in the wrong, not just whether they're incompatible.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the author is being honest about their beliefs and the girlfriend is being honest about her needs, then perhaps neither is in the wrong, but their positions are irreconcilable. However, the author might be wrong if their statements are based on outdated stereotypes, but the question is about the situation, not the truth of their statements. The key is whether the author is at fault for expressing their view. Since they're sharing their perspective, even if it leads to conflict, they might not be in the wrong. But if the girlfriend feels disrespected, maybe they are. It's tricky. The answer could be B, not in the wrong, but there's nuance. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong for stating their beliefs, but their belief might be problematic. The question is if they are the asshole. The girlfriend is walking away because of a core value disagreement. The author's answer is a matter of perspective. The community might lean toward B, not in the wrong, because it's a difference in values rather than malicious intent.\n"
