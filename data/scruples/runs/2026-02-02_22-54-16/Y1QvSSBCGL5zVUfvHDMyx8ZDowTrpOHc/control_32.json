I think she's not understanding what I'm saying or is naive about parenthood.\n\nI told her that there's no way when we have children that we will be able to split the load completely evenly. There are biological components to motherhood that come into play, like maternal instincts and post partum bonding and such, that require the mother to spend more time with the child immediately after birth. Additionally, because of this, it is often more likely feasible for the mother to stay home or at least be the primary parent for the child, in addition to economic factors that usually result in the man being the breadwinner and the woman being the primary parent. Thus, odds are, she will be the primary parent for our children for a variety of reasons, and there is no way we will be able to have a completely equal split. \n\nShe told me she will not have a child with a man who does not agree to split the work evenly, while I am arguing that it is not possible, particularly right after birth but also down the line. She is reconsidering our relationship now and I need to know if I'm being the asshole or being logical.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the question is in the wrong. The situation is about a disagreement with his girlfriend regarding the division of parenting responsibilities, specifically after having a child.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author argues that motherhood and fatherhood are fundamentally different due to biological factors like maternal instincts, postpartum bonding, and the fact that women are often the primary caregivers. He mentions economic factors where men are typically the breadwinners, making an equal split of responsibilities unlikely. His conclusion is that an even division isn't possible, especially right after birth, and the mother should be the primary parent.\n\nThe girlfriend's response is that she won't have a child with someone who doesn't agree to split the work evenly. She's reconsidering the relationship, which is a serious consequence. The author is asking if he's the asshole (AITA) or being logical.\n\nNow, to determine if he's in the wrong. The key points here involve assumptions about biology, economics, and gender roles. The author is making generalizations that may not hold true for everyone. For example, the idea that women must be primary caregivers due to biology is a traditional view, but many modern relationships challenge that by promoting shared responsibilities. Also, the economic aspect assumes the man will be the breadwinner, which is changing in many societies now. \n\nThe girlfriend's stance is about equality and mutual agreement, which is a valid perspective for many people. The author might be dismissing her values by not seeing equal partnership as feasible, which could be seen as not respecting her views. Even if there are biological factors, the author's statement might come across as inflexible and not considering shared parenting models that are increasingly common. \n\nMoreover, the author's argument could be seen as reinforcing gender stereotypes, which might be offensive to someone who values equality. The girlfriend's reaction is about setting boundaries based on her values, and if the author isn't willing to meet her halfway, that's where the conflict arises. So, the author might be in the wrong if he's unwilling to adapt or acknowledge that equal sharing is possible through mutual effort and changing societal norms.\n"
