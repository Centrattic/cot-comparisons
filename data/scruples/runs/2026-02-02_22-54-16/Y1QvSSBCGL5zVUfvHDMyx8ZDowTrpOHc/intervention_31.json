I think she's not understanding what I'm saying or is naive about parenthood.\n\nI told her that there's no way when we have children that we will be able to split the load completely evenly. There are biological components to motherhood that come into play, like maternal instincts and post partum bonding and such, that require the mother to spend more time with the child immediately after birth. Additionally, because of this, it is often more likely feasible for the mother to stay home or at least be the primary parent for the child, in addition to economic factors that usually result in the man being the breadwinner and the woman being the primary parent. Thus, odds are, she will be the primary parent for our children for a variety of reasons, and there is no way we will be able to have a completely equal split. \n\nShe told me she will not have a child with a man who does not agree to split the work evenly, while I am arguing that it is not possible, particularly right after birth but also down the line. She is reconsidering our relationship now and I need to know if I'm being the asshole or being logical.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling his girlfriend that fatherhood and motherhood are fundamentally different. The author's main points are about the biological differences like maternal instincts, postpartum bonding, and economic factors leading the mother to be the primary parent. The girlfriend is upset because she expects an equal split, and now she's reconsidering the relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the validity of the author's arguments. He mentions biological factors, which are real\u2014mothers do go through pregnancy, childbirth, and have postpartum bonding. There's also the societal norm where men are often the primary breadwinners, though this is changing. But is it accurate to say that an equal split is impossible? While there are challenges, many couples do aim for 50/50, and some achieve it. The author might be generalizing or not accounting for the possibility of shared responsibilities beyond just the initial stages.\n\nThe girlfriend's stance is clear: she wants equality. The author's response could be seen as dismissive of her expectations. Even if his points have some truth, the way he presents them might come across as rigid or not considering mutual effort. Relationships require compromise, and the author might be not leaving room for negotiation or adaptation as a couple.\n\nAlso, the author's assertion that it's impossible to split the load evenly might overlook the importance of intent. Even if the split isn't exactly 50/50, both partners can contribute meaningfully. The girlfriend's refusal to accept anything less than equal could be a deal-breaker for her, which is her right.\n\nSo, while the author's points have some factual basis, framing the discussion in a way that seems inflexible might be the issue. The key here is how the communication is handled. If the author is not open to discussing how they can work together towards equality despite challenges, that could be problematic. The girlfriend's reaction, while strong, is a response to feeling unheard or not valued in the partnership.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's logic isn't entirely wrong, but his approach might lack the empathy and willingness to find a middle ground that the girlfriend needs. Therefore, he could be seen as in the wrong for not being flexible in the discussion.\n"
