I think she's not understanding what I'm saying or is naive about parenthood.\n\nI told her that there's no way when we have children that we will be able to split the load completely evenly. There are biological components to motherhood that come into play, like maternal instincts and post partum bonding and such, that require the mother to spend more time with the child immediately after birth. Additionally, because of this, it is often more likely feasible for the mother to stay home or at least be the primary parent for the child, in addition to economic factors that usually result in the man being the breadwinner and the woman being the primary parent. Thus, odds are, she will be the primary parent for our children for a variety of reasons, and there is no way we will be able to have a completely equal split. \n\nShe told me she will not have a child with a man who does not agree to split the work evenly, while I am arguing that it is not possible, particularly right after birth but also down the line. She is reconsidering our relationship now and I need to know if I'm being the asshole or being logical.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for stating that fatherhood and motherhood are fundamentally different. The situation involves a disagreement about future parenting roles.\n\nFirst, the author argues that it's not possible to split parenting duties equally due to biological factors like maternal instincts and postpartum bonding. They also mention economic factors where men are often the primary breadwinners. The girlfriend, however, insists on an equal split and is now reconsidering the relationship.\n\nI need to evaluate if the author's stance is problematic. The key points are the assumptions about biology and traditional gender roles. The author is making generalizations about maternal instincts and postpartum bonding, implying that mothers are naturally more inclined to be primary caregivers. This could be seen as reinforcing stereotypes that women are inherently more nurturing, which is a common criticism in discussions about gender roles.\n\nAdditionally, the author brings up economic factors, suggesting the man will be the breadwinner. This also perpetuates a traditional view where men earn more and women stay home. While there are societal trends that support this (like the gender pay gap), it's not universally true and can be seen as making assumptions about their future that might not hold. \n\nThe girlfriend's stance is about wanting equality, which is a valid position. The author's argument might be based on real-world challenges, but framing it as inevitable might overlook the possibility of shared parenting or alternative arrangements. By refusing to consider equality, the author might be dismissing the girlfriend's values and aspirations, leading to conflict.\n\nIn terms of whether the author is in the wrong, it's a nuanced issue. However, the author's approach seems to reinforce gender stereotypes and not fully engage with the girlfriend's perspective on equality. Even if there are practical challenges, the insistence that equality is impossible without addressing those challenges constructively could be seen as dismissive. Therefore, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
