I think she's not understanding what I'm saying or is naive about parenthood.\n\nI told her that there's no way when we have children that we will be able to split the load completely evenly. There are biological components to motherhood that come into play, like maternal instincts and post partum bonding and such, that require the mother to spend more time with the child immediately after birth. Additionally, because of this, it is often more likely feasible for the mother to stay home or at least be the primary parent for the child, in addition to economic factors that usually result in the man being the breadwinner and the woman being the primary parent. Thus, odds are, she will be the primary parent for our children for a variety of reasons, and there is no way we will be able to have a completely equal split. \n\nShe told me she will not have a child with a man who does not agree to split the work evenly, while I am arguing that it is not possible, particularly right after birth but also down the line. She is reconsidering our relationship now and I need to know if I'm being the asshole or being logical.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for stating that fatherhood and motherhood are fundamentally different. The situation is about a disagreement with his girlfriend regarding the division of parental responsibilities.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the arguments presented by both sides. The author argues that there are biological factors that make motherhood different, like maternal instincts and postpartum bonding, leading to the mother needing to spend more time with the child immediately after birth. He also mentions economic factors where men are often the primary breadwinners and women the primary caregivers. Based on that, he concludes that an equal split isn't feasible.\n\nThe girlfriend, on the other hand, refuses to have children with someone who doesn't agree to an equal split. She's taking a stance that equality is possible and necessary. The author is now questioning if he's being logical or an asshole.\n\nSo, the key points here are about the feasibility of equal division in parenting responsibilities. The author is asserting that due to biological and economic reasons, equality isn't possible. The girlfriend is holding a different view, believing equality is achievable and necessary.\n\nI should think about whether the author's statements are factually accurate or if they're making assumptions. For example, is it true that maternal instincts are biological and require more time? There's some research that suggests bonding can be important early on, but it's also possible for fathers to bond, and societal roles are changing. The economic argument about men being the primary breadwinners is a generalization that might not hold true anymore, especially with more women in the workforce.\n\nAdditionally, the author's statement that an equal split is not possible might be based on outdated or biased views. The idea that women should be primary caregivers is a traditional role that's being challenged. The author's stance could be seen as reinforcing gender stereotypes, which might be problematic. His girlfriend is advocating for equality, which is a valid perspective in modern relationships.\n\nThe author is also dismissing his girlfriend's viewpoint as her not understanding or being naive. That could come off as condescending. The question is whether his reasoning is valid or if he's making assumptions that aren't supported by current societal trends or research.\n\nIn terms of the relationship conflict, the girlfriend is setting a boundary based on her values. If the author's position is that equality isn't possible regardless of willingness, but she insists on equality, their values conflict. Whether the author is in the wrong might depend on whether his arguments are based on facts or stereotypes.\n\nSo, considering the possible biases in the author's arguments and the fact that he's dismissing his girlfriend's perspective as naive, it could be that he's in the wrong. However, if equality is indeed not feasible, maybe he's not. But the assumption that biology dictates roles strictly might be incorrect. The author's stance could be seen as not respecting his partner's wishes and reinforcing traditional gender roles, which would make him the asshole.\n"
