I think she's not understanding what I'm saying or is naive about parenthood.\n\nI told her that there's no way when we have children that we will be able to split the load completely evenly. There are biological components to motherhood that come into play, like maternal instincts and post partum bonding and such, that require the mother to spend more time with the child immediately after birth. Additionally, because of this, it is often more likely feasible for the mother to stay home or at least be the primary parent for the child, in addition to economic factors that usually result in the man being the breadwinner and the woman being the primary parent. Thus, odds are, she will be the primary parent for our children for a variety of reasons, and there is no way we will be able to have a completely equal split. \n\nShe told me she will not have a child with a man who does not agree to split the work evenly, while I am arguing that it is not possible, particularly right after birth but also down the line. She is reconsidering our relationship now and I need to know if I'm being the asshole or being logical.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is between a guy and his girlfriend discussing future parenting roles. The guy says that motherhood and fatherhood are fundamentally different, especially in terms of the biological aspects like maternal instincts, postpartum bonding, and the likelihood of the mother being the primary caregiver. He argues that a completely equal split isn't possible. The girlfriend is upset, saying she won't have a child with someone who doesn't agree to an even split, and she's rethinking their future.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the arguments from both sides. The guy is pointing out biological differences. He's not saying the mother should do all the work, but that there are factors (like biology and societal norms) that might make the split unequal. The girlfriend, on the other hand, wants an equal split and is taking offense to the idea that it's not possible.\n\nNow, is the guy in the wrong? Well, he's making a factual claim about biological differences. That part is true\u2014there are physiological differences between giving birth and postpartum bonding. However, the way he's presenting this might come off as dismissive of the girlfriend's desire for equality. He mentions economic factors where the man is the breadwinner, which might reinforce traditional gender roles. Even if those economic factors are common, they're not set in stone, and expecting a primary parent role based on gender could be seen as outdated or sexist.\n\nAlso, the girlfriend's stance is that she wants an equal split, which reflects a modern view of shared parenting. By insisting that equality isn't possible, the guy might be undermining her expectations. He could be perceived as not being open to non-traditional arrangements, which might be why she's reconsidering the relationship.\n\nAnother angle: the guy is stating his view as a logical conclusion based on factors, but the girlfriend is taking it as a refusal to share responsibilities equally. The problem might be in how he's framing it. Even if he's correct about certain biological aspects, he's not accounting for the fact that societal norms and mutual agreement between partners can influence parenting roles. He might be oversimplifying the situation by assuming the mother must be the primary parent, without discussing alternative scenarios.\n\nIs there a middle ground? Maybe acknowledging the biological aspects but emphasizing the importance of working together to find a fair split that works for their family, even if it's not 50-50. But the girlfriend wants an equal split regardless, which the guy is saying isn't feasible. So there's a conflict in expectations.\n\nIn terms of whether he's in the wrong, it's possible he's being logical but not empathetic. He's focusing on the biological and economic factors without considering her perspective that equality is possible or necessary. The key here is communication. If he's not open to negotiation or sees his stance as non-negotiable, that could be the issue. The girlfriend's reaction is significant\u2014she's considering ending the relationship, which shows how important this issue is to her.\n\nSo, putting it all together: the author's statement might be factually correct in some aspects, but by not acknowledging the possibility of shared parenting and the importance of mutual agreement, he's not being supportive of his partner's views. This could be seen as being in the wrong because he's not respecting her desire for equality, even if his reasoning has some basis in reality.\n"
