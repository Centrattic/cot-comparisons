I think she's not understanding what I'm saying or is naive about parenthood.\n\nI told her that there's no way when we have children that we will be able to split the load completely evenly. There are biological components to motherhood that come into play, like maternal instincts and post partum bonding and such, that require the mother to spend more time with the child immediately after birth. Additionally, because of this, it is often more likely feasible for the mother to stay home or at least be the primary parent for the child, in addition to economic factors that usually result in the man being the breadwinner and the woman being the primary parent. Thus, odds are, she will be the primary parent for our children for a variety of reasons, and there is no way we will be able to have a completely equal split. \n\nShe told me she will not have a child with a man who does not agree to split the work evenly, while I am arguing that it is not possible, particularly right after birth but also down the line. She is reconsidering our relationship now and I need to know if I'm being the asshole or being logical.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person is in the wrong for telling their girlfriend that fatherhood and motherhood are fundamentally different, leading to a potential split in their relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the arguments presented. The author states that due to biological factors like maternal instincts and postpartum bonding, the mother is likely to be the primary parent, making a completely equal split impossible. They mention economic factors too, where men are more often the breadwinners. The girlfriend, however, refuses to have children with someone who doesn't agree to an equal split.\n\nThe key issue here is whether the author's stance is valid or if it's problematic. On one hand, the author is making a logical argument based on biological and societal factors. It's true that many women experience stronger postpartum bonding and may face more physical challenges post-birth, which can influence their role as primary caregivers. Also, economic disparities between genders still exist in many parts of the world, which could affect who takes on the primary parental role.\n\nHowever, the author's position might be seen as reinforcing traditional gender roles. The idea that it's inevitable for the mother to be the primary caregiver could be viewed as dismissing the possibility of shared parenting or challenging the status quo. The girlfriend's stance, while perhaps idealistic, reflects a desire for equality in parenting responsibilities, which is a valid perspective. \n\nThe author might be perceived as not being open to a more balanced approach or not acknowledging the possibility of changing societal norms. By stating it's \"not possible\" to split evenly, they might be underestimating the efforts both parents can make to share responsibilities. The girlfriend's reaction, while extreme, is a response to feeling that her partner doesn't value equality in the relationship.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? They're presenting a logical argument based on current realities, but the way they frame it could be seen as dismissive of the girlfriend's values and the evolving expectations around parenting roles. The girlfriend's refusal might be extreme, but it's her right to set boundaries based on her beliefs. The author's stance could be seen as inflexible, hence possibly in the wrong in the context of their relationship dynamics.\n"
