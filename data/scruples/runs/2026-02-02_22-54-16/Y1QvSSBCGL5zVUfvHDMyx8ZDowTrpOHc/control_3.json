I think she's not understanding what I'm saying or is naive about parenthood.\n\nI told her that there's no way when we have children that we will be able to split the load completely evenly. There are biological components to motherhood that come into play, like maternal instincts and post partum bonding and such, that require the mother to spend more time with the child immediately after birth. Additionally, because of this, it is often more likely feasible for the mother to stay home or at least be the primary parent for the child, in addition to economic factors that usually result in the man being the breadwinner and the woman being the primary parent. Thus, odds are, she will be the primary parent for our children for a variety of reasons, and there is no way we will be able to have a completely equal split. \n\nShe told me she will not have a child with a man who does not agree to split the work evenly, while I am arguing that it is not possible, particularly right after birth but also down the line. She is reconsidering our relationship now and I need to know if I'm being the asshole or being logical.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling his girlfriend that fatherhood and motherhood are fundamentally different. The situation is about their future plans and the girlfriend is reconsidering the relationship because of it.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the arguments presented. The author says that they can't split parenting duties evenly, especially right after birth, due to biological factors like maternal instincts and postpartum bonding. He also mentions economic factors where the man is the breadwinner and the woman is the primary parent. So he's making two main points: biology and economics.\n\nNow, is he in the wrong? Well, the question is about whether his statements are justifying unequal distribution. The key here is that the author is making assumptions based on traditional gender roles. He's implying that the mother should naturally be the primary parent because of biology, which is a common but controversial stance. \n\nSociety is moving towards more equality in parenting, and many people argue that both parents should share responsibilities equally, regardless of biology. By stating that a completely equal split isn't possible, especially in the early stages, he might be dismissing the possibility of shared parenting. The girlfriend is looking for a partner who's open to equal sharing, which is a reasonable expectation in many modern relationships.\n\nThe author's point about postpartum bonding is valid\u2014biologically, women do have a more direct role during childbirth and breastfeeding. However, he's using this as a reason to assume the mother must be the primary caregiver, which can be seen as reductive. It's possible to acknowledge biological differences while still committing to shared responsibilities. Also, the economic argument is a stereotype that may not apply to all couples. Many women are primary breadwinners, and some men choose to be stay-at-home parents.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction is about her expectations and values. If she wants a partner who is willing to commit to an equal split of work, and the author is not supportive of that, then their fundamental values about parenting and equality are conflicting. The author might be unaware that his stance could be perceived as suggesting the mother should take on more, which could be a deal-breaker for her.\n\nSo, the answer depends on whether the author is wrong for assuming that equality isn't possible. If the girlfriend wants equality and the author is rigid in his belief that it can't happen, then he might be in the wrong. But if he's just stating realistic challenges, maybe not. However, the way he frames it as \"fundamentally different\" and \"no way\" to split evenly could come off as dismissive of her desire for equality. The author isn't wrong to point out biological aspects, but his conclusion that the split can't be equal may be the issue. He should consider flexibility and modern approaches where both parents can share roles based on mutual agreement, not just traditional reasons.\n"
