I think she's not understanding what I'm saying or is naive about parenthood.\n\nI told her that there's no way when we have children that we will be able to split the load completely evenly. There are biological components to motherhood that come into play, like maternal instincts and post partum bonding and such, that require the mother to spend more time with the child immediately after birth. Additionally, because of this, it is often more likely feasible for the mother to stay home or at least be the primary parent for the child, in addition to economic factors that usually result in the man being the breadwinner and the woman being the primary parent. Thus, odds are, she will be the primary parent for our children for a variety of reasons, and there is no way we will be able to have a completely equal split. \n\nShe told me she will not have a child with a man who does not agree to split the work evenly, while I am arguing that it is not possible, particularly right after birth but also down the line. She is reconsidering our relationship now and I need to know if I'm being the asshole or being logical.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe user is a guy who told his girlfriend that fatherhood and motherhood are fundamentally different. He argues that it's not possible to split parenting responsibilities equally because of biological factors like maternal instincts, postpartum bonding, and economic factors where men are more likely to be the breadwinner. His girlfriend, on the other hand, says she won't have a child with someone who doesn't agree to split the work evenly. Now she's reconsidering the relationship, and he's asking if he's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the validity of his arguments. He mentions biological differences like maternal instincts. But I know that while there are some biological factors, like the mother's body producing milk for breastfeeding, the roles of fathers and mothers are increasingly seen as more flexible and not strictly determined by biology. Also, postpartum bonding is important for both parents, not just the mother. Plus, the idea that men are the primary breadwinners is a traditional view that doesn't hold in many modern families where women are also the primary earners or both parents work.\n\nHe assumes that the mother should be the primary parent due to these factors, but this might not consider the couple's specific circumstances. For example, maybe they both want to work, or maybe they have different career goals. Also, equal parenting is possible with conscious effort and communication. The idea that a completely even split isn't feasible might be a generalization. Many couples do manage to split parenting duties more equally, depending on their situation.\n\nHis girlfriend's stance is that she won't have kids unless he agrees to split the work evenly. That's a strong statement, but it's her choice regarding her own life and what she's comfortable with. The author's response could be seen as dismissive of her perspective and not acknowledging that roles can be shared or that societal roles are changing. By saying it's not possible, he might be reinforcing traditional gender roles rather than being open to negotiation.\n\nHe says he's being logical, but logic here might be based on outdated assumptions. The key point is that while there are biological factors, they don't have to dictate the division of labor in parenting. Couples can make choices based on their own preferences and circumstances. The author's refusal to consider equal sharing might stem from a rigid view of gender roles, which could be why his girlfriend is upset. She's valuing equality and partnership, which are important in modern relationships. \n\nTherefore, the author's stance is problematic because it doesn't allow for flexibility or mutual decision-making. Even if some factors are biological, the couple can choose how to approach parenting. His argument dismisses her desire for equality, which is a valid concern. So, in this context, he might be the one in the wrong because he's not being open to a partnership where roles can be negotiated and shared, despite biological factors. He's making assumptions based on traditional roles rather than considering their unique situation or his partner's values.\n"
