I think she's not understanding what I'm saying or is naive about parenthood.\n\nI told her that there's no way when we have children that we will be able to split the load completely evenly. There are biological components to motherhood that come into play, like maternal instincts and post partum bonding and such, that require the mother to spend more time with the child immediately after birth. Additionally, because of this, it is often more likely feasible for the mother to stay home or at least be the primary parent for the child, in addition to economic factors that usually result in the man being the breadwinner and the woman being the primary parent. Thus, odds are, she will be the primary parent for our children for a variety of reasons, and there is no way we will be able to have a completely equal split. \n\nShe told me she will not have a child with a man who does not agree to split the work evenly, while I am arguing that it is not possible, particularly right after birth but also down the line. She is reconsidering our relationship now and I need to know if I'm being the asshole or being logical.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for saying that fatherhood and motherhood are fundamentally different when planning for parenthood with his girlfriend. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the core of the argument. The author is arguing that due to biological factors like maternal instincts and postpartum bonding, the mother will naturally spend more time with the child right after birth. He also mentions economic factors where the man is typically the breadwinner, making it feasible for the mother to be the primary parent. He's saying an equal split isn't possible.\n\nThe girlfriend's response is that she won't have a child with someone who doesn't agree to split the work evenly. She's now reconsidering the relationship. The author is wondering if he's the asshole or being logical.\n\nNow, considering societal norms and modern views on parenting. There's a shift towards shared parenting and challenging traditional gender roles. The idea that one parent must take the lead based on gender might be seen as outdated. However, the author is pointing out biological realities, which some might argue are valid. But others might see this as essentializing roles and not respecting the partner's expectations for equality.\n\nI need to assess if the author's statements are dismissive of his girlfriend's needs or values. If she wants an equal split and he's not willing to commit to that, it's a conflict in their values. Even if there are biological factors, the author's stance could be seen as not being open to negotiation or considering shared responsibilities in a more balanced way. \n\nAlso, the phrase \"there's no way we will be able to split the load completely evenly\" might come across as rigid. It's possible that while there might be initial differences, over time they could find a more equitable balance. The author might be underestimating the possibility of adapting and working together to share responsibilities, even if starting from different points.\n\nSo, the key here is whether the author is being inflexible in his stance, which could be seen as not respecting his partner's wishes. Even if he's stating his views based on biological factors, the girlfriend's perspective is about equality and shared responsibility. If the author is unwilling to consider a more equal approach beyond the immediate postpartum period, that could be where he's in the wrong.\n\nIn relationships, mutual respect and compromise are important. If the author is not willing to meet her halfway or discuss how they can work towards a more equal split despite initial challenges, then he might be the asshole. The girlfriend's reaction is about her not wanting to be in a situation where she's the primary parent by default, which could lead to inequality in the long run.\n\nTherefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because his stance on traditional roles doesn't align with his partner's desire for equality and could be seen as dismissive of her needs.\n"
