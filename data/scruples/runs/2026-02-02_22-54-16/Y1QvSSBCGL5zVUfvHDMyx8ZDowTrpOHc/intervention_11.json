I think she's not understanding what I'm saying or is naive about parenthood.\n\nI told her that there's no way when we have children that we will be able to split the load completely evenly. There are biological components to motherhood that come into play, like maternal instincts and post partum bonding and such, that require the mother to spend more time with the child immediately after birth. Additionally, because of this, it is often more likely feasible for the mother to stay home or at least be the primary parent for the child, in addition to economic factors that usually result in the man being the breadwinner and the woman being the primary parent. Thus, odds are, she will be the primary parent for our children for a variety of reasons, and there is no way we will be able to have a completely equal split. \n\nShe told me she will not have a child with a man who does not agree to split the work evenly, while I am arguing that it is not possible, particularly right after birth but also down the line. She is reconsidering our relationship now and I need to know if I'm being the asshole or being logical.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling his girlfriend that fatherhood and motherhood are fundamentally different. The situation is that he's explaining to her that they can't split parenting duties equally because of biological factors like maternal instincts and postpartum bonding, as well as economic factors where the man is more likely to be the breadwinner. She's upset and rethinking their future together.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is making a statement based on his beliefs about the inherent differences between motherhood and fatherhood. He's not necessarily saying women should stay home or that men shouldn't be involved, but that certain biological and societal factors make an equal split impossible. He's trying to set expectations for the future.\n\nOn the other hand, his girlfriend is insisting on an equal split, which is a valid perspective. She might be advocating for gender equality in parenting roles, which is a common stance in modern relationships. Her reaction is strong, but it's also important to consider why she feels that way. Maybe she's pushing against traditional gender roles that assign more responsibility to women in parenting.\n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong. The key points here are the assumptions he's making. He's stating that maternal instincts and postpartum bonding require more time from the mother, which is a common belief but not universally accepted. Some studies suggest that bonding can be equally strong regardless of gender, and that societal expectations might play a bigger role than biology. The economic factor he mentions is also a societal norm rather than a biological necessity.\n\nSo, by asserting that an equal split isn't possible because of these factors, he's reinforcing traditional gender roles. This could be seen as invalidating his girlfriend's desire for equality. Even if there are biological differences, the author's conclusion that an equal split isn't feasible might be based more on societal norms than on actual necessity. It's possible to have a more equal split with intentional effort, flexible work arrangements, and shared responsibilities, even if there are initial biological challenges.\n\nThe author's approach might come across as dismissive of her perspective, especially if he's not open to discussing how they can work towards equality despite those challenges. The girlfriend's stance is about wanting an equal partnership, and the author's response might not acknowledge that both of them can adapt and find a way to share responsibilities more equally, even if it's not 50/50 right from the start.\n\nIn terms of whether he's in the wrong, it's about perspective. If he's using biological arguments to justify unequal distribution of labor, that could be seen as contributing to gender inequality. However, if he's simply stating his belief without being inflexible and is open to discussion, it's more about differing values. The problem arises if he's unwilling to compromise or consider alternative viewpoints, which might be the case here since she's now rethinking the relationship.\n\nTherefore, the answer hinges on the interpretation of the argument. If the author is presenting his view as a fact without acknowledging the possibility of change or shared effort, he might be in the wrong. But if he's just expressing his belief and she's reacting strongly, it's a matter of differing expectations in the relationship. However, the way he's framing it as an absolute (that an equal split is impossible) without considering solutions could be problematic.\n"
