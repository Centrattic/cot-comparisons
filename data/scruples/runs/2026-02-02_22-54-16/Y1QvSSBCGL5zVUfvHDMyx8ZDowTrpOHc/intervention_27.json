I think she's not understanding what I'm saying or is naive about parenthood.\n\nI told her that there's no way when we have children that we will be able to split the load completely evenly. There are biological components to motherhood that come into play, like maternal instincts and post partum bonding and such, that require the mother to spend more time with the child immediately after birth. Additionally, because of this, it is often more likely feasible for the mother to stay home or at least be the primary parent for the child, in addition to economic factors that usually result in the man being the breadwinner and the woman being the primary parent. Thus, odds are, she will be the primary parent for our children for a variety of reasons, and there is no way we will be able to have a completely equal split. \n\nShe told me she will not have a child with a man who does not agree to split the work evenly, while I am arguing that it is not possible, particularly right after birth but also down the line. She is reconsidering our relationship now and I need to know if I'm being the asshole or being logical.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a disagreement with their girlfriend regarding the division of labor in parenting. The author argues that motherhood and fatherhood are fundamentally different due to biological and economic factors, making an equal split impossible. The girlfriend is upset and considering ending the relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the main points of the author's argument. They mention maternal instincts, postpartum bonding, and the likelihood of the mother being the primary caregiver due to biological and economic reasons. The girlfriend, on the other hand, insists on an equal split. \n\nNow, the key here is whether the author's statements are factually accurate or if they're perpetuating stereotypes. The author is making generalizations about the roles of mothers and fathers. For example, they state that mothers will naturally spend more time with the child immediately after birth and that the man is typically the breadwinner. But these are stereotypes that don't hold true for everyone. Society is changing, and many fathers are now primary caregivers, and women are primary breadwinners. Also, the idea that motherhood is inherently different and requires more time might be based on outdated notions rather than current realities or individual circumstances.\n\nAnother angle is the assumption of inevitability. The author says it's \"not possible\" to split the work evenly, which is a strong statement. But in reality, couples can choose different arrangements based on their preferences, capabilities, and agreements. The author's stance might be inflexible and not considering that both partners can negotiate roles that suit them, regardless of traditional gender roles.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction is about wanting equality. If she values equal contribution, the author's argument that equality isn't possible might clash with her values. The author might be dismissing her perspective without acknowledging that societal changes have made different arrangements feasible. Additionally, the author's statement could be seen as implying that the mother's role is fixed, which might undermine the girlfriend's autonomy in deciding her future as a parent.\n\nThere's also the aspect of communication. The author might not be presenting their concerns in a way that's collaborative. Instead of focusing on the impossibility of equality, maybe they should be discussing how they can support each other in whatever arrangement they choose. The rigid stance here could be seen as not being open to compromise or understanding her needs.\n\nConsidering all these points, the author's argument relies on stereotypes and assumptions that may not be universally true. By asserting that equality isn't possible, they might be invalidating the girlfriend's desire for an equitable partnership. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not acknowledging that roles can be flexible and that equality is achievable through mutual effort and understanding, regardless of traditional gender roles.\n"
