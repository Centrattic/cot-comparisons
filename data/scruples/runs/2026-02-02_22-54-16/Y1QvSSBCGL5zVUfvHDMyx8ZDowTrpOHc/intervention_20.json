I think she's not understanding what I'm saying or is naive about parenthood.\n\nI told her that there's no way when we have children that we will be able to split the load completely evenly. There are biological components to motherhood that come into play, like maternal instincts and post partum bonding and such, that require the mother to spend more time with the child immediately after birth. Additionally, because of this, it is often more likely feasible for the mother to stay home or at least be the primary parent for the child, in addition to economic factors that usually result in the man being the breadwinner and the woman being the primary parent. Thus, odds are, she will be the primary parent for our children for a variety of reasons, and there is no way we will be able to have a completely equal split. \n\nShe told me she will not have a child with a man who does not agree to split the work evenly, while I am arguing that it is not possible, particularly right after birth but also down the line. She is reconsidering our relationship now and I need to know if I'm being the asshole or being logical.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for stating that motherhood and fatherhood are fundamentally different, leading to an unequal split in parenting responsibilities.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's argument. He's pointing out biological factors like maternal instincts, postpartum bonding, and the physical aspects of childbirth. He also mentions economic factors where men are more likely to be the breadwinners. His main point is that an equal 50/50 split isn't feasible because of these reasons.\n\nOn the other side, the girlfriend refuses to have children with someone who doesn't agree to an equal split. She's taking a stance that equality is non-negotiable, even if it's considered unrealistic. The author feels she's being naive about the realities of parenthood.\n\nNow, I should evaluate both perspectives. The author is making a logical argument based on biological and societal factors. He's not saying he won't help; he's saying the split can't be equal. The girlfriend is holding a firm line on equality, which might be idealistic but is her personal boundary.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, he's not denying that both parents should contribute; he's just acknowledging that the split can't be even. However, his argument might be based on outdated or stereotypical views. For example, the assumption that men are the primary breadwinners and women the primary caregivers is more a product of traditional gender roles than an inherent truth. Also, the idea that maternal instincts are inherently stronger could be seen as perpetuating gender stereotypes.\n\nThe key point is whether the author is wrong for making that argument. If his stance is based on rigid gender roles and biological determinism, then yes, he might be out of touch with modern views on shared parenting and gender equality. The girlfriend is asserting her right to have a partner who is equally committed to parenting, which is a valid expectation in a modern, equal relationship.\n\nSo, considering that the author's reasoning could reinforce stereotypes and that the girlfriend's stance is about equality and mutual commitment, the author's position might be problematic. Therefore, the answer could be that he's in the wrong.\n"
