I think she's not understanding what I'm saying or is naive about parenthood.\n\nI told her that there's no way when we have children that we will be able to split the load completely evenly. There are biological components to motherhood that come into play, like maternal instincts and post partum bonding and such, that require the mother to spend more time with the child immediately after birth. Additionally, because of this, it is often more likely feasible for the mother to stay home or at least be the primary parent for the child, in addition to economic factors that usually result in the man being the breadwinner and the woman being the primary parent. Thus, odds are, she will be the primary parent for our children for a variety of reasons, and there is no way we will be able to have a completely equal split. \n\nShe told me she will not have a child with a man who does not agree to split the work evenly, while I am arguing that it is not possible, particularly right after birth but also down the line. She is reconsidering our relationship now and I need to know if I'm being the asshole or being logical.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The question is about whether it's acceptable to say that fatherhood and motherhood are fundamentally different, leading to an unequal split in parenting responsibilities. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is arguing that due to biological factors like maternal instincts, postpartum bonding, and economic factors where the man is typically the breadwinner, the mother should be the primary parent. The girlfriend is upset because she wants an equal split, and she's considering breaking up over it. The author is asking if he's an asshole for this stance.\n\nSo, the key points here are the author's reasoning based on biology and economics versus the girlfriend's expectation of equality. The author is making a generalization about typical roles, which she finds unacceptable. \n\nI should consider current societal norms. There's a growing emphasis on gender equality, and many people advocate for shared parenting responsibilities regardless of traditional gender roles. The author's argument relies on traditional views where the mother is the primary caregiver, which some might see as outdated or restrictive. \n\nHowever, the author isn't saying he won't contribute at all. He's acknowledging that an equal split isn't feasible, perhaps especially right after birth. The girlfriend might feel that his stance dismisses her desire for equality and doesn't account for changing societal norms. \n\nAnother angle is that the author's argument could be seen as making assumptions based on gender. If the couple believes in equality, the author's position might be seen as undermining that. It's possible that the girlfriend is looking for reassurance that he's willing to adapt and share responsibilities equally, even if it means challenging traditional roles. \n\nThere's also the aspect of communication. The author might be trying to set realistic expectations, but if he's not open to negotiation or considering other perspectives, that could be an issue. The girlfriend's reaction is a strong indicator that she values equality highly, and if the author isn't willing to meet her halfway, there's a conflict in values. \n\nIn terms of fairness, the author might not be wrong in pointing out practical challenges, but if he's rigid in his stance without considering shared efforts or modern approaches to parenting, that could be problematic. The key is whether he's dismissing her feelings or not being flexible.\n\nSo, weighing these factors: the author's argument has some practical basis, but his approach might be inflexible and based on traditional views that the girlfriend finds unacceptable. The girlfriend's reaction suggests that she values equality in parenting, and if the author is unwilling to compromise, that's a problem. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong because he's not considering her perspective and the possibility of shared responsibilities despite challenges.\n"
