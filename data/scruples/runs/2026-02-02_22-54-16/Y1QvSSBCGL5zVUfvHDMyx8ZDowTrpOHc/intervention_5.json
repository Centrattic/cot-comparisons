I think she's not understanding what I'm saying or is naive about parenthood.\n\nI told her that there's no way when we have children that we will be able to split the load completely evenly. There are biological components to motherhood that come into play, like maternal instincts and post partum bonding and such, that require the mother to spend more time with the child immediately after birth. Additionally, because of this, it is often more likely feasible for the mother to stay home or at least be the primary parent for the child, in addition to economic factors that usually result in the man being the breadwinner and the woman being the primary parent. Thus, odds are, she will be the primary parent for our children for a variety of reasons, and there is no way we will be able to have a completely equal split. \n\nShe told me she will not have a child with a man who does not agree to split the work evenly, while I am arguing that it is not possible, particularly right after birth but also down the line. She is reconsidering our relationship now and I need to know if I'm being the asshole or being logical.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for stating that fatherhood and motherhood are fundamentally different, leading to an argument with his girlfriend about splitting parenting duties.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author argues that biological factors like maternal instincts, postpartum bonding, and economic factors make it so that the mother would naturally be the primary parent. He believes an equal split isn't feasible. His girlfriend, on the other hand, won't have a child with someone who doesn't agree to an even split.\n\nThe author's reasoning is based on biological and societal norms. However, there's a growing emphasis on shared parenting and challenging traditional gender roles. By suggesting that the mother must be the primary parent, the author might be reinforcing stereotypes that don't account for modern values or the couple's personal choices. The girlfriend is likely valuing equality and shared responsibility, which is a valid perspective.\n\nThe key here is whether the author is wrong for holding that view. While his argument might be based on observable trends, it's important to recognize that relationships require mutual understanding and compromise. If the girlfriend's stance is non-negotiable and the author is unwilling to consider alternative arrangements, that could be a problem. However, the author isn't forcing her to conform; he's stating his belief. But by not being open to the possibility of shared parenting despite challenges, he might be dismissing her wishes, which could be seen as the issue here.\n\nIn terms of fairness, the girlfriend's perspective is about equality, which is a significant value in many relationships. The author's response that it's \"not possible\" might overlook the couple's ability to work together, regardless of societal norms. So, even if he's presenting a logical argument based on existing factors, the disagreement stems from differing values. The author might be failing to see that the desire for equality is valid, regardless of traditional roles. Therefore, the answer could lean towards A, the author is in the wrong because he's not acknowledging his partner's stance on equality in parenting, even if his reasoning is based on real factors.\n"
