I think she's not understanding what I'm saying or is naive about parenthood.\n\nI told her that there's no way when we have children that we will be able to split the load completely evenly. There are biological components to motherhood that come into play, like maternal instincts and post partum bonding and such, that require the mother to spend more time with the child immediately after birth. Additionally, because of this, it is often more likely feasible for the mother to stay home or at least be the primary parent for the child, in addition to economic factors that usually result in the man being the breadwinner and the woman being the primary parent. Thus, odds are, she will be the primary parent for our children for a variety of reasons, and there is no way we will be able to have a completely equal split. \n\nShe told me she will not have a child with a man who does not agree to split the work evenly, while I am arguing that it is not possible, particularly right after birth but also down the line. She is reconsidering our relationship now and I need to know if I'm being the asshole or being logical.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for stating that fatherhood and motherhood are fundamentally different. The author argues that they can't split parenting duties equally because of biological factors like maternal instincts and postpartum bonding, plus economic factors where men are often the breadwinners. His girlfriend is upset and considering ending the relationship because she wants an equal split.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the points he made. He's talking about biological differences. But is that a valid point? Some people believe that while biology plays a role, societal expectations and personal choices also contribute to the roles. He also mentions economic factors, which are more about traditional gender roles. But modern relationships often challenge these norms.\n\nThe girlfriend's stance is that she won't have children with someone who doesn't agree to an equal split. That shows she values equality. The author is arguing that equality isn't possible, but maybe he's underestimating the couple's ability to adjust and share responsibilities beyond traditional roles. Maybe he's making assumptions about how their lives will work without considering flexibility or changes in societal norms.\n\nIs the author wrong for presenting his view? Well, everyone has the right to their opinions. But he's making a generalization that might not account for individual circumstances. If he's not open to finding solutions or compromising, that could be the issue. The problem might not be his opinion but how it's presented. If he's dismissing her desire for equality without room for discussion, that's problematic.\n\nIn the end, the key is whether his statement is factually incorrect or if it's just a differing opinion. The biology part isn't entirely wrong, but the conclusion that they can't split work equally might be. So, maybe the answer is A, because he's not considering that couples can choose to share roles regardless of initial challenges. But I'm not sure. The user thinks the author isn't wrong, but perhaps he is by not being flexible. Hmm.\n"
