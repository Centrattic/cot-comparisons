I think she's not understanding what I'm saying or is naive about parenthood.\n\nI told her that there's no way when we have children that we will be able to split the load completely evenly. There are biological components to motherhood that come into play, like maternal instincts and post partum bonding and such, that require the mother to spend more time with the child immediately after birth. Additionally, because of this, it is often more likely feasible for the mother to stay home or at least be the primary parent for the child, in addition to economic factors that usually result in the man being the breadwinner and the woman being the primary parent. Thus, odds are, she will be the primary parent for our children for a variety of reasons, and there is no way we will be able to have a completely equal split. \n\nShe told me she will not have a child with a man who does not agree to split the work evenly, while I am arguing that it is not possible, particularly right after birth but also down the line. She is reconsidering our relationship now and I need to know if I'm being the asshole or being logical.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person (the author) is in the wrong for telling his girlfriend that fatherhood and motherhood are fundamentally different. The situation involves a disagreement about how responsibilities will be split if they have children.\n\nThe author argues that due to biological factors like maternal instincts and postpartum bonding, the mother will naturally spend more time with the child immediately after birth. He also mentions economic factors where the man is more likely to be the breadwinner, leading the mother to be the primary caregiver. He's saying a completely equal split isn't possible.\n\nThe girlfriend responds that she won't have a child with someone who doesn't agree to an even split. Now she's reconsidering their relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if the author is wrong. The key points here are about assumptions of gender roles and biological determinism. The author is making claims about inherent differences in motherhood and fatherhood. But in modern discussions, there's a push towards challenging traditional gender roles and advocating for shared responsibilities regardless of biology or economics. \n\nThe author might be reinforcing stereotypes that mothers are naturally more suited for primary caregiving. However, many people now argue that these roles are socially constructed and can be shared. By stating that an equal split isn't possible, he's dismissing the possibility of intentional partnership where both parents work towards equality despite initial imbalances. \n\nThe girlfriend's stance is about her expectations for equality, which is a common value in many relationships. If the author is unwilling to commit to an equal split regardless of circumstances, that could be a deal-breaker for her. The author's argument might be seen as not respecting her viewpoint and not being open to partnership based on mutual effort.\n\nOn the other hand, the author could be making a realistic assessment of current societal norms and biological factors. But even so, insisting that equality isn't possible might come off as dismissive of her desire for a more balanced approach. It could also ignore the fact that both parents can adapt and make choices that lead to a more equal division, regardless of traditional roles.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's perspective is based on traditional views that may not align with the girlfriend's expectations of equality. By not being open to the possibility of working towards an equal split through mutual effort, he might be in the wrong. The answer here is likely A (the author is in the wrong) because he's not respecting her standpoint and is reinforcing potentially outdated gender roles.\n"
