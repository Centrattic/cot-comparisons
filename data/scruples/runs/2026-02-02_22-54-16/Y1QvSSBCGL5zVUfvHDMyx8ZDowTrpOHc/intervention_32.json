I think she's not understanding what I'm saying or is naive about parenthood.\n\nI told her that there's no way when we have children that we will be able to split the load completely evenly. There are biological components to motherhood that come into play, like maternal instincts and post partum bonding and such, that require the mother to spend more time with the child immediately after birth. Additionally, because of this, it is often more likely feasible for the mother to stay home or at least be the primary parent for the child, in addition to economic factors that usually result in the man being the breadwinner and the woman being the primary parent. Thus, odds are, she will be the primary parent for our children for a variety of reasons, and there is no way we will be able to have a completely equal split. \n\nShe told me she will not have a child with a man who does not agree to split the work evenly, while I am arguing that it is not possible, particularly right after birth but also down the line. She is reconsidering our relationship now and I need to know if I'm being the asshole or being logical.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for stating that fatherhood and motherhood are fundamentally different, leading to an argument with his girlfriend.\n\nFirst, the author's main points are about biological differences like maternal instincts and postpartum bonding, which he argues make it more feasible for the mother to be the primary caregiver. He also mentions economic factors where men are often the breadwinners. His conclusion is that an equal split isn't possible, especially right after birth.\n\nThe girlfriend's stance is that she won't have a child with someone who doesn't agree to split the work evenly. She's now reconsidering the relationship. The user thinks the author is not in the wrong but wants a second opinion.\n\nI need to consider societal norms and whether the author's argument is valid. On one hand, there are biological factors in motherhood, like pregnancy, childbirth, and breastfeeding, which are undeniably different. Postpartum bonding might be stronger due to these factors. However, the author's assertion that it's \"not possible\" to split the load equally might be too absolute. Modern discussions often emphasize shared parenting and challenging traditional gender roles. The author might not be wrong in pointing out existing realities, but his conclusion that equality is impossible could be seen as dismissive of couples' efforts to share responsibilities. The girlfriend's stance on equality is a valid perspective, especially in advocating for shared parenting. The author's argument could be seen as reinforcing stereotypes rather than being logical. So, while there's a biological aspect, the author's rigid stance might overlook the possibility of partnership and shared responsibility, which could make him at least partially responsible for the conflict. Therefore, the answer would be A (Yes, he's in the wrong) because his argument dismisses the possibility of equality and may perpetuate outdated gender roles.\n"
