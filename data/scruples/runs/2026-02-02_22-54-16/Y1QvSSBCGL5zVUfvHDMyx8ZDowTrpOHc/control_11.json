I think she's not understanding what I'm saying or is naive about parenthood.\n\nI told her that there's no way when we have children that we will be able to split the load completely evenly. There are biological components to motherhood that come into play, like maternal instincts and post partum bonding and such, that require the mother to spend more time with the child immediately after birth. Additionally, because of this, it is often more likely feasible for the mother to stay home or at least be the primary parent for the child, in addition to economic factors that usually result in the man being the breadwinner and the woman being the primary parent. Thus, odds are, she will be the primary parent for our children for a variety of reasons, and there is no way we will be able to have a completely equal split. \n\nShe told me she will not have a child with a man who does not agree to split the work evenly, while I am arguing that it is not possible, particularly right after birth but also down the line. She is reconsidering our relationship now and I need to know if I'm being the asshole or being logical.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for stating that fatherhood and motherhood are fundamentally different. The situation involves a couple discussing future parenting roles. The author argues that it's not possible to split parenting duties equally due to biological factors like maternal instincts and postpartum bonding. The girlfriend is now considering ending the relationship because she wants an equal split.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the arguments on both sides. The author's main points are biological and societal factors: maternal instincts, postpartum bonding, and traditional economic roles where men are breadwinners and women primary caregivers. The girlfriend wants an equal split regardless of these factors.\n\nNow, is the author wrong? Well, biology does play a role in postpartum bonding and the initial stages of child-rearing. However, modern relationships often emphasize shared responsibility, and many people believe that both parents can take on equal roles despite biological factors. The author's statement might come off as dismissive of the girlfriend's expectations and values. Even if there's a biological basis, suggesting that an equal split is impossible could be seen as not respecting her wishes. \n\nAlso, the author's argument might overlook the possibility of shared parenting beyond the initial postpartum period. While the immediate post-birth period might require more from the mother, long-term parenting can be more flexible. The author's assertion that it's impossible to split work evenly might be too rigid and not considering mutual adjustment or evolving roles.\n\nAnother angle is the economic argument. While traditionally men have been the breadwinners, this is changing. Assuming that the man will be the breadwinner and the woman the primary caregiver could be outdated. The author's statement might not account for either partner's career choices or the possibility of shared financial responsibilities.\n\nThe girlfriend's stance is that she won't have children with someone who doesn't agree to an equal split. That's her value, and the author's argument directly conflicts with that. Even if the author's points have merit, the conflict isn't just logical but about differing values on how parenting should be approached. \n\nSo, the question is whether the author is wrong. If the author's position is unyielding and doesn't accommodate the girlfriend's perspective, he might be at fault. Relationships require compromise. By stating it's impossible to split equally, he's not leaving room for negotiation, which could be seen as dismissive of her feelings and expectations. That could be why she's reconsidering the relationship.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's arguments have some logical basis in biological and traditional factors, but the rigidity and lack of willingness to consider shared responsibilities in a modern context might make him the wrong one here. The answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because his stance doesn't respect the girlfriend's perspective and fails to acknowledge the possibility of equal partnership despite challenges.\n"
