I think she's not understanding what I'm saying or is naive about parenthood.\n\nI told her that there's no way when we have children that we will be able to split the load completely evenly. There are biological components to motherhood that come into play, like maternal instincts and post partum bonding and such, that require the mother to spend more time with the child immediately after birth. Additionally, because of this, it is often more likely feasible for the mother to stay home or at least be the primary parent for the child, in addition to economic factors that usually result in the man being the breadwinner and the woman being the primary parent. Thus, odds are, she will be the primary parent for our children for a variety of reasons, and there is no way we will be able to have a completely equal split. \n\nShe told me she will not have a child with a man who does not agree to split the work evenly, while I am arguing that it is not possible, particularly right after birth but also down the line. She is reconsidering our relationship now and I need to know if I'm being the asshole or being logical.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for stating that fatherhood and motherhood are fundamentally different. The key points here are about the arguments each person made.\n\nThe author argues that there are biological reasons why the mother would be the primary parent, like maternal instincts and postpartum bonding. They also mention economic factors where the man is typically the breadwinner. The girlfriend, on the other hand, insists that she won't have a child with someone who doesn't agree to an equal split, leading her to reevaluate the relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the validity of the author's points. The biological aspects\u2014like how maternal instincts and postpartum bonding affect the mother\u2014are real. Research does show that the hormonal changes during pregnancy and after birth can influence a mother's bonding with the child. However, the assumption that these biological factors mean the mother must be the primary caregiver is a bit of a generalization. It's true that in many cases mothers spend more time with the baby initially, but societal norms are changing, and many fathers take on significant roles early on.\n\nThen there's the economic argument. The author mentions that the man is usually the breadwinner. This is a stereotype that's becoming less accurate as more women enter the workforce and earn comparable incomes. But it's still a common situation. However, the author's conclusion that this makes equal split impossible might be overlooking the possibility of mutual adjustment. If both partners are willing to adapt their careers or share responsibilities, an equal split could be feasible, even if it's challenging.\n\nThe girlfriend's stance is that she expects equality. Her reaction is strong\u2014reconsidering the relationship if there's no agreement. That's a big deal, but her position is about personal values. She might be setting a boundary based on her beliefs about shared parenting. The author's argument that equality isn't possible could be seen as dismissive of her values. It's possible he's not considering that she's not just talking about the first few months but long-term parenting. Even if the initial months are more demanding for the mother, over time, equality can be achieved through mutual effort.\n\nAnother angle is the assumption that the mother must be the primary caregiver. This could be seen as reinforcing traditional gender roles, which might be why the girlfriend is upset. Even if there are biological factors, they don't have to dictate the entire parenting arrangement. The idea that it's \"fundamentally different\" might be oversimplifying the complexities of modern parenting and individual choices. The author's stance might come off as rigid, not allowing for flexibility or shared responsibilities beyond the initial period.\n\nThe author is presenting this as a logical conclusion, but it's also a value judgment. The girlfriend is setting a personal boundary, which is valid. The question is whether the author's argument is a reasonable discussion of practical realities or if it's perpetuating outdated stereotypes. If the author is using biological factors to justify unequal responsibilities, that could be problematic. It might also depend on the context of their relationship and previous discussions about parenting roles.\n\nIn summary, the author is making a case based on biological and economic factors, but the girlfriend sees it as a refusal to commit to equality. The core issue is whether the author is dismissing her expectations as naive. If the author is unwilling to compromise or consider alternative arrangements, that could be where he's in the wrong. The key here is whether he's being dismissive of her values rather than engaging in a constructive dialogue about how to navigate parenting together.\n"
