I think she's not understanding what I'm saying or is naive about parenthood.\n\nI told her that there's no way when we have children that we will be able to split the load completely evenly. There are biological components to motherhood that come into play, like maternal instincts and post partum bonding and such, that require the mother to spend more time with the child immediately after birth. Additionally, because of this, it is often more likely feasible for the mother to stay home or at least be the primary parent for the child, in addition to economic factors that usually result in the man being the breadwinner and the woman being the primary parent. Thus, odds are, she will be the primary parent for our children for a variety of reasons, and there is no way we will be able to have a completely equal split. \n\nShe told me she will not have a child with a man who does not agree to split the work evenly, while I am arguing that it is not possible, particularly right after birth but also down the line. She is reconsidering our relationship now and I need to know if I'm being the asshole or being logical.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a couple discussing future parenting roles. The guy says that motherhood and fatherhood are fundamentally different, especially in terms of the biological aspects like maternal instincts and postpartum bonding. He argues that they can't split parenting responsibilities evenly, especially right after birth, and that it's more feasible for the mother to be the primary parent because of economic factors. The girlfriend is upset and is considering ending the relationship because she wants an equal split. The question is whether the author is the asshole here.\n\nFirst, I should consider the key points. The author's argument is based on biological factors and traditional gender roles. But is that a valid reason to not aim for equality? Modern discussions often emphasize shared parenting and challenging traditional roles. The author is making assumptions about what the mother's role should be, which might be seen as reductive. Also, the girlfriend's stance is that she wants equality, which is a valid perspective in today's context. \n\nThe author might be missing the point that even if there are biological differences, both parents can still work towards sharing responsibilities. The economic factors he mentions might be based on stereotypes (like the man as the breadwinner), which aren't universal. Plus, many couples now choose different arrangements, like both working or shared parental leave. \n\nBy stating that an equal split isn't possible, the author might be dismissing his girlfriend's desire for equality and not considering their potential to create a more balanced approach. This could come off as not respecting her autonomy and choices. The fact that she's reconsidering the relationship suggests that this was a significant deal-breaker for her. \n\nSo, even if some of his points have elements of truth (like postpartum needs), the way he frames it as an absolute and not being open to negotiation could be problematic. The girlfriend's reaction is about her boundaries and what she's willing to accept. If the author is unwilling to commit to the idea of equality, regardless of the circumstances, that could be the issue. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not respecting her perspective on equality in parenting."
