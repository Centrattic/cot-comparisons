I think she's not understanding what I'm saying or is naive about parenthood.\n\nI told her that there's no way when we have children that we will be able to split the load completely evenly. There are biological components to motherhood that come into play, like maternal instincts and post partum bonding and such, that require the mother to spend more time with the child immediately after birth. Additionally, because of this, it is often more likely feasible for the mother to stay home or at least be the primary parent for the child, in addition to economic factors that usually result in the man being the breadwinner and the woman being the primary parent. Thus, odds are, she will be the primary parent for our children for a variety of reasons, and there is no way we will be able to have a completely equal split. \n\nShe told me she will not have a child with a man who does not agree to split the work evenly, while I am arguing that it is not possible, particularly right after birth but also down the line. She is reconsidering our relationship now and I need to know if I'm being the asshole or being logical.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the question is in the wrong. The situation is about a couple discussing future parenting roles. The author argues that motherhood and fatherhood are different, citing biological factors and economic reasons. The girlfriend is upset and considering ending the relationship because he won't agree to split the work evenly.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's reasoning is based on biological and societal factors. He mentions maternal instincts, postpartum bonding, and the traditional economic roles where men are breadwinners and women primary caregivers. But is that a valid or acceptable argument today?\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's stance is that she expects an equal split. She might be advocating for a more modern, egalitarian approach to parenting, which is increasingly common. The author's argument could be seen as reinforcing traditional gender roles, which might be why she's upset.\n\nThe key here is whether the author's statements are factually correct or if they perpetuate stereotypes. While there are biological differences (like pregnancy and postpartum), the idea that mothers must be the primary parent is more of a societal norm than a strict biological necessity. Many couples do share responsibilities equally, and the assumption that men must be the breadwinner is changing. So the author's argument might be based on outdated or oversimplified assumptions.\n\nAlso, the girlfriend's reaction might be about the principle. She might feel that the author is dismissing her values or not being open to a partnership where roles can be flexible. Even if the author's points have some truth, the way he frames it could be seen as inflexible or not respecting her expectations. In relationships, compromise and mutual respect are important. If the author is unwilling to consider a more equal split despite changing societal norms, that could be the issue.\n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong because he's clinging to traditional roles that the girlfriend finds unacceptable. Even if some of his points have merit, the rigidity and the refusal to negotiate could be the problem here.\n"
