I think she's not understanding what I'm saying or is naive about parenthood.\n\nI told her that there's no way when we have children that we will be able to split the load completely evenly. There are biological components to motherhood that come into play, like maternal instincts and post partum bonding and such, that require the mother to spend more time with the child immediately after birth. Additionally, because of this, it is often more likely feasible for the mother to stay home or at least be the primary parent for the child, in addition to economic factors that usually result in the man being the breadwinner and the woman being the primary parent. Thus, odds are, she will be the primary parent for our children for a variety of reasons, and there is no way we will be able to have a completely equal split. \n\nShe told me she will not have a child with a man who does not agree to split the work evenly, while I am arguing that it is not possible, particularly right after birth but also down the line. She is reconsidering our relationship now and I need to know if I'm being the asshole or being logical.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about whether fatherhood and motherhood are fundamentally different, leading to a conflict with their girlfriend.\n\nThe author argues that it's not possible to split parenting duties evenly, citing biological factors like maternal instincts and postpartum bonding. They also mention economic factors where the man is typically the breadwinner. The girlfriend, however, insists she won't have children with someone who doesn't agree to an equal split, leading her to reconsider the relationship.\n\nHmm. So the key points here are the assumptions the author is making. They're talking about biological components that make the mother spend more time with the child. But wait, isn't that a stereotype? I remember that some studies show that while there are some biological factors, a lot of parental behavior is influenced by social norms and expectations. For example, the idea that mothers should be the primary caregivers is socially constructed, not purely biological. Also, the economic role where the man is the breadwinner is a traditional gender role that's changing in many societies. So the author might be relying on outdated or biased assumptions.\n\nThe girlfriend's stance is that she wants equality. She might be pushing back against these traditional roles, which the author is defending. If the author is insisting that equality isn't possible because of these inherent differences, they might be dismissing the possibility of challenging those norms. The girlfriend could see this as the author not being committed to equality, which is a dealbreaker for her. \n\nBut wait, the author isn't saying they won't be equal, just that a complete 50/50 split isn't feasible. Maybe the author is right in the sense that perfect equality is hard, but the girlfriend is expecting a commitment to shared responsibility even if it's not perfectly equal. The problem here is the rigidity of the author's position. By stating that it's impossible, the author might be shutting down the discussion about how to share responsibilities in a fair way, rather than working together to find a solution. \n\nAlso, the author might be making generalizations that don't account for individual differences. Not all mothers feel the same about postpartum bonding, and many fathers are very involved from the start. The author's argument could be seen as reinforcing harmful stereotypes that limit both the mother's and the father's roles. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. If the author's intention was to discuss realistic expectations, but they came across as dismissive of the girlfriend's desire for equality, that's a problem. The girlfriend's reconsideration might be because she feels the author isn't open to sharing responsibilities in a way that aligns with her values. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? I think they might be because they're perpetuating stereotypes and not engaging with the girlfriend's perspective on equality. Even if their points have some basis in reality, the way they're framed could be seen as inflexible and dismissive. The answer would likely be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
