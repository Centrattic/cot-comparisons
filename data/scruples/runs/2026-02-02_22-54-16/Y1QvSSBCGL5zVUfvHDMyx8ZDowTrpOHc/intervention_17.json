I think she's not understanding what I'm saying or is naive about parenthood.\n\nI told her that there's no way when we have children that we will be able to split the load completely evenly. There are biological components to motherhood that come into play, like maternal instincts and post partum bonding and such, that require the mother to spend more time with the child immediately after birth. Additionally, because of this, it is often more likely feasible for the mother to stay home or at least be the primary parent for the child, in addition to economic factors that usually result in the man being the breadwinner and the woman being the primary parent. Thus, odds are, she will be the primary parent for our children for a variety of reasons, and there is no way we will be able to have a completely equal split. \n\nShe told me she will not have a child with a man who does not agree to split the work evenly, while I am arguing that it is not possible, particularly right after birth but also down the line. She is reconsidering our relationship now and I need to know if I'm being the asshole or being logical.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for stating that fatherhood and motherhood are fundamentally different. The author argues that it's impossible to split parenting responsibilities equally because of biological factors like maternal instincts and postpartum bonding, as well as economic factors where men are more likely to be the breadwinners. His girlfriend is upset and considering ending the relationship because she refuses to accept anything less than an equal split.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the validity of the author's points. He mentions biological differences, but it's important to note that while there are biological aspects (like childbirth and breastfeeding), the concept of maternal instincts isn't a scientific fact. It's more of a societal belief. Also, economic factors contributing to the man being the breadwinner are changing, and many dual-income households exist. So, his argument might be based on outdated or overgeneralized assumptions.\n\nNext, the author's approach to the conversation is key. He's making assertions about how parenting will have to be structured without considering his girlfriend's perspective. The girlfriend wants equality, which is a valid stance. By not being open to negotiation or considering other possibilities (like flexible work arrangements, support systems, etc.), he's dismissing her needs. Communication in relationships requires mutual understanding and compromise. If he's not willing to explore options that allow for a more equal split despite his points, that's problematic.\n\nThe author's statement that there's no way to split the load evenly could come off as dismissive of the girlfriend's desire for equality. Even if he's not \"wrong\" biologically, he might be wrong in how he's handling the conversation. The girlfriend's reaction is about feeling unheard or invalidated, which is a significant issue in relationships. The author's approach might stem from a place of trying to be realistic, but by not addressing her concerns and being rigid, he's contributing to the conflict.\n\nAdditionally, the idea that the mother should be the primary parent often comes from traditional gender roles, which many people are moving away from. The author's argument could be seen as reinforcing stereotypes, which might be why the girlfriend is upset. It's possible that the author isn't in the wrong in terms of his beliefs, but in how he's expressing them and not being flexible in finding a solution that works for both partners.\n\nSo, considering all these points, the author might be wrong not because his biological arguments are invalid (though they can be debated), but because he isn't engaging in the conversation with the necessary openness and willingness to compromise. Relationships require negotiation, and his stance could be seen as inflexible, leading to the girlfriend feeling her needs aren't respected.\n"
