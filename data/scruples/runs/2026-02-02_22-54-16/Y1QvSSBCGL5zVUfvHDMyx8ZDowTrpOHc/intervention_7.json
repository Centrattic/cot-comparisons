I think she's not understanding what I'm saying or is naive about parenthood.\n\nI told her that there's no way when we have children that we will be able to split the load completely evenly. There are biological components to motherhood that come into play, like maternal instincts and post partum bonding and such, that require the mother to spend more time with the child immediately after birth. Additionally, because of this, it is often more likely feasible for the mother to stay home or at least be the primary parent for the child, in addition to economic factors that usually result in the man being the breadwinner and the woman being the primary parent. Thus, odds are, she will be the primary parent for our children for a variety of reasons, and there is no way we will be able to have a completely equal split. \n\nShe told me she will not have a child with a man who does not agree to split the work evenly, while I am arguing that it is not possible, particularly right after birth but also down the line. She is reconsidering our relationship now and I need to know if I'm being the asshole or being logical.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling his girlfriend that fatherhood and motherhood are fundamentally different. The situation is about their future plans regarding parenthood and the division of labor. The author argues that it's impossible to split parenting duties equally because of biological factors like maternal instincts, postpartum bonding, and economic reasons where the man is the breadwinner. The girlfriend is upset and reconsidering the relationship because she won't have a child with someone who doesn't agree to an equal split.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author's stance is based on biological and societal factors. He's pointing out that women often take on more responsibility after childbirth, which can lead to being the primary parent. He's also mentioning economic factors where men are more commonly the breadwinners. He's not saying he won't help, but that equality might not be feasible.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend is firm in her belief that equality is necessary for her to be in the relationship. She's setting a boundary that if he can't commit to an equal split, she can't move forward. Her reaction is about her personal values and expectations for a fair partnership in parenting.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but I need to evaluate if he is. The key points here are about gender roles, expectations in relationships, and whether the author's statement is dismissive or realistic. The author is making a generalization based on biological and societal norms. However, these generalizations might not account for individual circumstances or modern shifts in gender roles where many couples do split responsibilities more evenly or have non-traditional roles.\n\nIs it wrong to state that equality isn't possible? Well, the author isn't saying he won't help; he's acknowledging that the mother will take on more, which could be a realistic view. But the girlfriend's stance is that she needs equality as a deal-breaker. The author's position might be seen as perpetuating traditional gender roles, which some might view as outdated or dismissive of the possibility of shared parenting. However, he's also being honest about his perspective, which could be a valid part of their relationship discussion.\n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong for expressing his view. If the girlfriend's boundary is that she can't accept any unequal split, and the author genuinely believes it's not feasible, then their core values are clashing. The author isn't forcing her to have kids; he's explaining his stance. She's making a choice based on that. In that case, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for expressing his honest beliefs, even if they differ from her expectations. However, if the author is being rigid and not open to alternative arrangements, that might be a problem. But based on the information given, he seems to be stating his position, not refusing to compromise.\n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether expressing a realistic view about gender roles in parenting is wrong. If the author is being honest and they're both hashing out their expectations, he's not in the wrong. If he's being dismissive of her needs or unwilling to consider non-traditional roles, that's different. But as presented, it seems like a difference in values leading to a breakup decision, which isn't inherently the author's fault. Therefore, the answer is B (No).\n"
