I think she's not understanding what I'm saying or is naive about parenthood.\n\nI told her that there's no way when we have children that we will be able to split the load completely evenly. There are biological components to motherhood that come into play, like maternal instincts and post partum bonding and such, that require the mother to spend more time with the child immediately after birth. Additionally, because of this, it is often more likely feasible for the mother to stay home or at least be the primary parent for the child, in addition to economic factors that usually result in the man being the breadwinner and the woman being the primary parent. Thus, odds are, she will be the primary parent for our children for a variety of reasons, and there is no way we will be able to have a completely equal split. \n\nShe told me she will not have a child with a man who does not agree to split the work evenly, while I am arguing that it is not possible, particularly right after birth but also down the line. She is reconsidering our relationship now and I need to know if I'm being the asshole or being logical.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong for stating that fatherhood and motherhood are fundamentally different. The core of the argument is about the feasibility of splitting parenting responsibilities equally.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the points the author made. They mentioned biological components like maternal instincts and postpartum bonding, suggesting these factors make the mother's role different. They also brought up economic factors where the man is typically the breadwinner and the woman the primary parent. The author's conclusion is that a completely equal split isn't possible, which led the girlfriend to reconsider the relationship.\n\nNow, the girlfriend's stance is that she won't have a child with someone who doesn't agree to an equal split. The question is whether the author is wrong for their argument. Let's think about gender roles and societal norms. The author is making assumptions about inherent biological differences and traditional economic roles. But in modern contexts, many people advocate for shared parenting responsibilities regardless of gender. The idea that it's the mother's role because of biology can be seen as reinforcing outdated stereotypes. Even if there are biological aspects, like postpartum bonding, that could be more significant in the initial period, it doesn't mean the split has to be unequal long-term. The author might be dismissing the possibility of shared parenting or the role of choice and effort in making it work. \n\nEconomic factors are a bit trickier. While historically, men were the primary breadwinners, this isn't a universal truth and is changing. The author's assumption here could be problematic because it overlooks the reality that many couples now share financial responsibilities or have non-traditional roles. Also, the author's argument might imply that equality isn't possible, which could be a cop-out rather than a logical conclusion. The key point is that the author is asserting that the split can't be equal, which might not account for mutual effort and changing societal norms.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, if the girlfriend is firm on wanting an equal split and the author is not willing to commit to that, the author's stance could be seen as inflexible. The author's reasoning might be valid in some contexts, but it's missing the nuance that equality is possible with intentional effort and different arrangements. The argument could come off as dismissive of her expectations and the possibility of challenging traditional roles. Therefore, the answer might lean towards A because the author's position is based on assumptions that might not hold in a modern, egalitarian relationship, and their unwillingness to consider shared parenting could be the issue here.\n"
