I think she's not understanding what I'm saying or is naive about parenthood.\n\nI told her that there's no way when we have children that we will be able to split the load completely evenly. There are biological components to motherhood that come into play, like maternal instincts and post partum bonding and such, that require the mother to spend more time with the child immediately after birth. Additionally, because of this, it is often more likely feasible for the mother to stay home or at least be the primary parent for the child, in addition to economic factors that usually result in the man being the breadwinner and the woman being the primary parent. Thus, odds are, she will be the primary parent for our children for a variety of reasons, and there is no way we will be able to have a completely equal split. \n\nShe told me she will not have a child with a man who does not agree to split the work evenly, while I am arguing that it is not possible, particularly right after birth but also down the line. She is reconsidering our relationship now and I need to know if I'm being the asshole or being logical.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for stating that fatherhood and motherhood are fundamentally different. The situation is about a disagreement with the girlfriend over how responsibilities would split if they had children.\n\nFirst, the author argues that due to biological factors like maternal instincts and postpartum bonding, the mother would naturally spend more time with the child initially. They also mention economic factors where the man is the breadwinner and the woman the primary parent. The conclusion is that an equal split isn't possible.\n\nThe girlfriend's stance is that she won't have a child with someone who doesn't agree to an equal split. Now, the user wants to know if the author is the asshole (AITA).\n\nI need to consider if the author is wrong. The key points here are about assumptions related to gender roles and biology. The author is making broad generalizations about mothers being primary caregivers due to biology and economics. But these are stereotypes that don't hold true for everyone. Many fathers are primary caregivers, and economic roles are changing. The author's statement might dismiss the girlfriend's desire for equality, which could be seen as dismissing her perspective.\n\nAlso, the argument that equality isn't possible because of biological factors could be seen as reinforcing traditional gender roles rather than promoting shared responsibility. Even if there are biological factors, many couples today aim for shared parenting regardless of those factors. The author's position might not account for the couple's mutual effort to balance responsibilities as much as possible, even if it's not exactly 50/50.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction is significant. She's considering ending the relationship over this, which indicates the issue is serious for her. If the author's stance is based on outdated or rigid views, that could be the problem. The question is whether the author is wrong in maintaining that view despite the girlfriend's stance.\n\nIt's also worth noting that the author's argument could be perceived as not valuing the girlfriend's opinion. If she's clear that equality is non-negotiable, and he's not willing to meet her halfway, that could be a deal-breaker. The author might be wrong in not being flexible, even if there's some truth to the biological aspects, because relationships require compromise.\n\nAnother angle: The author's argument assumes that the split can't be equal, but maybe the girlfriend is more willing to adapt roles or the couple could find a middle ground. By stating it's impossible, the author might be closing off discussion. That could be seen as inflexible.\n\nIn conclusion, the author might be in the wrong because his stance relies on stereotypes, doesn't account for modern parenting approaches, and is non-negotiable despite the girlfriend's clear boundaries. So the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
