I think she's not understanding what I'm saying or is naive about parenthood.\n\nI told her that there's no way when we have children that we will be able to split the load completely evenly. There are biological components to motherhood that come into play, like maternal instincts and post partum bonding and such, that require the mother to spend more time with the child immediately after birth. Additionally, because of this, it is often more likely feasible for the mother to stay home or at least be the primary parent for the child, in addition to economic factors that usually result in the man being the breadwinner and the woman being the primary parent. Thus, odds are, she will be the primary parent for our children for a variety of reasons, and there is no way we will be able to have a completely equal split. \n\nShe told me she will not have a child with a man who does not agree to split the work evenly, while I am arguing that it is not possible, particularly right after birth but also down the line. She is reconsidering our relationship now and I need to know if I'm being the asshole or being logical.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for saying that fatherhood and motherhood are fundamentally different, leading to an argument with his girlfriend. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author argues that due to biological factors like maternal instincts, postpartum bonding, and economic factors where men are often the breadwinners, the mother will likely be the primary parent. His girlfriend, on the other hand, insists on an equal split and is reconsidering the relationship because he doesn't agree. \n\nHmm. The author is making a case based on biological and societal norms. But is it valid? Well, biology does play a role\u2014like breastfeeding, postpartum bonding\u2014but those aren't absolute. Some fathers bond strongly too. Also, societal roles are changing. More men are primary caregivers, and many couples share responsibilities equally now. The author's argument assumes that the mother must be the primary parent, which might be based on outdated or generalized views.\n\nThe girlfriend's stance is about equality and shared responsibility. She wants an equal split, which is a valid expectation in a modern relationship. The author's refusal to see that equality is possible might come off as dismissive of her needs and the possibility of shared parenting. Even if there are challenges, the author's statement that it's \"not possible\" could be seen as rigid and not considering their ability to adapt or challenge traditional roles.\n\nAlso, the argument led to her reconsidering the relationship. The author might have triggered a deeper issue about differing values. If she values equal partnership and he's not willing to commit to that, there's a fundamental disagreement. The author's logic might be based on assumptions that don't account for their specific capabilities or willingness to adjust roles. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong because he's not acknowledging the possibility of shared parenting and is reinforcing traditional gender roles. The girlfriend's boundary is about equality, which is a valid stance. The answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
