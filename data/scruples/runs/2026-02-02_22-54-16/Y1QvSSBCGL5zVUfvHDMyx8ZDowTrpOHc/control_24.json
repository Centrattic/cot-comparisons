I think she's not understanding what I'm saying or is naive about parenthood.\n\nI told her that there's no way when we have children that we will be able to split the load completely evenly. There are biological components to motherhood that come into play, like maternal instincts and post partum bonding and such, that require the mother to spend more time with the child immediately after birth. Additionally, because of this, it is often more likely feasible for the mother to stay home or at least be the primary parent for the child, in addition to economic factors that usually result in the man being the breadwinner and the woman being the primary parent. Thus, odds are, she will be the primary parent for our children for a variety of reasons, and there is no way we will be able to have a completely equal split. \n\nShe told me she will not have a child with a man who does not agree to split the work evenly, while I am arguing that it is not possible, particularly right after birth but also down the line. She is reconsidering our relationship now and I need to know if I'm being the asshole or being logical.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling his girlfriend that fatherhood and motherhood are fundamentally different. The situation is that they were discussing future plans, and the girlfriend is reconsidering the relationship because she won't have a child with someone who doesn't agree to an equal split in parenting duties. The author argues that it's not possible to split evenly due to biological factors like maternal instincts and postpartum bonding, plus economic factors where the man is the breadwinner.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the author's reasoning. He's making claims based on biology and economics. The biological argument here is that mothers have maternal instincts and need to be more involved post-birth. But wait, is that a fact or a stereotype? There's research showing that bonding isn't exclusive to mothers; fathers can bond just as strongly. Also, postpartum bonding is often attributed to cultural norms and societal expectations rather than just biology. The economic angle assumes the man is the breadwinner, which is a traditional role that's changing in many cases now.\n\nThen there's the assumption that the primary parent should be the mother. This might be a societal expectation but not a given. Many couples do split responsibilities, and some even switch roles. The author is making a generalization that doesn't account for varying circumstances or choices the couple might make.\n\nThe girlfriend's stance is that she wants equality. She's clear that she won't accept anything less than an equal split. The author is pushing back based on his understanding, which might be based on outdated or biased views. By not acknowledging that equality can be achieved through shared commitment and flexibility, he's dismissing her values. \n\nFrom a social perspective, promoting equality in parenting is a valid and growing movement. The author's argument could be seen as reinforcing traditional gender roles, which might be why the girlfriend is upset. Even if some biological factors exist, they don't preclude the possibility of shared responsibilities. The author's insistence on an unequal split could be perceived as unwillingness to adapt or challenge societal norms.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is wrong. If his reasoning is based on stereotypes and not open to change, then he's contributing to unequal expectations. The girlfriend is standing by her principles of equality, which is a reasonable stance. Therefore, the author's position might be considered the wrong one because he's not being flexible and is imposing traditional roles without considering the couple's potential to create an equal partnership regardless of biological factors.\n"
