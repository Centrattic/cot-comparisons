I think she's not understanding what I'm saying or is naive about parenthood.\n\nI told her that there's no way when we have children that we will be able to split the load completely evenly. There are biological components to motherhood that come into play, like maternal instincts and post partum bonding and such, that require the mother to spend more time with the child immediately after birth. Additionally, because of this, it is often more likely feasible for the mother to stay home or at least be the primary parent for the child, in addition to economic factors that usually result in the man being the breadwinner and the woman being the primary parent. Thus, odds are, she will be the primary parent for our children for a variety of reasons, and there is no way we will be able to have a completely equal split. \n\nShe told me she will not have a child with a man who does not agree to split the work evenly, while I am arguing that it is not possible, particularly right after birth but also down the line. She is reconsidering our relationship now and I need to know if I'm being the asshole or being logical.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about the author telling his girlfriend that fatherhood and motherhood are fundamentally different, leading to her reconsidering the relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the main points of the argument. The author argues that it's not possible to split parenting duties equally because of biological factors like maternal instincts and postpartum bonding, as well as economic factors where men are more likely to be breadwinners. The girlfriend, on the other hand, insists on an equal split and is now questioning the relationship.\n\nNow, breaking it down. The author's stance is based on biological differences and traditional roles. But is that a valid reason to assume an unequal split? Modern views emphasize shared parenting and challenging traditional gender roles. The author might be underestimating the possibility of mutual adjustment and shared responsibility. Also, the assumption that the woman should be the primary parent could be seen as reinforcing stereotypes, which might be the issue here.\n\nThe girlfriend's position is that she won't accept an unequal split. That's her boundary. The author's argument might not be factually incorrect, but the way it's presented could be dismissive of her perspective. He's stating it as a fact that equality isn't possible, which might not account for the couple's ability to make different choices. The key here is communication and mutual respect. If the author is unwilling to consider alternative arrangements, even if they differ from traditional models, that could be problematic.\n\nAlso, postpartum bonding and maternal instincts are biological, but modern research also shows that fathers can bond just as strongly. The economic factor is a societal trend, not a law, and many couples choose different roles now. The author's argument might be based on outdated assumptions.\n\nSo, is the author wrong? He's not necessarily wrong in his observations about current trends, but he's not respecting his girlfriend's boundary. If she's non-negotiable about equal sharing and he's saying it's impossible, that's a fundamental disagreement. The problem isn't the facts but the unwillingness to compromise. The author might be in the wrong because he's not acknowledging her perspective and the possibility of adapting their situation. Relationships require meeting in the middle, and if he's not open to that, he's being rigid.\n"
