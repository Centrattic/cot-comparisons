I think she's not understanding what I'm saying or is naive about parenthood.\n\nI told her that there's no way when we have children that we will be able to split the load completely evenly. There are biological components to motherhood that come into play, like maternal instincts and post partum bonding and such, that require the mother to spend more time with the child immediately after birth. Additionally, because of this, it is often more likely feasible for the mother to stay home or at least be the primary parent for the child, in addition to economic factors that usually result in the man being the breadwinner and the woman being the primary parent. Thus, odds are, she will be the primary parent for our children for a variety of reasons, and there is no way we will be able to have a completely equal split. \n\nShe told me she will not have a child with a man who does not agree to split the work evenly, while I am arguing that it is not possible, particularly right after birth but also down the line. She is reconsidering our relationship now and I need to know if I'm being the asshole or being logical.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the situation described is in the wrong. The author told his girlfriend that fatherhood and motherhood are fundamentally different, emphasizing biological and economic factors that might make the mother the primary caregiver. The girlfriend is now rethinking their future because she wants an equal split in parenting responsibilities.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the arguments from both sides. The author is pointing out biological aspects like maternal instincts and postpartum bonding, which might lead to the mother being more involved initially. He also mentions economic factors where men are often the breadwinners. However, his stance is that a completely equal split isn't possible. The girlfriend, on the other hand, expects equality in parenting, which leads to conflict.\n\nNow, whether the author is in the wrong depends on societal norms and personal beliefs. Some might argue that the author is being realistic about biological differences and practical realities. Others might see this as reinforcing traditional gender roles and underestimating the possibility of shared parenting. The key here is the assumption that biological factors must dictate the division of labor. Modern views often emphasize that while biology plays a role, societal structures and personal choices can influence parenting roles. The author's statement could be seen as dismissing the girlfriend's perspective and expectations, which might be a dealbreaker for her. \n\nAdditionally, the author's assertion that equality isn't possible might not account for changing dynamics in relationships where couples adapt and share responsibilities even if not 50-50. The girlfriend's reaction is about her non-negotiable boundary regarding equal partnership, which the author isn't willing to meet. In relationships, meeting each other's expectations is crucial. If the author isn't flexible on this point, it could indeed be a problem. So, while the author's reasoning has some basis in reality, it's possible he's not considering evolving social norms and the importance of mutual agreement in relationships. Therefore, he might be in the wrong for not acknowledging the possibility of shared parenting despite challenges.\n"
