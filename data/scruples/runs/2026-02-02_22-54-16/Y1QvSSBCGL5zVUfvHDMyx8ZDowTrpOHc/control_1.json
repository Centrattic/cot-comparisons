I think she's not understanding what I'm saying or is naive about parenthood.\n\nI told her that there's no way when we have children that we will be able to split the load completely evenly. There are biological components to motherhood that come into play, like maternal instincts and post partum bonding and such, that require the mother to spend more time with the child immediately after birth. Additionally, because of this, it is often more likely feasible for the mother to stay home or at least be the primary parent for the child, in addition to economic factors that usually result in the man being the breadwinner and the woman being the primary parent. Thus, odds are, she will be the primary parent for our children for a variety of reasons, and there is no way we will be able to have a completely equal split. \n\nShe told me she will not have a child with a man who does not agree to split the work evenly, while I am arguing that it is not possible, particularly right after birth but also down the line. She is reconsidering our relationship now and I need to know if I'm being the asshole or being logical.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a disagreement between a couple about the feasibility of splitting parenting responsibilities equally.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the arguments. The author states that motherhood and fatherhood are fundamentally different due to biological factors like maternal instincts, postpartum bonding, and the likelihood of the mother being the primary caregiver. They also mention economic factors where men are typically the breadwinners. The girlfriend responds that she won't have a child with someone who doesn't agree to an equal split.\n\nThe key points here are the author's belief that complete equality isn't possible, especially after childbirth, while the girlfriend insists on equality. The author is arguing from a biological and traditional economic perspective, while the girlfriend is standing by her stance on equal responsibility.\n\nNow, I need to consider if the author is wrong. Are the biological factors the author mentions valid? Yes, there are physiological differences like childbirth and postpartum that can affect a mother's immediate role. However, the author might be generalizing and not accounting for modern societal shifts where shared parenting is possible with effort and support. The assumption that the mother must be the primary parent might overlook the possibility of flexible arrangements and changing economic roles.\n\nThe author's statement that a completely equal split isn't possible could be seen as dismissing the girlfriend's expectations without acknowledging that equality isn't always about splitting time equally but about shared responsibility and adapting. The girlfriend's stance is about mutual commitment, and the author's response might come off as rigid or not valuing her perspective.\n\nAlso, the author's tone might be contributing to the problem. Even if there's some truth in the biological aspects, presenting it as an absolute (\"no way\") could be inflexible. Relationships require compromise, and suggesting that equality isn't possible without considering alternatives or flexibility could be hurtful.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, while there are still gender-based economic disparities in some regions, many societies are moving towards more equitable parenting roles. The author's argument might be based on outdated assumptions. The girlfriend's insistence on equality could reflect her personal values and the belief that both parents can adapt roles as needed.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author's stance might be logical from a certain perspective but could be missing the emotional and relational aspects. The girlfriend's reaction is about her non-negotiable boundary, which the author is not respecting. Therefore, the author might be at fault for not being open to compromise or understanding her perspective, even if some of the points have merit.\n"
