I think she's not understanding what I'm saying or is naive about parenthood.\n\nI told her that there's no way when we have children that we will be able to split the load completely evenly. There are biological components to motherhood that come into play, like maternal instincts and post partum bonding and such, that require the mother to spend more time with the child immediately after birth. Additionally, because of this, it is often more likely feasible for the mother to stay home or at least be the primary parent for the child, in addition to economic factors that usually result in the man being the breadwinner and the woman being the primary parent. Thus, odds are, she will be the primary parent for our children for a variety of reasons, and there is no way we will be able to have a completely equal split. \n\nShe told me she will not have a child with a man who does not agree to split the work evenly, while I am arguing that it is not possible, particularly right after birth but also down the line. She is reconsidering our relationship now and I need to know if I'm being the asshole or being logical.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" (AITA) post is in the wrong. The situation involves a disagreement between the author and his girlfriend about the division of parental responsibilities, particularly after the birth of their children.\n\nThe author argues that due to biological factors like maternal instincts, postpartum bonding, and traditional economic roles where the man is the breadwinner, it's not feasible to split parenting duties equally. He believes the mother should be the primary parent initially. His girlfriend, on the other hand, insists on an equal split and is considering ending the relationship because he doesn't agree.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the validity of the author's points. He's pointing out biological and societal factors that might influence parenting roles. However, his argument seems to assume that these factors are fixed and that equality isn't possible, which might not be the case. Modern discussions around parenting often emphasize shared responsibility and the idea that both parents can adapt roles regardless of traditional norms. The author's stance could be seen as reinforcing stereotypes, which might be problematic.\n\nThe girlfriend's stance is about wanting equality. She's setting a boundary that she won't have children with someone who doesn't agree to split the work. Her position is about mutual commitment to shared parenting. While the author thinks it's impossible, the girlfriend sees it as a non-negotiable value.\n\nNow, considering the question of right and wrong. The author isn't necessarily wrong in pointing out existing realities, but he might be in the wrong if his argument is dismissive of the possibility of equality. By stating that an equal split isn't possible, he's not leaving room for compromise or change. The girlfriend's reaction is about her expectations for a partnership where both contribute equally, which is a valid perspective. \n\nThe key issue here is communication and understanding. The author might be underestimating the importance of the girlfriend's values. Even if there are biological factors, they don't have to dictate the division of labor. The author's approach could be seen as rigid, not allowing for flexibility or growth in their partnership. \n\nIn terms of societal progress, there's a shift towards more egalitarian parenting. The author's argument might be based on outdated norms. By not acknowledging that both parents can share responsibilities equally despite biological factors, he's not being fully supportive of his partner's needs. \n\nTherefore, the author's stance could be seen as the problem here. He's not wrong in acknowledging existing challenges, but his refusal to consider equality as achievable might be where he's in the wrong. The girlfriend's reaction is about her personal boundaries, which are important in a healthy relationship. The author's response to her concerns might not have been empathetic enough, leading to her reevaluating the relationship.\n"
