I think she's not understanding what I'm saying or is naive about parenthood.\n\nI told her that there's no way when we have children that we will be able to split the load completely evenly. There are biological components to motherhood that come into play, like maternal instincts and post partum bonding and such, that require the mother to spend more time with the child immediately after birth. Additionally, because of this, it is often more likely feasible for the mother to stay home or at least be the primary parent for the child, in addition to economic factors that usually result in the man being the breadwinner and the woman being the primary parent. Thus, odds are, she will be the primary parent for our children for a variety of reasons, and there is no way we will be able to have a completely equal split. \n\nShe told me she will not have a child with a man who does not agree to split the work evenly, while I am arguing that it is not possible, particularly right after birth but also down the line. She is reconsidering our relationship now and I need to know if I'm being the asshole or being logical.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for saying that motherhood and fatherhood are fundamentally different, leading to an unequal split in parenting duties.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the arguments from both sides. The author argues that there are biological factors, like maternal instincts and postpartum bonding, that make the mother the primary caregiver immediately after birth. He also mentions economic factors where men are more likely to be the breadwinners. Therefore, he thinks an equal split isn't feasible.\n\nHis girlfriend, on the other hand, insists that she won't have a child with someone who doesn't agree to split the work evenly. She's taking a stance on equality in parenting, possibly valuing equal sharing of responsibilities regardless of traditional roles.\n\nNow, the key here is whether the author is wrong for his perspective. The question is about whether his position is based on outdated or incorrect assumptions. \n\nThe author's argument relies on biological and traditional economic roles. However, modern perspectives often challenge these ideas. For example, many studies show that maternal instincts aren't exclusive to women and that bonding can be equally strong in fathers. Also, the economic role of men as primary breadwinners is changing, though it's still a reality in many cases. \n\nBy stating that an equal split isn't possible, the author might be dismissing the possibility of shared parenting and the idea that both parents can adapt their roles. His girlfriend is likely looking for a commitment to shared responsibility, which he's not willing to make due to his beliefs about inherent differences.\n\nThe author's stance could be seen as reinforcing traditional gender roles, which might be considered the wrong approach in a relationship where both partners want equality. Even if some biological factors exist, they don't necessarily dictate the division of labor. The author's unwillingness to consider a more equal split despite these factors could be seen as inflexible or not accommodating his partner's needs and values.\n\nAdditionally, the author's argument that it's \"not possible\" might not account for the flexibility and mutual adjustment that many couples achieve. The girlfriend's reaction suggests that she values equality and partnership, and the author's refusal to agree could be damaging to their relationship.\n\nSo, considering modern views on gender roles and shared parenting, the author's position might be seen as the wrong one, hence answer A. But wait, the question is whether he's in the wrong. If his argument is based on outdated ideas, then he is in the wrong. However, if he's just stating his belief without being disrespectful, maybe not. But his girlfriend's reaction shows that his statement caused a major conflict, leading her to reconsider the relationship. \n\nThe author might not be wrong in his beliefs, but in how he communicated them or his unwillingness to find a middle ground. If he's not open to negotiation or considering his partner's perspective, that's where he's in the wrong. The fact that he's framing it as a \"logical\" argument while dismissing her stance as \"naive\" could make him the asshole here. \n\nTherefore, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because he's enforcing traditional roles without considering modern approaches to shared parenting and his partner's desires for equality.\n"
