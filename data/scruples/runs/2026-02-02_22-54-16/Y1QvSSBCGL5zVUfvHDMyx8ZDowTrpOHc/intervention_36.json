I think she's not understanding what I'm saying or is naive about parenthood.\n\nI told her that there's no way when we have children that we will be able to split the load completely evenly. There are biological components to motherhood that come into play, like maternal instincts and post partum bonding and such, that require the mother to spend more time with the child immediately after birth. Additionally, because of this, it is often more likely feasible for the mother to stay home or at least be the primary parent for the child, in addition to economic factors that usually result in the man being the breadwinner and the woman being the primary parent. Thus, odds are, she will be the primary parent for our children for a variety of reasons, and there is no way we will be able to have a completely equal split. \n\nShe told me she will not have a child with a man who does not agree to split the work evenly, while I am arguing that it is not possible, particularly right after birth but also down the line. She is reconsidering our relationship now and I need to know if I'm being the asshole or being logical.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for stating that fatherhood and motherhood are fundamentally different, leading to an argument with his girlfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the core of the issue. The author argues that due to biological factors like maternal instincts and postpartum bonding, it's not feasible for the load of parenting to be split evenly. He also mentions economic factors where the man is typically the breadwinner. The girlfriend, however, refuses to have a child with someone who doesn't agree to an equal split.\n\nSo, is the author wrong? Let's break it down. The author is making a claim based on traditional gender roles and biological factors. But here's the thing: modern discussions around parenting often emphasize shared responsibility. The idea that mothers must be the primary parent is rooted in historical and societal norms, not necessarily biological determinism. Many people now argue that while biology plays a role, societal structures and personal choices can shape parenting roles more equitably.\n\nThe author's statement might come off as reinforcing outdated gender roles. By suggesting that the mother should naturally take on more responsibility, he might be dismissing the possibility of shared parenting or the father taking a more active role. This could be seen as not supporting the girlfriend's desire for equality. The girlfriend's stance is about mutual agreement on equal sharing, which is a valid perspective in the context of modern relationships.\n\nHowever, the author's point about practical challenges (like postpartum bonding) isn't entirely baseless. Physically, childbirth is a female experience, which might make the initial bonding period different. But that doesn't mean the mother must be the primary parent indefinitely. The author's argument that it's impossible to split the load evenly could be seen as rigid, not considering the flexibility of modern parenting approaches.\n\nThe key here is the assumption that equality means an exact 50/50 split, which might not be realistic, but the girlfriend is looking for a commitment to shared responsibility. The author's stance might be more about expecting the mother to take the lead, which could be the root of the conflict. \n\nIn terms of fairness, it's a matter of perspective. If the girlfriend values equality in parenting and the author is unwilling to commit to that, it's a valid reason for her to reconsider the relationship. The author might not be \"in the wrong\" factually (as there are biological aspects), but socially, he's not accommodating the girlfriend's values, which is a relational issue.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong from a relational standpoint, even if his statements have some factual basis. The answer would likely be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because his approach seems to reinforce traditional gender roles and doesn't fully support his partner's vision of equality.\n"
