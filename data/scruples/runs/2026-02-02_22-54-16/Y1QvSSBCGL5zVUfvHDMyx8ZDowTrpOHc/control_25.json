I think she's not understanding what I'm saying or is naive about parenthood.\n\nI told her that there's no way when we have children that we will be able to split the load completely evenly. There are biological components to motherhood that come into play, like maternal instincts and post partum bonding and such, that require the mother to spend more time with the child immediately after birth. Additionally, because of this, it is often more likely feasible for the mother to stay home or at least be the primary parent for the child, in addition to economic factors that usually result in the man being the breadwinner and the woman being the primary parent. Thus, odds are, she will be the primary parent for our children for a variety of reasons, and there is no way we will be able to have a completely equal split. \n\nShe told me she will not have a child with a man who does not agree to split the work evenly, while I am arguing that it is not possible, particularly right after birth but also down the line. She is reconsidering our relationship now and I need to know if I'm being the asshole or being logical.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the author of this situation is in the wrong. Let me try to break it down.\n\nThe author is a guy who told his girlfriend that fatherhood and motherhood are fundamentally different. He's saying that they can't split parenting duties equally because of biological factors like maternal instincts and postpartum bonding. He also mentions economic factors where men are often the breadwinners. His girlfriend is upset and considering ending the relationship because she wants an equal split, and she thinks he's not on board with that.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the arguments from both sides. The author is making a point based on biological and societal factors. He's not saying he won't help; he's saying it's not possible to split 50-50. But his girlfriend sees this as a refusal to share the load equally, which is her dealbreaker.\n\nNow, is the author wrong? Well, making assumptions about gender roles based on biology can be problematic. While there are biological differences (like postpartum), those don't necessarily dictate how parenting should be structured. Modern relationships are moving towards more equality, and assuming the woman must be the primary parent can be seen as outdated or dismissive of the woman's choices and capabilities.\n\nAlso, the author's argument might be based on traditional roles rather than acknowledging that both partners can adapt and share responsibilities. Even if there are biological factors, the key point is about equality in the partnership. If the girlfriend feels her partner doesn't support shared parenting from the start, that's a valid concern. The author's stance could undermine her autonomy and the idea that they can work together to find a solution.\n\nSo, even if the author thinks he's being logical, his approach might come off as dismissive of her needs and expectations. The girlfriend is setting a boundary here, which is important. The author's argument assumes a fixed role that might not align with the girlfriend's values. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong because he's not being flexible or supportive of her desire for an equal partnership.\n"
