I think she's not understanding what I'm saying or is naive about parenthood.\n\nI told her that there's no way when we have children that we will be able to split the load completely evenly. There are biological components to motherhood that come into play, like maternal instincts and post partum bonding and such, that require the mother to spend more time with the child immediately after birth. Additionally, because of this, it is often more likely feasible for the mother to stay home or at least be the primary parent for the child, in addition to economic factors that usually result in the man being the breadwinner and the woman being the primary parent. Thus, odds are, she will be the primary parent for our children for a variety of reasons, and there is no way we will be able to have a completely equal split. \n\nShe told me she will not have a child with a man who does not agree to split the work evenly, while I am arguing that it is not possible, particularly right after birth but also down the line. She is reconsidering our relationship now and I need to know if I'm being the asshole or being logical.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person is in the wrong for telling their girlfriend that fatherhood and motherhood are fundamentally different. The situation is about future parenting plans.\n\nFirst, the author's argument is based on biological factors like maternal instincts, postpartum bonding, and economic reasons where the man is typically the breadwinner. They argue that an equal split isn't feasible, especially after birth. The girlfriend, however, refuses to have children with someone who doesn't agree to split work evenly.\n\nI need to consider both sides. The author is making a point about reality and practical considerations. But maybe they're reinforcing traditional gender roles? The key here is whether the author's statement is a logical observation or if it's dismissing the girlfriend's valid expectations.\n\nThe author says there's a biological component, which is a common argument. However, modern perspectives often emphasize that while biology plays a role, societal expectations and personal choices are also significant. The author's assertion that the mother will likely be the primary parent due to economic factors might be based on current trends but doesn't account for changing norms or the possibility of shared responsibilities.\n\nThe girlfriend's stance is about equality and mutual agreement. If she wants an equal split, the author's refusal to commit to that might undermine her values. The author is being realistic, but maybe not flexible enough. The problem arises if the author is using biology as an excuse to avoid commitment to shared parenting, rather than being open to negotiation.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It depends on whether their argument is based on facts they can't control or if they're making a choice to avoid responsibility. If they're being honest about their beliefs but are unwilling to adapt, that could be an issue. The girlfriend has the right to set boundaries based on her expectations, so if the author isn't willing to meet her halfway, he might be in the wrong. But if he's just stating his views without pushing for unequal roles, maybe not. The line is thin here. I'm leaning towards the author being in the wrong because they're dismissing the possibility of equal partnership despite valid reasons for the girlfriend's stance.\n"
