I think she's not understanding what I'm saying or is naive about parenthood.\n\nI told her that there's no way when we have children that we will be able to split the load completely evenly. There are biological components to motherhood that come into play, like maternal instincts and post partum bonding and such, that require the mother to spend more time with the child immediately after birth. Additionally, because of this, it is often more likely feasible for the mother to stay home or at least be the primary parent for the child, in addition to economic factors that usually result in the man being the breadwinner and the woman being the primary parent. Thus, odds are, she will be the primary parent for our children for a variety of reasons, and there is no way we will be able to have a completely equal split. \n\nShe told me she will not have a child with a man who does not agree to split the work evenly, while I am arguing that it is not possible, particularly right after birth but also down the line. She is reconsidering our relationship now and I need to know if I'm being the asshole or being logical.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong for stating that fatherhood and motherhood are fundamentally different in terms of responsibilities, especially regarding child-rearing. The girlfriend is upset because she wants an equal split in parenting duties, but the author argues that it's not feasible due to biological and economic factors.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the arguments from both sides. The author's main points are about maternal instincts, postpartum bonding, and the feasibility of the mother being the primary caregiver. They also mention economic factors where the man is typically the breadwinner. The girlfriend's stance is that she won't have a child with someone who doesn't agree to an equal split.\n\nThe key here is whether the author's statements are factually accurate and whether they dismissed their partner's feelings. The author is making a generalization based on biological and societal norms, but individual circumstances can vary. For example, not all mothers feel the same about staying home, and many couples do manage to share responsibilities equally. The author's assertion that an equal split is impossible might be seen as dismissive of their partner's perspective and the possibility of working together to find a solution that suits both of them.\n\nAdditionally, the author's statement might be contributing to reinforcing gender roles, which the girlfriend is clearly against. Even if there are biological factors, the emphasis on the mother as the primary caregiver can overlook the potential for shared responsibilities. The author's approach might come across as inflexible, not considering that their partner's expectation is important for her sense of equality and partnership in the relationship.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is trying to be realistic about potential challenges, but the way they communicate this could be problematic. Instead of focusing on the impossibility of equality, they might have approached the conversation with more empathy and openness to finding a middle ground. The girlfriend's reaction indicates that her desire for equality is a non-negotiable for her, which the author didn't seem to respect by insisting on their viewpoint.\n\nSo, weighing these factors, the author might be in the wrong because they didn't validate their partner's feelings and expectations, and their argument could be perpetuating traditional gender roles. The answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
