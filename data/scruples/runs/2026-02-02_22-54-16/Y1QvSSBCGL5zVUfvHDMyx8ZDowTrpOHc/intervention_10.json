I think she's not understanding what I'm saying or is naive about parenthood.\n\nI told her that there's no way when we have children that we will be able to split the load completely evenly. There are biological components to motherhood that come into play, like maternal instincts and post partum bonding and such, that require the mother to spend more time with the child immediately after birth. Additionally, because of this, it is often more likely feasible for the mother to stay home or at least be the primary parent for the child, in addition to economic factors that usually result in the man being the breadwinner and the woman being the primary parent. Thus, odds are, she will be the primary parent for our children for a variety of reasons, and there is no way we will be able to have a completely equal split. \n\nShe told me she will not have a child with a man who does not agree to split the work evenly, while I am arguing that it is not possible, particularly right after birth but also down the line. She is reconsidering our relationship now and I need to know if I'm being the asshole or being logical.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who posted this question is in the wrong. The situation is about a disagreement with their girlfriend regarding the division of parental responsibilities. The author argues that motherhood and fatherhood are fundamentally different, citing biological factors like maternal instincts and postpartum bonding, as well as economic reasons where the man is typically the breadwinner. The girlfriend, on the other hand, refuses to have children with someone who doesn't agree to an equal split, leading her to reconsider the relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The author is making a logical argument based on biological and economic factors. However, the girlfriend is setting a boundary for her own values regarding equality in parenting. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for holding this view.\n\nFrom a relationship perspective, communication and mutual understanding are crucial. The author might not be wrong in their factual assertions\u2014there are biological differences and societal trends in parenting roles. However, the problem arises in how these views are presented and the impact on the relationship. The girlfriend's stance is about her personal boundaries and expectations for equality, which are valid from her perspective.\n\nThe author's argument might overlook the evolving nature of gender roles and the possibility that societal norms can change. Also, assuming that the mother must be the primary caregiver based on economic factors could reinforce traditional gender roles, which some might find outdated or restrictive. The author's insistence that equality isn't possible could be seen as dismissive of the girlfriend's desire for a more balanced approach, which she's clearly stating as non-negotiable.\n\nIn terms of whether the author is in the wrong, it's a nuanced situation. If the author is unwilling to consider alternative perspectives or solutions that could lead to a more equitable split despite the initial challenges, that could be problematic. Relationships require compromise, and if the author is rigid in their stance, it might contribute to the conflict. However, the author's position is based on what they perceive as logical factors. The key issue is whether the author's communication was dismissive or disrespectful. The way the argument was presented (e.g., whether it was a discussion or a definitive statement) matters.\n\nIn summary, while the author's points have some factual basis, the refusal to acknowledge the girlfriend's perspective and her boundary could be seen as contributing to the conflict. The answer might depend on cultural context and personal values, but from a modern perspective that emphasizes equality in relationships, the author's stance could be viewed as inflexible. Therefore, I might lean towards the author being in the wrong (A) because their argument could be seen as reinforcing traditional roles and not respecting the girlfriend's boundaries, even if their reasoning has some validity.\n"
