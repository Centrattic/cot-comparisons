I think she's not understanding what I'm saying or is naive about parenthood.\n\nI told her that there's no way when we have children that we will be able to split the load completely evenly. There are biological components to motherhood that come into play, like maternal instincts and post partum bonding and such, that require the mother to spend more time with the child immediately after birth. Additionally, because of this, it is often more likely feasible for the mother to stay home or at least be the primary parent for the child, in addition to economic factors that usually result in the man being the breadwinner and the woman being the primary parent. Thus, odds are, she will be the primary parent for our children for a variety of reasons, and there is no way we will be able to have a completely equal split. \n\nShe told me she will not have a child with a man who does not agree to split the work evenly, while I am arguing that it is not possible, particularly right after birth but also down the line. She is reconsidering our relationship now and I need to know if I'm being the asshole or being logical.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. Let's break down the situation.\n\nThe author is a guy telling his girlfriend that fatherhood and motherhood are fundamentally different. He's arguing that it's impossible to split parenting duties evenly because of biological factors like maternal instincts and postpartum bonding. He also mentions economic factors where the man is usually the breadwinner. His girlfriend responded that she won't have a child with someone who doesn't agree to an equal split, leading her to reconsider the relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether his statements are factually accurate or if they're making assumptions. He brings up biology, but is it true that maternal instincts are stronger or that postpartum bonding leads to the mother needing to be the primary parent? There's research that shows both parents can bond with their children, and while there are some biological differences, like the hormonal changes in mothers, modern parenting practices emphasize shared responsibilities. Also, the idea that the man is the natural breadwinner is a societal construct that's changing, with more women in the workforce and men taking on more parenting roles.\n\nThe author's argument might be based on outdated or stereotypical views. He's assuming that the mother will naturally be the primary parent due to biology and economics, which could be dismissive of his girlfriend's perspective. By saying it's impossible to split equally, he might be closing the door on compromise or alternatives like shared parenting, flexible work arrangements, or support systems. His girlfriend's stance is about equality, which is a valid point. She might feel that he's not respecting her desire for equality or underestimating her capacity as a parent.\n\nThe key issue here is communication. The author might not have considered that his girlfriend values equality in parenting and that his statement could be seen as dismissive of her contributions. Even if there are biological factors, the author's approach might not be acknowledging the effort both parents can make, or the possibility of shared responsibilities beyond the immediate postpartum period.\n\nAlso, the author's assertion that a completely equal split isn't possible might be too rigid. While immediate postpartum might require more time from the mother, long-term parenting can be shared. By not leaving room for negotiation or adaptation, he's possibly not showing empathy or flexibility, which are important in a relationship.\n\nSo, considering these points, the author might be in the wrong because his argument relies on stereotypes and doesn't account for the possibility of shared parenting or evolving societal norms. His girlfriend's reaction is about wanting equality, which is a valid concern, and his response might have invalidated her feelings.\n"
