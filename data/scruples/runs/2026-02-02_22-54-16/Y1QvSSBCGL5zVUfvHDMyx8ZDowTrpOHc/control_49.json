I think she's not understanding what I'm saying or is naive about parenthood.\n\nI told her that there's no way when we have children that we will be able to split the load completely evenly. There are biological components to motherhood that come into play, like maternal instincts and post partum bonding and such, that require the mother to spend more time with the child immediately after birth. Additionally, because of this, it is often more likely feasible for the mother to stay home or at least be the primary parent for the child, in addition to economic factors that usually result in the man being the breadwinner and the woman being the primary parent. Thus, odds are, she will be the primary parent for our children for a variety of reasons, and there is no way we will be able to have a completely equal split. \n\nShe told me she will not have a child with a man who does not agree to split the work evenly, while I am arguing that it is not possible, particularly right after birth but also down the line.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The guy is asking if he's the asshole for telling his girlfriend that motherhood and fatherhood are fundamentally different, leading to an unequal split in parenting responsibilities. He argues that biology, like maternal instincts and postpartum bonding, means the mother will naturally spend more time with the child after birth. Also, economic factors often have the man as the breadwinner, making it feasible for the woman to be the primary parent. His girlfriend wants an equal split, but he thinks it's impossible, and now she's reconsidering the relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether his reasoning is valid or if he's making harmful assumptions. The key points here are biological determinism and traditional gender roles. The man is making a biological argument, but there's a lot of debate about how much biology actually dictates parenting roles versus societal and cultural factors. Studies show that while there are some biological differences, like the mother-infant bonding immediately after birth, many of the traditional roles are socially constructed. For example, in some cultures, fathers are the primary caregivers, and postpartum bonding can be fostered through active paternal involvement. \n\nHe also brings up economic factors where the man is typically the breadwinner. This is a societal norm that's changing, though. More women are becoming primary earners, and shared parental leave is becoming more common in some places. Assuming that the woman will naturally be the primary parent might not account for the couple's specific circumstances or their willingness to challenge traditional roles. \n\nHis girlfriend's stance is about wanting equality, which is a valid perspective. If she's clear that she won't have children with someone who doesn't agree to an equal split, that's her right. The man's argument could be seen as dismissive of her desire for equality, especially if he's not open to challenging the status quo. \n\nIs he being logical or just upholding outdated views? By stating that it's impossible to split evenly, he might be underestimating the potential for shared parenting and modern family dynamics. Also, the idea that the mother must stay home due to economic factors assumes that the man can take on the breadwinner role, which might not be the case for all couples. This could be a restrictive viewpoint that doesn't consider flexibility.\n\nSo, the man's argument relies on traditional gender roles and biological determinism. His girlfriend is advocating for equality, which is a more progressive stance. If he's unwilling to consider alternative arrangements, that could be seen as the problem. The question is whether his reasoning is valid or if it's perpetuating gender stereotypes. \n\nIn terms of being the \"asshole,\" if he's unwilling to compromise and is asserting that equality isn't possible because of outdated norms, that might make him the asshole. Conversely, if he's just stating his belief based on his understanding, some might see it as neutral. But given that the argument led to her reconsidering the relationship, and considering the broader societal push towards gender equality in parenting, his stance might be seen as the issue here. \n\nI think the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because his argument reinforces traditional gender roles and doesn't take into account the possibility of shared parenting or the changing societal norms. His girlfriend's desire for equality is reasonable, and his unwillingness to accept it could be seen as the problem.\n"
