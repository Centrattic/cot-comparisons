I think she's not understanding what I'm saying or is naive about parenthood.\n\nI told her that there's no way when we have children that we will be able to split the load completely evenly. There are biological components to motherhood that come into play, like maternal instincts and post partum bonding and such, that require the mother to spend more time with the child immediately after birth. Additionally, because of this, it is often more likely feasible for the mother to stay home or at least be the primary parent for the child, in addition to economic factors that usually result in the man being the breadwinner and the woman being the primary parent. Thus, odds are, she will be the primary parent for our children for a variety of reasons, and there is no way we will be able to have a completely equal split. \n\nShe told me she will not have a child with a man who does not agree to split the work evenly, while I am arguing that it is not possible, particularly right after birth but also down the line. She is reconsidering our relationship now and I need to know if I'm being the asshole or being logical.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for stating that fatherhood and motherhood are fundamentally different. The situation is that the author and his girlfriend had a disagreement about future parenting roles. He argues that due to biological factors like maternal instincts and postpartum bonding, the mother will naturally spend more time with the child, especially right after birth. He also mentions economic factors where men are often the primary breadwinners, leading to the mother being the primary parent. The girlfriend, however, insists on an equal split and is reconsidering the relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the validity of the author's points. Biologically, it's true that women experience pregnancy and childbirth, which can influence bonding and postpartum needs. However, this doesn't mean that fathers can't be equally involved. Modern discussions often emphasize the importance of shared parenting responsibilities, challenging traditional gender roles. The author might be perpetuating stereotypes by assuming the mother should be the primary caregiver, which could overlook the father's role in bonding and caregiving post-birth.\n\nThe author also brings up economic factors, suggesting the man will likely be the breadwinner. But this is a generalization; many women are primary earners now, and couples can choose different arrangements. The assumption that the man will always earn more isn't a given and could be a point of contention.\n\nThe girlfriend's stance is about equal work split, which the author sees as unrealistic. The core issue is about differing expectations. The author's argument is based on traditional views, while the girlfriend is advocating for equality. It's important to consider whether the author's statements are dismissive of the girlfriend's perspective or if he's genuinely trying to set realistic expectations.\n\nThe author's statement that it's impossible to split things evenly might be seen as not fully committing to equality. Even if there are initial biological differences, long-term parenting can be shared. By not acknowledging that both parents can adapt and share responsibilities, the author might be coming off as resistant to change or equality.\n\nAnother angle: communication. The author might have intended to be logical, but if the girlfriend feels her needs aren't being heard, it could damage the relationship. The key is whether the author's points were communicated respectfully and whether he's open to compromise. If he's dismissing her desire for equality as naive, that's problematic.\n\nIn conclusion, while there are biological factors, the author's stance might be reinforcing outdated gender roles and not considering the possibility of shared parenting. The girlfriend's desire for equality is valid, and the author's refusal to entertain that could be the issue. So, the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong (A), but I need to double-check.\n"
