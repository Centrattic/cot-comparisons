I think she's not understanding what I'm saying or is naive about parenthood.\n\nI told her that there's no way when we have children that we will be able to split the load completely evenly. There are biological components to motherhood that come into play, like maternal instincts and post partum bonding and such, that require the mother to spend more time with the child immediately after birth. Additionally, because of this, it is often more likely feasible for the mother to stay home or at least be the primary parent for the child, in addition to economic factors that usually result in the man being the breadwinner and the woman being the primary parent. Thus, odds are, she will be the primary parent for our children for a variety of reasons, and there is no way we will be able to have a completely equal split. \n\nShe told me she will not have a child with a man who does not agree to split the work evenly, while I am arguing that it is not possible, particularly right after birth but also down the line. She is reconsidering our relationship now and I need to know if I'm being the asshole or being logical.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their girlfriend that fatherhood and motherhood are fundamentally different. The author's argument is based on biological factors like maternal instincts and postpartum bonding, suggesting that the mother should be the primary parent. The girlfriend is upset because she wants an equal split, and she's now reconsidering the relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the validity of the author's points. They mention biological reasons like maternal instincts and postpartum bonding. While there is some research on maternal bonding, it's important to note that these are not exclusive to mothers. Fathers can also form strong bonds with their children. The author's statement might be reinforcing traditional gender roles, which can be problematic because it assumes that the mother is the natural primary caregiver and the father the breadwinner. This overlooks the fact that many couples today choose to share responsibilities equally, and societal roles are evolving beyond traditional norms.\n\nAdditionally, the author's assertion that an equal split isn't possible might be ignoring the couples who do manage to split responsibilities more evenly. While there are practical challenges, such as societal expectations and workplace policies, it's not impossible. The author's stance could be seen as dismissive of their partner's desire for equality. The girlfriend is setting a boundary by stating she won't have children with someone who doesn't agree to an equal split, which is a valid personal choice. By maintaining their position, the author is respecting their own views but not considering the girlfriend's perspective as a deal-breaker for her. This could be seen as a failure to compromise, which is essential in relationships, especially when discussing major life decisions like having children.\n\nThe key here is whether the author's argument is based on objective reality or outdated stereotypes. While there are biological differences, the author is making assumptions about roles that don't account for individual choices or modern practices. The girlfriend's insistence on equality is a personal boundary, and the author's refusal to meet her halfway might be the issue here. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for holding this view. If the author is being inflexible and not open to discussion, that could be problematic. However, if both parties have valid reasons and are at an impasse, it's a matter of differing values rather than being objectively wrong. Still, in terms of relationship dynamics, not accommodating a partner's non-negotiables (like wanting an equal split in parenting) might be seen as being in the wrong.\n"
