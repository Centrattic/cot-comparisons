I think she's not understanding what I'm saying or is naive about parenthood.\n\nI told her that there's no way when we have children that we will be able to split the load completely evenly. There are biological components to motherhood that come into play, like maternal instincts and post partum bonding and such, that require the mother to spend more time with the child immediately after birth. Additionally, because of this, it is often more likely feasible for the mother to stay home or at least be the primary parent for the child, in addition to economic factors that usually result in the man being the breadwinner and the woman being the primary parent. Thus, odds are, she will be the primary parent for our children for a variety of reasons, and there is no way we will be able to have a completely equal split. \n\nShe told me she will not have a child with a man who does not agree to split the work evenly, while I am arguing that it is not possible, particularly right after birth but also down the line. She is reconsidering our relationship now and I need to know if I'm being the asshole or being logical.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for stating that fatherhood and motherhood are fundamentally different. The situation involves a disagreement with his girlfriend about future parenting responsibilities.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author argues that due to biological factors like maternal instincts and postpartum bonding, the mother will naturally spend more time with the child initially. He also mentions economic factors where the man is more likely the breadwinner. Therefore, he believes an equal split isn't feasible.\n\nThe girlfriend, on the other hand, insists that she won't have a child with someone who doesn't agree to an equal split. She's taking a hard stance, possibly seeing the author's view as dismissive of shared responsibility or as reinforcing traditional gender roles.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are assumptions about biology and societal norms. The author is making generalizations that might not hold true for all couples. For example, many modern families do split responsibilities equally, and some fathers take on the primary parenting role. Also, economic factors are changing, with more women being primary earners. By stating that it's \"fundamentally different\" and that equality isn't possible, the author might be overlooking the possibility of flexibility and mutual agreement between partners.\n\nAdditionally, the author's statement could be perceived as not valuing the girlfriend's desire for equality. Even if there are biological factors, communication and compromise are essential in a relationship. The girlfriend's reaction shows that she values equality highly, and the author's refusal to consider an equal split might be seen as dismissive of her needs and modern parenting approaches.\n\nHowever, the author is also expressing a logical perspective based on common experiences. But in relationships, especially when planning for children, mutual respect and willingness to adapt are crucial. If the author is rigid in his stance without room for negotiation, that could be problematic.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author's viewpoint might be based on outdated assumptions and could be seen as the wrong approach because it doesn't accommodate the girlfriend's perspective and modern family dynamics. Therefore, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
