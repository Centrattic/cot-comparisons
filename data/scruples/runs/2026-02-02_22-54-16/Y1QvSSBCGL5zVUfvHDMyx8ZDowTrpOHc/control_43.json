I think she's not understanding what I'm saying or is naive about parenthood.\n\nI told her that there's no way when we have children that we will be able to split the load completely evenly. There are biological components to motherhood that come into play, like maternal instincts and post partum bonding and such, that require the mother to spend more time with the child immediately after birth. Additionally, because of this, it is often more likely feasible for the mother to stay home or at least be the primary parent for the child, in addition to economic factors that usually result in the man being the breadwinner and the woman being the primary parent. Thus, odds are, she will be the primary parent for our children for a variety of reasons, and there is no way we will be able to have a completely equal split. \n\nShe told me she will not have a child with a man who does not agree to split the work evenly, while I am arguing that it is not possible, particularly right after birth but also down the line. She is reconsidering our relationship now and I need to know if I'm being the asshole or being logical.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the question is in the wrong. The scenario is about a disagreement between him and his girlfriend regarding the division of parental responsibilities.\n\nFirst, he's saying that motherhood and fatherhood are fundamentally different because of biological factors like maternal instincts and postpartum bonding. He argues that it's not feasible to split the parenting duties equally because the mother would naturally spend more time with the child after birth. He also mentions economic factors where the man is typically the breadwinner, leading to the mother being the primary parent. His girlfriend, however, insists that she won't have children with someone who doesn't agree to an equal split, and now she's rethinking the relationship.\n\nNow, I need to determine if the author is in the wrong. Let me break down the key points. The author is making a case based on biological and economic factors. However, there are several issues here. First, the assumption that maternal instincts are stronger is a common stereotype but isn't universally accepted. Modern parenting often emphasizes shared responsibility, and many studies show that both parents can be equally involved, regardless of biology. The idea that the mother must be the primary parent due to biology might be outdated and overlooks the importance of shared parenting. Also, the economic argument about the man being the breadwinner is a traditional view that doesn't reflect the reality for many couples today where both partners work and share parenting duties. \n\nThe author's stance might come off as dismissive of his partner's wishes and potentially reinforcing gender stereotypes. By insisting that equality isn't possible, he's not showing flexibility or willingness to adapt. The fact that his partner has a strong stance on equal splitting suggests that this is a non-negotiable issue for her. If he's unwilling to meet her halfway or consider alternative arrangements, it might be seen as inflexible.\n\nOn the other hand, he's trying to be realistic about biological factors. But even if there are initial challenges, that doesn't mean equality isn't achievable over time. Partners can plan for that, like hiring help or adjusting work schedules. His inflexibility could be the problem here. Relationships require compromise, and if he's rigid in his views without considering her perspective, that's where he might be wrong.\n\nSo, considering the points, the author might be in the wrong because he's relying on outdated stereotypes, not being open to shared parenting, and dismissing his partner's important boundary. Therefore, the answer would be A (yes, he's in the wrong).\n"
