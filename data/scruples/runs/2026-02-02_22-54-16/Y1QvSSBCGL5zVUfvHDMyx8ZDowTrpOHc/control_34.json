I think she's not understanding what I'm saying or is naive about parenthood.\n\nI told her that there's no way when we have children that we will be able to split the load completely evenly. There are biological components to motherhood that come into play, like maternal instincts and post partum bonding and such, that require the mother to spend more time with the child immediately after birth. Additionally, because of this, it is often more likely feasible for the mother to stay home or at least be the primary parent for the child, in addition to economic factors that usually result in the man being the breadwinner and the woman being the primary parent. Thus, odds are, she will be the primary parent for our children for a variety of reasons, and there is no way we will be able to have a completely equal split. \n\nShe told me she will not have a child with a man who does not agree to split the work evenly, while I am arguing that it is not possible, particularly right after birth but also down the line. She is reconsidering our relationship now and I need to know if I'm being the asshole or being logical.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a disagreement between a couple about the feasibility of splitting parenting responsibilities equally. The author argues that due to biological factors like maternal instincts and postpartum bonding, along with economic factors where the man is the breadwinner, it's not possible to split the load evenly. His girlfriend, however, insists that she won't have a child with someone who doesn't agree to an equal split.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the validity of the author's points. He mentions biological components such as maternal instincts and postpartum bonding. However, it's worth noting that while some people might experience strong maternal instincts, these are not exclusive to women and can vary widely among individuals. Additionally, postpartum bonding can involve both parents, and modern parenting often emphasizes shared responsibility from the start. The author also brings up economic factors, but this can be a societal issue rather than an inherent biological one. Many couples do share responsibilities, and the idea that men are always the primary breadwinners is becoming less common with more women in the workforce.\n\nThe girlfriend's stance is clear: she believes in equal sharing and sees the author's position as not accepting that. The author is arguing it's not feasible, but maybe he's making assumptions about what is possible. The question is whether his statements are based on valid points or if they're making generalizations that could be seen as dismissive of the girlfriend's perspective.\n\nThe author's assertion that it's \"not possible\" to split work evenly might be too absolute. While there are challenges, many couples do manage to share responsibilities, and the author's approach might be underestimating the potential for flexibility and compromise. By not acknowledging that the division can be more balanced despite initial challenges, he might be coming off as rigid. The girlfriend's reaction is serious, but her stance is about her personal values regarding equality in parenting.\n\nIt's also important to consider gender roles and societal norms. The author's argument might be based on traditional views that women are naturally primary caregivers, which can be a controversial stance. The girlfriend could perceive this as a refusal to adapt to modern, more egalitarian parenting models. The author's statement about the mother \"being the primary parent\" could be seen as reinforcing stereotypes, which might be why she's reconsidering the relationship.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the key point is whether the author's argument is dismissive of the girlfriend's needs and expectations. If the author is unwilling to consider that a more equal split is possible, even if not perfectly 50/50, then he might be in the wrong. The girlfriend's insistence on equality is her right, and if the author can't meet her expectations, that's a valid reason for her to reevaluate the relationship.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author's position seems to rely on assumptions that may not hold in reality or that perpetuate traditional gender roles. The girlfriend's reaction is a response to his unwillingness to consider alternative approaches. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not being open to the possibility of shared parenting beyond initial challenges.\n"
