I think she's not understanding what I'm saying or is naive about parenthood.\n\nI told her that there's no way when we have children that we will be able to split the load completely evenly. There are biological components to motherhood that come into play, like maternal instincts and post partum bonding and such, that require the mother to spend more time with the child immediately after birth. Additionally, because of this, it is often more likely feasible for the mother to stay home or at least be the primary parent for the child, in addition to economic factors that usually result in the man being the breadwinner and the woman being the primary parent. Thus, odds are, she will be the primary parent for our children for a variety of reasons, and there is no way we will be able to have a completely equal split. \n\nShe told me she will not have a child with a man who does not agree to split the work evenly, while I am arguing that it is not possible, particularly right after birth but also down the line. She is reconsidering our relationship now and I need to know if I'm being the asshole or being logical.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong. The situation is about a disagreement between a couple about splitting parental responsibilities equally. The author argues that motherhood and fatherhood are fundamentally different, citing biological factors like maternal instincts, postpartum bonding, and the traditional role of the mother as the primary caregiver. The girlfriend, on the other hand, insists that she won't have children with someone who doesn't agree to an equal split.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the arguments from both sides. The author's main points are based on biological differences and traditional roles. They mention things like maternal instincts and postpartum bonding, which are biological realities. They also bring up economic factors where the man is typically the breadwinner. However, there's a shift happening in many societies towards more equal sharing of parental duties, and economic roles are changing too. \n\nThe girlfriend's stance is that she expects an equal split. That's a valid perspective for many people, especially those who value gender equality and shared responsibilities. The author's argument might be seen as reinforcing traditional gender roles, which some might find outdated or restrictive. Even if there are biological factors, modern parenting often emphasizes partnership and shared responsibility regardless of gender. \n\nThe key here is whether the author's statement is inherently wrong. The author isn't saying they won't help; they're saying it's not feasible to split equally. But the girlfriend is taking a firm stance that equality is necessary. The author's argument might not account for the possibility of adapting roles beyond traditional expectations. For example, maybe the woman could work part-time, or they could hire help, or use other support systems. The author's rigid stance might not leave room for flexibility or negotiation. \n\nAlso, there's the aspect of communication. The author might have expressed their views in a way that dismissed the girlfriend's expectations without considering alternative solutions. If the author's position is that the split can't be equal, but the girlfriend's condition is that it must be equal, then a conflict arises. The author might be failing to see that the girlfriend's demand is about equality in effort, not necessarily a 50/50 split. Maybe she expects both partners to contribute as much as they can, even if roles differ. \n\nAnother angle is that the author's argument could be seen as making assumptions about biological roles that might not align with the girlfriend's values. If she believes in equal partnership regardless of traditional roles, then the author's stance might be perceived as not respecting her values. This could lead to incompatibility in their approach to parenting. \n\nIn terms of being \"in the wrong,\" it's about whether the author's statements were reasonable and respectful. Asserting that equality isn't possible might come off as dismissive of her perspective. Even if there are biological factors, the author could have approached the discussion with more openness to find a middle ground. The girlfriend has the right to set boundaries based on her values, and if the author's position is non-negotiable, that could be a deal-breaker for her.\n\nSo, considering all these points, the author's argument might not be factually incorrect, but their approach could be seen as rigid and not accommodating the girlfriend's values. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not being open to alternative viewpoints and for making assumptions that conflict with the girlfriend's expectations.\n"
