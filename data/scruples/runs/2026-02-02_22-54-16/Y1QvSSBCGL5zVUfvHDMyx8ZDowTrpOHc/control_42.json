I think she's not understanding what I'm saying or is naive about parenthood.\n\nI told her that there's no way when we have children that we will be able to split the load completely evenly. There are biological components to motherhood that come into play, like maternal instincts and post partum bonding and such, that require the mother to spend more time with the child immediately after birth. Additionally, because of this, it is often more likely feasible for the mother to stay home or at least be the primary parent for the child, in addition to economic factors that usually result in the man being the breadwinner and the woman being the primary parent. Thus, odds are, she will be the primary parent for our children for a variety of reasons, and there is no way we will be able to have a completely equal split. \n\nShe told me she will not have a child with a man who does not agree to split the work evenly, while I am arguing that it is not possible, particularly right after birth but also down the line. She is reconsidering our relationship now and I need to know if I'm being the asshole or being logical.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a disagreement between a couple regarding fatherhood and motherhood. The author argues that it's not possible to split parenting responsibilities equally due to biological factors and traditional roles. The girlfriend is considering ending the relationship because she wants an equal split.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the author's statements. He's making biological claims about maternal instincts and postpartum bonding. But is that accurate? Modern research shows that bonding isn't exclusive to mothers. Also, the idea that men should be breadwinners and women primary caregivers is a traditional view that many challenge today. The author assumes roles based on gender, which might be outdated.\n\nHe's also framing things as if equality is impossible, which could be dismissive of the girlfriend's perspective. She wants equality, so his response might be seen as not respecting her values. Even if there are biological differences, societal roles are changing, and many couples manage shared responsibilities. His stance could be seen as rigid and not open to negotiation.\n\nThe key points are whether his arguments are valid and if his approach was respectful. By not acknowledging the possibility of equality and dismissing her stance, he might come off as inflexible. The girlfriend's reaction is about her boundaries; if he's unwilling to meet her expectations, she's within her rights to reconsider the relationship.\n\nSo, the answer is likely A (author is in the wrong) because his arguments rely on outdated assumptions and he wasn't open to compromise, which is a dealbreaker for her.\n"
