I think she's not understanding what I'm saying or is naive about parenthood.\n\nI told her that there's no way when we have children that we will be able to split the load completely evenly. There are biological components to motherhood that come into play, like maternal instincts and post partum bonding and such, that require the mother to spend more time with the child immediately after birth. Additionally, because of this, it is often more likely feasible for the mother to stay home or at least be the primary parent for the child, in addition to economic factors that usually result in the man being the breadwinner and the woman being the primary parent. Thus, odds are, she will be the primary parent for our children for a variety of reasons, and there is no way we will be able to have a completely equal split. \n\nShe told me she will not have a child with a man who does not agree to split the work evenly, while I am arguing that it is not possible, particularly right after birth but also down the line. She is reconsidering our relationship now and I need to know if I'm being the asshole or being logical.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling his girlfriend that fatherhood and motherhood are fundamentally different. The situation revolves around their future plans regarding having children and the division of parenting responsibilities.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the core of their disagreement. The author argues that it's not possible to split parenting duties evenly because of biological factors like maternal instincts, postpartum bonding, and economic reasons where men are often the breadwinners. The girlfriend, on the other hand, insists that she won't have a child with someone who doesn't agree to an equal split, leading her to reconsider the relationship.\n\nNow, I need to evaluate whether the author is in the wrong. The key points here are the assumptions he's making. The author is stating a generalization about gender roles in parenting, which might be based on traditional or outdated views. Modern perspectives increasingly emphasize shared parenting responsibilities regardless of gender. The girlfriend's stance seems to be based on the belief in equality in parenting, which is a valid and widely supported viewpoint.\n\nThe author's argument relies on biological determinism, suggesting that women are naturally inclined to be the primary caregivers. However, this overlooks the importance of choice, societal changes, and the fact that both parents can adapt to various roles. The economic argument also assumes traditional gender roles in income, which may not apply to all couples. \n\nThe author might be dismissive of his girlfriend's perspective, not recognizing that her demand for equality is a legitimate expectation. By not being open to alternative views, he could be contributing to the conflict. Additionally, the fact that their disagreement is causing her to reconsider the relationship indicates a significant misalignment in values regarding parenting, which can be a deal-breaker for some.\n\nSo, while the author might not be entirely incorrect in pointing out logistical challenges, his approach and the underlying assumptions could be seen as reinforcing stereotypes. The girlfriend's reaction is understandable if she values equality and shared responsibility, which are important in a mutual partnership. Therefore, the author's stance could be viewed as problematic, making him at least partially in the wrong.\n"
