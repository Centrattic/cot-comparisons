I think she's not understanding what I'm saying or is naive about parenthood.\n\nI told her that there's no way when we have children that we will be able to split the load completely evenly. There are biological components to motherhood that come into play, like maternal instincts and post partum bonding and such, that require the mother to spend more time with the child immediately after birth. Additionally, because of this, it is often more likely feasible for the mother to stay home or at least be the primary parent for the child, in addition to economic factors that usually result in the man being the breadwinner and the woman being the primary parent. Thus, odds are, she will be the primary parent for our children for a variety of reasons, and there is no way we will be able to have a completely equal split. \n\nShe told me she will not have a child with a man who does not agree to split the work evenly, while I am arguing that it is not possible, particularly right after birth but also down the line. She is reconsidering our relationship now and I need to know if I'm being the asshole or being logical.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a disagreement between a couple regarding the division of parental responsibilities.\n\nFirst, the author argues that fatherhood and motherhood are fundamentally different due to biological factors like maternal instincts, postpartum bonding, and the traditional economic roles where men are breadwinners and women are primary caregivers. They claim it's impossible to split parenting duties equally, especially right after birth and in the long term. The girlfriend, on the other hand, refuses to have children with someone who doesn't agree to an equal split.\n\nI need to consider both perspectives. The author is making a logical argument based on biological and societal factors. However, the girlfriend is asserting her right to equal partnership in parenting, which is a valid stance given modern discussions around gender equality and shared parenting. The question is whether the author's position is inherently wrong.\n\nThe key points here are assumptions about biology and traditional roles. The author assumes that mothers must take on more caregiving, which might be based on outdated or stereotypical views. Research shows that while there are biological differences like childbirth and lactation, societal roles are evolving, and many couples successfully share responsibilities. The author's statement that an equal split is impossible might be dismissive of the girlfriend's desire for equality and could be seen as rigid or not considering changing norms.\n\nAdditionally, the author's insistence that the mother will be the primary parent due to economic factors perpetuates the idea that men are the main earners, which isn't universally true anymore. This could be contributing to the girlfriend feeling her values aren't respected. The author's argument may lack flexibility and empathy, which are important in relationships.\n\nSo, while the author might see their stance as logical, it could be viewed as not aligning with the girlfriend's expectations for equality, leading to conflict. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not accommodating the girlfriend's perspective and for relying on traditional gender roles that may not reflect mutual goals for a partnership.\n"
