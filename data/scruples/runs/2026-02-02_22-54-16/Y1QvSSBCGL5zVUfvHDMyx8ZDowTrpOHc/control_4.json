I think she's not understanding what I'm saying or is naive about parenthood.\n\nI told her that there's no way when we have children that we will be able to split the load completely evenly. There are biological components to motherhood that come into play, like maternal instincts and post partum bonding and such, that require the mother to spend more time with the child immediately after birth. Additionally, because of this, it is often more likely feasible for the mother to stay home or at least be the primary parent for the child, in addition to economic factors that usually result in the man being the breadwinner and the woman being the primary parent. Thus, odds are, she will be the primary parent for our children for a variety of reasons, and there is no way we will be able to have a completely equal split. \n\nShe told me she will not have a child with a man who does not agree to split the work evenly, while I am arguing that it is not possible, particularly right after birth but also down the line. She is reconsidering our relationship now and I need to know if I'm being the asshole or being logical.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the question (the author) is in the wrong. The situation is about whether fatherhood and motherhood are fundamentally different, leading to a disagreement about splitting parenting responsibilities equally.\n\nFirst, the author is arguing that it's not possible to split parenting work evenly because of biological factors like maternal instincts and postpartum bonding. They also mention economic factors where men are more likely to be the breadwinners. The girlfriend, on the other hand, refuses to have children with someone who doesn't agree to an equal split, leading her to reconsider the relationship.\n\nSo, I need to determine if the author is being reasonable or if they're in the wrong. The key points here are assumptions about biological differences and traditional gender roles. The author is making claims about inherent differences between mothers and fathers in parenting, which might be based on stereotypes rather than evidence. Modern discussions often emphasize that while there are biological aspects (like mothers needing to recover from childbirth), the roles can be shared and are influenced by societal norms and individual choices. The author might be dismissing the idea that fathers can take on primary parenting roles, which some people believe is possible and necessary for equality.\n\nThe girlfriend's stance is that she wants equality, which is a valid perspective. The author's argument could be seen as reinforcing traditional gender roles, which the girlfriend is rejecting. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for making that argument. If the author is using biological determinism to justify unequal roles, that might be problematic. However, the author is stating their opinion based on their understanding of reality, not necessarily being malicious. \n\nBut relationships require mutual understanding and compromise. If the author isn't willing to consider that roles can be shared and that the primary parent doesn't have to be the mother, they might be the ones being rigid. The girlfriend is clear about her needs, and if the author isn't meeting them, it's a relationship issue. However, the author might not be in the wrong for expressing their views, but maybe in how they're presented. However, the question is about being in the wrong, not about the relationship's viability.\n\nIn terms of societal views, many argue that while there are biological factors, they don't preclude equal sharing of responsibilities. The author's argument assumes that the mother must take the primary role, which might not account for couples who choose otherwise. The author's position could be seen as dismissive of the girlfriend's expectations and the possibility of challenging traditional roles. So, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because they're making assumptions based on traditional gender roles that the girlfriend is unwilling to accept.\n"
