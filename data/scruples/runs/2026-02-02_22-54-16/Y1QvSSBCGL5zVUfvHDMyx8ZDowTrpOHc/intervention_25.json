I think she's not understanding what I'm saying or is naive about parenthood.\n\nI told her that there's no way when we have children that we will be able to split the load completely evenly. There are biological components to motherhood that come into play, like maternal instincts and post partum bonding and such, that require the mother to spend more time with the child immediately after birth. Additionally, because of this, it is often more likely feasible for the mother to stay home or at least be the primary parent for the child, in addition to economic factors that usually result in the man being the breadwinner and the woman being the primary parent. Thus, odds are, she will be the primary parent for our children for a variety of reasons, and there is no way we will be able to have a completely equal split. \n\nShe told me she will not have a child with a man who does not agree to split the work evenly, while I am arguing that it is not possible, particularly right after birth but also down the line. She is reconsidering our relationship now and I need to know if I'm being the asshole or being logical.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for stating that fatherhood and motherhood are fundamentally different. The author's argument is based on biological factors like maternal instincts, postpartum bonding, and traditional economic roles leading the mother to be the primary parent. The girlfriend is upset because she expects an equal split, and now she's reconsidering the relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the validity of the author's points. Biologically, there are differences in the physical aspects of pregnancy and childbirth, which can influence the immediate post-birth bonding. However, modern societal views increasingly emphasize shared parenting responsibilities regardless of gender. The author's assertion that a completely equal split isn't possible might be seen as reinforcing traditional gender roles, which the girlfriend might find restrictive.\n\nThe key here is whether the author is being dismissive of the girlfriend's perspective. The author is presenting their view as a logical conclusion based on certain factors, but the girlfriend feels her stance (equal split) isn't respected. The author might not be wrong in their logic, but the problem could be in how they're presenting it\u2014perhaps not acknowledging that societal norms are changing and that couples can choose different roles. If the author is unwilling to consider flexibility or the possibility that the girlfriend's expectations are valid, that could be where the issue lies.\n\nAlso, the author's statement that \"there is no way we will be able to have a completely equal split\" is a strong assertion. Even if there are biological factors, many couples do manage to split responsibilities more evenly. The author's stance might be seen as not respecting the girlfriend's desire for equality, which is a significant point in a relationship. The girlfriend's response about rethinking the relationship suggests that this is a deal-breaker for her, which is her right.\n\nSo, while the author's points might have some merit, the way they're expressed and the rigidity in their position could be problematic. The core issue is whether the author is being open to alternative viewpoints and the possibility of shared parenting despite the challenges. If the author is not willing to engage in a compromise or acknowledge the girlfriend's perspective, then they might be in the wrong by not considering her values and expectations in the relationship. Therefore, the answer might lean towards A (the author is in the wrong) because of the potential rigidity and lack of empathy in addressing the girlfriend's concerns.\n"
