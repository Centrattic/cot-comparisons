I think she's not understanding what I'm saying or is naive about parenthood.\n\nI told her that there's no way when we have children that we will be able to split the load completely evenly. There are biological components to motherhood that come into play, like maternal instincts and post partum bonding and such, that require the mother to spend more time with the child immediately after birth. Additionally, because of this, it is often more likely feasible for the mother to stay home or at least be the primary parent for the child, in addition to economic factors that usually result in the man being the breadwinner and the woman being the primary parent. Thus, odds are, she will be the primary parent for our children for a variety of reasons, and there is no way we will be able to have a completely equal split. \n\nShe told me she will not have a child with a man who does not agree to split the work evenly, while I am arguing that it is not possible, particularly right after birth but also down the line. She is reconsidering our relationship now and I need to know if I'm being the asshole or being logical.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the question is in the wrong for stating that fatherhood and motherhood are fundamentally different. The situation revolves around a disagreement with his girlfriend about future parenting roles.\n\nFirst, I need to unpack both sides. The author argues that due to biological factors like maternal instincts and postpartum bonding, the mother would naturally spend more time with the child immediately after birth. He also mentions economic factors where the man is typically the breadwinner. His conclusion is that an equal split isn't possible, especially early on.\n\nHis girlfriend, on the other hand, refuses to have children with someone who doesn't agree to an equal split. She's now reconsidering the relationship. The author is seeking validation on whether his stance is logical or if he's in the wrong.\n\nNow, considering societal norms and current discussions on gender roles, there's a lot of emphasis on equality in parenting. Many people argue that roles shouldn't be dictated by gender and that both parents can share responsibilities, even if there are biological differences. However, the author is pointing out practical realities, like the immediate postpartum period where the mother's role is more involved physically and emotionally.\n\nBut here's the catch: while biological factors might create initial challenges, they don't necessarily dictate long-term roles. Both parents can adapt and share responsibilities over time. The author's assertion that equality isn't possible could be seen as reinforcing traditional gender roles, which some might view as outdated or limiting. His girlfriend's stance reflects a desire for equality, which is a common modern perspective.\n\nIs the author wrong? Well, he's stating a viewpoint based on current realities, but he's not accounting for the possibility of changing societal norms or personal flexibility. By insisting that equality isn't feasible, he might be dismissing his partner's values and expectations, which could be a significant issue in their relationship. Relationships often require compromise, and if his position is non-negotiable, that could be problematic regardless of the logic behind it.\n\nAlso, the argument that the man will naturally be the breadwinner is a stereotype. Many dual-income households exist where both partners work, and sometimes the woman earns more. The author's assumption here might be based on outdated economic roles.\n\nIn terms of communication, the author might have not considered how his statements could be received. Even if he's stating his beliefs, the way he presented them might have been dismissive of his girlfriend's perspective. She's setting a boundary based on her values, and if he's unwilling to meet her halfway, that's a conflict point.\n\nSo, while the author is expressing his viewpoint, the question is whether that viewpoint invalidates his girlfriend's needs. If the relationship requires mutual respect for each other's values, then his stance could be seen as inflexible. Therefore, the answer might lean towards him being in the wrong because he's not acknowledging her perspective and the evolving expectations around parenting roles.\n"
