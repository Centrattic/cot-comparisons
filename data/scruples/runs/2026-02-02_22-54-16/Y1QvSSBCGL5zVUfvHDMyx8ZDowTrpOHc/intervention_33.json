I think she's not understanding what I'm saying or is naive about parenthood.\n\nI told her that there's no way when we have children that we will be able to split the load completely evenly. There are biological components to motherhood that come into play, like maternal instincts and post partum bonding and such, that require the mother to spend more time with the child immediately after birth. Additionally, because of this, it is often more likely feasible for the mother to stay home or at least be the primary parent for the child, in addition to economic factors that usually result in the man being the breadwinner and the woman being the primary parent. Thus, odds are, she will be the primary parent for our children for a variety of reasons, and there is no way we will be able to have a completely equal split. \n\nShe told me she will not have a child with a man who does not agree to split the work evenly, while I am arguing that it is not possible, particularly right after birth but also down the line. She is reconsidering our relationship now and I need to know if I'm being the asshole or being logical.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a disagreement about how parenting responsibilities should be divided.\n\nFirst, the author argues that motherhood and fatherhood are fundamentally different, pointing to biological factors like maternal instincts and postpartum bonding. They also mention practical factors like economic roles where the man is more likely to be the breadwinner. The author believes that splitting parenting duties equally isn't feasible, especially right after birth. The girlfriend, however, refuses to have children with someone who doesn't agree to an equal split, leading her to reconsider the relationship.\n\nNow, considering societal norms and evolving perspectives, there's a push towards equal partnership in parenting, regardless of traditional gender roles. The author is making a case based on traditional views, which some might find outdated. The key point here is whether the author's stance is justified or if it's contributing to inequality.\n\nThe author's argument relies on biological determinism, suggesting that women are naturally more suited to be primary caregivers. But modern discussions often emphasize the importance of shared responsibility and flexibility rather than rigid roles. The girlfriend's stance reflects a desire for equality, which is a common expectation in many relationships today.\n\nIs the author being logical or is he reinforcing harmful stereotypes? By stating that equality isn't possible, he might be dismissing the possibility of mutual effort and adjustment. The author might not be wrong in acknowledging biological factors, but he could be missing the point about shared commitment. The girlfriend is looking for a partner who is willing to put in equal effort, not someone who sets limits based on traditional roles.\n\nIn conclusion, the author might be in the wrong because he's not considering the importance of equal partnership. While there are biological factors, the insistence on an unequal split could be seen as not meeting the girlfriend's expectations for mutual support. The answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because the core issue is about mutual agreement on parenting roles, and the author isn't showing willingness to commit to equality as the girlfriend expects.\n"
