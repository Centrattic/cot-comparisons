I think she's not understanding what I'm saying or is naive about parenthood.\n\nI told her that there's no way when we have children that we will be able to split the load completely evenly. There are biological components to motherhood that come into play, like maternal instincts and post partum bonding and such, that require the mother to spend more time with the child immediately after birth. Additionally, because of this, it is often more likely feasible for the mother to stay home or at least be the primary parent for the child, in addition to economic factors that usually result in the man being the breadwinner and the woman being the primary parent. Thus, odds are, she will be the primary parent for our children for a variety of reasons, and there is no way we will be able to have a completely equal split. \n\nShe told me she will not have a child with a man who does not agree to split the work evenly, while I am arguing that it is not possible, particularly right after birth but also down the line. She is reconsidering our relationship now and I need to know if I'm being the asshole or being logical.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a disagreement between a couple regarding the division of responsibilities when they have children. The guy says it's not possible to split the load evenly because of biological factors and traditional gender roles. The girlfriend refuses to have kids with someone who doesn't agree to an equal split.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the arguments from both sides. The author's main points are about biological differences like maternal instincts, postpartum bonding, and the traditional economic roles where the man is the breadwinner. He argues that these factors make an equal split impossible. The girlfriend, on the other hand, wants an equal split and is considering ending the relationship if he doesn't agree.\n\nIs the author wrong? Well, I should consider current societal norms and the emphasis on gender equality. While it's true that biological differences exist, such as pregnancy and postpartum, modern discussions often focus on shared responsibilities beyond just the initial stages. The author's argument might be based on outdated or traditional views. For example, the idea that maternal instincts automatically require the mother to be the primary parent could be seen as reinforcing stereotypes that women are naturally more suited for caregiving. This perspective ignores the possibility of shared parenting roles beyond the early months and the evolving economic landscape where dual-income households are common.\n\nAdditionally, the author's statement that it's \"not possible\" to split the work evenly might be too absolute. While there might be initial challenges, many couples do manage to share responsibilities more equally with communication and flexibility. The girlfriend's stance reflects a modern expectation of equality in parenting, which is valid. The author dismissing this as impossible could be seen as not valuing her perspective or being unwilling to adapt.\n\nMoreover, the economic factors mentioned by the author are shifting. Increasingly, women are primary breadwinners, and men are taking on more childcare roles. Assuming that the woman will automatically be the primary parent based on economics is an outdated assumption. The author's refusal to consider a more equal arrangement, despite these changes, might be the issue here.\n\nHowever, the author isn't entirely wrong in pointing out the biological realities. Pregnancy and childbirth are unique to women, and postpartum care does require more immediate attention. But equating that to a lifelong unequal split is where the problem lies. The girlfriend's demand for equality is a reasonable expectation in a modern relationship, and dismissing it as naive could be the problem.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's argument relies on traditional views that might not align with contemporary values of equality. His dismissal of the possibility of an equal split, despite the girlfriend's valid stance, suggests a lack of willingness to compromise or adapt. Therefore, he might be in the wrong here.\n"
