I think she's not understanding what I'm saying or is naive about parenthood.\n\nI told her that there's no way when we have children that we will be able to split the load completely evenly. There are biological components to motherhood that come into play, like maternal instincts and post partum bonding and such, that require the mother to spend more time with the child immediately after birth. Additionally, because of this, it is often more likely feasible for the mother to stay home or at least be the primary parent for the child, in addition to economic factors that usually result in the man being the breadwinner and the woman being the primary parent. Thus, odds are, she will be the primary parent for our children for a variety of reasons, and there is no way we will be able to have a completely equal split. \n\nShe told me she will not have a child with a man who does not agree to split the work evenly, while I am arguing that it is not possible, particularly right after birth but also down the line.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong. The situation is about a disagreement between a couple regarding the division of parental responsibilities. The man argues that motherhood and fatherhood are fundamentally different, citing biological factors like maternal instincts, postpartum bonding, and economic roles leading the mother to be the primary parent. The girlfriend refuses to have children with someone who doesn't agree to an equal split.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze both sides. The man's argument is based on biological and societal factors. He's pointing out that physically, the mother goes through pregnancy and childbirth, which might make it more feasible for her to be the primary caregiver initially. He also mentions traditional economic roles where men are breadwinners. However, these are generalizations. Many women work full-time and are breadwinners, and fathers are increasingly taking on primary caregiving roles. The assumption that it's automatically the mother's role because of biology might be reinforcing stereotypes.\n\nThe girlfriend's stance is that she expects equality. She's not willing to accept a situation where she's the primary parent, which is understandable if she values equality and doesn't want to be in a traditional role. Her response is firm, which might come off as extreme, but her position is based on her personal values.\n\nNow, considering the man's perspective, is he wrong to state his beliefs? He's expressing his view based on his understanding of biology and societal norms. However, is that view accurate or fair? The idea that maternal instincts are inherently stronger or that equality in parenting isn't possible could be problematic. It might overlook the fact that many fathers can and do take on significant caregiving roles, and that societal norms are changing. Also, assuming that the mother must be the primary parent due to economic factors could ignore the reality that dual-income households are common and that gender roles in parenting are evolving.\n\nThe man's statement that a completely equal split isn't possible might be dismissive of the girlfriend's desire for equality. Even if there are biological differences initially, long-term equality is achievable with mutual effort. By stating that it's impossible, he might be undermining her perspective and not acknowledging that both parents can adapt roles as needed. The key here is whether the man is being rigid in his stance instead of being open to compromise or negotiation.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's reaction is to reconsider the relationship, which could be seen as a strong move. But her stance is based on her non-negotiable boundary, which is valid if she's clear about her expectations. The man's refusal to agree to an equal split could be the reason she's rethinking the relationship.\n\nIn terms of societal progress, the idea that parenting should be split equally is becoming more accepted. The man's argument might be seen as traditional or even regressive if it's used to justify unequal treatment. However, he's not necessarily wrong in acknowledging biological differences but is in the wrong if he uses those differences to justify an unequal division without considering other factors or the possibility of change.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer would depend on whether his statements are based on harmful stereotypes or if he's just stating his honest perspective. If he's rigidly holding to traditional roles without considering modern realities or his partner's wishes, then he's more in the wrong. If he's just expressing his view but is open to discussion, maybe not. But given that he's saying it's \"not possible\" and she's unwilling to accept that, the rigidity on his part might make him the asshole. Alternatively, if she's being unreasonable by not allowing for any flexibility, but her stance is about equality, which is a valid personal value.\n\nI think the author is in the wrong because his argument reinforces outdated gender roles and dismisses the possibility of equality in parenting. By not acknowledging that both parents can adapt and share responsibilities equally, even with biological differences, he's not respecting his partner's perspective. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
