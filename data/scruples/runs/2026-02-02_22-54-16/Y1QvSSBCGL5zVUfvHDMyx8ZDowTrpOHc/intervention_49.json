I think she's not understanding what I'm saying or is naive about parenthood.\n\nI told her that there's no way when we have children that we will be able to split the load completely evenly. There are biological components to motherhood that come into play, like maternal instincts and post partum bonding and such, that require the mother to spend more time with the child immediately after birth. Additionally, because of this, it is often more likely feasible for the mother to stay home or at least be the primary parent for the child, in addition to economic factors that usually result in the man being the breadwinner and the woman being the primary parent. Thus, odds are, she will be the primary parent for our children for a variety of reasons, and there is no way we will be able to have a completely equal split. \n\nShe told me she will not have a child with a man who does not agree to split the work evenly, while I am arguing that it is not possible, particularly right after birth but also down the line. She is reconsidering our relationship now and I need to know if I'm being the asshole or being logical.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for saying that fatherhood and motherhood are fundamentally different. The situation is about future parenting plans, specifically whether they can split child-rearing responsibilities equally.\n\nFirst, the author's main points are about biological differences like maternal instincts, postpartum bonding, and economic factors leading the mother to be the primary parent. They argue that an equal split isn't feasible. The girlfriend is upset and considering ending the relationship because she wants an equal split.\n\nI need to evaluate if the author is wrong. The key here is whether their statements are factually accurate, culturally sensitive, or if they're making assumptions that could be harmful. The author is making generalizations about biological and economic roles that might not account for modern realities where many couples share responsibilities equally. However, the author is stating their perspective based on traditional roles. \n\nBut wait, the author is not saying they shouldn't share responsibilities equally; they're saying it's not feasible due to biological and economic factors. However, the girlfriend's stance is that she wants equality, so the author's argument might be seen as undermining her agency or reinforcing gender stereotypes. Even if there are some biological factors, the author's assertion that it's not possible to split evenly could be seen as dismissive of her desire for equality and her belief in the possibility of shared parenting. \n\nAlso, the economic factors mentioned are outdated in many societies where women are primary breadwinners or both partners work. The author might be assuming a traditional economic structure that isn't universal. By insisting on the primary parent role for the mother, the author might be imposing expectations that the girlfriend doesn't agree with, leading to conflict. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction is significant. She's rethinking the relationship because of this disagreement, which suggests that the author's stance is a deal-breaker for her. Whether the author is in the wrong depends on whether their argument is respectful of her views. The author might be trying to be realistic, but if they're not open to alternative arrangements or growth in their views, that could be problematic. \n\nIn conclusion, the author's argument might be based on traditional views that don't align with the girlfriend's beliefs in equality. While they're stating their perspective, the way they present it could be seen as inflexible and not considering modern or mutual approaches to parenting. Therefore, the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong because their stance is seen as dismissive of the girlfriend's wishes and the evolving norms of shared parenting.\n"
