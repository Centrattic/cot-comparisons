I think she's not understanding what I'm saying or is naive about parenthood.\n\nI told her that there's no way when we have children that we will be able to split the load completely evenly. There are biological components to motherhood that come into play, like maternal instincts and post partum bonding and such, that require the mother to spend more time with the child immediately after birth. Additionally, because of this, it is often more likely feasible for the mother to stay home or at least be the primary parent for the child, in addition to economic factors that usually result in the man being the breadwinner and the woman being the primary parent. Thus, odds are, she will be the primary parent for our children for a variety of reasons, and there is no way we will be able to have a completely equal split. \n\nShe told me she will not have a child with a man who does not agree to split the work evenly, while I am arguing that it is not possible, particularly right after birth but also down the line.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a disagreement with his girlfriend about the division of parental responsibilities.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the arguments from both sides. The author claims that motherhood and fatherhood are fundamentally different due to biological factors like maternal instincts and postpartum bonding, which mean the mother has to spend more time with the child immediately after birth. He also mentions economic factors where the man is typically the breadwinner and the woman the primary parent. Therefore, he argues that an equal split isn't possible.\n\nThe girlfriend's stance is that she won't have a child with someone who doesn't agree to split the work evenly. The author is now being told that his viewpoint might make him the asshole (AITA), and he wants to know if he's wrong.\n\nI should consider societal norms and expectations. Traditionally, societal roles have often placed the mother as the primary caregiver, but modern discussions emphasize shared responsibility and challenging traditional gender roles. The author is making a biological argument, but some might argue that societal structures and personal choices also play a big role. \n\nThe author's argument hinges on the idea that equality isn't possible due to biological and economic factors. However, the girlfriend is pushing for equality regardless of those factors. This could lead to a conflict where one partner's expectations are not met. \n\nIs the author wrong for stating his beliefs? Well, he's expressing his view, but if the girlfriend's expectations are non-negotiable, then the conflict arises from not meeting her terms. The key here is mutual agreement. If the author is unwilling to consider different arrangements or if his stance is inflexible, that could be problematic. However, if he's just stating his perspective and they can't find a middle ground, it might not be his fault.\n\nAlso, there's a nuance in how the author presents his argument. He mentions that it's not possible to split evenly, but maybe he's not leaving room for compromise. The girlfriend is clear that equality is a deal-breaker for her. If the author is unwilling to adjust or find a solution that aligns with her needs, then he might be at fault. However, he's also stating his position based on his understanding of biology and economics, which some might see as logical.\n\nAnother angle is the assumption of economic roles. The author assumes the man will be the breadwinner, which might not be the case. Assuming traditional roles could be seen as outdated. If the girlfriend expects a more equal sharing of both financial and parenting responsibilities, the author's stance might not align with her modern expectations.\n\nIn conclusion, whether the author is in the wrong depends on how inflexible he is. If he's open to discussion and compromise but just has a different view, it's a difference in values. But if he's rigid and dismissive of her needs, then he might be at fault. The scenario as presented doesn't show him being unwilling to adjust, but it does show a clash in expectations. Since the girlfriend is rethinking the relationship because he won't agree to her terms, the answer might hinge on whether his position is valid or not.\n"
