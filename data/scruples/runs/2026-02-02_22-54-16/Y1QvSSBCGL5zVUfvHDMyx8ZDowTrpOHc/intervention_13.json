I think she's not understanding what I'm saying or is naive about parenthood.\n\nI told her that there's no way when we have children that we will be able to split the load completely evenly. There are biological components to motherhood that come into play, like maternal instincts and post partum bonding and such, that require the mother to spend more time with the child immediately after birth. Additionally, because of this, it is often more likely feasible for the mother to stay home or at least be the primary parent for the child, in addition to economic factors that usually result in the man being the breadwinner and the woman being the primary parent. Thus, odds are, she will be the primary parent for our children for a variety of reasons, and there is no way we will be able to have a completely equal split. \n\nShe told me she will not have a child with a man who does not agree to split the work evenly, while I am arguing that it is not possible, particularly right after birth but also down the line. She is reconsidering our relationship now and I need to know if I'm being the asshole or being logical.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for stating that fatherhood and motherhood are fundamentally different, leading to an argument with his girlfriend about future parenting roles.\n\nFirst, the author argues that due to biological factors like maternal instincts and postpartum bonding, the mother would naturally spend more time with the child initially. He also mentions economic factors where men are often the primary breadwinners. His point is that a completely equal split isn't feasible, especially right after birth.\n\nThe girlfriend's stance is that she won't have a child with someone who doesn't agree to an equal workload split. The author is now seeing her reconsider their relationship and is questioning if he's the asshole here.\n\nI need to determine if his reasoning is valid or if he's making harmful assumptions. The key points are the biological and economic factors. The author is making generalizations based on traditional gender roles. However, modern perspectives emphasize that parenting roles can be shared and that economic roles are changing. Assuming that the woman will be the primary parent might be based on outdated stereotypes, even if there are some biological differences.\n\nThe author's argument could be seen as dismissing his partner's desire for equality, which is a valid stance for her. By insisting that equality isn't possible, he might be undermining her values. The girlfriend's reaction could be because she values equal partnership and sees his statement as a refusal to commit to shared responsibilities, which is a deal-breaker for her.\n\nSo, while the author might believe he's being realistic, his perspective could be reinforcing traditional gender roles. The question is whether that makes him in the wrong. If the girlfriend's refusal is based on her values, and the author's argument is based on assumptions that ignore changing societal norms, then he might be in the wrong for not being open to shared parenting models that don't rely on traditional roles.\n"
