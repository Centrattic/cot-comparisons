I think she's not understanding what I'm saying or is naive about parenthood.\n\nI told her that there's no way when we have children that we will be able to split the load completely evenly. There are biological components to motherhood that come into play, like maternal instincts and post partum bonding and such, that require the mother to spend more time with the child immediately after birth. Additionally, because of this, it is often more likely feasible for the mother to stay home or at least be the primary parent for the child, in addition to economic factors that usually result in the man being the breadwinner and the woman being the primary parent. Thus, odds are, she will be the primary parent for our children for a variety of reasons, and there is no way we will be able to have a completely equal split. \n\nShe told me she will not have a child with a man who does not agree to split the work evenly, while I am arguing that it is not possible, particularly right after birth but also down the line. She is reconsidering our relationship now and I need to know if I'm being the asshole or being logical.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The question is whether it's wrong for the author to say that fatherhood and motherhood are fundamentally different, leading to an unequal split in parenting responsibilities.\n\nFirst, the author argues that there are biological reasons, like maternal instincts and postpartum bonding, which mean the mother will naturally spend more time with the child right after birth. They also mention economic factors where the man is typically the breadwinner and the woman the primary parent. So, the author is making a case that equality in child-rearing isn't possible, especially at first.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction is that she won't have a child with someone who doesn't agree to split the work evenly. The author feels the girlfriend isn't understanding his point or is being naive. The question is whether the author is wrong for expressing this view.\n\nI need to consider both sides. The author's perspective is based on biological and economic factors, which are real. However, there's also a societal shift towards more equal parenting roles, and the idea that these traditional roles are changing. The author's statement might come off as reinforcing stereotypes, which could be hurtful. The girlfriend might feel that the author doesn't support the idea of shared parenting or equality, which is important to her.\n\nEven if there are biological factors, the author's approach might be dismissive of the girlfriend's desire for equality. It's possible that the author is not considering that couples can work together to adjust roles, even if they start different. The author's stance might be seen as rigid, not allowing for flexibility or shared responsibility over time.\n\nAlso, the author's assertion about economic factors (man as breadwinner, woman as primary parent) is a traditional view that doesn't account for modern scenarios where many women are the primary earners. This could imply that the author has outdated assumptions.\n\nSo, while there are biological aspects, the way the author presents it might be seen as not valuing the girlfriend's perspective on equality. The author's argument could be perceived as minimizing the possibility of shared parenting, which is what the girlfriend is advocating for. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong even if they're pointing out real factors, because they're not engaging with the girlfriend's values and expectations in a way that shows mutual respect and willingness to find a middle ground.\n"
