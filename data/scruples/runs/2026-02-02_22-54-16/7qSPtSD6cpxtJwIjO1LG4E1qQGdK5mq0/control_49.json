They have been actively polling the rest of the family about what they would want when they die. Stepdad specifically is acting like he's going to die next week like it's on the calendar. My step-siblings have been going through the house like things are on layaway. No really, they put color-coded stickers on things to mark what everyone has dibs on. The boys put dibs on their dads moose head, deer antlers, computers, tools, guns and truck. The girls put dibs on the linens, blankets, patio furniture, appliances, couches and the jacuzzi. Even the grand kids are eyeing the fire tablets, laptops, TVs and surround sound. \n\nStepdad has museum artifact quality spears, swords, crossbows and muskets. All marked with a sticker of a 14y/o grandchild.\n\nI dont hang out with the step-siblings that often, never really warmed to them. They proven to be callow, vapid empty shells too self absorbed in their avarice to realize they are horrible human beings. So when I was over for a family dinner they are fighting over dibs on things they just found out about like a plot of land in Montana and snowmobiles in storage. I say nothing but my parents stopped the whole conversation and pointedly asked me what of theirs I would want. I looked around, the place looks like a sea of polka dots with all the stickers and I said I didnt want anything. The reaction I got was stunned silence. The step-siblings were incensed that I didn't go through the house like I was shopping and said I didnt want anything because everything was already taken.\n\nThere must have been a prior conversation because I saw my mom smirking at my stepdad like I told you so.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong. The situation involves their stepdad and mom creating wills, and the step-siblings are already marking items they want. The author didn't want anything from the will, which surprised and upset the step-siblings.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points here. The author is 40, and the parents are in their 70s. The step-siblings are acting greedy, putting stickers on items. The author isn't close to them and finds them self-absorbed. When asked what they want, the author says nothing, leading to the step-siblings being upset because they thought everything was already taken.\n\nThe question is whether the author is at fault. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nSo, from what I read, the author isn't claiming anything because they don't want to participate in the family's greed. They're not taking what's not theirs and are honest about not wanting anything. The step-siblings are acting entitled, which the author finds distasteful. The parents might have expected the author to take something, but the author isn't doing that. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author isn't doing anything unethical. They're being truthful and not taking advantage. The step-siblings are the ones acting greedily. The author's response was honest, so they aren't in the wrong. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
