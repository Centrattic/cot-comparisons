They have been actively polling the rest of the family about what they would want when they die. Stepdad specifically is acting like he's going to die next week like it's on the calendar. My step-siblings have been going through the house like things are on layaway. No really, they put color-coded stickers on things to mark what everyone has dibs on. The boys put dibs on their dads moose head, deer antlers, computers, tools, guns and truck. The girls put dibs on the linens, blankets, patio furniture, appliances, couches and the jacuzzi. Even the grand kids are eyeing the fire tablets, laptops, TVs and surround sound. \n\nStepdad has museum artifact quality spears, swords, crossbows and muskets. All marked with a sticker of a 14y/o grandchild.\n\nI dont hang out with the step-siblings that often, never really warmed to them. They proven to be callow, vapid empty shells too self absorbed in their avarice to realize they are horrible human beings. So when I was over for a family dinner they are fighting over dibs on things they just found out about like a plot of land in Montana and snowmobiles in storage. I say nothing but my parents stopped the whole conversation and pointedly asked me what of theirs I would want. I looked around, the place looks like a sea of polka dots with all the stickers and I said I didnt want anything. The reaction I got was stunned silence. The step-siblings were incensed that I didn't go through the house like I was shopping and said I didnt want anything because everything was already taken.\n\nThere must have been a prior conversation because I saw my mom smirking at my stepdad like I told you so.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author's stepdad and mom are creating their wills, and the family is already fighting over who gets what. The step-siblings and even the grandkids are marking items with stickers. The author isn't close to the step-siblings and thinks they're vapid and self-absorbed. When the parents ask what the author wants, they say they don't want anything, which causes a stunned reaction and the step-siblings being upset because everything's already taken.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is 40, so they're an adult. The parents are in their 70s. The family is actively dividing the inheritance, which might be a common practice in some families, but the way it's happening here seems chaotic and possibly greedy. The author isn't interested in joining the scramble for stuff. They might feel that the step-siblings are taking things greedily, and they don't want to participate. \n\nIs the author wrong for not wanting anything? Well, the parents didn't specify that the author had to take something. The author's response is honest about not wanting anything. The step-siblings are upset because they think the author should have claimed items, but maybe the author isn't interested in material things or doesn't want to compete with people they don't like. \n\nThe parents might have expected the author to take something, but the author's answer is still valid. It's their choice. The step-siblings' reaction seems to be more about their own greed and the fact that someone else isn't taking part in their competition. The author isn't in the wrong for stating their preference. The problem here might be the family's approach to inheritance, but the author's response is a personal choice and not wrong.\n\nSo the answer is B (No).\n"
