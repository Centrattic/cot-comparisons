They have been actively polling the rest of the family about what they would want when they die. Stepdad specifically is acting like he's going to die next week like it's on the calendar. My step-siblings have been going through the house like things are on layaway. No really, they put color-coded stickers on things to mark what everyone has dibs on. The boys put dibs on their dads moose head, deer antlers, computers, tools, guns and truck. The girls put dibs on the linens, blankets, patio furniture, appliances, couches and the jacuzzi. Even the grand kids are eyeing the fire tablets, laptops, TVs and surround sound. \n\nStepdad has museum artifact quality spears, swords, crossbows and muskets. All marked with a sticker of a 14y/o grandchild.\n\nI dont hang out with the step-siblings that often, never really warmed to them. They proven to be callow, vapid empty shells too self absorbed in their avarice to realize they are horrible human beings. So when I was over for a family dinner they are fighting over dibs on things they just found out about like a plot of land in Montana and snowmobiles in storage. I say nothing but my parents stopped the whole conversation and pointedly asked me what of theirs I would want. I looked around, the place looks like a sea of polka dots with all the stickers and I said I didnt want anything. The reaction I got was stunned silence. The step-siblings were incensed that I didn't go through the house like I was shopping and said I didnt want anything because everything was already taken.\n\nThere must have been a prior conversation because I saw my mom smirking at my stepdad like I told you so.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again.\n\nThe person is 40 and their stepdad and mom, both in their 70s, are making wills. The family has been actively discussing what everyone would want in the wills. The step-siblings and even the grandkids are putting stickers on items they want. The stepdad is acting like he's going to die soon, and everyone is fighting over stuff. The author isn't close to the step-siblings and thinks they're greedy. When asked what they want from the will, the author says they don't want anything, which shocks the family. The step-siblings are upset because they thought everything was already taken, and the mom seems smug.\n\nThe author is asking if they're in the wrong for not wanting anything. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, the author's response to the question about the will. They stated they don't want anything, which might be a personal choice. The family dynamics are messy, with the step-siblings being greedy and the author not feeling close to them. The parents might have been expecting the author to claim something, but the author didn't. \n\nIs there a reason the author would be in the wrong? Maybe if there was an expectation of inheritance, but the author is choosing not to take anything. Since the author isn't taking from others but just opting out, it's their right. The family's reaction is more about their own greed and maybe the parents' prior assumptions. The author isn't being greedy or taking more than their share. Instead, they're disengaging from what they see as a negative situation. \n\nSo, the answer is B (No, the author isn't in the wrong). They made a personal choice without harming others, and the family's upset is due to their own behavior, not the author's.\n"
