They have been actively polling the rest of the family about what they would want when they die. Stepdad specifically is acting like he's going to die next week like it's on the calendar. My step-siblings have been going through the house like things are on layaway. No really, they put color-coded stickers on things to mark what everyone has dibs on. The boys put dibs on their dads moose head, deer antlers, computers, tools, guns and truck. The girls put dibs on the linens, blankets, patio furniture, appliances, couches and the jacuzzi. Even the grand kids are eyeing the fire tablets, laptops, TVs and surround sound. \n\nStepdad has museum artifact quality spears, swords, crossbows and muskets. All marked with a sticker of a 14y/o grandchild.\n\nI dont hang out with the step-siblings that often, never really warmed to them. They proven to be callow, vapid empty shells too self absorbed in their avarice to realize they are horrible human beings. So when I was over for a family dinner they are fighting over dibs on things they just found out about like a plot of land in Montana and snowmobiles in storage. I say nothing but my parents stopped the whole conversation and pointedly asked me what of theirs I would want. I looked around, the place looks like a sea of polka dots with all the stickers and I said I didnt want anything. The reaction I got was stunned silence. The step-siblings were incensed that I didn't go through the house like I was shopping and said I didnt want anything because everything was already taken.\n\nThere must have been a prior conversation because I saw my mom smirking at my stepdad like I told you so.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author's stepdad and mom creating their wills, and the rest of the family is marking up all the belongings with stickers to indicate who they think they'll inherit what. The author, when asked what they want, says they don't want anything, which shocks the family, especially the step-siblings who are very focused on claiming things.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the cultural and familial context. In many families, especially when discussing wills and inheritance, there's an expectation that people will express interest in certain items. The step-siblings are acting greedy and self-centered, which the author criticizes. The author doesn't engage in the same behavior, which might be seen as rude by the family, but the user is wondering if the author is wrong for not participating.\n\nThe key points here are: the author's lack of interest in material things, the family's over-the-top behavior, and the author's response in the situation. The author didn't take part in the sticker marking and when asked, declined to claim anything. The step-siblings are upset because they expected the author to at least voice a preference. The parents' reaction is mixed, with the mom smirking as if she anticipated this response.\n\nLegally, inheritance is a matter of the will, so the author's opinion doesn't affect the actual distribution. Socially, though, there's a norm of participating in these discussions, even if just to state one's wishes. However, the author's response could be seen as a personal choice, especially if they don't value material possessions. The family's reaction is negative, but the author isn't obligated to conform to their expectations. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because they're not required to participate in what they perceive as a greedy or unnecessary process. Their response is honest and perhaps a reflection of their values. The family's disapproval is more about their own expectations than the author's rights or wrongs. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
