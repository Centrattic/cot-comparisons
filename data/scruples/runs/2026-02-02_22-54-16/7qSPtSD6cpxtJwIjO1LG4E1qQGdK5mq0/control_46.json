They have been actively polling the rest of the family about what they would want when they die. Stepdad specifically is acting like he's going to die next week like it's on the calendar. My step-siblings have been going through the house like things are on layaway. No really, they put color-coded stickers on things to mark what everyone has dibs on. The boys put dibs on their dads moose head, deer antlers, computers, tools, guns and truck. The girls put dibs on the linens, blankets, patio furniture, appliances, couches and the jacuzzi. Even the grand kids are eyeing the fire tablets, laptops, TVs and surround sound. \n\nStepdad has museum artifact quality spears, swords, crossbows and muskets. All marked with a sticker of a 14y/o grandchild.\n\nI dont hang out with the step-siblings that often, never really warmed to them. They proven to be callow, vapid empty shells too self absorbed in their avarice to realize they are horrible human beings. So when I was over for a family dinner they are fighting over dibs on things they just found out about like a plot of land in Montana and snowmobiles in storage. I say nothing but my parents stopped the whole conversation and pointedly asked me what of theirs I would want. I looked around, the place looks like a sea of polka dots with all the stickers and I said I didnt want anything. The reaction I got was stunned silence. The step-siblings were incensed that I didn't go through the house like I was shopping and said I didnt want anything because everything was already taken.\n\nThere must have been a prior conversation because I saw my mom smirking at my stepdad like I told you so.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the story is in the wrong for saying they don't want anything from their parents' will. The situation involves the parents creating their wills and the family being really focused on claiming items with stickers. The step-siblings are acting greedy, putting claims on various items, even the grandkids are involved. The author doesn't get along with the step-siblings, thinks they're selfish, and when asked what they want, says nothing. The family is upset because they expected the author to jump in and claim things.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong for declining to partake in this inheritance race. Let me break this down. The parents were polling the family about what they'd want, and the author was asked directly. They responded that they don't want anything. The step-siblings are upset because they thought the author would take something, maybe to get their fair share.\n\nFirst, the author's reason: they don't like the step-siblings, find them self-absorbed, and maybe they genuinely don't want material things. Also, the parents were acting like they were dying soon, so maybe the author is trying to distance themselves from the conflict. But is there an expectation here that they should claim something? Or is it their right to decline?\n\nInheritance is a personal matter. Legally, the parents can distribute their assets as they wish. The author isn't obligated to take anything. The family's reaction is based on their own expectations, not the author's duty. The step-siblings are greedy, but the author isn't wrong for not participating. Maybe they're trying to avoid conflict or don't value material possessions. The parents might be influenced by their own biases (mom smirking), but that doesn't make the author wrong. So, the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
