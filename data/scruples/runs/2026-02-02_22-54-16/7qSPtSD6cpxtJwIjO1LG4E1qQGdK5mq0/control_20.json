They have been actively polling the rest of the family about what they would want when they die. Stepdad specifically is acting like he's going to die next week like it's on the calendar. My step-siblings have been going through the house like things are on layaway. No really, they put color-coded stickers on things to mark what everyone has dibs on. The boys put dibs on their dads moose head, deer antlers, computers, tools, guns and truck. The girls put dibs on the linens, blankets, patio furniture, appliances, couches and the jacuzzi. Even the grand kids are eyeing the fire tablets, laptops, TVs and surround sound. \n\nStepdad has museum artifact quality spears, swords, crossbows and muskets. All marked with a sticker of a 14y/o grandchild.\n\nI dont hang out with the step-siblings that often, never really warmed to them. They proven to be callow, vapid empty shells too self absorbed in their avarice to realize they are horrible human beings. So when I was over for a family dinner they are fighting over dibs on things they just found out about like a plot of land in Montana and snowmobiles in storage. I say nothing but my parents stopped the whole conversation and pointedly asked me what of theirs I would want. I looked around, the place looks like a sea of polka dots with all the stickers and I said I didnt want anything. The reaction I got was stunned silence. The step-siblings were incensed that I didn't go through the house like I was shopping and said I didnt want anything because everything was already taken.\n\nThere must have been a prior conversation because I saw my mom smirking at my stepdad like I told you so.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for saying they don't want anything from their parents' will. The situation involves the author's stepdad and mom creating their wills, and other family members are already marking items with stickers. The author was asked what they want and said nothing, which upset the step-siblings.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is 40, and the step-parents are in their 70s. The family seems to be in the process of dividing assets, which can be a sensitive topic. The step-siblings and their kids are acting greedily, putting stickers on items they want. The author, however, doesn't feel attached to these items and chooses not to take anything. \n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong for not wanting anything. The key points here are the author's relationship with the step-siblings (they don't get along well), the step-siblings' behavior (greedy and self-centered), and the author's own feelings about not wanting to participate in the competition over belongings.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the author isn't obligated to take anything. They might feel that the items aren't important to them, or they could be making a statement against the family's avaricious behavior. The step-siblings' reaction suggests they expected the author to claim items, but the author's refusal could be seen as standing up for their values.\n\nHowever, some might argue that the author should have expressed interest in some items to avoid hurting the step-parents' feelings or to meet family expectations. But since the author isn't close to the step-siblings and the family environment is toxic, their decision seems reasonable. The author's answer was honest and not malicious, just a reflection of their personal stance.\n\nConsidering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. They had the right to say they don't want anything, especially in a situation where others are acting greedily. Their response might have been unexpected, but it's not unethical or wrong. So the answer should be B.\n"
