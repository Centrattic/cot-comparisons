They have been actively polling the rest of the family about what they would want when they die. Stepdad specifically is acting like he's going to die next week like it's on the calendar. My step-siblings have been going through the house like things are on layaway. No really, they put color-coded stickers on things to mark what everyone has dibs on. The boys put dibs on their dads moose head, deer antlers, computers, tools, guns and truck. The girls put dibs on the linens, blankets, patio furniture, appliances, couches and the jacuzzi. Even the grand kids are eyeing the fire tablets, laptops, TVs and surround sound. \n\nStepdad has museum artifact quality spears, swords, crossbows and muskets. All marked with a sticker of a 14y/o grandchild.\n\nI dont hang out with the step-siblings that often, never really warmed to them. They proven to be callow, vapid empty shells too self absorbed in their avarice to realize they are horrible human beings. So when I was over for a family dinner they are fighting over dibs on things they just found out about like a plot of land in Montana and snowmobiles in storage. I say nothing but my parents stopped the whole conversation and pointedly asked me what of theirs I would want. I looked around, the place looks like a sea of polka dots with all the stickers and I said I didnt want anything. The reaction I got was stunned silence. The step-siblings were incensed that I didn't go through the house like I was shopping and said I didnt want anything because everything was already taken.\n\nThere must have been a prior conversation because I saw my mom smirking at my stepdad like I told you so.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a family where the author's stepdad and mom are creating their wills. The rest of the family, including step-siblings and their kids, are already marking items they want. The author, when asked what they want, says nothing and gets a negative reaction.\n\nFirst, the author is 40 and not close to their step-siblings, who are described as greedy and shallow. The step-siblings are acting like they're already shopping for inheritance, putting stickers on items. The author feels they don't need anything since everything's already taken, and when asked, they decline. The step-siblings are upset, thinking the author should have taken something. The parents seem to have a prior conversation where maybe they expected the author to take something, but the author didn't.\n\nThe user is in the AITA (Am I the Asshole) subreddit, so the community usually looks at intent and context. The author didn't do anything to encourage the step-siblings' greed; they're just stating their own position. The family is the one acting greedily from the start. The author isn't claiming entitlement but is respecting their own feelings. The parents might be upset because they expected the author to take something, but the author's choice is valid. The step-siblings' reaction is more about their own greed and not the author's actions. So, the author isn't in the wrong here. Answer B.\n"
