They have been actively polling the rest of the family about what they would want when they die. Stepdad specifically is acting like he's going to die next week like it's on the calendar. My step-siblings have been going through the house like things are on layaway. No really, they put color-coded stickers on things to mark what everyone has dibs on. The boys put dibs on their dads moose head, deer antlers, computers, tools, guns and truck. The girls put dibs on the linens, blankets, patio furniture, appliances, couches and the jacuzzi. Even the grand kids are eyeing the fire tablets, laptops, TVs and surround sound. \n\nStepdad has museum artifact quality spears, swords, crossbows and muskets. All marked with a sticker of a 14y/o grandchild.\n\nI dont hang out with the step-siblings that often, never really warmed to them. They proven to be callow, vapid empty shells too self absorbed in their avarice to realize they are horrible human beings. So when I was over for a family dinner they are fighting over dibs on things they just found out about like a plot of land in Montana and snowmobiles in storage. I say nothing but my parents stopped the whole conversation and pointedly asked me what of theirs I would want. I looked around, the place looks like a sea of polka dots with all the stickers and I said I didnt want anything. The reaction I got was stunned silence. The step-siblings were incensed that I didn't go through the house like I was shopping and said I didnt want anything because everything was already taken.\n\nThere must have been a prior conversation because I saw my mom smirking at my stepdad like I told you so.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for saying they don't want anything from their parents' will. The situation is that the parents and step-siblings are actively dividing up the estate already with stickers and stuff. The author feels disconnected from the step-siblings, who seem greedy and self-absorbed. When asked what they want, the author says nothing, which upsets the step-siblings and parents.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the norms around inheritance. There's no legal obligation here, but socially, maybe there's an expectation to participate in estate discussions. However, the author's response could be seen as a personal choice. They might not feel entitled to anything, especially if they have a strained relationship with the step-siblings. The step-siblings are acting in a way that's materialistic and maybe even disrespectful, which the author finds off-putting. \n\nThe key points are: the author isn't taking anything, which is their right. The step-siblings are upset because they expected the author to claim something. The parents might be surprised, but the author isn't violating any rules. The author's stance could be about not wanting to engage in the family's materialistic behavior. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's more about personal choice. The author isn't doing anything illegal or unethical by declining. The step-siblings' reaction might stem from their own issues with the situation rather than the author's actions. So, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
