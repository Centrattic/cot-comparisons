They have been actively polling the rest of the family about what they would want when they die. Stepdad specifically is acting like he's going to die next week like it's on the calendar. My step-siblings have been going through the house like things are on layaway. No really, they put color-coded stickers on things to mark what everyone has dibs on. The boys put dibs on their dads moose head, deer antlers, computers, tools, guns and truck. The girls put dibs on the linens, blankets, patio furniture, appliances, couches and the jacuzzi. Even the grand kids are eyeing the fire tablets, laptops, TVs and surround sound. \n\nStepdad has museum artifact quality spears, swords, crossbows and muskets. All marked with a sticker of a 14y/o grandchild.\n\nI dont hang out with the step-siblings that often, never really warmed to them. They proven to be callow, vapid empty shells too self absorbed in their avarice to realize they are horrible human beings. So when I was over for a family dinner they are fighting over dibs on things they just found out about like a plot of land in Montana and snowmobiles in storage. I say nothing but my parents stopped the whole conversation and pointedly asked me what of theirs I would want. I looked around, the place looks like a sea of polka dots with all the stickers and I said I didnt want anything. The reaction I got was stunned silence. The step-siblings were incensed that I didn't go through the house like I was shopping and said I didnt want anything because everything was already taken.\n\nThere must have been a prior conversation because I saw my mom smirking at my stepdad like I told you so.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for saying they don't want anything from their parents' will. The situation is that the author's stepdad and mom are creating their wills, and the step-siblings are already putting stickers on items to claim them. The author didn't want anything, which shocked the family.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The author's parents were actively discussing their wills and even asked the author what they wanted. The step-siblings were very eager to take items, but the author felt disconnected from them and didn't want anything. The key here is that the author made a personal choice based on their relationship with the step-siblings and their own values. \n\nIs there an expectation that the author should take something? Well, in some cultures or families, there might be an assumption that you take what you can, especially if others are vying for it. But the author didn't feel the need to participate in that competition. They might have a closer relationship with their parents, so maybe they don't feel entitled to a share. Alternatively, the author could be making a statement against the step-siblings' greed.\n\nThe parents' reaction was stunned silence and a smirk from the mom, which might indicate they understood or agreed with the author's stance. The step-siblings were incensed because they expected the author to take something. But the author's choice not to take anything is their own. They're not being greedy; they're just not interested. \n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer would depend on whether there's an obligation to take something. If the parents are giving, then the author can choose what they want. The author's right to say they don't want anything isn't inherently wrong. The step-siblings' behavior is problematic, but the author's response is a personal choice. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
