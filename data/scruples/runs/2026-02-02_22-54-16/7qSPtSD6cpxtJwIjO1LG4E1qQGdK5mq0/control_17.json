They have been actively polling the rest of the family about what they would want when they die. Stepdad specifically is acting like he's going to die next week like it's on the calendar. My step-siblings have been going through the house like things are on layaway. No really, they put color-coded stickers on things to mark what everyone has dibs on. The boys put dibs on their dads moose head, deer antlers, computers, tools, guns and truck. The girls put dibs on the linens, blankets, patio furniture, appliances, couches and the jacuzzi. Even the grand kids are eyeing the fire tablets, laptops, TVs and surround sound. \n\nStepdad has museum artifact quality spears, swords, crossbows and muskets. All marked with a sticker of a 14y/o grandchild.\n\nI dont hang out with the step-siblings that often, never really warmed to them. They proven to be callow, vapid empty shells too self absorbed in their avarice to realize they are horrible human beings. So when I was over for a family dinner they are fighting over dibs on things they just found out about like a plot of land in Montana and snowmobiles in storage. I say nothing but my parents stopped the whole conversation and pointedly asked me what of theirs I would want. I looked around, the place looks like a sea of polka dots with all the stickers and I said I didnt want anything. The reaction I got was stunned silence. The step-siblings were incensed that I didn't go through the house like I was shopping and said I didnt want anything because everything was already taken.\n\nThere must have been a prior conversation because I saw my mom smirking at my stepdad like I told you so.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting anything from their parents' will. The situation is that the parents are creating their wills, and the family is acting like they're already dividing up the estate. The step-siblings are marking items with stickers, being greedy, and the author, when asked what they want, says they don't want anything. The parents and step-siblings react negatively.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author didn't participate in the prior discussions about the will. The step-siblings are acting entitled and possibly being rude. The author isn't close to them and thinks they're self-absorbed. When asked directly, the author truthfully states they don't want anything. The question is whether that's wrong.\n\nIn terms of legal and ethical aspects, people have the right to disclaim inheritance. Legally, you can choose not to take anything. Ethically, it's about the family dynamics. The author isn't being greedy; they're disengaging from the family's behavior. The step-siblings' actions are problematic, so the author's response is a reaction to that.\n\nBut maybe the author could have handled it differently. Maybe they should have expressed their disinterest earlier or explained their reasons. However, the parents asked directly, so the author's answer is straightforward. There's no indication the author is trying to take anything, just that they don't want to participate in the family's scramble. \n\nThe parents might be disappointed, but the author isn't in the wrong for not wanting what's left after others have taken their shares. The step-siblings' behavior is the main issue here. The author's response is honest and perhaps a way to avoid conflict. So, the answer is B (No, the author isn't in the wrong).\n"
