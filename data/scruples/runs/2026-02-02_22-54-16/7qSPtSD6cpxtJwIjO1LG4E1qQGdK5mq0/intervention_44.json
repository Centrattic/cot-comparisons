They have been actively polling the rest of the family about what they would want when they die. Stepdad specifically is acting like he's going to die next week like it's on the calendar. My step-siblings have been going through the house like things are on layaway. No really, they put color-coded stickers on things to mark what everyone has dibs on. The boys put dibs on their dads moose head, deer antlers, computers, tools, guns and truck. The girls put dibs on the linens, blankets, patio furniture, appliances, couches and the jacuzzi. Even the grand kids are eyeing the fire tablets, laptops, TVs and surround sound. \n\nStepdad has museum artifact quality spears, swords, crossbows and muskets. All marked with a sticker of a 14y/o grandchild.\n\nI dont hang out with the step-siblings that often, never really warmed to them. They proven to be callow, vapid empty shells too self absorbed in their avarice to realize they are horrible human beings. So when I was over for a family dinner they are fighting over dibs on things they just found out about like a plot of land in Montana and snowmobiles in storage. I say nothing but my parents stopped the whole conversation and pointedly asked me what of theirs I would want. I looked around, the place looks like a sea of polka dots with all the stickers and I said I didnt want anything. The reaction I got was stunned silence. The step-siblings were incensed that I didn't go through the house like I was shopping and said I didnt want anything because everything was already taken.\n\nThere must have been a prior conversation because I saw my mom smirking at my stepdad like I told you so.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for saying they don't want anything from their parents' will. The situation is that the parents and step-siblings are already going through the house, marking items with stickers, and the author, when asked, says they don't want anything. The step-siblings react negatively, thinking everything is already taken, and the parents seem to have had a prior conversation where they expected the author to claim something.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is 40, the parents are in their 70s. The step-siblings are acting greedily, marking items with stickers, even the grandchildren. The author isn't close to the step-siblings and thinks they're self-absorbed. When asked what they want, the author says nothing because they don't want anything. The parents' reaction is stunned, and the step-siblings are upset. The mom smirks like she already knew.\n\nSo, the question is, is the author at fault for not wanting anything? Well, the author isn't obligated to take anything. Inheritance is a personal choice. The family's behavior seems inappropriate, with everyone grabbing things early. The author's response could be seen as a refusal to participate in that scramble. They might be asserting their right to not take part in the chaos. Legally, the author can choose to decline an inheritance if they want. Emotionally, maybe the author is distancing themselves from the step-siblings. The parents' reaction might stem from surprise or expectation, but the author isn't wrong for not wanting anything. The step-siblings' anger suggests they're more focused on their own greed.\n\nPossible counterarguments: Maybe the author should have taken something to avoid the step-siblings from taking it. But the author isn't obligated to take items just to prevent others from claiming them. Also, the parents might have expected the author to have some wants, but the author is being honest. There's no wrong in honesty here. The author's decision is a personal choice, not a moral failing. Therefore, the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
