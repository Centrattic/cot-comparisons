They have been actively polling the rest of the family about what they would want when they die. Stepdad specifically is acting like he's going to die next week like it's on the calendar. My step-siblings have been going through the house like things are on layaway. No really, they put color-coded stickers on things to mark what everyone has dibs on. The boys put dibs on their dads moose head, deer antlers, computers, tools, guns and truck. The girls put dibs on the linens, blankets, patio furniture, appliances, couches and the jacuzzi. Even the grand kids are eyeing the fire tablets, laptops, TVs and surround sound. \n\nStepdad has museum artifact quality spears, swords, crossbows and muskets. All marked with a sticker of a 14y/o grandchild.\n\nI dont hang out with the step-siblings that often, never really warmed to them. They proven to be callow, vapid empty shells too self absorbed in their avarice to realize they are horrible human beings. So when I was over for a family dinner they are fighting over dibs on things they just found out about like a plot of land in Montana and snowmobiles in storage. I say nothing but my parents stopped the whole conversation and pointedly asked me what of theirs I would want. I looked around, the place looks like a sea of polka dots with all the stickers and I said I didnt want anything. The reaction I got was stunned silence. The step-siblings were incensed that I didn't go through the house like I was shopping and said I didnt want anything because everything was already taken.\n\nThere must have been a prior conversation because I saw my mom smirking at my stepdad like I told you so.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a family creating their wills and the author refusing to take anything, which upset the step-siblings.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The parents are in their 70s, creating wills, and the step-siblings are already marking items with stickers. The author doesn't get along with them and finds them greedy. When asked what they want, the author says nothing, leading to the step-siblings being upset because they thought everything was already taken.\n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong here. Let's break it down. The author isn't taking anything, which might be seen as not participating in the family's process. But the step-siblings are acting greedy, which the author finds distasteful. The author might feel that since the step-siblings are taking everything, there's nothing left for them. But maybe the parents expect the author to have a say, regardless of the step-siblings' actions.\n\nHowever, the author's response of not wanting anything could be seen as a valid personal choice. They might not value material possessions, or they might be making a statement against the greed they're witnessing. On the other hand, if the author had specific items in mind, not claiming them might be seen as not being assertive enough. But the author explicitly states they don't want anything, which is their right.\n\nThe step-siblings' reaction might stem from their own greed, assuming everyone wants to take items. The author's refusal could be a rejection of that materialistic mindset. The parents' reaction includes the mom smirking, suggesting maybe there was a prior understanding or that the author's response was expected. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. They have the right to choose not to take anything, especially if they disagree with the family's approach. The step-siblings' upset comes from their own expectations, not the author's wrongdoing. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
