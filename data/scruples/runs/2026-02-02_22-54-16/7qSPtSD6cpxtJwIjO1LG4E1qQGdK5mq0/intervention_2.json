They have been actively polling the rest of the family about what they would want when they die. Stepdad specifically is acting like he's going to die next week like it's on the calendar. My step-siblings have been going through the house like things are on layaway. No really, they put color-coded stickers on things to mark what everyone has dibs on. The boys put dibs on their dads moose head, deer antlers, computers, tools, guns and truck. The girls put dibs on the linens, blankets, patio furniture, appliances, couches and the jacuzzi. Even the grand kids are eyeing the fire tablets, laptops, TVs and surround sound. \n\nStepdad has museum artifact quality spears, swords, crossbows and muskets. All marked with a sticker of a 14y/o grandchild.\n\nI dont hang out with the step-siblings that often, never really warmed to them. They proven to be callow, vapid empty shells too self absorbed in their avarice to realize they are horrible human beings. So when I was over for a family dinner they are fighting over dibs on things they just found out about like a plot of land in Montana and snowmobiles in storage. I say nothing but my parents stopped the whole conversation and pointedly asked me what of theirs I would want. I looked around, the place looks like a sea of polka dots with all the stickers and I said I didnt want anything. The reaction I got was stunned silence. The step-siblings were incensed that I didn't go through the house like I was shopping and said I didnt want anything because everything was already taken.\n\nThere must have been a prior conversation because I saw my mom smirking at my stepdad like I told you so.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is at fault for saying they don't want anything from their parents' will. The situation involves their stepdad and mom creating wills, and the step-siblings are already claiming items with stickers. The author, when asked what they want, says nothing, causing a negative reaction from the family.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The step-siblings are acting greedy, marking up the house with stickers. The author isn't close to them and finds them unpleasant. When asked what they want, the author honestly says they don't want anything. The step-siblings are upset because they expected the author to claim something, but the author's response disrupts their expectations.\n\nIs the author wrong for not wanting anything? Well, people have different values. The author might not value material possessions as much as others. Also, the family's behavior seems excessive and inconsiderate. The author isn't taking anything that's already been claimed, so there's no conflict there. The step-siblings' anger seems more about their own greed being thwarted rather than the author having a legitimate grievance.\n\nThe parents might have expected the author to participate in the claiming, but if the author isn't interested in material things, that's their choice. The key here is that the author isn't taking anything that's already marked, so there's no direct conflict. The step-siblings are the ones acting selfishly, and the author's refusal to engage in their materialistic behavior isn't wrong. The parents' reaction might be surprising, but the author's stance is valid.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is B\u2014No, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
