They have been actively polling the rest of the family about what they would want when they die. Stepdad specifically is acting like he's going to die next week like it's on the calendar. My step-siblings have been going through the house like things are on layaway. No really, they put color-coded stickers on things to mark what everyone has dibs on. The boys put dibs on their dads moose head, deer antlers, computers, tools, guns and truck. The girls put dibs on the linens, blankets, patio furniture, appliances, couches and the jacuzzi. Even the grand kids are eyeing the fire tablets, laptops, TVs and surround sound. \n\nStepdad has museum artifact quality spears, swords, crossbows and muskets. All marked with a sticker of a 14y/o grandchild.\n\nI dont hang out with the step-siblings that often, never really warmed to them. They proven to be callow, vapid empty shells too self absorbed in their avarice to realize they are horrible human beings. So when I was over for a family dinner they are fighting over dibs on things they just found out about like a plot of land in Montana and snowmobiles in storage. I say nothing but my parents stopped the whole conversation and pointedly asked me what of theirs I would want. I looked around, the place looks like a sea of polka dots with all the stickers and I said I didnt want anything. The reaction I got was stunned silence. The step-siblings were incensed that I didn't go through the house like I was shopping and said I didnt want anything because everything was already taken.\n\nThere must have been a prior conversation because I saw my mom smirking at my stepdad like I told you so.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the original poster (OP) is in the wrong for saying they don't want anything from their parents' will. The situation involves the OP's stepdad and mom creating wills, and the rest of the family is already marking up the house with color-coded stickers to claim items. The step-siblings and even the grandparents are fighting over stuff like land, guns, tools, and electronics. The OP, who doesn't really get along with the step-siblings, says they don't want anything, and the family is shocked and upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The family is being very forward about taking items, even putting stickers on them. The OP isn't part of that dynamic\u2014they don't hang out with the step-siblings and find them shallow. When asked what they want, the OP honestly says nothing. The step-siblings are upset because they thought the OP would be part of the \"shopping\" process. \n\nSo, is the OP wrong? Well, the key points are honesty and the family's expectations. The OP was truthful about their feelings. They didn't try to claim anything others had already marked, which might have caused conflicts. The family's reaction is more about their own greed and expectations rather than the OP's actions. The OP's mom seems to have anticipated this, which might suggest she wasn't surprised by the OP's response. \n\nIn terms of fairness, people have the right to decide what they want in a will. The OP isn't taking anything others have claimed, so there's no conflict there. The issue is more about the family's entitlement and the OP not conforming to their expected behavior. The OP's stance is about personal choice and not engaging in what they see as a vapid competition. \n\nTherefore, the answer is likely B (No), the OP isn't in the wrong. They expressed their genuine feelings without causing harm, and the family's upset stems from their own actions and expectations.\n"
