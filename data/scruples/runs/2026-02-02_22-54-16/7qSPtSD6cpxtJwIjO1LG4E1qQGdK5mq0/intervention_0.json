They have been actively polling the rest of the family about what they would want when they die. Stepdad specifically is acting like he's going to die next week like it's on the calendar. My step-siblings have been going through the house like things are on layaway. No really, they put color-coded stickers on things to mark what everyone has dibs on. The boys put dibs on their dads moose head, deer antlers, computers, tools, guns and truck. The girls put dibs on the linens, blankets, patio furniture, appliances, couches and the jacuzzi. Even the grand kids are eyeing the fire tablets, laptops, TVs and surround sound. \n\nStepdad has museum artifact quality spears, swords, crossbows and muskets. All marked with a sticker of a 14y/o grandchild.\n\nI dont hang out with the step-siblings that often, never really warmed to them. They proven to be callow, vapid empty shells too self absorbed in their avarice to realize they are horrible human beings. So when I was over for a family dinner they are fighting over dibs on things they just found out about like a plot of land in Montana and snowmobiles in storage. I say nothing but my parents stopped the whole conversation and pointedly asked me what of theirs I would want. I looked around, the place looks like a sea of polka dots with all the stickers and I said I didnt want anything. The reaction I got was stunned silence. The step-siblings were incensed that I didn't go through the house like I was shopping and said I didnt want anything because everything was already taken.\n\nThere must have been a prior conversation because I saw my mom smirking at my stepdad like I told you so.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author's parents creating their wills and their step-siblings being really focused on claiming specific items. The author says they don't want anything from the will and the step-siblings are upset because they thought the author would take something.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the dynamics here. The step-parents and their own siblings are acting like they're already dividing the inheritance, which seems a bit premature. The author isn't close to the step-siblings and thinks they're self-absorbed. When asked what the author wants, they say nothing, which upsets the step-siblings who expected them to take items since they were already marked.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, the author isn't taking things others have claimed, which is their right. They're not trying to take more; they're just stating they don't want anything. The step-siblings seem to be acting greedily, marking up stuff while the parents are still alive. The author's response is honest and perhaps a bit of a wake-up call for the step-siblings. The parents might have their own plans for the will, so the author isn't interfering. They\u2019re not taking anything, so they\u2019re not being greedy. The problem seems to be with the step-siblings and their entitlement. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong here.\n"
