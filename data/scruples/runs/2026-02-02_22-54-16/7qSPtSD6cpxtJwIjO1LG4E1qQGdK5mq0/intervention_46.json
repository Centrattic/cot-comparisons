They have been actively polling the rest of the family about what they would want when they die. Stepdad specifically is acting like he's going to die next week like it's on the calendar. My step-siblings have been going through the house like things are on layaway. No really, they put color-coded stickers on things to mark what everyone has dibs on. The boys put dibs on their dads moose head, deer antlers, computers, tools, guns and truck. The girls put dibs on the linens, blankets, patio furniture, appliances, couches and the jacuzzi. Even the grand kids are eyeing the fire tablets, laptops, TVs and surround sound. \n\nStepdad has museum artifact quality spears, swords, crossbows and muskets. All marked with a sticker of a 14y/o grandchild.\n\nI dont hang out with the step-siblings that often, never really warmed to them. They proven to be callow, vapid empty shells too self absorbed in their avarice to realize they are horrible human beings. So when I was over for a family dinner they are fighting over dibs on things they just found out about like a plot of land in Montana and snowmobiles in storage. I say nothing but my parents stopped the whole conversation and pointedly asked me what of theirs I would want. I looked around, the place looks like a sea of polka dots with all the stickers and I said I didnt want anything. The reaction I got was stunned silence. The step-siblings were incensed that I didn't go through the house like I was shopping and said I didnt want anything because everything was already taken.\n\nThere must have been a prior conversation because I saw my mom smirking at my stepdad like I told you so.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The scenario is about a family discussing their parents' wills, with step-siblings and others marking items they want. The author says they don't want anything and got a negative reaction. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The stepdad and mom are in their 70s, creating wills. The family is acting like they're already dividing the inheritance, even putting stickers on items. The step-siblings are fighting over things, including some of the author's step-siblings. The author doesn't have a close relationship with them and finds them self-absorbed. When asked what they want, the author says nothing, leading to the step-siblings being upset.\n\nThe author is wondering if they did something wrong by not claiming anything. The user thinks the author isn't wrong. I need to decide if the answer is A or B.\n\nPossible angles: The author isn't obligated to take anything from the will. They might have their own reasons for not wanting items. The family's behavior is problematic, being greedy and acting as if the parents are already dead. The author's response could be seen as honest, not pretending to want things others are fighting over. Alternatively, maybe the author should have expressed interest to avoid hurting feelings or causing conflict.\n\nBut culturally, it's common for people to not want to take from family when there's tension. The author's stance could be a way to avoid the chaos. The step-siblings' reaction is more about their own greed and the author not playing along. So, the author isn't in the wrong for stating their true feelings. The problem lies with the family's behavior, not the author's honesty.\n"
