They have been actively polling the rest of the family about what they would want when they die. Stepdad specifically is acting like he's going to die next week like it's on the calendar. My step-siblings have been going through the house like things are on layaway. No really, they put color-coded stickers on things to mark what everyone has dibs on. The boys put dibs on their dads moose head, deer antlers, computers, tools, guns and truck. The girls put dibs on the linens, blankets, patio furniture, appliances, couches and the jacuzzi. Even the grand kids are eyeing the fire tablets, laptops, TVs and surround sound. \n\nStepdad has museum artifact quality spears, swords, crossbows and muskets. All marked with a sticker of a 14y/o grandchild.\n\nI dont hang out with the step-siblings that often, never really warmed to them. They proven to be callow, vapid empty shells too self absorbed in their avarice to realize they are horrible human beings. So when I was over for a family dinner they are fighting over dibs on things they just found out about like a plot of land in Montana and snowmobiles in storage. I say nothing but my parents stopped the whole conversation and pointedly asked me what of theirs I would want. I looked around, the place looks like a sea of polka dots with all the stickers and I said I didnt want anything. The reaction I got was stunned silence. The step-siblings were incensed that I didn't go through the house like I was shopping and said I didnt want anything because everything was already taken.\n\nThere must have been a prior conversation because I saw my mom smirking at my stepdad like I told you so.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is at fault for not wanting anything from their parents' will. The situation involves the step-parents and step-siblings marking up the house with stickers for inheritance. The author didn't want anything, which upset the step-siblings.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural norms around inheritance. In many places, people expect family to inherit things, but it's not a legal requirement. The author is in their 40s, so maybe they've established their own life and don't need the items. They might not see the point in fighting over material goods.\n\nThe step-siblings acted greedily, marking everything with stickers. The author's refusal could be seen as a way to avoid conflict. But maybe the parents expected them to want something. However, the parents did ask directly, and the author honestly said they didn't want anything. That seems fair.\n\nThe step-siblings' reaction is about their own greed, not the author's choice. The author isn't obligated to take things they don't want. So, no, the author isn't in the wrong. They're making a personal choice without causing harm. Answer B.\n"
