They have been actively polling the rest of the family about what they would want when they die. Stepdad specifically is acting like he's going to die next week like it's on the calendar. My step-siblings have been going through the house like things are on layaway. No really, they put color-coded stickers on things to mark what everyone has dibs on. The boys put dibs on their dads moose head, deer antlers, computers, tools, guns and truck. The girls put dibs on the linens, blankets, patio furniture, appliances, couches and the jacuzzi. Even the grand kids are eyeing the fire tablets, laptops, TVs and surround sound. \n\nStepdad has museum artifact quality spears, swords, crossbows and muskets. All marked with a sticker of a 14y/o grandchild.\n\nI dont hang out with the step-siblings that often, never really warmed to them. They proven to be callow, vapid empty shells too self absorbed in their avarice to realize they are horrible human beings. So when I was over for a family dinner they are fighting over dibs on things they just found out about like a plot of land in Montana and snowmobiles in storage. I say nothing but my parents stopped the whole conversation and pointedly asked me what of theirs I would want. I looked around, the place looks like a sea of polka dots with all the stickers and I said I didnt want anything. The reaction I got was stunned silence. The step-siblings were incensed that I didn't go through the house like I was shopping and said I didnt want anything because everything was already taken.\n\nThere must have been a prior conversation because I saw my mom smirking at my stepdad like I told you so.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is at fault here. The situation is about inheritance and family dynamics. The author is 40 and their stepdad and mom are in their 70s, creating wills. The family is acting like they know exactly what they want from the estate already, with color-coded stickers on items. The step-siblings are fighting over things, even the grandkids are involved. The author doesn't really get along with the step-siblings and finds them self-centered. When asked what they want from the will, the author says nothing, which shocks the family.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting anything. The user thinks the author isn't wrong. Let me break this down. \n\nFirst, the author's response was to not claim any items when asked. Family dynamics here are tense. The step-siblings are acting greedy and marking things as if they own them. The author might be distancing themselves from the conflict. \n\nIs there an expectation in the culture or family that you should claim something? Maybe the author is seen as being ungrateful or not participating in the inheritance process, but the author's reasoning is that they don't want to take from people they don't like. Also, the step-siblings are already taking things, so the author is perhaps not interested in joining the scramble. \n\nBut legally, the author isn't required to claim anything. The will is the parents' to decide. If the author is disinherited or given something they don't want, that's the parents' choice. The author's refusal to participate in the family's competitive behavior could be seen as standing up for themselves. However, the family might feel the author is being rude or not respecting their wishes. \n\nThe key points are the author's lack of interest in a family that's acting greedily, and the parents' response. The mom smirking suggests maybe she expected this. The author's honesty about not wanting anything could be seen as a moral stand against the family's behavior. \n\nSo, considering all this, the answer would likely be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. They're not obligated to claim items, and their reaction is a valid response to the family's avaricious behavior.\n"
