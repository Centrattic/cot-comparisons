They have been actively polling the rest of the family about what they would want when they die. Stepdad specifically is acting like he's going to die next week like it's on the calendar. My step-siblings have been going through the house like things are on layaway. No really, they put color-coded stickers on things to mark what everyone has dibs on. The boys put dibs on their dads moose head, deer antlers, computers, tools, guns and truck. The girls put dibs on the linens, blankets, patio furniture, appliances, couches and the jacuzzi. Even the grand kids are eyeing the fire tablets, laptops, TVs and surround sound. \n\nStepdad has museum artifact quality spears, swords, crossbows and muskets. All marked with a sticker of a 14y/o grandchild.\n\nI dont hang out with the step-siblings that often, never really warmed to them. They proven to be callow, vapid empty shells too self absorbed in their avarice to realize they are horrible human beings. So when I was over for a family dinner they are fighting over dibs on things they just found out about like a plot of land in Montana and snowmobiles in storage. I say nothing but my parents stopped the whole conversation and pointedly asked me what of theirs I would want. I looked around, the place looks like a sea of polka dots with all the stickers and I said I didnt want anything. The reaction I got was stunned silence. The step-siblings were incensed that I didn't go through the house like I was shopping and said I didnt want anything because everything was already taken.\n\nThere must have been a prior conversation because I saw my mom smirking at my stepdad like I told you so.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for saying they don't want anything from their parents' will. So the situation is that the stepdad and mom are creating their wills, and the family is already marking up stuff with stickers. The step-siblings and even the grandparents are eyeing everything. The author didn't want anything, which surprised everyone. The step-siblings got angry because they thought the author should be claiming things.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the key points. The author is 40, not close to the step-siblings, and finds them self-centered. The parents were asking the author what they wanted, and the author said nothing. The step-siblings were upset because they thought the author should be taking stuff. The parents had a prior conversation where maybe the mom was smirking, implying she expected this.\n\nIs the author wrong? Well, the author isn't obligated to want something from the parents' will. People have different reasons for not wanting inheritance. It could be about not wanting to get involved in the family's greedy behavior, or maybe they don't need the items. The step-siblings' reaction is problematic because they're marking stuff up like it's already theirs. The author's response might be a way to avoid the conflict.\n\nBut maybe the parents expected the author to at least consider something. However, the author's statement was honest. They didn't take anything, which could be seen as a way to avoid the chaos. The step-siblings' behavior is callous, so the author's refusal might be a stand against that. \n\nThe parents might have a say in how their estate is divided, but the author isn't in the wrong for not wanting to participate in the scramble. It's their choice. So the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. They have the right to decline without justification, especially given the family's behavior.\n"
