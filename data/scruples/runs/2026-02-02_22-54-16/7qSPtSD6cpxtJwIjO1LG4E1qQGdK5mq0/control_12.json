They have been actively polling the rest of the family about what they would want when they die. Stepdad specifically is acting like he's going to die next week like it's on the calendar. My step-siblings have been going through the house like things are on layaway. No really, they put color-coded stickers on things to mark what everyone has dibs on. The boys put dibs on their dads moose head, deer antlers, computers, tools, guns and truck. The girls put dibs on the linens, blankets, patio furniture, appliances, couches and the jacuzzi. Even the grand kids are eyeing the fire tablets, laptops, TVs and surround sound. \n\nStepdad has museum artifact quality spears, swords, crossbows and muskets. All marked with a sticker of a 14y/o grandchild.\n\nI dont hang out with the step-siblings that often, never really warmed to them. They proven to be callow, vapid empty shells too self absorbed in their avarice to realize they are horrible human beings. So when I was over for a family dinner they are fighting over dibs on things they just found out about like a plot of land in Montana and snowmobiles in storage. I say nothing but my parents stopped the whole conversation and pointedly asked me what of theirs I would want. I looked around, the place looks like a sea of polka dots with all the stickers and I said I didnt want anything. The reaction I got was stunned silence. The step-siblings were incensed that I didn't go through the house like I was shopping and said I didnt want anything because everything was already taken.\n\nThere must have been a prior conversation because I saw my mom smirking at my stepdad like I told you so.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a family where the parents are creating their wills, and various family members are already marking items they want. The author says they don't want anything from the will, which surprises the family, especially the step-siblings. The question is, is the author at fault here?\n\nFirst, I need to recall the details. The parents are in their 70s, and the stepdad is acting like he'll die soon. The step-siblings and even the grandchildren are putting stickers on items they want. The author doesn't get along well with the step-siblings, thinks they're greedy and self-absorbed. When asked what they want, the author says nothing, leading to a negative reaction from the family.\n\nThe key points here are about the author's right to decline participating in the inheritance process. In many cultures, especially in Western ones, it's common for people to have their own preferences about inheritance, and not wanting anything isn't necessarily wrong. However, the family might expect everyone to have a claim, especially if there's a sense of entitlement.\n\nBut the author's perspective is that the step-siblings are greedy, and they don't want to engage. They might feel that the family's approach is inappropriate, and by not claiming anything, they're making a statement. The parents' reaction could be surprise or disapproval, but does that mean the author is in the wrong?\n\nLegally, the author isn't obligated to claim anything. Emotionally, maybe the family feels hurt or surprised, but the author isn't violating any rules. The step-siblings' behavior is problematic, so the author's decision not to participate could be seen as a boundary they needed to set.\n\nAnother angle: The author might be protecting their own feelings. They don't have a close relationship with the step-siblings, and the family's greed is off-putting. Choosing not to engage in the competition for inheritance is a personal choice. There's no obligation to take things if they don't want them.\n\nHowever, maybe there's an unspoken expectation in the family to have some claim, and the author's refusal could hurt the parents' feelings. But the parents are the ones creating the wills, so they should know what their children want. If the author truly doesn't want anything, that's their right.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong for stating their preference. The family's reaction is more about their own expectations and issues with the step-siblings. The author's response is a personal choice, not a transgression.\n"
