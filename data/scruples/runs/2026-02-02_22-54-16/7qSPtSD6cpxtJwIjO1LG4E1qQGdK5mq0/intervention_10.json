They have been actively polling the rest of the family about what they would want when they die. Stepdad specifically is acting like he's going to die next week like it's on the calendar. My step-siblings have been going through the house like things are on layaway. No really, they put color-coded stickers on things to mark what everyone has dibs on. The boys put dibs on their dads moose head, deer antlers, computers, tools, guns and truck. The girls put dibs on the linens, blankets, patio furniture, appliances, couches and the jacuzzi. Even the grand kids are eyeing the fire tablets, laptops, TVs and surround sound. \n\nStepdad has museum artifact quality spears, swords, crossbows and muskets. All marked with a sticker of a 14y/o grandchild.\n\nI dont hang out with the step-siblings that often, never really warmed to them. They proven to be callow, vapid empty shells too self absorbed in their avarice to realize they are horrible human beings. So when I was over for a family dinner they are fighting over dibs on things they just found out about like a plot of land in Montana and snowmobiles in storage. I say nothing but my parents stopped the whole conversation and pointedly asked me what of theirs I would want. I looked around, the place looks like a sea of polka dots with all the stickers and I said I didnt want anything. The reaction I got was stunned silence. The step-siblings were incensed that I didn't go through the house like I was shopping and said I didnt want anything because everything was already taken.\n\nThere must have been a prior conversation because I saw my mom smirking at my stepdad like I told you so.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author's stepdad and mom are making their wills, and the whole family is acting like they're going to inherit stuff already. The step-siblings are marking up the house with stickers for what they want, even the grandkids. The author doesn't really get along with the step-siblings and thinks they're self-absorbed. When asked what they want from the will, the author says nothing, which shocks everyone. The step-siblings are mad because they thought the author would take something.\n\nHmm, the question is whether the author is wrong for saying they don't want anything. Let's break it down. The author's response is a personal choice. They might not feel entitled to the inheritance, especially if they have a strained relationship with the step-siblings. The fact that the family is acting like they're already in possession of the items might be part of the problem. The author isn't taking anything, which could be seen as a way to avoid conflict or because they don't value the items. \n\nBut why would the author be in the wrong? Maybe because they didn't participate in the marking or didn't express interest? But the author explains they don't hang out with the step-siblings and don't like them. So maybe their response is justified as a reflection of their relationship. Also, the parents might have expected the author to have some claim, but if the author isn't close to the family, it's possible they don't want to engage in the family's antics. \n\nAnother angle: the parents asked the author directly, so maybe they wanted to know for their own planning. The author's refusal could be seen as a passive-aggressive move or just honesty. The step-siblings being upset might be because they expected the author to take something, but the author's response disrupts their plans. However, the author isn't obligated to participate in the family's behavior. \n\nI think the key points are the author's personal feelings towards the step-siblings, the family's over-the-top behavior, and the author's right to choose not to take anything. The author isn't wrong for making a personal choice based on their relationship and values. So the answer is B.\n"
