They have been actively polling the rest of the family about what they would want when they die. Stepdad specifically is acting like he's going to die next week like it's on the calendar. My step-siblings have been going through the house like things are on layaway. No really, they put color-coded stickers on things to mark what everyone has dibs on. The boys put dibs on their dads moose head, deer antlers, computers, tools, guns and truck. The girls put dibs on the linens, blankets, patio furniture, appliances, couches and the jacuzzi. Even the grand kids are eyeing the fire tablets, laptops, TVs and surround sound. \n\nStepdad has museum artifact quality spears, swords, crossbows and muskets. All marked with a sticker of a 14y/o grandchild.\n\nI dont hang out with the step-siblings that often, never really warmed to them. They proven to be callow, vapid empty shells too self absorbed in their avarice to realize they are horrible human beings. So when I was over for a family dinner they are fighting over dibs on things they just found out about like a plot of land in Montana and snowmobiles in storage. I say nothing but my parents stopped the whole conversation and pointedly asked me what of theirs I would want. I looked around, the place looks like a sea of polka dots with all the stickers and I said I didnt want anything. The reaction I got was stunned silence. The step-siblings were incensed that I didn't go through the house like I was shopping and said I didnt want anything because everything was already taken.\n\nThere must have been a prior conversation because I saw my mom smirking at my stepdad like I told you so.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author's parents creating their wills and the step-siblings marking up all the household items with stickers. The author, when asked what they want, said they don't want anything because everything's already taken. The step-siblings got upset, and the author's mom seemed to smirk at the stepdad.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The family is in the process of planning their wills, which can be a sensitive topic. The step-siblings are acting greedy, marking items even before the parents have passed. The author, who isn't close to them, chose not to participate in this scramble. When asked, the author honestly stated they don't want anything, perhaps feeling that the step-siblings are taking it all anyway. \n\nThe key points here are the author's right to their own wishes. The parents asked the author directly, so the author's response is their personal choice. There's no obligation to want something from the will. The step-siblings' reaction is more about their own greed and frustration that the author isn't playing along. The author's decision not to claim anything isn't harmful; in fact, it might be a way to avoid conflict. \n\nAlso, the author's mom smirking suggests she might agree with the author's stance, maybe implying that the step-siblings were expecting the author to want something but were proven wrong. The author isn't taking anything, so there's no real wrongdoing. They're just stating their preferences. The step-siblings' behavior is problematic, but the author isn't at fault here for not engaging in their game. \n\nSo, the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
