They have been actively polling the rest of the family about what they would want when they die. Stepdad specifically is acting like he's going to die next week like it's on the calendar. My step-siblings have been going through the house like things are on layaway. No really, they put color-coded stickers on things to mark what everyone has dibs on. The boys put dibs on their dads moose head, deer antlers, computers, tools, guns and truck. The girls put dibs on the linens, blankets, patio furniture, appliances, couches and the jacuzzi. Even the grand kids are eyeing the fire tablets, laptops, TVs and surround sound. \n\nStepdad has museum artifact quality spears, swords, crossbows and muskets. All marked with a sticker of a 14y/o grandchild.\n\nI dont hang out with the step-siblings that often, never really warmed to them. They proven to be callow, vapid empty shells too self absorbed in their avarice to realize they are horrible human beings. So when I was over for a family dinner they are fighting over dibs on things they just found out about like a plot of land in Montana and snowmobiles in storage. I say nothing but my parents stopped the whole conversation and pointedly asked me what of theirs I would want. I looked around, the place looks like a sea of polka dots with all the stickers and I said I didnt want anything. The reaction I got was stunned silence. The step-siblings were incensed that I didn't go through the house like I was shopping and said I didnt want anything because everything was already taken.\n\nThere must have been a prior conversation because I saw my mom smirking at my stepdad like I told you so.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for not wanting anything from their parents' will. The situation involves the stepdad and mom creating their wills, and the family is already divvying up assets with stickers. The step-siblings and even the kids are fighting over stuff. The author doesn't get along with the step-siblings and sees them as greedy. When asked what they want, the author says nothing, which shocks the family.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. Legally, a person isn't obligated to take anything from a will; they can disclaim an inheritance. So the author isn't doing anything illegal here. Ethically, the family might feel the author is being cold or not showing gratitude, but the author's perspective is that the step-siblings are already grabbing everything, and they don't want to participate in that behavior.\n\nThe key points are the family's avarice and the author's disinterest in joining that. The author's response might be seen as a moral stance against greed, especially since they don't have a close relationship with the step-siblings. The parents' reaction\u2014stunned silence and the step-siblings being incensed\u2014suggests that the family expected everyone to grab as much as possible, but the author's refusal highlights their hypocrisy.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, they didn't take anything that wasn't offered to them. They were asked directly and chose not to participate. There's no indication they tried to take something away from the step-siblings. The author's stance could be seen as principled, especially if they feel the family is acting greedily before the parents have even passed. So, from a moral standpoint, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
