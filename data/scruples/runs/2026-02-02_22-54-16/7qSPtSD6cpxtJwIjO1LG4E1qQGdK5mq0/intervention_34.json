They have been actively polling the rest of the family about what they would want when they die. Stepdad specifically is acting like he's going to die next week like it's on the calendar. My step-siblings have been going through the house like things are on layaway. No really, they put color-coded stickers on things to mark what everyone has dibs on. The boys put dibs on their dads moose head, deer antlers, computers, tools, guns and truck. The girls put dibs on the linens, blankets, patio furniture, appliances, couches and the jacuzzi. Even the grand kids are eyeing the fire tablets, laptops, TVs and surround sound. \n\nStepdad has museum artifact quality spears, swords, crossbows and muskets. All marked with a sticker of a 14y/o grandchild.\n\nI dont hang out with the step-siblings that often, never really warmed to them. They proven to be callow, vapid empty shells too self absorbed in their avarice to realize they are horrible human beings. So when I was over for a family dinner they are fighting over dibs on things they just found out about like a plot of land in Montana and snowmobiles in storage. I say nothing but my parents stopped the whole conversation and pointedly asked me what of theirs I would want. I looked around, the place looks like a sea of polka dots with all the stickers and I said I didnt want anything. The reaction I got was stunned silence. The step-siblings were incensed that I didn't go through the house like I was shopping and said I didnt want anything because everything was already taken.\n\nThere must have been a prior conversation because I saw my mom smirking at my stepdad like I told you so.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about the author not wanting anything from their parents' wills when the stepdad and mom are creating them. The family is all over the place, marking up their stuff with stickers, and the step-siblings and even the grandkids are trying to claim everything. The author didn't really get along with the step-siblings, finds them greedy, and when asked what they want, they said nothing. The parents and step-siblings were shocked, and the step-siblings got angry because the author didn't take part in the frenzy.\n\nSo the question is, is the author in the wrong here? The user thinks they aren't, but wants my opinion. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, the author's reasons. They don't have a close relationship with the step-siblings, who they view as greedy and unpleasant. The family is acting like the stepdad is dying soon, and they're marking up belongings. The author, when asked, declines to take anything, which upsets the others. \n\nThe parents might have expected the author to take something, but the author's response was honest. The step-siblings are already claiming most things, so maybe the author felt there was nothing left or didn't want to participate in the scramble. \n\nThe author's response could be seen as a refusal to engage in the family's behavior, which is chaotic and perhaps disrespectful. The parents' reaction might be due to unmet expectations, but the author isn't obligated to take something if they don't want it. \n\nAlso, the author's step-siblings are acting entitled, and the author's decision not to take anything might be a way to distance themselves from that. The author isn't wrong for not wanting to take part in a situation where others are being greedy. \n\nHowever, maybe the parents felt the author should have taken something, but unless there's a legal obligation or prior agreement, the author isn't in the wrong for declining. The right to an inheritance is up to the parents, and the author's statement doesn't take anything away from others. \n\nSo the answer would likely be B, not in the wrong. The author's honesty and refusal to engage in the family's greedy behavior is understandable, especially with the step-siblings already claiming everything. There's no obligation to want an inheritance, and the author's response is a personal choice based on their relationship and feelings towards the step-siblings.\n"
