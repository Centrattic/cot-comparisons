They have been actively polling the rest of the family about what they would want when they die. Stepdad specifically is acting like he's going to die next week like it's on the calendar. My step-siblings have been going through the house like things are on layaway. No really, they put color-coded stickers on things to mark what everyone has dibs on. The boys put dibs on their dads moose head, deer antlers, computers, tools, guns and truck. The girls put dibs on the linens, blankets, patio furniture, appliances, couches and the jacuzzi. Even the grand kids are eyeing the fire tablets, laptops, TVs and surround sound. \n\nStepdad has museum artifact quality spears, swords, crossbows and muskets. All marked with a sticker of a 14y/o grandchild.\n\nI dont hang out with the step-siblings that often, never really warmed to them. They proven to be callow, vapid empty shells too self absorbed in their avarice to realize they are horrible human beings. So when I was over for a family dinner they are fighting over dibs on things they just found out about like a plot of land in Montana and snowmobiles in storage. I say nothing but my parents stopped the whole conversation and pointedly asked me what of theirs I would want. I looked around, the place looks like a sea of polka dots with all the stickers and I said I didnt want anything. The reaction I got was stunned silence. The step-siblings were incensed that I didn't go through the house like I was shopping and said I didnt want anything because everything was already taken.\n\nThere must have been a prior conversation because I saw my mom smirking at my stepdad like I told you so.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for saying they don't want anything from their parents' will. \n\nFirst, the situation: The stepdad and mom are creating their wills, and the family is acting like the house is already up for grabs. The step-siblings and even the grandkids are marking items with stickers, being really greedy. The author doesn't get along with the step-siblings, who they think are selfish. When asked what they want, the author says nothing, which shocks the family.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is at fault. The options are A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no). \n\nThe key points here are the author's right to refuse inheritance. Inheritance isn't a right; people can choose to disinherit themselves if they want. The author is not obligated to take anything. The family's reaction might be hurtful, but the author isn't wrong for making that choice, especially given the context of the other family members being greedy. Also, the author's relationship with the step-siblings is strained, so their decision could be based on personal feelings. \n\nThere's no indication the author is trying to be spiteful, just that they don't want to participate in the scramble. The law usually allows people to disclaim inheritance, so the author isn't in the wrong. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
