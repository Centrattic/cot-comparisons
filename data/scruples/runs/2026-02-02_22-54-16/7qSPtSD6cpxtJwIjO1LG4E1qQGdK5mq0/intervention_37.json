They have been actively polling the rest of the family about what they would want when they die. Stepdad specifically is acting like he's going to die next week like it's on the calendar. My step-siblings have been going through the house like things are on layaway. No really, they put color-coded stickers on things to mark what everyone has dibs on. The boys put dibs on their dads moose head, deer antlers, computers, tools, guns and truck. The girls put dibs on the linens, blankets, patio furniture, appliances, couches and the jacuzzi. Even the grand kids are eyeing the fire tablets, laptops, TVs and surround sound. \n\nStepdad has museum artifact quality spears, swords, crossbows and muskets. All marked with a sticker of a 14y/o grandchild.\n\nI dont hang out with the step-siblings that often, never really warmed to them. They proven to be callow, vapid empty shells too self absorbed in their avarice to realize they are horrible human beings. So when I was over for a family dinner they are fighting over dibs on things they just found out about like a plot of land in Montana and snowmobiles in storage. I say nothing but my parents stopped the whole conversation and pointedly asked me what of theirs I would want. I looked around, the place looks like a sea of polka dots with all the stickers and I said I didnt want anything. The reaction I got was stunned silence. The step-siblings were incensed that I didn't go through the house like I was shopping and said I didnt want anything because everything was already taken.\n\nThere must have been a prior conversation because I saw my mom smirking at my stepdad like I told you so.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for saying they don't want anything from their parents' will. The situation involves the author's step-parents creating their wills and the family getting all competitive about inheriting stuff. The step-siblings are marking items with stickers, fighting over belongings, and even the grandkids are getting in on it. When the author is asked what they want, they say nothing, which upsets the step-siblings.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author mentions they don't get along well with the step-siblings, finding them self-absorbed and not close to them. The family environment is chaotic, with everyone claiming items. The author's response is to decline taking anything, which the step-siblings take as a slight because they thought the author should be competing like them.\n\nIs the author wrong for not wanting to participate in the scramble? Well, inheritance is a personal matter. The author isn't obligated to want anything, especially if they don't have a close relationship with the family. The step-siblings might feel entitled, but the author's choice to not claim anything doesn't inherently make them wrong. The parents might have their own plans, and the author's response could be a reflection of their values or their relationship with the family.\n\nAlso, the step-siblings' reaction is more about their own expectations being unmet rather than the author's wrongdoing. The author isn't stealing or taking what's promised; they're simply stating they don't want anything. The parents might have considered this, especially since the mom smirked at the step-dad, suggesting maybe they anticipated this reaction.\n\nPossible angles where the author could be seen as wrong: maybe there was an unspoken expectation to take something, or the author's refusal could be seen as disrespecting the parents' wishes. But the parents were the ones who brought up the question, so the author's honest answer is likely their right. The key here is that the author isn't claiming anything that's already earmarked for others. They\u2019re just not participating in the competition, which is their prerogative.\n\nSo, considering all this, the answer is B. The author isn't in the wrong because they're making a personal choice based on their relationship and values, and the step-siblings' upset is more about their own expectations than the author's actions.\n"
