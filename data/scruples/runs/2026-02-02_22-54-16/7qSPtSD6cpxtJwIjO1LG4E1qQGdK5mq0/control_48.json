They have been actively polling the rest of the family about what they would want when they die. Stepdad specifically is acting like he's going to die next week like it's on the calendar. My step-siblings have been going through the house like things are on layaway. No really, they put color-coded stickers on things to mark what everyone has dibs on. The boys put dibs on their dads moose head, deer antlers, computers, tools, guns and truck. The girls put dibs on the linens, blankets, patio furniture, appliances, couches and the jacuzzi. Even the grand kids are eyeing the fire tablets, laptops, TVs and surround sound. \n\nStepdad has museum artifact quality spears, swords, crossbows and muskets. All marked with a sticker of a 14y/o grandchild.\n\nI dont hang out with the step-siblings that often, never really warmed to them. They proven to be callow, vapid empty shells too self absorbed in their avarice to realize they are horrible human beings. So when I was over for a family dinner they are fighting over dibs on things they just found out about like a plot of land in Montana and snowmobiles in storage. I say nothing but my parents stopped the whole conversation and pointedly asked me what of theirs I would want. I looked around, the place looks like a sea of polka dots with all the stickers and I said I didnt want anything. The reaction I got was stunned silence. The step-siblings were incensed that I didn't go through the house like I was shopping and said I didnt want anything because everything was already taken.\n\nThere must have been a prior conversation because I saw my mom smirking at my stepdad like I told you so.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for saying they don't want anything from their parents' will.\n\nFirst, the situation: The person's stepdad and mom are creating their wills, and the family is acting like they're already planning the inheritance. The step-siblings and even the grandchildren are marking items with stickers. The author isn't close to the step-siblings and thinks they're self-absorbed. When asked what they want, the author says nothing because everything is already taken. The step-siblings got mad about that.\n\nHmm. The key points here are the author's right to decide what they want. Legally, the author can choose to disclaim or take nothing. But maybe the step-siblings are upset because they expected the author to claim something. However, the author isn't part of the same family dynamics and isn't close to them. Also, the step-siblings are acting greedy, which the author criticizes. The author's response was honest about not wanting anything, which might be seen as a personal choice. \n\nIs the author wrong for not wanting to engage in the family's inheritance squabbles? Probably not. They have the right to decline. The step-siblings' reaction is more about their own expectations rather than the author's wrongdoing. The parents might be surprised, but that's their issue. The author isn't violating any rules here. So the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
