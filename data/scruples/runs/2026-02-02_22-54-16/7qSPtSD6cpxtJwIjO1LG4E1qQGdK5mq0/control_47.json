They have been actively polling the rest of the family about what they would want when they die. Stepdad specifically is acting like he's going to die next week like it's on the calendar. My step-siblings have been going through the house like things are on layaway. No really, they put color-coded stickers on things to mark what everyone has dibs on. The boys put dibs on their dads moose head, deer antlers, computers, tools, guns and truck. The girls put dibs on the linens, blankets, patio furniture, appliances, couches and the jacuzzi. Even the grand kids are eyeing the fire tablets, laptops, TVs and surround sound. \n\nStepdad has museum artifact quality spears, swords, crossbows and muskets. All marked with a sticker of a 14y/o grandchild.\n\nI dont hang out with the step-siblings that often, never really warmed to them. They proven to be callow, vapid empty shells too self absorbed in their avarice to realize they are horrible human beings. So when I was over for a family dinner they are fighting over dibs on things they just found out about like a plot of land in Montana and snowmobiles in storage. I say nothing but my parents stopped the whole conversation and pointedly asked me what of theirs I would want. I looked around, the place looks like a sea of polka dots with all the stickers and I said I didnt want anything. The reaction I got was stunned silence. The step-siblings were incensed that I didn't go through the house like I was shopping and said I didnt want anything because everything was already taken.\n\nThere must have been a prior conversation because I saw my mom smirking at my stepdad like I told you so.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about the author not wanting to take anything from their parents' will. The parents and step-siblings are all marking up stuff they want when the parents die.\n\nSo, the author is 40, and their stepdad and mom are making their wills. The step-siblings are already putting stickers on stuff, even the grandkids are eyeing electronics. The author doesn't get along with the step-siblings, who they think are greedy and shallow. When asked what they want, the author says nothing, and the family is shocked. The step-siblings are upset because they thought everyone would take stuff. The author's mom seems smug, probably because she had a prior discussion with the stepdad.\n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong for not wanting anything. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nHmm. Legally, the author isn't in the will yet. The question is more about moral or social wrong. The author isn't taking anything, while others are fighting over stuff. The step-siblings are greedy, and the author might be avoiding the conflict. The parents probably expected their kids to want things, but the author isn't interested. \n\nIs there a duty to take something? Probably not. The author is free to decline. The family's reaction is their problem. The author isn't stealing; they're just not claiming anything. The step-siblings' behavior is more questionable, taking even specific items like a 14-year-old's stickers on weapons. The author's choice to not participate in the scramble isn't wrong. They might be avoiding the greed, which is a valid response. So the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
