They have been actively polling the rest of the family about what they would want when they die. Stepdad specifically is acting like he's going to die next week like it's on the calendar. My step-siblings have been going through the house like things are on layaway. No really, they put color-coded stickers on things to mark what everyone has dibs on. The boys put dibs on their dads moose head, deer antlers, computers, tools, guns and truck. The girls put dibs on the linens, blankets, patio furniture, appliances, couches and the jacuzzi. Even the grand kids are eyeing the fire tablets, laptops, TVs and surround sound. \n\nStepdad has museum artifact quality spears, swords, crossbows and muskets. All marked with a sticker of a 14y/o grandchild.\n\nI dont hang out with the step-siblings that often, never really warmed to them. They proven to be callow, vapid empty shells too self absorbed in their avarice to realize they are horrible human beings. So when I was over for a family dinner they are fighting over dibs on things they just found out about like a plot of land in Montana and snowmobiles in storage. I say nothing but my parents stopped the whole conversation and pointedly asked me what of theirs I would want. I looked around, the place looks like a sea of polka dots with all the stickers and I said I didnt want anything. The reaction I got was stunned silence. The step-siblings were incensed that I didn't go through the house like I was shopping and said I didnt want anything because everything was already taken.\n\nThere must have been a prior conversation because I saw my mom smirking at my stepdad like I told you so.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for stating they don't want anything from their parents' will. Let's start by breaking down the situation.\n\nFirst, the parents are in their 70s and creating wills. The step-parent and mom have been polling the family about what they want. The step-parent is acting like he's going to die soon, and the step-siblings are already marking items in the house with colored stickers. The step-siblings are dividing up stuff like moose heads, tools, furniture, etc. The author doesn't get along well with the step-siblings, finding them self-centered and avaricious. When asked what they want from the parents' will, the author says nothing, which surprises the family. The step-siblings are upset because they thought the author would want something, but the mom seems smug about it. The author is now wondering if they're in the wrong.\n\nSo, the key points here are:\n1. The author's step-siblings are acting greedy and opportunistic.\n2. The author doesn't want to participate in the scramble for inheritance.\n3. The author's response was unexpected and caused tension.\n4. The parents might have expected the author to claim something, but the author chose not to.\n\nNow, considering ethics and common sense, is the author wrong? The author isn't taking anything, which could be seen as selfless or indifferent. The step-siblings are being greedy, so the author's decision not to participate might be justified. However, maybe there's an unspoken expectation in families to claim items, especially if they have sentimental value. But the author's reasoning is that the step-siblings are already taking everything, and they don't want to add to that. Also, the parents might have different plans for distributing their assets, and the author's refusal could be freeing up resources for others or respecting the parents' wishes in a different way.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the author should have at least expressed interest in something to avoid appearing dismissive or ungrateful. But given the context of the step-siblings' behavior, the author's choice seems reasonable. It's also possible that the parents wanted to ensure their children (even step) are provided for, but the author is making a conscious decision not to take anything, which could be a personal choice rather than a wrong one.\n\nIn the AITA subreddit, people often consider intentions and context. If the step-siblings are acting out of greed, the author's refusal is a valid response. The parents might appreciate their child not being caught up in the conflict. Therefore, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
