They have been actively polling the rest of the family about what they would want when they die. Stepdad specifically is acting like he's going to die next week like it's on the calendar. My step-siblings have been going through the house like things are on layaway. No really, they put color-coded stickers on things to mark what everyone has dibs on. The boys put dibs on their dads moose head, deer antlers, computers, tools, guns and truck. The girls put dibs on the linens, blankets, patio furniture, appliances, couches and the jacuzzi. Even the grand kids are eyeing the fire tablets, laptops, TVs and surround sound. \n\nStepdad has museum artifact quality spears, swords, crossbows and muskets. All marked with a sticker of a 14y/o grandchild.\n\nI dont hang out with the step-siblings that often, never really warmed to them. They proven to be callow, vapid empty shells too self absorbed in their avarice to realize they are horrible human beings. So when I was over for a family dinner they are fighting over dibs on things they just found out about like a plot of land in Montana and snowmobiles in storage. I say nothing but my parents stopped the whole conversation and pointedly asked me what of theirs I would want. I looked around, the place looks like a sea of polka dots with all the stickers and I said I didnt want anything. The reaction I got was stunned silence. The step-siblings were incensed that I didn't go through the house like I was shopping and said I didnt want anything because everything was already taken.\n\nThere must have been a prior conversation because I saw my mom smirking at my stepdad like I told you so.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for saying they don't want anything from their parents' will. The situation involves step-parents creating their wills and the family, including step-siblings, marking up the house with stickers for inheritance. The author didn't want anything and got a negative reaction from the step-siblings.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The step-parents are in their 70s and making wills, which is a normal process. The family is acting overly eager, even childish, by marking items with stickers. The author is not close to the step-siblings and even criticizes them as \"callow, vapid empty shells.\" So the author's response of not wanting anything seems like a genuine reaction to the absurdity of the situation.\n\nThe key point is whether the author is wrong for declining to participate in the inheritance scramble. Legally, people have the right to disclaim inheritance, so the author isn't doing anything wrong in that sense. The family's reaction might stem from their own entitlement, but the author isn't obligated to take anything. Also, the author's mom smirking suggests maybe she agreed with the author's stance, which could imply that the parents aren't upset either.\n\nThe step-siblings got angry because they expected the author to take something, but the author's refusal highlights their own greed. The author's statement that they don't want anything is a valid choice and doesn't harm anyone else. There's no indication the author is being selfish or disrespectful; rather, they're not participating in a family that's already being unreasonable.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
