They have been actively polling the rest of the family about what they would want when they die. Stepdad specifically is acting like he's going to die next week like it's on the calendar. My step-siblings have been going through the house like things are on layaway. No really, they put color-coded stickers on things to mark what everyone has dibs on. The boys put dibs on their dads moose head, deer antlers, computers, tools, guns and truck. The girls put dibs on the linens, blankets, patio furniture, appliances, couches and the jacuzzi. Even the grand kids are eyeing the fire tablets, laptops, TVs and surround sound. \n\nStepdad has museum artifact quality spears, swords, crossbows and muskets. All marked with a sticker of a 14y/o grandchild.\n\nI dont hang out with the step-siblings that often, never really warmed to them. They proven to be callow, vapid empty shells too self absorbed in their avarice to realize they are horrible human beings. So when I was over for a family dinner they are fighting over dibs on things they just found out about like a plot of land in Montana and snowmobiles in storage. I say nothing but my parents stopped the whole conversation and pointedly asked me what of theirs I would want. I looked around, the place looks like a sea of polka dots with all the stickers and I said I didnt want anything. The reaction I got was stunned silence. The step-siblings were incensed that I didn't go through the house like I was shopping and said I didnt want anything because everything was already taken.\n\nThere must have been a prior conversation because I saw my mom smirking at my stepdad like I told you so.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a will and how the family is handling it. The author is 40, their stepdad and mom are in their 70s, creating wills. The family members are putting stickers on things they want, acting like they're already entitled to them. The author didn't want anything and said so when asked, leading to negative reactions from the step-siblings.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author didn't engage in the process of claiming items because they don't get along with the step-siblings and see them as self-absorbed. When asked directly, they declined to take anything, maybe because they felt it was already taken or they genuinely don't care. The step-siblings are upset, and the parents seem to have had a prior discussion where the author's mom was smug about it.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. I need to evaluate this.\n\nLegally, the author isn't entitled to anything unless specified in the will. They have no obligation to claim items, so there's no legal wrongdoing. The issue is more about family dynamics and expectations. The step-siblings might feel the author is being greedy or disrespectful by not expressing interest. However, the author's reasoning is that they don't want to participate in the siblings' avaricious behavior. They might feel that the process is inappropriate or that the step-siblings are being too forward. \n\nIs there a moral obligation to express interest? Not necessarily. The author isn't claiming they should get anything, just that they don't want it. The problem arises from the step-siblings' entitlement and the author's non-participation. The parents might have expected the author to join the bidding, but the author chose not to. The mother's smirk suggests she might have anticipated this, possibly disapproving of the siblings' behavior. \n\nIn some cultures or families, it's considered impolite to not express interest in inherited items, but it's not a universal rule. The author's decision could be seen as a boundary, avoiding conflict or the appearance of greed. Alternatively, some might think the author should have at least pretended to be interested to maintain family harmony. \n\nHowever, the step-siblings are acting entitled, marking items with stickers and fighting over them. The author's refusal to participate might be a way to reject that behavior. Since the author isn't taking anything, they aren't causing harm. The issue is more about the family's approach to the will. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. They have the right to decline and are not obligated to participate in a process that they find distasteful. The step-siblings are in the wrong for their entitlement. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
