They have been actively polling the rest of the family about what they would want when they die. Stepdad specifically is acting like he's going to die next week like it's on the calendar. My step-siblings have been going through the house like things are on layaway. No really, they put color-coded stickers on things to mark what everyone has dibs on. The boys put dibs on their dads moose head, deer antlers, computers, tools, guns and truck. The girls put dibs on the linens, blankets, patio furniture, appliances, couches and the jacuzzi. Even the grand kids are eyeing the fire tablets, laptops, TVs and surround sound. \n\nStepdad has museum artifact quality spears, swords, crossbows and muskets. All marked with a sticker of a 14y/o grandchild.\n\nI dont hang out with the step-siblings that often, never really warmed to them. They proven to be callow, vapid empty shells too self absorbed in their avarice to realize they are horrible human beings. So when I was over for a family dinner they are fighting over dibs on things they just found out about like a plot of land in Montana and snowmobiles in storage. I say nothing but my parents stopped the whole conversation and pointedly asked me what of theirs I would want. I looked around, the place looks like a sea of polka dots with all the stickers and I said I didnt want anything. The reaction I got was stunned silence. The step-siblings were incensed that I didn't go through the house like I was shopping and said I didnt want anything because everything was already taken.\n\nThere must have been a prior conversation because I saw my mom smirking at my stepdad like I told you so.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for saying they don't want anything from their parents' will. The situation is that the parents and step-siblings are already fighting over stuff, with everything labeled. The author didn't want anything, and the family was surprised or upset.\n\nSo, first, the author's position: they don't want any inheritance. They mention they don't hang out with the step-siblings and think they're not great people. But when asked, they just said they don't want anything. The step-siblings got angry because they thought the author should be taking stuff. The parents had a prior conversation where the mom smirked, suggesting maybe she agreed with the author's stance.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, inheritance can be a sensitive topic. If the parents are setting up their wills, the author's decision not to take anything might be their choice. They might not want to get involved in the family's squabbles. On the other hand, maybe the parents expected them to take something, but the author is clear they don't want to. \n\nThe step-siblings are acting greedy, which the author points out. The author's response might be a refusal to participate in the conflict. Legally, the author isn't obligated to take anything. Emotionally, perhaps the parents feel slighted, but the author isn't in the wrong for making a personal choice. The step-siblings' reaction is more about their own greed than the author's right to decline. \n\nSo, the answer is likely B (No), because the author isn't obligated to take anything and their decision is their personal choice, especially given the family's behavior.\n"
