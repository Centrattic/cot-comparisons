They have been actively polling the rest of the family about what they would want when they die. Stepdad specifically is acting like he's going to die next week like it's on the calendar. My step-siblings have been going through the house like things are on layaway. No really, they put color-coded stickers on things to mark what everyone has dibs on. The boys put dibs on their dads moose head, deer antlers, computers, tools, guns and truck. The girls put dibs on the linens, blankets, patio furniture, appliances, couches and the jacuzzi. Even the grand kids are eyeing the fire tablets, laptops, TVs and surround sound. \n\nStepdad has museum artifact quality spears, swords, crossbows and muskets. All marked with a sticker of a 14y/o grandchild.\n\nI dont hang out with the step-siblings that often, never really warmed to them. They proven to be callow, vapid empty shells too self absorbed in their avarice to realize they are horrible human beings. So when I was over for a family dinner they are fighting over dibs on things they just found out about like a plot of land in Montana and snowmobiles in storage. I say nothing but my parents stopped the whole conversation and pointedly asked me what of theirs I would want. I looked around, the place looks like a sea of polka dots with all the stickers and I said I didnt want anything. The reaction I got was stunned silence. The step-siblings were incensed that I didn't go through the house like I was shopping and said I didnt want anything because everything was already taken.\n\nThere must have been a prior conversation because I saw my mom smirking at my stepdad like I told you so.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for saying they don't want anything from their parents' will. The situation involves the author's step-parents and step-siblings being very active about their wills and marking up the house with stickers to claim items. The author didn't want anything and got a bad reaction from the family.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the context. The author is 40 years old, and their stepdad and mom are in their 70s. The step-siblings are acting greedy, marking up the house with color-coded stickers. The author isn't close to them and finds them to be self-absorbed. When asked what they want, the author says nothing. The step-siblings are upset, and the parents seem to have expected this, with the mom smirking.\n\nThe key points here are the author's right to decline inheritance and the family's behavior. Legally, the author isn't obligated to accept anything. They can choose to disclaim any inheritance if they want. Emotionally, the family is treating the distribution like a treasure hunt, which is probably not healthy. The author's decision to not take anything might be a way of distancing themselves from the family's greed.\n\nThe question is whether the author is at fault. The options are A (yes) or B (no). The author isn't doing anything wrong by choosing not to take anything. They might be expressing their feelings towards the family dynamics. The step-siblings' reaction is more about their own greed and maybe feeling slighted, but the author isn't in the wrong for stating their wishes. The parents' smirk might indicate they agree with the author's stance, which further suggests the author isn't wrong. So the answer should be B.\n"
