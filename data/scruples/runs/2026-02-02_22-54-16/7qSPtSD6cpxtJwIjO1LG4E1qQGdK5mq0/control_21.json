They have been actively polling the rest of the family about what they would want when they die. Stepdad specifically is acting like he's going to die next week like it's on the calendar. My step-siblings have been going through the house like things are on layaway. No really, they put color-coded stickers on things to mark what everyone has dibs on. The boys put dibs on their dads moose head, deer antlers, computers, tools, guns and truck. The girls put dibs on the linens, blankets, patio furniture, appliances, couches and the jacuzzi. Even the grand kids are eyeing the fire tablets, laptops, TVs and surround sound. \n\nStepdad has museum artifact quality spears, swords, crossbows and muskets. All marked with a sticker of a 14y/o grandchild.\n\nI dont hang out with the step-siblings that often, never really warmed to them. They proven to be callow, vapid empty shells too self absorbed in their avarice to realize they are horrible human beings. So when I was over for a family dinner they are fighting over dibs on things they just found out about like a plot of land in Montana and snowmobiles in storage. I say nothing but my parents stopped the whole conversation and pointedly asked me what of theirs I would want. I looked around, the place looks like a sea of polka dots with all the stickers and I said I didnt want anything. The reaction I got was stunned silence. The step-siblings were incensed that I didn't go through the house like I was shopping and said I didnt want anything because everything was already taken.\n\nThere must have been a prior conversation because I saw my mom smirking at my stepdad like I told you so.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about their parents creating wills and the family marking items they want. The author's step-siblings are all claiming things with stickers, and when the author says they don't want anything, they get upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is 40, their stepdad and mom are in their 70s. The step-siblings and even the kids are acting like they're already entitled to stuff. The author isn't close to the step-siblings, thinks they're self-absorbed. When asked what they want, the author says nothing. The step-siblings are angry because they thought the author would be vying for things too.\n\nSo, the author's action is to not claim anything. The question is if that's wrong. Well, legally, the author isn't obligated to want anything. Morally, it's about expectations. The parents might have expected the author to express some desires, but the author isn't claiming because everything's already taken and they don't care. The step-siblings are upset because they assumed the author would take part in the competition. But the author's response is a refusal to engage in what they see as a greedy family dynamic.\n\nIs the author wrong? It depends on the family dynamics. The author isn't taking things others want, so they aren't being selfish. The step-siblings are the ones acting greedy. The author's choice to not participate could be seen as a refusal to play into that. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
