They have been actively polling the rest of the family about what they would want when they die. Stepdad specifically is acting like he's going to die next week like it's on the calendar. My step-siblings have been going through the house like things are on layaway. No really, they put color-coded stickers on things to mark what everyone has dibs on. The boys put dibs on their dads moose head, deer antlers, computers, tools, guns and truck. The girls put dibs on the linens, blankets, patio furniture, appliances, couches and the jacuzzi. Even the grand kids are eyeing the fire tablets, laptops, TVs and surround sound. \n\nStepdad has museum artifact quality spears, swords, crossbows and muskets. All marked with a sticker of a 14y/o grandchild.\n\nI dont hang out with the step-siblings that often, never really warmed to them. They proven to be callow, vapid empty shells too self absorbed in their avarice to realize they are horrible human beings. So when I was over for a family dinner they are fighting over dibs on things they just found out about like a plot of land in Montana and snowmobiles in storage. I say nothing but my parents stopped the whole conversation and pointedly asked me what of theirs I would want. I looked around, the place looks like a sea of polka dots with all the stickers and I said I didnt want anything. The reaction I got was stunned silence. The step-siblings were incensed that I didn't go through the house like I was shopping and said I didnt want anything because everything was already taken.\n\nThere must have been a prior conversation because I saw my mom smirking at my stepdad like I told you so.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person is in the wrong for saying they don't want anything from their parents' will. The situation is that the family's been marking up stuff with stickers, and when asked, the author said they don't want anything. The step-siblings were upset because they thought everyone should be claiming stuff.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The family is already acting like they're entitled to the inheritance, even putting stickers on items. The author isn't close to the step-siblings and finds them selfish. They just said they don't want anything, which caused a reaction. \n\nIs the author wrong for not wanting to participate? Well, people have the right to decline inheritance. Maybe the parents expected everyone to claim something, but the author's choice is personal. Also, the step-siblings' behavior is pretty greedy, so the author's response might be justified.\n\nBut maybe the parents wanted to distribute things among all children, and the author's refusal could be seen as not respecting that. However, the author didn't take anything, so maybe they're not in the wrong. The key is whether declining to take anything is inappropriate. Since the author is honest about not wanting stuff, and given the step-siblings' behavior, the author isn't wrong. So answer B.\n"
