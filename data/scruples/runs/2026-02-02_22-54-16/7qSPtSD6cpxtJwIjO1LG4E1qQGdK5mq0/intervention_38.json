They have been actively polling the rest of the family about what they would want when they die. Stepdad specifically is acting like he's going to die next week like it's on the calendar. My step-siblings have been going through the house like things are on layaway. No really, they put color-coded stickers on things to mark what everyone has dibs on. The boys put dibs on their dads moose head, deer antlers, computers, tools, guns and truck. The girls put dibs on the linens, blankets, patio furniture, appliances, couches and the jacuzzi. Even the grand kids are eyeing the fire tablets, laptops, TVs and surround sound. \n\nStepdad has museum artifact quality spears, swords, crossbows and muskets. All marked with a sticker of a 14y/o grandchild.\n\nI dont hang out with the step-siblings that often, never really warmed to them. They proven to be callow, vapid empty shells too self absorbed in their avarice to realize they are horrible human beings. So when I was over for a family dinner they are fighting over dibs on things they just found out about like a plot of land in Montana and snowmobiles in storage. I say nothing but my parents stopped the whole conversation and pointedly asked me what of theirs I would want. I looked around, the place looks like a sea of polka dots with all the stickers and I said I didnt want anything. The reaction I got was stunned silence. The step-siblings were incensed that I didn't go through the house like I was shopping and said I didnt want anything because everything was already taken.\n\nThere must have been a prior conversation because I saw my mom smirking at my stepdad like I told you so.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about the author not wanting anything from their parents' will, while the step-siblings are aggressively claiming items.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the details. The author is 40, their stepdad and mom are in their 70s and making their wills. The step-siblings are already marking items with stickers, fighting over stuff, and the author is not interested in taking anything. When asked by the parents, the author says they don't want anything, which shocks the family. The author's step-siblings are upset because they thought the author would claim some items. The parents had a prior conversation where the mom smirked, maybe implying they expected the author not to take anything.\n\nThe key points here are: the author's right to refuse inheritance, the family's behavior, and the context of the author's relationship with the step-siblings. In many places, you can disclaim an inheritance if you don't want it, so legally the author isn't doing anything wrong. Ethically, it's about whether the author is justified in their stance.\n\nThe author doesn't get along with the step-siblings and finds them avaricious. They might not feel entitled to anything because they're not close to the parents. The step-siblings are acting out of greed, which the author might feel is undeserving. The parents might have had a plan before, so maybe the author's response aligns with what they discussed.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? If the author is honest about their feelings and the step-siblings are being greedy, then no. The author isn't obligated to claim items, especially if they don't want them. The step-siblings' reaction might be because they expected the author to take some items, but the author's choice to not take anything isn't unethical. The parents' smirk suggests they might have anticipated this, so they're not upset, just the step-siblings. \n\nSo, the answer is B. The author isn't in the wrong because they can choose not to take anything from the will, especially given their negative feelings towards the family's behavior.\n"
