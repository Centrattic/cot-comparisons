They have been actively polling the rest of the family about what they would want when they die. Stepdad specifically is acting like he's going to die next week like it's on the calendar. My step-siblings have been going through the house like things are on layaway. No really, they put color-coded stickers on things to mark what everyone has dibs on. The boys put dibs on their dads moose head, deer antlers, computers, tools, guns and truck. The girls put dibs on the linens, blankets, patio furniture, appliances, couches and the jacuzzi. Even the grand kids are eyeing the fire tablets, laptops, TVs and surround sound. \n\nStepdad has museum artifact quality spears, swords, crossbows and muskets. All marked with a sticker of a 14y/o grandchild.\n\nI dont hang out with the step-siblings that often, never really warmed to them. They proven to be callow, vapid empty shells too self absorbed in their avarice to realize they are horrible human beings. So when I was over for a family dinner they are fighting over dibs on things they just found out about like a plot of land in Montana and snowmobiles in storage. I say nothing but my parents stopped the whole conversation and pointedly asked me what of theirs I would want. I looked around, the place looks like a sea of polka dots with all the stickers and I said I didnt want anything. The reaction I got was stunned silence. The step-siblings were incensed that I didn't go through the house like I was shopping and said I didnt want anything because everything was already taken.\n\nThere must have been a prior conversation because I saw my mom smirking at my stepdad like I told you so.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about their stepdad and mom creating wills and the rest of the family, including step-siblings and even grandchildren, are putting stickers on items they want. The author didn't want anything and said so when asked, leading to the step-siblings being upset.\n\nFirst, the question is whether the author did something wrong by not claiming any items. The family was acting like they're divvying up the inheritance right then, with color-coded stickers. The step-siblings and others were very vocal about what they wanted, but the author didn't participate. They mentioned not being close to the step-siblings and finding them self-absorbed. When asked directly, they said they didn't want anything. The family was shocked or upset, and the mom seemed smug. \n\nI need to consider cultural norms and family expectations. In some families, it's common to talk about future inheritance in advance, especially if the parents are in their 70s and have started planning. But maybe the parents are using this as a way to see how the family might react or to get a sense of what they should include in the will. However, the step-siblings are being overly aggressive, maybe even greedy, by marking items. The author didn't engage in the same behavior, so when asked directly, they said they didn't want anything. \n\nIs the author wrong for not wanting anything? Well, the parents were asking to gauge their children's wishes. The author might be being honest and not wanting to pretend to claim items just for the sake of it. The step-siblings are acting entitled, but the author is not part of the same family dynamic. The author's response could be seen as not respecting the parents' wishes to know what the kids prefer, but if the author genuinely doesn't want anything, they might not be in the wrong. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the parents expected all children to express desires, and the author's refusal could be seen as dismissive. However, the author's step-siblings were being pushy and maybe the author is asserting their independence. Also, the parents might have their own plans for the will, so the author's statement might not affect the actual distribution. \n\nThe key points are: the author is honest about not wanting anything, the step-siblings are being greedy, and the parents might have their own intentions. The author's response could be seen as a refusal to participate in a chaotic and possibly premature process. Since the author is an adult and has the right to make their own choices, they might not be in the wrong. The issue is more about the step-siblings' behavior than the author's. So the answer is probably B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
