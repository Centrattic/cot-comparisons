They have been actively polling the rest of the family about what they would want when they die. Stepdad specifically is acting like he's going to die next week like it's on the calendar. My step-siblings have been going through the house like things are on layaway. No really, they put color-coded stickers on things to mark what everyone has dibs on. The boys put dibs on their dads moose head, deer antlers, computers, tools, guns and truck. The girls put dibs on the linens, blankets, patio furniture, appliances, couches and the jacuzzi. Even the grand kids are eyeing the fire tablets, laptops, TVs and surround sound. \n\nStepdad has museum artifact quality spears, swords, crossbows and muskets. All marked with a sticker of a 14y/o grandchild.\n\nI dont hang out with the step-siblings that often, never really warmed to them. They proven to be callow, vapid empty shells too self absorbed in their avarice to realize they are horrible human beings. So when I was over for a family dinner they are fighting over dibs on things they just found out about like a plot of land in Montana and snowmobiles in storage. I say nothing but my parents stopped the whole conversation and pointedly asked me what of theirs I would want. I looked around, the place looks like a sea of polka dots with all the stickers and I said I didnt want anything. The reaction I got was stunned silence. The step-siblings were incensed that I didn't go through the house like I was shopping and said I didnt want anything because everything was already taken.\n\nThere must have been a prior conversation because I saw my mom smirking at my stepdad like I told you so.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for stating they don't want anything from their parents' will. The situation involves the author's stepdad and mom creating their wills, and the extended family, including step-siblings, marking up items with stickers to claim them. The author, when asked what they want, says nothing, leading to a negative reaction from the family.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author mentions they don't get along well with the step-siblings, who they describe as self-absorbed and greedy. The step-siblings are already claiming items, which the author finds distasteful. When asked what they want, the author honestly states they don't want anything. The family is upset because the author didn't try to claim items they hadn't even known about before.\n\nSo, the key points are: the author's honesty about not wanting anything, the family's expectation that everyone should take something, and the author's disapproval of the step-siblings' behavior. \n\nIs the author wrong for not wanting anything? Legally, they aren't obligated to take anything, so there's no legal issue. Socially, it's more about expectations. In many cultures, it's common to expect that family members would want to inherit something, especially from their parents. However, the author's stance is that they don't want to participate in what they see as a greedy, superficial family dynamic. They might feel that by not taking anything, they're making a statement against the others' avarice.\n\nBut is there a wrong here? The author's right to decline is theirs, but maybe the family expected them to take something. The step-siblings' reaction might stem from surprise or even resentment that the author isn't playing along. However, the author isn't taking anything away from others by not claiming items. The parents might have intended to distribute things in a certain way, but the author's non-participation doesn't harm others. \n\nThe user's question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The answer hinges on the intention and context. The author isn't doing anything unethical or immoral by not wanting to take anything. They're making a personal choice based on their values and feelings towards the family's behavior. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
