They have been actively polling the rest of the family about what they would want when they die. Stepdad specifically is acting like he's going to die next week like it's on the calendar. My step-siblings have been going through the house like things are on layaway. No really, they put color-coded stickers on things to mark what everyone has dibs on. The boys put dibs on their dads moose head, deer antlers, computers, tools, guns and truck. The girls put dibs on the linens, blankets, patio furniture, appliances, couches and the jacuzzi. Even the grand kids are eyeing the fire tablets, laptops, TVs and surround sound. \n\nStepdad has museum artifact quality spears, swords, crossbows and muskets. All marked with a sticker of a 14y/o grandchild.\n\nI dont hang out with the step-siblings that often, never really warmed to them. They proven to be callow, vapid empty shells too self absorbed in their avarice to realize they are horrible human beings. So when I was over for a family dinner they are fighting over dibs on things they just found out about like a plot of land in Montana and snowmobiles in storage. I say nothing but my parents stopped the whole conversation and pointedly asked me what of theirs I would want. I looked around, the place looks like a sea of polka dots with all the stickers and I said I didnt want anything. The reaction I got was stunned silence. The step-siblings were incensed that I didn't go through the house like I was shopping and said I didnt want anything because everything was already taken.\n\nThere must have been a prior conversation because I saw my mom smirking at my stepdad like I told you so.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for saying they don't want anything from their parents' will. The situation is that the parents are creating their wills, and the step-siblings are all marking items they want, even some grandkids. The author didn't want anything, leading to the step-siblings being upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author is 40, so probably doesn't rely on the inheritance. They mention not getting along with the step-siblings, who they find vapid and self-centered. The author's response was to decline taking anything, which surprised the family. The parents were involved, and the mother seemed to agree with the author's stance.\n\nThe main question here is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nInheritance matters can be sensitive. Legally, the parents can distribute their assets as they choose. The author is not claiming entitlement to anything, just stating they don't want it. The step-siblings are upset because they expected the author to claim something, but maybe they were already taking items, leading to conflict. \n\nThe author's decision not to take anything isn't necessarily wrong. They might not need it, or maybe they don't want to engage in the family's drama. The parents are in charge of the will, so the author isn't obligated to take anything. Also, the step-siblings' behavior (marking items greedily) seems inappropriate, which might justify the author's neutral stance.\n\nSo, I think the answer is B: No, the author isn't in the wrong. They're not claiming anything, and their response was honest. The family's reaction is more about their own greed than the author's actions.\n"
