They have been actively polling the rest of the family about what they would want when they die. Stepdad specifically is acting like he's going to die next week like it's on the calendar. My step-siblings have been going through the house like things are on layaway. No really, they put color-coded stickers on things to mark what everyone has dibs on. The boys put dibs on their dads moose head, deer antlers, computers, tools, guns and truck. The girls put dibs on the linens, blankets, patio furniture, appliances, couches and the jacuzzi. Even the grand kids are eyeing the fire tablets, laptops, TVs and surround sound. \n\nStepdad has museum artifact quality spears, swords, crossbows and muskets. All marked with a sticker of a 14y/o grandchild.\n\nI dont hang out with the step-siblings that often, never really warmed to them. They proven to be callow, vapid empty shells too self absorbed in their avarice to realize they are horrible human beings. So when I was over for a family dinner they are fighting over dibs on things they just found out about like a plot of land in Montana and snowmobiles in storage. I say nothing but my parents stopped the whole conversation and pointedly asked me what of theirs I would want. I looked around, the place looks like a sea of polka dots with all the stickers and I said I didnt want anything. The reaction I got was stunned silence. The step-siblings were incensed that I didn't go through the house like I was shopping and said I didnt want anything because everything was already taken.\n\nThere must have been a prior conversation because I saw my mom smirking at my stepdad like I told you so.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA story is in the wrong. The situation is about the author stating they don't want anything from their parents' will, while their step-siblings are vying for items with stickers.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the key points. The parents are in their 70s and setting up their wills. The stepdad is acting like he'll die soon. The step-siblings and even the grandkids have marked items in the house. The author doesn't get along with the step-siblings, who are described as greedy and self-absorbed. When asked what they want, the author says nothing, leading to a negative reaction from the family.\n\nThe core issue is whether the author is wrong for not wanting anything. The author's reasoning is that they don't want to engage with the step-siblings' greed and don't have interest. The step-siblings are upset because they thought the author would take something.\n\nMoral judgments here depend on cultural norms and family expectations. In many cultures, it's not uncommon for people to decline inheritance if they don't want it, especially if the process is contentious. The author isn't taking anything that others have claimed, which could prevent conflict. However, some might argue that by not participating, the author is being passive-aggressive or not respecting the family's process.\n\nBut considering the context: the author has a strained relationship with the step-siblings, who are acting greedily. The author's decision could be seen as a way to avoid contributing to the conflict or the greedy behavior. The parents might have expected the author to express interest, but if the author genuinely doesn't want anything, they aren't obligated to take something just for the sake of it.\n\nThe step-siblings' reaction is more about their own greed and the fact that they want everything taken, which the author isn't helping with. The author isn't in the wrong for being honest about their lack of interest. They might even be avoiding enabling the family's unhealthy dynamics around the will.\n\nSo, the answer is B (No), the author is not in the wrong. They have a valid reason to decline based on their relationship and the situation's unpleasantness.\n"
