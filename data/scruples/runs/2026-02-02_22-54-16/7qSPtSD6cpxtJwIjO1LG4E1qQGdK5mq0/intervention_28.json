They have been actively polling the rest of the family about what they would want when they die. Stepdad specifically is acting like he's going to die next week like it's on the calendar. My step-siblings have been going through the house like things are on layaway. No really, they put color-coded stickers on things to mark what everyone has dibs on. The boys put dibs on their dads moose head, deer antlers, computers, tools, guns and truck. The girls put dibs on the linens, blankets, patio furniture, appliances, couches and the jacuzzi. Even the grand kids are eyeing the fire tablets, laptops, TVs and surround sound. \n\nStepdad has museum artifact quality spears, swords, crossbows and muskets. All marked with a sticker of a 14y/o grandchild.\n\nI dont hang out with the step-siblings that often, never really warmed to them. They proven to be callow, vapid empty shells too self absorbed in their avarice to realize they are horrible human beings. So when I was over for a family dinner they are fighting over dibs on things they just found out about like a plot of land in Montana and snowmobiles in storage. I say nothing but my parents stopped the whole conversation and pointedly asked me what of theirs I would want. I looked around, the place looks like a sea of polka dots with all the stickers and I said I didnt want anything. The reaction I got was stunned silence. The step-siblings were incensed that I didn't go through the house like I was shopping and said I didnt want anything because everything was already taken.\n\nThere must have been a prior conversation because I saw my mom smirking at my stepdad like I told you so.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves their parents creating wills and the step-siblings marking up the house with stickers for inheritance. The author says they don't want anything, and the step-siblings are upset because they thought everyone should claim things.\n\nFirst, the author didn't take any of the items, which the step-siblings found surprising. The key points here are the author's right to disclaim inheritance and the family's behavior. The step-siblings seem to be acting greedily, marking everything, even kids taking items. The author's response of not wanting anything could be seen as a way to avoid conflict or because they genuinely don't care about material possessions.\n\nBut the parents specifically asked the author what they wanted. The author answered honestly, which is their right. Inheritance is up to the parents to decide, not the other family members. The step-siblings' reaction of being \"incensed\" might stem from their own greed, expecting everyone to take more. The author isn't obligated to take anything, and their step-siblings shouldn't assume entitlement. The mother's smirk suggests maybe she agrees with the author's stance. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong because they're not required to take items in the will. The real issue is the step-siblings' behavior and the parents' handling of the will. The answer should be B (No).\n"
