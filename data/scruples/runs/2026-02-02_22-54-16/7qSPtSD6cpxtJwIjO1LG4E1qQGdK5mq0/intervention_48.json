They have been actively polling the rest of the family about what they would want when they die. Stepdad specifically is acting like he's going to die next week like it's on the calendar. My step-siblings have been going through the house like things are on layaway. No really, they put color-coded stickers on things to mark what everyone has dibs on. The boys put dibs on their dads moose head, deer antlers, computers, tools, guns and truck. The girls put dibs on the linens, blankets, patio furniture, appliances, couches and the jacuzzi. Even the grand kids are eyeing the fire tablets, laptops, TVs and surround sound. \n\nStepdad has museum artifact quality spears, swords, crossbows and muskets. All marked with a sticker of a 14y/o grandchild.\n\nI dont hang out with the step-siblings that often, never really warmed to them. They proven to be callow, vapid empty shells too self absorbed in their avarice to realize they are horrible human beings. So when I was over for a family dinner they are fighting over dibs on things they just found out about like a plot of land in Montana and snowmobiles in storage. I say nothing but my parents stopped the whole conversation and pointedly asked me what of theirs I would want. I looked around, the place looks like a sea of polka dots with all the stickers and I said I didnt want anything. The reaction I got was stunned silence. The step-siblings were incensed that I didn't go through the house like I was shopping and said I didnt want anything because everything was already taken.\n\nThere must have been a prior conversation because I saw my mom smirking at my stepdad like I told you so.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author of the AITA story is in the wrong by saying they don't want anything from their parents' will.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The parents are making their wills, and the step-siblings are all over the house marking items with stickers, acting like they already own things. The author doesn't get along with the step-siblings, who are described as greedy and self-absorbed. When the parents ask the author what they want, they say nothing because everything's already taken with stickers. The step-siblings get angry because the author didn't claim stuff. The mom seems to be smirking, implying maybe she agreed with the author's response.\n\nSo the question is, is the author wrong for not wanting anything? Let me think about the factors here. Inheritance is a personal choice. Legally, they don't have to take anything. The author might be making a statement against the greedy behavior of the step-siblings. By not claiming anything, they're perhaps showing they don't care for material things, or are distancing themselves from the conflict. The parents might be okay with that, especially since the mom was smirking, suggesting she might support the author's stance.\n\nBut maybe the parents expected the author to say they wanted something, even if it's just to be polite. However, the situation is that the step-siblings already marked everything, so there's nothing left. The author's response could be seen as honest, given the circumstances. They didn't want to participate in the scramble for stuff. The step-siblings' reaction is more about their own greed and feeling that the author isn't playing along. \n\nIn terms of morality, the author isn't stealing or taking something unfairly. They're just stating their preference. The real issue is the step-siblings' behavior, not the author's. So the answer is probably B, the author isn't in the wrong. They have the right to choose not to take anything, especially in a situation where others are being greedy and inconsiderate.\n"
