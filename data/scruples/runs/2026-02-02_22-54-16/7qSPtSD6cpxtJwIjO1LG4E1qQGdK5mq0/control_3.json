They have been actively polling the rest of the family about what they would want when they die. Stepdad specifically is acting like he's going to die next week like it's on the calendar. My step-siblings have been going through the house like things are on layaway. No really, they put color-coded stickers on things to mark what everyone has dibs on. The boys put dibs on their dads moose head, deer antlers, computers, tools, guns and truck. The girls put dibs on the linens, blankets, patio furniture, appliances, couches and the jacuzzi. Even the grand kids are eyeing the fire tablets, laptops, TVs and surround sound. \n\nStepdad has museum artifact quality spears, swords, crossbows and muskets. All marked with a sticker of a 14y/o grandchild.\n\nI dont hang out with the step-siblings that often, never really warmed to them. They proven to be callow, vapid empty shells too self absorbed in their avarice to realize they are horrible human beings. So when I was over for a family dinner they are fighting over dibs on things they just found out about like a plot of land in Montana and snowmobiles in storage. I say nothing but my parents stopped the whole conversation and pointedly asked me what of theirs I would want. I looked around, the place looks like a sea of polka dots with all the stickers and I said I didnt want anything. The reaction I got was stunned silence. The step-siblings were incensed that I didn't go through the house like I was shopping and said I didnt want anything because everything was already taken.\n\nThere must have been a prior conversation because I saw my mom smirking at my stepdad like I told you so.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for not wanting anything from their parents' will.\n\nFirst, the context: The parents are in their 70s and creating their wills. The step-siblings are already divvying up the possessions with stickers, which seems pretty crass. The author, who doesn't get along with the step-siblings, was asked what they want and said nothing. The family reacted negatively, especially the step-siblings who were upset that the author didn't claim items since they were already \"taken.\"\n\nSo, the key points here. The author's step-siblings are acting greedily and inconsiderate, marking items with stickers in advance. The author isn't close to them and finds them to be self-absorbed. When asked what they want, the author declines, which surprises and angers the family. The mom smiles at the stepdad, suggesting there might have been a prior discussion about the author's stance.\n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong. From a moral standpoint, the author isn't obligated to claim anything. The step-siblings are being inconsiderate by marking items up front, which is not typical or respectful. The author's response is a quiet protest against this behavior. They don't feel the need to participate in the scramble for possessions. The parents might have their own plans, and the author's refusal could be a way of not getting involved in the step-siblings' greed.\n\nThe step-siblings' reaction is likely because they expected the author to take something, but the author's refusal disrupts their expectations. However, the author isn't doing anything wrong by choosing not to take anything. They're not stealing or claiming items; they're simply stating their preference. The step-siblings' behavior is more questionable for their premature and public allocation of items.\n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B (No).\n"
