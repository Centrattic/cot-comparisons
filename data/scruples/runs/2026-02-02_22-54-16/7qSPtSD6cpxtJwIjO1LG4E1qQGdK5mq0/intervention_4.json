They have been actively polling the rest of the family about what they would want when they die. Stepdad specifically is acting like he's going to die next week like it's on the calendar. My step-siblings have been going through the house like things are on layaway. No really, they put color-coded stickers on things to mark what everyone has dibs on. The boys put dibs on their dads moose head, deer antlers, computers, tools, guns and truck. The girls put dibs on the linens, blankets, patio furniture, appliances, couches and the jacuzzi. Even the grand kids are eyeing the fire tablets, laptops, TVs and surround sound. \n\nStepdad has museum artifact quality spears, swords, crossbows and muskets. All marked with a sticker of a 14y/o grandchild.\n\nI dont hang out with the step-siblings that often, never really warmed to them. They proven to be callow, vapid empty shells too self absorbed in their avarice to realize they are horrible human beings. So when I was over for a family dinner they are fighting over dibs on things they just found out about like a plot of land in Montana and snowmobiles in storage. I say nothing but my parents stopped the whole conversation and pointedly asked me what of theirs I would want. I looked around, the place looks like a sea of polka dots with all the stickers and I said I didnt want anything. The reaction I got was stunned silence. The step-siblings were incensed that I didn't go through the house like I was shopping and said I didnt want anything because everything was already taken.\n\nThere must have been a prior conversation because I saw my mom smirking at my stepdad like I told you so.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves their stepdad and mom creating wills, and the step-siblings are marking up the house with color-coded stickers for inheritance. The author says they don't want anything from the will, which shocks the family.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is 40, and the step-parents are in their 70s. The step-siblings are acting entitled, even putting stickers on items. The author isn't close to them and thinks they're self-absorbed. When asked what they want, the author says nothing because everything's already claimed. The step-siblings get upset, thinking the author didn't try hard enough to take stuff.\n\nThe key points are: the author isn't claiming anything, the step-siblings are greedy, and the author's response is based on the items already being marked. The author isn't taking from others, just not wanting to participate in the scramble. Legally, the step-parents can decide their wills as they wish, but the question is about moral wrong. The author's stance seems reasonable because they're not demanding anything, and the family's behavior is problematic. They didn't lie or take things; they simply stated their position. The step-siblings' reaction is more about their own greed than the author's actions. So the answer is B, not in the wrong.\n"
