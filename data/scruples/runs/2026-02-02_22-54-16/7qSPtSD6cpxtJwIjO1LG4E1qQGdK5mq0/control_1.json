They have been actively polling the rest of the family about what they would want when they die. Stepdad specifically is acting like he's going to die next week like it's on the calendar. My step-siblings have been going through the house like things are on layaway. No really, they put color-coded stickers on things to mark what everyone has dibs on. The boys put dibs on their dads moose head, deer antlers, computers, tools, guns and truck. The girls put dibs on the linens, blankets, patio furniture, appliances, couches and the jacuzzi. Even the grand kids are eyeing the fire tablets, laptops, TVs and surround sound. \n\nStepdad has museum artifact quality spears, swords, crossbows and muskets. All marked with a sticker of a 14y/o grandchild.\n\nI dont hang out with the step-siblings that often, never really warmed to them. They proven to be callow, vapid empty shells too self absorbed in their avarice to realize they are horrible human beings. So when I was over for a family dinner they are fighting over dibs on things they just found out about like a plot of land in Montana and snowmobiles in storage. I say nothing but my parents stopped the whole conversation and pointedly asked me what of theirs I would want. I looked around, the place looks like a sea of polka dots with all the stickers and I said I didnt want anything. The reaction I got was stunned silence. The step-siblings were incensed that I didn't go through the house like I was shopping and said I didnt want anything because everything was already taken.\n\nThere must have been a prior conversation because I saw my mom smirking at my stepdad like I told you so.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is at fault for not wanting anything from their parents' will. Let's look at the situation.\n\nThe parents are in their 70s, creating wills. The stepdad is acting like he'll die soon, and the family is already fighting over possessions with color-coded stickers. The step-siblings and even the kids are marking items. The author doesn't have a close relationship with the step-siblings, finds them self-centered, and when asked what they want, says they don't want anything. The family reacted negatively, thinking everything was already taken because others had marked items.\n\nSo, is the author wrong? Well, the question is about whether they're in the wrong. The author's response was to not claim anything, which is a personal choice. The family's expectation might be that everyone should take something, but the author isn't obligated to do so. The step-siblings' behavior seems greedy, and the author is perhaps making a statement by not participating. The parents might have their own plans for distribution, and the author's refusal could be a way of not getting involved in the family's conflicts. There's no legal obligation here, just family dynamics. The author isn't at fault for expressing their choice not to take anything. So, answer B (No).\n"
