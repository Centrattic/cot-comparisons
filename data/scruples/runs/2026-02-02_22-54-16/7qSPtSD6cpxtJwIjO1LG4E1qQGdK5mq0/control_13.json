They have been actively polling the rest of the family about what they would want when they die. Stepdad specifically is acting like he's going to die next week like it's on the calendar. My step-siblings have been going through the house like things are on layaway. No really, they put color-coded stickers on things to mark what everyone has dibs on. The boys put dibs on their dads moose head, deer antlers, computers, tools, guns and truck. The girls put dibs on the linens, blankets, patio furniture, appliances, couches and the jacuzzi. Even the grand kids are eyeing the fire tablets, laptops, TVs and surround sound. \n\nStepdad has museum artifact quality spears, swords, crossbows and muskets. All marked with a sticker of a 14y/o grandchild.\n\nI dont hang out with the step-siblings that often, never really warmed to them. They proven to be callow, vapid empty shells too self absorbed in their avarice to realize they are horrible human beings. So when I was over for a family dinner they are fighting over dibs on things they just found out about like a plot of land in Montana and snowmobiles in storage. I say nothing but my parents stopped the whole conversation and pointedly asked me what of theirs I would want. I looked around, the place looks like a sea of polka dots with all the stickers and I said I didnt want anything. The reaction I got was stunned silence. The step-siblings were incensed that I didn't go through the house like I was shopping and said I didnt want anything because everything was already taken.\n\nThere must have been a prior conversation because I saw my mom smirking at my stepdad like I told you so.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the question is whether the author is in the wrong for saying they don't want anything from their parents' will. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The parents are in their 70s, creating wills. The stepdad is acting like he's going to die soon. The step-siblings and their family are marking up the house with stickers to claim items. They're really focused on material things, even the grandkids are taking electronics. The author isn't close to the step-siblings and finds them shallow. When asked what they want, the author says nothing, which surprises the family and upsets the step-siblings. The parents seem to have anticipated this, with the mom smirking.\n\nNow, the key points. The author isn't taking anything because maybe they don't want to compete with the others who are already claiming stuff. Also, they might not value material possessions as much. The step-siblings are acting greedy, which the author finds off-putting. The parents might have a plan where the author isn't expected to take anything, given the step-siblings' behavior.\n\nIs the author wrong? Well, they're honest about their feelings. They didn't lie or take something they weren't supposed to. The step-siblings are the ones acting possessive. The author's response might be a way to avoid conflict. The parents' reaction isn't negative, just surprised. The author isn't entitled to anything, but they're not required to take stuff either. So, probably not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
