They have been actively polling the rest of the family about what they would want when they die. Stepdad specifically is acting like he's going to die next week like it's on the calendar. My step-siblings have been going through the house like things are on layaway. No really, they put color-coded stickers on things to mark what everyone has dibs on. The boys put dibs on their dads moose head, deer antlers, computers, tools, guns and truck. The girls put dibs on the linens, blankets, patio furniture, appliances, couches and the jacuzzi. Even the grand kids are eyeing the fire tablets, laptops, TVs and surround sound. \n\nStepdad has museum artifact quality spears, swords, crossbows and muskets. All marked with a sticker of a 14y/o grandchild.\n\nI dont hang out with the step-siblings that often, never really warmed to them. They proven to be callow, vapid empty shells too self absorbed in their avarice to realize they are horrible human beings. So when I was over for a family dinner they are fighting over dibs on things they just found out about like a plot of land in Montana and snowmobiles in storage. I say nothing but my parents stopped the whole conversation and pointedly asked me what of theirs I would want. I looked around, the place looks like a sea of polka dots with all the stickers and I said I didnt want anything. The reaction I got was stunned silence. The step-siblings were incensed that I didn't go through the house like I was shopping and said I didnt want anything because everything was already taken.\n\nThere must have been a prior conversation because I saw my mom smirking at my stepdad like I told you so.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author's stepdad and mom are creating their wills in their 70s. The whole family is acting like they're already shopping for the inheritance, with color-coded stickers on items. The step-siblings and even the grandkids are marking stuff they want. The author doesn't really get along with the step-siblings, finding them self-absorbed and greedy. When asked what they want from the will, the author says they don't want anything, which shocks the family. The mom seems smug, maybe implying she knew the author wouldn't take anything.\n\nHmm. The question is whether the author is at fault for not wanting to claim items. Let's break it down. First, the author's relationship with the step-siblings is strained. They don't interact much and don't like them. So, the author's reluctance to participate in the \"shopping\" might stem from genuine feelings. Also, the family's behavior seems excessive\u2014marking possessions as if they're already theirs. The author might feel like their own potential inheritance isn't important, or perhaps they don't want to contribute to the greed.\n\nBut are they in the wrong? Well, the parents are asking the author what they want, so they have the right to know. However, the author's response could be seen as passive-aggressive or dismissive. Maybe the parents wanted to know so they could make fair decisions. By not expressing any wants, the author might be leaving the parents in a lurch. But maybe the author is being honest. If the author truly doesn't care about material things and doesn't want to take anything, that's their choice. \n\nThe step-siblings are upset because they thought the author would be vying for stuff too. The author might be trying to avoid conflict. But is it wrong to not want anything? It's possible the parents intended to distribute assets among all children, but if the author is a legal child (biological or adopted), they might be entitled to a share regardless. However, the author isn't claiming that. They're just not taking anything. \n\nIn some cultures, it's expected to decline if you don't need it, but in others, it might be seen as odd. The key points here are the author's intent and the parents' expectations. If the author is being truthful and not trying to take anything, they might not be wrong. The step-siblings' reaction is more about their own greed. The parents might be relieved if one child isn't fighting over stuff. \n\nBut maybe the parents wanted the author to express a preference so they could plan the will. By not doing so, the author could be complicating things. However, the author's response is honest. They don't want anything, so why should they be wrong? The family's behavior is more about their own issues. The author's stance might be a way to distance themselves from the family's greed. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. They have the right to choose not to take anything, especially if they don't want to engage with the family's competitive and materialistic behavior. The parents should handle the distribution as they see fit, but the author's refusal to claim items is their personal choice and not a transgression.\n"
