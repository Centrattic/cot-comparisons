They have been actively polling the rest of the family about what they would want when they die. Stepdad specifically is acting like he's going to die next week like it's on the calendar. My step-siblings have been going through the house like things are on layaway. No really, they put color-coded stickers on things to mark what everyone has dibs on. The boys put dibs on their dads moose head, deer antlers, computers, tools, guns and truck. The girls put dibs on the linens, blankets, patio furniture, appliances, couches and the jacuzzi. Even the grand kids are eyeing the fire tablets, laptops, TVs and surround sound. \n\nStepdad has museum artifact quality spears, swords, crossbows and muskets. All marked with a sticker of a 14y/o grandchild.\n\nI dont hang out with the step-siblings that often, never really warmed to them. They proven to be callow, vapid empty shells too self absorbed in their avarice to realize they are horrible human beings. So when I was over for a family dinner they are fighting over dibs on things they just found out about like a plot of land in Montana and snowmobiles in storage. I say nothing but my parents stopped the whole conversation and pointedly asked me what of theirs I would want. I looked around, the place looks like a sea of polka dots with all the stickers and I said I didnt want anything. The reaction I got was stunned silence. The step-siblings were incensed that I didn't go through the house like I was shopping and said I didnt want anything because everything was already taken.\n\nThere must have been a prior conversation because I saw my mom smirking at my stepdad like I told you so.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe user is 40 and their stepdad and mom are in their 70s, creating wills. The family has been actively discussing what they want from the estate. The step-siblings are color-coding items with stickers, even the grandkids are picking electronics. The author doesn't get along with the step-siblings, who they think are greedy and self-absorbed. At a family dinner, the parents ask the author what they want, and the author says they don't want anything. The step-siblings are upset because they thought the author would take something. The mom seems smug, like she expected this.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting anything. The user thinks the author isn't wrong. The answer options are A (yes) or B (no).\n\nFirst, the author's response seems to be a personal choice. The step-siblings were busy claiming items, but the author didn't feel the need to participate. The author might not want material things, or maybe they don't want to get involved in the family's conflict. But the parents asked them directly, so the author's answer was honest. \n\nIs there an expectation here that the author should want something? Maybe in some families, people assume you'd want to inherit something, but it's not a rule. The author's refusal could be seen as a way of avoiding conflict or not wanting to take from the step-siblings. The step-siblings' reaction is anger, but that's their problem, not the author's. \n\nThe key points are: the author didn't take anything, which might upset others, but they have the right to decline. The parents might have had prior discussions, as hinted by the mom's smirk. The author's stance is personal and not harmful unless they had obligations, which isn't mentioned here. So the author isn't in the wrong for stating their preference. The answer should be B.\n"
