They have been actively polling the rest of the family about what they would want when they die. Stepdad specifically is acting like he's going to die next week like it's on the calendar. My step-siblings have been going through the house like things are on layaway. No really, they put color-coded stickers on things to mark what everyone has dibs on. The boys put dibs on their dads moose head, deer antlers, computers, tools, guns and truck. The girls put dibs on the linens, blankets, patio furniture, appliances, couches and the jacuzzi. Even the grand kids are eyeing the fire tablets, laptops, TVs and surround sound. \n\nStepdad has museum artifact quality spears, swords, crossbows and muskets. All marked with a sticker of a 14y/o grandchild.\n\nI dont hang out with the step-siblings that often, never really warmed to them. They proven to be callow, vapid empty shells too self absorbed in their avarice to realize they are horrible human beings. So when I was over for a family dinner they are fighting over dibs on things they just found out about like a plot of land in Montana and snowmobiles in storage. I say nothing but my parents stopped the whole conversation and pointedly asked me what of theirs I would want. I looked around, the place looks like a sea of polka dots with all the stickers and I said I didnt want anything. The reaction I got was stunned silence. The step-siblings were incensed that I didn't go through the house like I was shopping and said I didnt want anything because everything was already taken.\n\nThere must have been a prior conversation because I saw my mom smirking at my stepdad like I told you so.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this AITA scenario. The user is asking if the person who posted the story is wrong for saying they don't want anything from their parents' will. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the parents and step-siblings are actively planning the wills and have marked up the house with stickers to claim items. The step-siblings are really into this, even the grandkids. The author isn't close to the step-siblings and finds them shallow. When asked what they want, the author says nothing, which shocks the family. The parents seem to have expected this, with the mom smirking.\n\nSo, the key points here: The author didn't want to participate in the family's pre-death inheritance scramble. They might feel that the step-siblings are greedy, and by not claiming anything, they're avoiding the conflict. The parents might be okay with this, given the mom's smirk. But the step-siblings are upset because they expected the author to want something.\n\nIs the author wrong? They're not taking anything, which is their right. The family's behavior seems a bit extreme, marking up items and fighting over them. The author's response could be seen as a refusal to engage in what they view as a childish or greedy process. There's no indication they're entitled to anything; they just stated they don't want it. The parents aren't upset, so maybe the author isn't in the wrong. They're choosing not to partake, which is their choice. The answer is probably B (not in the wrong) because it's their right to decline.\n"
