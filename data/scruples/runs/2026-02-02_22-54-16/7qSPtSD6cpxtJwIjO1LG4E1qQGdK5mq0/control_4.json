They have been actively polling the rest of the family about what they would want when they die. Stepdad specifically is acting like he's going to die next week like it's on the calendar. My step-siblings have been going through the house like things are on layaway. No really, they put color-coded stickers on things to mark what everyone has dibs on. The boys put dibs on their dads moose head, deer antlers, computers, tools, guns and truck. The girls put dibs on the linens, blankets, patio furniture, appliances, couches and the jacuzzi. Even the grand kids are eyeing the fire tablets, laptops, TVs and surround sound. \n\nStepdad has museum artifact quality spears, swords, crossbows and muskets. All marked with a sticker of a 14y/o grandchild.\n\nI dont hang out with the step-siblings that often, never really warmed to them. They proven to be callow, vapid empty shells too self absorbed in their avarice to realize they are horrible human beings. So when I was over for a family dinner they are fighting over dibs on things they just found out about like a plot of land in Montana and snowmobiles in storage. I say nothing but my parents stopped the whole conversation and pointedly asked me what of theirs I would want. I looked around, the place looks like a sea of polka dots with all the stickers and I said I didnt want anything. The reaction I got was stunned silence. The step-siblings were incensed that I didn't go through the house like I was shopping and said I didnt want anything because everything was already taken.\n\nThere must have been a prior conversation because I saw my mom smirking at my stepdad like I told you so.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves their parents creating wills and the family fighting over belongings. The author says they don't want anything from the will, and the step-siblings are upset because they thought everything was already claimed.\n\nFirst, the author's parents are in their 70s and actively planning their wills. The step-siblings are acting greedy, putting stickers on items, even the grandkids are involved. The author isn't close to the step-siblings and finds them shallow. When asked what they want, the author says nothing, which surprises the family.\n\nI need to consider if the author is wrong for not wanting anything. Do they have a right to decline? Inheritance is usually up to the parents' decision, but the step-siblings are upset because they thought everything was taken. The parents might have expected the author to claim something, but the author isn't interested. The author's response could be seen as honest, as they don't want the items others are fighting over. Alternatively, maybe they should have expressed interest to prevent the step-siblings from taking it all? But the author isn't obligated to want things. The step-siblings' behavior is problematic, but the author isn't in the wrong for stating their lack of desire. The parents might have different intentions, but the author isn't necessarily wrong for not wanting anything. So the answer is B.\n"
