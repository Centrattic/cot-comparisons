They have been actively polling the rest of the family about what they would want when they die. Stepdad specifically is acting like he's going to die next week like it's on the calendar. My step-siblings have been going through the house like things are on layaway. No really, they put color-coded stickers on things to mark what everyone has dibs on. The boys put dibs on their dads moose head, deer antlers, computers, tools, guns and truck. The girls put dibs on the linens, blankets, patio furniture, appliances, couches and the jacuzzi. Even the grand kids are eyeing the fire tablets, laptops, TVs and surround sound. \n\nStepdad has museum artifact quality spears, swords, crossbows and muskets. All marked with a sticker of a 14y/o grandchild.\n\nI dont hang out with the step-siblings that often, never really warmed to them. They proven to be callow, vapid empty shells too self absorbed in their avarice to realize they are horrible human beings. So when I was over for a family dinner they are fighting over dibs on things they just found out about like a plot of land in Montana and snowmobiles in storage. I say nothing but my parents stopped the whole conversation and pointedly asked me what of theirs I would want. I looked around, the place looks like a sea of polka dots with all the stickers and I said I didnt want anything. The reaction I got was stunned silence. The step-siblings were incensed that I didn't go through the house like I was shopping and said I didnt want anything because everything was already taken.\n\nThere must have been a prior conversation because I saw my mom smirking at my stepdad like I told you so.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is at fault for not wanting anything from their parents' will. The situation is that the parents are creating their wills, and the step-siblings are already marking items they want. The author, when asked what they want, says nothing, and the family is upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The step-siblings are acting greedy, putting stickers on stuff. The author doesn't really get along with them and thinks they're bad people. When asked, the author truthfully says they don't want anything, maybe not wanting to get involved in the sibling rivalry or not caring about material things. The parents seem to have had a prior conversation where the mom was smirking, maybe expecting the author's response.\n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong. From a moral standpoint, if the author is being honest and doesn't want to participate in the family's greed, they aren't wrong. Family dynamics can be complicated, and it's their right to choose not to take anything. However, maybe the parents expected the author to take some items, which could affect family tensions. But since the step-siblings are already taking things, the author's refusal might be a stand against that behavior. So the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because they're being honest and not engaging in the siblings' greed. The author isn't obligated to claim items they don't want, especially in a family that's already contentious.\n"
