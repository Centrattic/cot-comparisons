They have been actively polling the rest of the family about what they would want when they die. Stepdad specifically is acting like he's going to die next week like it's on the calendar. My step-siblings have been going through the house like things are on layaway. No really, they put color-coded stickers on things to mark what everyone has dibs on. The boys put dibs on their dads moose head, deer antlers, computers, tools, guns and truck. The girls put dibs on the linens, blankets, patio furniture, appliances, couches and the jacuzzi. Even the grand kids are eyeing the fire tablets, laptops, TVs and surround sound. \n\nStepdad has museum artifact quality spears, swords, crossbows and muskets. All marked with a sticker of a 14y/o grandchild.\n\nI dont hang out with the step-siblings that often, never really warmed to them. They proven to be callow, vapid empty shells too self absorbed in their avarice to realize they are horrible human beings. So when I was over for a family dinner they are fighting over dibs on things they just found out about like a plot of land in Montana and snowmobiles in storage. I say nothing but my parents stopped the whole conversation and pointedly asked me what of theirs I would want. I looked around, the place looks like a sea of polka dots with all the stickers and I said I didnt want anything. The reaction I got was stunned silence. The step-siblings were incensed that I didn't go through the house like I was shopping and said I didnt want anything because everything was already taken.\n\nThere must have been a prior conversation because I saw my mom smirking at my stepdad like I told you so.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. The question is whether they're at fault for saying they don't want anything from their parents' will.\n\nSo, the situation is that the parents and stepdad are creating their wills. The step-siblings are all over the place, putting stickers on stuff they want. The author doesn't really get along with the step-siblings, who they think are greedy and not nice. When asked what they want, the author says nothing because everything's already taken. The step-siblings got upset because they expected the author to want something, but the author didn't.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the social norms here. Typically, when family members are discussing their wills, it's usually expected that everyone might have a say or a claim. But the author here explicitly states they don't want anything, which might come as a surprise to others. However, the author's reason is that they don't want to take things that others have already claimed, and they don't have a good relationship with the step-siblings.\n\nThe step-siblings might feel that the author is being passive-aggressive or not respecting their parents by not wanting anything. But the author isn't taking anything away from the step-siblings; they're just choosing not to participate. Also, the parents' reaction was stunned silence, and the mom seemed to agree with the author's stance.\n\nAnother angle: the author isn't being greedy; they're actually avoiding conflict by not wanting to claim anything. The step-siblings are the ones acting greedy. In some cultures, not wanting to take from parents might be considered disrespectful, but in others, it's seen as polite if you don't have a claim.\n\nI think the key here is that the author isn't taking anything, just choosing not to. They have valid reasons based on their relationship with the step-siblings. The step-siblings' reaction is more about their own greed and expectations. So the author isn't in the wrong here. They're making a personal choice that doesn't harm others.\n"
