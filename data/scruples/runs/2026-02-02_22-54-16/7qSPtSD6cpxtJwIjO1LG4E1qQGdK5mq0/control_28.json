They have been actively polling the rest of the family about what they would want when they die. Stepdad specifically is acting like he's going to die next week like it's on the calendar. My step-siblings have been going through the house like things are on layaway. No really, they put color-coded stickers on things to mark what everyone has dibs on. The boys put dibs on their dads moose head, deer antlers, computers, tools, guns and truck. The girls put dibs on the linens, blankets, patio furniture, appliances, couches and the jacuzzi. Even the grand kids are eyeing the fire tablets, laptops, TVs and surround sound. \n\nStepdad has museum artifact quality spears, swords, crossbows and muskets. All marked with a sticker of a 14y/o grandchild.\n\nI dont hang out with the step-siblings that often, never really warmed to them. They proven to be callow, vapid empty shells too self absorbed in their avarice to realize they are horrible human beings. So when I was over for a family dinner they are fighting over dibs on things they just found out about like a plot of land in Montana and snowmobiles in storage. I say nothing but my parents stopped the whole conversation and pointedly asked me what of theirs I would want. I looked around, the place looks like a sea of polka dots with all the stickers and I said I didnt want anything. The reaction I got was stunned silence. The step-siblings were incensed that I didn't go through the house like I was shopping and said I didnt want anything because everything was already taken.\n\nThere must have been a prior conversation because I saw my mom smirking at my stepdad like I told you so.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person (AITA - Am I the Asshole) is in the wrong for saying they don't want anything from their parents' will. The situation involves the parents and step-siblings being very overt about dividing up the inheritance with stickers, and the step-siblings are being greedy and self-centered. The author didn't participate in this and when asked what they want, they said nothing, which upset the step-siblings.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The parents were creating wills and the family was acting like there's an immediate inheritance. The step-siblings are taking things with stickers, which is unusual and possibly disrespectful. The author doesn't align with the step-siblings and finds them to be bad people. When asked what they want, the author truthfully says they don't want anything, which is a valid response. The parents' reaction was stunned silence, and the step-siblings were angry. The mom smirked, implying maybe she expected this.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). The key points are: the author's right to decline inheritance, the family's behavior being problematic, and the author's honest response. In many cultures, expecting or assuming you'll inherit something isn't fair, and the family's actions are greedy. The author's refusal to participate in the scramble and their honesty should be acceptable. The step-siblings' reaction is more about their own greed and entitlement than the author's right to say no. So the author isn't in the wrong here. The answer should be B.\n"
