They have been actively polling the rest of the family about what they would want when they die. Stepdad specifically is acting like he's going to die next week like it's on the calendar. My step-siblings have been going through the house like things are on layaway. No really, they put color-coded stickers on things to mark what everyone has dibs on. The boys put dibs on their dads moose head, deer antlers, computers, tools, guns and truck. The girls put dibs on the linens, blankets, patio furniture, appliances, couches and the jacuzzi. Even the grand kids are eyeing the fire tablets, laptops, TVs and surround sound. \n\nStepdad has museum artifact quality spears, swords, crossbows and muskets. All marked with a sticker of a 14y/o grandchild.\n\nI dont hang out with the step-siblings that often, never really warmed to them. They proven to be callow, vapid empty shells too self absorbed in their avarice to realize they are horrible human beings. So when I was over for a family dinner they are fighting over dibs on things they just found out about like a plot of land in Montana and snowmobiles in storage. I say nothing but my parents stopped the whole conversation and pointedly asked me what of theirs I would want. I looked around, the place looks like a sea of polka dots with all the stickers and I said I didnt want anything. The reaction I got was stunned silence. The step-siblings were incensed that I didn't go through the house like I was shopping and said I didnt want anything because everything was already taken.\n\nThere must have been a prior conversation because I saw my mom smirking at my stepdad like I told you so.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author is 40 years old, and their stepdad and mom are in their 70s and making wills. The family has been polling others about what they want. The stepdad acts like he's going to die soon, and the step-siblings are marking items with stickers, dividing up everything from the house. The author doesn't get along with the step-siblings, thinks they're self-absorbed. When asked what they want from the will, the author says nothing, which shocks the family. The step-siblings are upset because they thought the author would take something, but the author didn't want anything. The mom seemed smug about it. The author is asking if they're in the wrong (AITA).\n\nThe user's initial thought is the author isn't in the wrong. Now, I need to evaluate.\n\nFirst, the author's right to decline. Legally, you can choose to disclaim inheritance. So if someone doesn't want anything, they can say so. But socially, maybe family expects you to take something. However, the step-siblings are acting greedy, taking everything. The author might not want to contribute to that dynamic. Also, the step-siblings are being described as vapid and self-absorbed, so the author might not want to engage with them. \n\nBut maybe the parents expect the author to take something. However, the author didn't know about the prior conversation where the mom said they thought the author would pass. The mom's smirk suggests maybe she agreed with the author's decision beforehand. \n\nThe key points: The author isn't taking anything, which the family found surprising. The author's reasoning is that they don't want to participate in the family's avarice. The step-siblings are already taking everything with stickers, so the author's refusal could be seen as standing up for their values rather than being greedy. \n\nIs there a cultural expectation to take something? Maybe, but the author isn't taking anything, so they can't be blamed for not wanting to join in the family's behavior. The step-siblings are the ones acting out, and the author is choosing not to engage. \n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
