They have been actively polling the rest of the family about what they would want when they die. Stepdad specifically is acting like he's going to die next week like it's on the calendar. My step-siblings have been going through the house like things are on layaway. No really, they put color-coded stickers on things to mark what everyone has dibs on. The boys put dibs on their dads moose head, deer antlers, computers, tools, guns and truck. The girls put dibs on the linens, blankets, patio furniture, appliances, couches and the jacuzzi. Even the grand kids are eyeing the fire tablets, laptops, TVs and surround sound. \n\nStepdad has museum artifact quality spears, swords, crossbows and muskets. All marked with a sticker of a 14y/o grandchild.\n\nI dont hang out with the step-siblings that often, never really warmed to them. They proven to be callow, vapid empty shells too self absorbed in their avarice to realize they are horrible human beings. So when I was over for a family dinner they are fighting over dibs on things they just found out about like a plot of land in Montana and snowmobiles in storage. I say nothing but my parents stopped the whole conversation and pointedly asked me what of theirs I would want. I looked around, the place looks like a sea of polka dots with all the stickers and I said I didnt want anything. The reaction I got was stunned silence. The step-siblings were incensed that I didn't go through the house like I was shopping and said I didnt want anything because everything was already taken.\n\nThere must have been a prior conversation because I saw my mom smirking at my stepdad like I told you so.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author's stepdad and mom creating their wills and the extended family already fighting over belongings with stickers. The author didn't want anything and was met with negative reactions.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The family is preoccupied with dividing up the parents' property before they even pass away, which is already a red flag. The step-siblings are being described as greedy and self-absorbed. The author didn't want anything, which surprised the family. The parents might have expected the author to take something, but the author didn't.\n\nThe question is whether the author did something wrong by not claiming any inheritance. Legally, the author isn't obligated to take anything. Ethically, maybe the family expected them to take something, but the author isn't required to comply. The step-siblings are portrayed as the ones acting greedily, so the author's refusal could be seen as a stand against that behavior. The parents might be upset because they wanted the author to have something, but the author's choice is still valid. \n\nThe author's response was honest about not wanting anything, which could be a personal decision based on their relationship with the family. Since there's no legal obligation and the author isn't stealing from anyone, they aren't in the wrong. The family's reaction is more about their own greed than the author's actions. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
