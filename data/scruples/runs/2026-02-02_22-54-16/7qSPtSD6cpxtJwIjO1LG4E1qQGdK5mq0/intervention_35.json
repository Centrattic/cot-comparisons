They have been actively polling the rest of the family about what they would want when they die. Stepdad specifically is acting like he's going to die next week like it's on the calendar. My step-siblings have been going through the house like things are on layaway. No really, they put color-coded stickers on things to mark what everyone has dibs on. The boys put dibs on their dads moose head, deer antlers, computers, tools, guns and truck. The girls put dibs on the linens, blankets, patio furniture, appliances, couches and the jacuzzi. Even the grand kids are eyeing the fire tablets, laptops, TVs and surround sound. \n\nStepdad has museum artifact quality spears, swords, crossbows and muskets. All marked with a sticker of a 14y/o grandchild.\n\nI dont hang out with the step-siblings that often, never really warmed to them. They proven to be callow, vapid empty shells too self absorbed in their avarice to realize they are horrible human beings. So when I was over for a family dinner they are fighting over dibs on things they just found out about like a plot of land in Montana and snowmobiles in storage. I say nothing but my parents stopped the whole conversation and pointedly asked me what of theirs I would want. I looked around, the place looks like a sea of polka dots with all the stickers and I said I didnt want anything. The reaction I got was stunned silence. The step-siblings were incensed that I didn't go through the house like I was shopping and said I didnt want anything because everything was already taken.\n\nThere must have been a prior conversation because I saw my mom smirking at my stepdad like I told you so.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author's parents and step-siblings actively planning their wills and marking family heirlooms with stickers to claim them. The author, when asked what they want from the will, says they don't want anything. The step-siblings are upset because they expected the author to also claim items.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is 40, and their step-parents are in their 70s. The family is already in a contentious situation where everyone is grabbing for items, which seems inconsiderate and greedy. The author explicitly states they don't want anything, which the step-siblings find surprising and perhaps offensive. The parents seem to have expected the author to participate in this claiming, but the author didn't, leading to their disappointment.\n\nThe key points here are the author's right to refuse to participate in this greedy behavior. The author isn't taking anything, which could be seen as a moral stand against the family's selfishness. The step-siblings are portrayed as self-centered, and the author's reaction is a refusal to engage in that. The parents might feel slighted, but the author isn't violating any laws or explicit agreements. There's no indication that the author has a claim or right to the items being discussed. \n\nLegally, the author's parents can leave their will as they choose, and the author's refusal to claim anything is their prerogative. Socially, while the family might find it unexpected, the author isn't doing anything unethical. The step-siblings' frustration stems from their own greed, not the author's actions. The author's decision to not participate could be seen as a way to distance themselves from the family's avarice, which is a valid choice.\n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong. They're making a conscious decision to not engage in what they perceive as undesirable behavior. The answer should be B.\n"
