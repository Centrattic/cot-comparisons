They have been actively polling the rest of the family about what they would want when they die. Stepdad specifically is acting like he's going to die next week like it's on the calendar. My step-siblings have been going through the house like things are on layaway. No really, they put color-coded stickers on things to mark what everyone has dibs on. The boys put dibs on their dads moose head, deer antlers, computers, tools, guns and truck. The girls put dibs on the linens, blankets, patio furniture, appliances, couches and the jacuzzi. Even the grand kids are eyeing the fire tablets, laptops, TVs and surround sound. \n\nStepdad has museum artifact quality spears, swords, crossbows and muskets. All marked with a sticker of a 14y/o grandchild.\n\nI dont hang out with the step-siblings that often, never really warmed to them. They proven to be callow, vapid empty shells too self absorbed in their avarice to realize they are horrible human beings. So when I was over for a family dinner they are fighting over dibs on things they just found out about like a plot of land in Montana and snowmobiles in storage. I say nothing but my parents stopped the whole conversation and pointedly asked me what of theirs I would want. I looked around, the place looks like a sea of polka dots with all the stickers and I said I didnt want anything. The reaction I got was stunned silence. The step-siblings were incensed that I didn't go through the house like I was shopping and said I didnt want anything because everything was already taken.\n\nThere must have been a prior conversation because I saw my mom smirking at my stepdad like I told you so.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about inheritance and family dynamics.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the scenario. The author is 40, and their stepdad and mom are in their 70s. They've been creating wills and the family is already fighting over items with color-coded stickers. The step-siblings are marking everything, even kids are taking items. The author doesn't get along well with the step-siblings, finds them greedy. When asked what they want from the will, the author says nothing, leading to a shocked reaction. The step-siblings are upset because they thought everything was already taken, but the author didn't claim anything. The mom smirks at the stepdad like \"I told you so.\"\n\nThe author is asking if they're in the wrong. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong but wants my opinion. I need to decide A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no).\n\nLet me think. The author's step-siblings are acting entitled and taking things without the parents' approval. The author isn't taking anything, which could mean they're not greedy. But maybe there's an expectation that the author should have claimed something, especially if there's a prior conversation the author wasn't aware of. The parents might have thought the author wanted something, but the author didn't express that. However, the author's point is that they don't want anything, and maybe the step-siblings expected them to take more to balance things out. But the author isn't in the wrong for not wanting anything. They have the right to decline. The step-siblings' reaction is more about their own greed and entitlement. The author is choosing not to participate in the family's squabbling over possessions. So, the answer is B (no, not in the wrong).\n"
