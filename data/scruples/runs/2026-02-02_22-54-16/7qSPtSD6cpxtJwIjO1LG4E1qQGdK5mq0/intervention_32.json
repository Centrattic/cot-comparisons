They have been actively polling the rest of the family about what they would want when they die. Stepdad specifically is acting like he's going to die next week like it's on the calendar. My step-siblings have been going through the house like things are on layaway. No really, they put color-coded stickers on things to mark what everyone has dibs on. The boys put dibs on their dads moose head, deer antlers, computers, tools, guns and truck. The girls put dibs on the linens, blankets, patio furniture, appliances, couches and the jacuzzi. Even the grand kids are eyeing the fire tablets, laptops, TVs and surround sound. \n\nStepdad has museum artifact quality spears, swords, crossbows and muskets. All marked with a sticker of a 14y/o grandchild.\n\nI dont hang out with the step-siblings that often, never really warmed to them. They proven to be callow, vapid empty shells too self absorbed in their avarice to realize they are horrible human beings. So when I was over for a family dinner they are fighting over dibs on things they just found out about like a plot of land in Montana and snowmobiles in storage. I say nothing but my parents stopped the whole conversation and pointedly asked me what of theirs I would want. I looked around, the place looks like a sea of polka dots with all the stickers and I said I didnt want anything. The reaction I got was stunned silence. The step-siblings were incensed that I didn't go through the house like I was shopping and said I didnt want anything because everything was already taken.\n\nThere must have been a prior conversation because I saw my mom smirking at my stepdad like I told you so.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who posted the AITA story is in the wrong. The situation involves family dynamics around a will and inheritance. The author, who is 40, says they don't want anything from their parents' will. The stepdad and mom are in their 70s and creating wills, and the family is acting like things are already being divided. The step-siblings, including the author's step-siblings, are marking items with stickers, even when the author doesn't spend much time with them and finds them self-absorbed.\n\nThe key points here are: the author is not claiming anything, which shocks the family. The step-siblings are upset because they thought the author would take items, but the author isn't interested. The parents seem to have had a prior conversation, maybe expecting the author to want something. The author's response is that they don't want anything, leading to the family's negative reactions.\n\nSo, why might the author be in the wrong? Maybe they should have at least said they wanted something to be polite, or perhaps they should have been more involved in the discussions. But the author isn't taking anything, which is their right. They might be in a position where they don't need the inheritance, or maybe they don't want to cause conflict by claiming items. The family's reaction is about their own expectations being violated, not necessarily the author's wrongdoing. The author isn't taking things others have marked, so there's no conflict there. They simply stated their own lack of desire. The step-siblings are the ones acting greedily according to the author's description. \n\nThe parents might have expected the author to participate more, but the author's choice to not take anything isn't inherently wrong. It's personal and depends on their relationship with the parents and the rest of the family. The author isn't causing harm by not taking anything. The family's issue is with their own assumptions, not the author's choices. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
