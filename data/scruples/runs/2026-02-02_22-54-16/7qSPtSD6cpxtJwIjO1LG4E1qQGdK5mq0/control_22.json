They have been actively polling the rest of the family about what they would want when they die. Stepdad specifically is acting like he's going to die next week like it's on the calendar. My step-siblings have been going through the house like things are on layaway. No really, they put color-coded stickers on things to mark what everyone has dibs on. The boys put dibs on their dads moose head, deer antlers, computers, tools, guns and truck. The girls put dibs on the linens, blankets, patio furniture, appliances, couches and the jacuzzi. Even the grand kids are eyeing the fire tablets, laptops, TVs and surround sound. \n\nStepdad has museum artifact quality spears, swords, crossbows and muskets. All marked with a sticker of a 14y/o grandchild.\n\nI dont hang out with the step-siblings that often, never really warmed to them. They proven to be callow, vapid empty shells too self absorbed in their avarice to realize they are horrible human beings. So when I was over for a family dinner they are fighting over dibs on things they just found out about like a plot of land in Montana and snowmobiles in storage. I say nothing but my parents stopped the whole conversation and pointedly asked me what of theirs I would want. I looked around, the place looks like a sea of polka dots with all the stickers and I said I didnt want anything. The reaction I got was stunned silence. The step-siblings were incensed that I didn't go through the house like I was shopping and said I didnt want anything because everything was already taken.\n\nThere must have been a prior conversation because I saw my mom smirking at my stepdad like I told you so.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for saying they don't want anything from their parents' will. The context is that their stepdad and mom are making their wills, and the whole family has been marking up stuff with stickers. The stepsiblings are really into claiming things, even the grandkids. The author doesn't get along with the stepsiblings, thinks they're greedy and not nice. When asked what they want, the author says nothing, causing the stepsiblings to be upset because they thought everything was already taken.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, the author's response is about not wanting anything, which is their right. They don't have an obligation to claim items, especially if they don't want to. The family's approach seems chaotic, with everyone marking stuff. The author might be standing their ground by not participating in the scramble. The stepsiblings are acting like they expected everyone else to take stuff, but the author's refusal could be a way of not getting dragged into that. \n\nHowever, maybe there's an expectation in the family that they should express interest, even if they don't take anything. But since the author is clear they don't want anything, that's their choice. They might not be in the wrong for not wanting to engage in the stepsiblings' behavior. The author's stance could be a way of avoiding conflict and not supporting the stepsiblings' greed. So, the answer would be B (no), they're not in the wrong.\n"
