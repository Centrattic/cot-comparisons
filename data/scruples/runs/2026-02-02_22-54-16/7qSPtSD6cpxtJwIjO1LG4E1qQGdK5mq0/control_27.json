They have been actively polling the rest of the family about what they would want when they die. Stepdad specifically is acting like he's going to die next week like it's on the calendar. My step-siblings have been going through the house like things are on layaway. No really, they put color-coded stickers on things to mark what everyone has dibs on. The boys put dibs on their dads moose head, deer antlers, computers, tools, guns and truck. The girls put dibs on the linens, blankets, patio furniture, appliances, couches and the jacuzzi. Even the grand kids are eyeing the fire tablets, laptops, TVs and surround sound. \n\nStepdad has museum artifact quality spears, swords, crossbows and muskets. All marked with a sticker of a 14y/o grandchild.\n\nI dont hang out with the step-siblings that often, never really warmed to them. They proven to be callow, vapid empty shells too self absorbed in their avarice to realize they are horrible human beings. So when I was over for a family dinner they are fighting over dibs on things they just found out about like a plot of land in Montana and snowmobiles in storage. I say nothing but my parents stopped the whole conversation and pointedly asked me what of theirs I would want. I looked around, the place looks like a sea of polka dots with all the stickers and I said I didnt want anything. The reaction I got was stunned silence. The step-siblings were incensed that I didn't go through the house like I was shopping and said I didnt want anything because everything was already taken.\n\nThere must have been a prior conversation because I saw my mom smirking at my stepdad like I told you so.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the story is in the wrong for not wanting anything from their parents' will. The situation involves the stepfather and mother creating their wills and the family getting all competitive about what they want. The author's step-siblings are marking items with stickers, fighting over stuff, and the author ends up saying they don't want anything.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author's response was inappropriate. The key points here are the dynamics within the family. The author doesn't have a close relationship with the step-siblings, who are described as selfish and vapid. The author's decision to not participate in the scramble for possessions seems like a personal choice. \n\nThe parents asked the author directly, and the author honestly stated they didn't want anything. The step-siblings were upset because they thought the author should be just as greedy. But the author's stance is that they don't want to engage in that behavior. \n\nLegally, the author isn't obligated to take anything from the will. Emotionally, it's about respecting their own boundaries. The step-siblings might feel slighted, but the author isn't wrong for choosing not to want material goods when the others are so focused on it. The mom's smirk suggests she might agree with the author's position. \n\nNo one is in the wrong for not wanting to participate in a family dynamic they find distasteful. The author isn't at fault here. So the answer should be B.\n"
