They have been actively polling the rest of the family about what they would want when they die. Stepdad specifically is acting like he's going to die next week like it's on the calendar. My step-siblings have been going through the house like things are on layaway. No really, they put color-coded stickers on things to mark what everyone has dibs on. The boys put dibs on their dads moose head, deer antlers, computers, tools, guns and truck. The girls put dibs on the linens, blankets, patio furniture, appliances, couches and the jacuzzi. Even the grand kids are eyeing the fire tablets, laptops, TVs and surround sound. \n\nStepdad has museum artifact quality spears, swords, crossbows and muskets. All marked with a sticker of a 14y/o grandchild.\n\nI dont hang out with the step-siblings that often, never really warmed to them. They proven to be callow, vapid empty shells too self absorbed in their avarice to realize they are horrible human beings. So when I was over for a family dinner they are fighting over dibs on things they just found out about like a plot of land in Montana and snowmobiles in storage. I say nothing but my parents stopped the whole conversation and pointedly asked me what of theirs I would want. I looked around, the place looks like a sea of polka dots with all the stickers and I said I didnt want anything. The reaction I got was stunned silence. The step-siblings were incensed that I didn't go through the house like I was shopping and said I didnt want anything because everything was already taken.\n\nThere must have been a prior conversation because I saw my mom smirking at my stepdad like I told you so.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for saying they don't want anything from their parents' will.\n\nSo, the situation is that the parents and step-siblings are all actively planning and marking items they want from the estate. The author doesn't interact much with the step-siblings and thinks they're pretty awful. When asked what they want, the author says nothing, which upsets the step-siblings because they thought everything was already taken. The parents seem to have expected the author's response, with the mom smirking at the stepdad.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author's step-siblings are being greedy and marking items in a way that's maybe not appropriate. The author isn't interested in participating in this scramble for stuff. Declining to take anything might be a reaction to seeing the family act so materialistic and self-centered. \n\nIs there a cultural expectation here? In some cultures, not wanting anything might be seen as ungrateful, but others might see it as a personal choice. The key here is that the author's step-siblings are acting in a way that's making the author feel uncomfortable. The author's response could be a way to avoid conflict or to make a statement about their values. \n\nThe parents might have been expecting this because maybe they know the author isn't materialistic. The step-siblings being incensed suggests they were expecting to get more, but the author's refusal might have been a surprise. However, the author isn't taking anything, so they aren't taking away from others. \n\nI think the answer leans towards B (not in the wrong) because the author is asserting their own choice not to participate in what they see as a greedy situation. They aren't preventing others from taking items, just declining themselves. The step-siblings' reaction is more about their own expectations being unmet, not the author's right to refuse. The parents' smirk implies they might agree with the author's stance. So the author isn't wrong for making a personal choice here.\n"
