They have been actively polling the rest of the family about what they would want when they die. Stepdad specifically is acting like he's going to die next week like it's on the calendar. My step-siblings have been going through the house like things are on layaway. No really, they put color-coded stickers on things to mark what everyone has dibs on. The boys put dibs on their dads moose head, deer antlers, computers, tools, guns and truck. The girls put dibs on the linens, blankets, patio furniture, appliances, couches and the jacuzzi. Even the grand kids are eyeing the fire tablets, laptops, TVs and surround sound. \n\nStepdad has museum artifact quality spears, swords, crossbows and muskets. All marked with a sticker of a 14y/o grandchild.\n\nI dont hang out with the step-siblings that often, never really warmed to them. They proven to be callow, vapid empty shells too self absorbed in their avarice to realize they are horrible human beings. So when I was over for a family dinner they are fighting over dibs on things they just found out about like a plot of land in Montana and snowmobiles in storage. I say nothing but my parents stopped the whole conversation and pointedly asked me what of theirs I would want. I looked around, the place looks like a sea of polka dots with all the stickers and I said I didnt want anything. The reaction I got was stunned silence. The step-siblings were incensed that I didn't go through the house like I was shopping and said I didnt want anything because everything was already taken.\n\nThere must have been a prior conversation because I saw my mom smirking at my stepdad like I told you so.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong for saying they don't want anything from their parents' will. Let me read through the situation again to make sure I get all the details right.\n\nThe user is 40, their stepdad and mom are in their 70s and have been setting up wills. The family has been actively discussing what everyone wants when they die. The stepdad is acting like he'll die soon, and the step-siblings are putting stickers on items to mark their \"dibs.\" They even have color-coded stickers. The step-siblings are grabbing things like tools, furniture, electronics, and even the kids are eyeing items. The author doesn't get along well with the step-siblings, finding them self-absorbed and greedy. When asked what the author wants, they say nothing, which shocks the family. The stepsiblings are upset because they thought the author would take something, but the author's mom seems smug, maybe from a prior conversation.\n\nSo the author is asking if they did the wrong thing by not wanting anything. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to consider the cultural context. In many cultures, there's an expectation that children will inherit something from their parents, especially if there's property or assets. But there's also the idea that a parent can distribute their estate as they choose. The author isn't claiming they should get something, just that they don't want anything. \n\nThe stepsiblings are acting greedy, which the author finds distasteful. The author might feel that the family is more focused on material things rather than the actual relationships. By not claiming anything, the author could be making a statement about not valuing material possessions or distancing themselves from the family's behavior. \n\nHowever, the parents might have expected the author to at least show interest, especially if they had discussed it beforehand. The mom's smirk suggests there might have been a prior agreement or expectation. But the author's decision to not take anything could be their way of asserting independence or rejecting the family's materialism.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, legally, the parents can leave their estate to whomever they want. The author isn't stopping the others from getting what they want; they're just choosing not to take anything. Emotionally, maybe the family expects gratitude or some form of acknowledgment. But the author's stance is about personal choice and possibly moral judgment on the family's actions. \n\nThe stepsiblings are acting entitled, which the author criticizes. The author's refusal could be seen as a moral stance against that behavior. However, some might argue that the author is being passive-aggressive or not respecting their parents' wishes if they had intended to include them. But the author's mom's reaction (smirking) implies she might agree with the author's decision. \n\nSo, considering all factors, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They made a personal choice based on their values and the family's behavior. The answer should be B (No).\n"
