They have been actively polling the rest of the family about what they would want when they die. Stepdad specifically is acting like he's going to die next week like it's on the calendar. My step-siblings have been going through the house like things are on layaway. No really, they put color-coded stickers on things to mark what everyone has dibs on. The boys put dibs on their dads moose head, deer antlers, computers, tools, guns and truck. The girls put dibs on the linens, blankets, patio furniture, appliances, couches and the jacuzzi. Even the grand kids are eyeing the fire tablets, laptops, TVs and surround sound. \n\nStepdad has museum artifact quality spears, swords, crossbows and muskets. All marked with a sticker of a 14y/o grandchild.\n\nI dont hang out with the step-siblings that often, never really warmed to them. They proven to be callow, vapid empty shells too self absorbed in their avarice to realize they are horrible human beings. So when I was over for a family dinner they are fighting over dibs on things they just found out about like a plot of land in Montana and snowmobiles in storage. I say nothing but my parents stopped the whole conversation and pointedly asked me what of theirs I would want. I looked around, the place looks like a sea of polka dots with all the stickers and I said I didnt want anything. The reaction I got was stunned silence. The step-siblings were incensed that I didn't go through the house like I was shopping and said I didnt want anything because everything was already taken.\n\nThere must have been a prior conversation because I saw my mom smirking at my stepdad like I told you so.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about family dynamics and inheritance. The author, who is 40, didn't express interest in anything in their parents' will. Their stepdad and mom are in their 70s and creating wills, and the rest of the family is already divvying up stuff with stickers. The step-siblings are being greedy, and the author just said they don't want anything. The family reacted negatively, with the step-siblings being upset that the author didn't claim things.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is at fault. The key points are that the author didn't want anything, which caused a bad reaction. The question is whether they should have expressed interest or claimed something. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that they don't get along with the step-siblings, who are portrayed negatively. The author might feel that the family's approach to inheritance is crass, and their decision not to participate is a reflection of their own values. Alternatively, maybe the author should have said something to avoid seeming ungrateful or causing tension.\n\nBut in reality, people have the right to decide what they want from an inheritance. There's no obligation to claim something just because others are. The author's parents might have expected them to participate, but the author's choice is valid. The step-siblings' reaction suggests they might be more interested in their own shares and feel threatened by the author's non-participation. However, the author isn't wrong for prioritizing their own feelings and not engaging in a situation they find uncomfortable or distasteful.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is B\u2014no, the author isn't in the wrong. They made a personal choice based on their values and the family dynamics. It's their prerogative to decline participating in the inheritance scramble, and the family's negative reaction is their issue, not the author's fault.\n"
