They have been actively polling the rest of the family about what they would want when they die. Stepdad specifically is acting like he's going to die next week like it's on the calendar. My step-siblings have been going through the house like things are on layaway. No really, they put color-coded stickers on things to mark what everyone has dibs on. The boys put dibs on their dads moose head, deer antlers, computers, tools, guns and truck. The girls put dibs on the linens, blankets, patio furniture, appliances, couches and the jacuzzi. Even the grand kids are eyeing the fire tablets, laptops, TVs and surround sound. \n\nStepdad has museum artifact quality spears, swords, crossbows and muskets. All marked with a sticker of a 14y/o grandchild.\n\nI dont hang out with the step-siblings that often, never really warmed to them. They proven to be callow, vapid empty shells too self absorbed in their avarice to realize they are horrible human beings. So when I was over for a family dinner they are fighting over dibs on things they just found out about like a plot of land in Montana and snowmobiles in storage. I say nothing but my parents stopped the whole conversation and pointedly asked me what of theirs I would want. I looked around, the place looks like a sea of polka dots with all the stickers and I said I didnt want anything. The reaction I got was stunned silence. The step-siblings were incensed that I didn't go through the house like I was shopping and said I didnt want anything because everything was already taken.\n\nThere must have been a prior conversation because I saw my mom smirking at my stepdad like I told you so.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a 40-year-old person whose stepdad and mom are creating their wills. The stepdad is acting like he's going to die soon, and all the family members, including step-siblings and grandchildren, are marking items they want with stickers. The main character, when asked what they want, says they don't want anything, which upsets the step-siblings. The question is whether the main character is at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The family is getting overly involved in what seems like a premature and possibly greedy behavior. The main character is not close to the step-siblings and finds them to be shallow and self-centered. When asked directly, the main character honestly states they don't want anything, which leads to a negative reaction from others.\n\nLegally, the parents can decide how to distribute their assets, so the main character isn't in the wrong legally. Ethically, it's about family dynamics and expectations. The main character is not taking anything, which might be seen as polite or as a way to avoid conflict. However, the step-siblings are upset because they thought the main character would take more, but the main character's decision not to take anything might be because they don't want to participate in what they see as a greedy or inappropriate process.\n\nThe key points here are that the main character is honest about their feelings and isn't taking advantage of the situation. They're not interfering with the parents' wills but are declining to partake in the family's scramble. The parents' reaction and the step-siblings' anger might stem from their own expectations, but the main character isn't wrong for not wanting to join in. The answer would hinge on the idea that it's the family's fault for their behavior, not the main character's. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
