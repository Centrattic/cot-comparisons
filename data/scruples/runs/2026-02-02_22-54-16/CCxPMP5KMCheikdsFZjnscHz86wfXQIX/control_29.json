      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the question is wrong for thinking that the parent on parental leave should be the one getting up with the baby at night. The situation involves splitting night duties when one parent is working and the other is on leave.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the common practices around parental leave and night duties. Typically, parents might split responsibilities based on their schedules. The parent on leave might have more flexibility to adjust their sleep schedule, while the working parent needs to be up early for work. But does that mean it's fair to assign all the overnight duties to the parent on leave?\n\nI should think about the reasons behind this arrangement. The working parent needs to get enough rest to function during the day, which is logical. However, the parent on leave might have physical recovery needs, especially if they're the birth parent. Plus, the parent on leave is not working, so maybe they have more capacity to handle nighttime duties. But is that always the case?\n\nAnother angle is the potential for burnout. If the non-working parent is handling all the night feedings or care, they might get exhausted, which could affect their well-being. Also, the idea that the working parent should get more sleep might be a societal norm rather than a strict rule. It's possible that both parents need rest, and splitting the duties could be more balanced, even if it's not perfectly equal.\n\nCultural expectations might play a role here. In some cultures, the parent on leave is expected to take more responsibility for night duties because they have the time. But in other contexts, fairness and shared responsibility are emphasized regardless of work schedules.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for thinking this way. If the author is suggesting that the parent on leave should handle all the night shifts because the other parent is working, is that a valid perspective or not? It might depend on the specific circumstances, like the parents' health, the baby's needs, and their mutual agreement. If it's a mutual decision that works for both, then maybe it's okay. But if it's an assumption without considering the non-working parent's needs, it could be problematic.\n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether it's fair to assume the non-working parent should take all the night duties. If it's based on practicality (like the working parent needing sleep), then the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. However, if it's an unfair expectation without considering the non-working parent's well-being, then they might be. The question doesn't provide enough context about the parents' agreement or health, so it's a bit ambiguous. But generally, the author's reasoning might be seen as reasonable if it's a practical arrangement. However, some might argue that both parents should share the load as much as possible, regardless of work schedules. So, the answer could be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) if the reasoning is based on practical work schedules, but others might say A (Yes) if fairness is considered regardless of work.\n"
