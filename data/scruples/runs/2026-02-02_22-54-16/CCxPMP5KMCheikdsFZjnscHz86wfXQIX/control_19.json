      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who posted this is in the wrong. The situation is about whether the parent on parental leave should be the one getting up with the baby at night. The parent is saying they don't understand splitting night shifts when one is working and the other isn't.\n\nFirst, I need to consider common societal views on parental leave and responsibilities. Typically, parental leave allows one parent to take time off work to care for the baby. During this period, that parent might be expected to handle more of the nighttime duties since they're not working. However, this isn't a hard and fast rule and can vary based on family agreements, cultural norms, and individual circumstances.\n\nThe key here is whether the parent on leave should automatically take over nighttime feedings. Some might argue that both parents should share responsibilities equally regardless of work schedules. Others might think that the working parent needs rest to perform their job, making it practical for the non-working parent to handle the night duties.\n\nThe original poster is suggesting that splitting the nights isn't necessary because one parent is working. They might be advocating for the working parent to rest, which could be seen as reasonable. However, if the non-working parent is already taking time off to care for the baby, expecting them to handle all night duties could lead to burnout. It's about balance and mutual agreement.\n\nIn some cases, the working parent might still want to participate in nighttime care to bond with the baby. But if they're exhausted from work, it's logical for the other parent to take over. The question is whether the assumption that the non-working parent should handle it is valid.\n\nConsidering that parental leave is meant to allow both parents to adjust to the new arrival, the division of labor should ideally be agreed upon by the parents. The author's stance is based on practicality\u2014prioritizing the working parent's rest. There's no inherent right or wrong here, but the author's position isn't necessarily wrong if it's based on mutual agreement and practical considerations.\n\nSo, the answer is B (No), because the author isn't in the wrong; their perspective is based on practical work-life balance and common parental leave expectations.\n"
