      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who thinks the parent on parental leave should stay up with the baby at night is in the wrong. The question is framed as \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole), which usually invites a discussion on social norms and expectations.\n\nFirst, I need to consider typical societal expectations. In many cultures, there's an expectation that the parent not working should take on more childcare responsibilities, especially during the early months when sleep is disrupted. Parental leave is often given to support bonding and adjust to the new addition, so it makes sense that this parent might handle nighttime duties to allow the working parent to rest for their job.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that every family's situation is different. Some parents might share the nighttime duties regardless of work schedules. But the original question is about whether the author is in the wrong for thinking the non-working parent should take over. The key here is that the author is suggesting a division based on the parent's work obligations. \n\nFrom a fairness standpoint, if one parent is off work and the other is working, it's logical that the non-working parent handles the night feeds or wake-ups so the working parent can get the rest they need for their job. This isn't necessarily about being right or wrong but about practicality and support. \n\nBut then again, some might argue that both parents should share equally, regardless of work schedules. However, the author's reasoning is based on the practical need for the working parent to be rested. Since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, and given that many people would agree with the author's perspective, the answer would lean towards the author not being in the wrong.\n"
