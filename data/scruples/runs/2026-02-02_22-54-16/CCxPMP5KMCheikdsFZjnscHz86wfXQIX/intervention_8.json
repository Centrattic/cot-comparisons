      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is wrong for thinking that the parent on parental leave should be the one to get up with the baby at night. The situation is that one parent is off work for six weeks, while the other has to go to work every morning. The author doesn't see the need for splitting the night duties.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Parental leave is usually taken to bond with the baby and manage childcare, so the parent on leave might have more flexibility. The working parent needs to get up early for work, so their sleep might be more disrupted if they also have to get up during the night. The author's reasoning is that the parent not working in the morning can handle the night feedings without affecting their job. \n\nBut is this fair? Well, everyone's situation is different. Some parents might prefer to split the duties for more fairness or bonding. However, the author is not forcing the other parent; they're just suggesting that the leave parent should handle the nighttime tasks. It's a matter of opinion. \n\nThe key points here are the practicality of the working parent needing to sleep enough for work and the leave parent having the time. The author's stance seems reasonable from a practical standpoint. There's no inherent wrongness in prioritizing the working parent's need to rest. So, the answer is likely B.\n"
