      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person asking the question (the author) is in the wrong for thinking that the parent on parental leave should be the one getting up with the baby at night. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThe author is suggesting that when one parent is on leave and the other has to go to work every morning, the parent who's not working should handle the overnight duties. They don't see a reason to split the overnights, maybe because splitting would be more complicated or less efficient. The question is whether this is a fair or unfair assumption.\n\nFirst, I should consider the reasons behind the author's thinking. They might argue that the working parent is already dealing with a full day of work and needs more rest, while the parent on leave is not working and can take the extra shifts. That seems logical because the working parent needs to be rested for their job, which could be mentally and physically demanding. On the other hand, the parent on leave might have more flexibility and less need for sleep since they're not commuting or working.\n\nBut then there are other factors to consider. Parental leave isn't always just about being free from work; it's also about bonding with the baby and sharing the responsibilities. If the parent on leave is already doing all the night feedings, they might miss out on some rest, which is important for their well-being too. Fatigue can be a big issue for new parents, and not getting enough sleep can affect their mental and physical health. So maybe splitting the duties could help prevent burnout for both parents.\n\nAnother angle is the assumption that the parent on leave is automatically the one who should take over all the night duties. Maybe that parent has other responsibilities or needs rest as much as the working parent. The author's suggestion could be seen as placing an unfair burden on the parent who's not working, especially if they're already juggling childcare during the day. It's possible that mutual agreement and flexibility are more important than a strict division based on who's working.\n\nAlso, cultural or societal norms might influence this. In some cultures, it's expected that the non-working parent takes on more childcare duties, but in others, there's an emphasis on shared parenting responsibilities. The answer might depend on the specific context of the parents' agreement and their personal preferences.\n\nI should also think about the potential consequences. If the working parent takes a night shift, they might be too tired for work the next day, which could affect their job performance. Conversely, if the parent on leave is constantly up at night without rest, their recovery and ability to bond with the baby might suffer. It's a balance between practicality and fairness.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the author is making a blanket statement without considering the other parent's needs or preferences, then maybe they are. However, if the parent on leave is willing and able to take on those duties, then the author's suggestion is reasonable. The key here is whether there's a mutual agreement or if one parent is being forced into it without consideration for their situation.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's perspective has a practical basis, but it's important that both parents communicate and agree on a plan that works for them. If the author is advocating for a division that's fair and considerate of both parties' needs, then they're not in the wrong. However, if they're imposing their own views without considering the other parent's circumstances, then they might be. Since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, and the answer options are A (Yes) or B (No), I need to decide based on whether the author's reasoning is inherently flawed or not.\n"
