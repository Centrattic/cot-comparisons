      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the question is in the wrong. The situation is about who should get up with the baby at night when one parent is on parental leave.\n\nSo the author is saying they think the parent on leave should take overnights because the other parent has to go to work every morning. They're asking if they're in the wrong (AITA). \n\nFirst, I need to consider the common perspectives. Parental leave is often a time when the parent not working can take more responsibility for the baby, including night feedings. The parent going back to work might need their sleep to be rested for the day. On the other hand, some might argue that both parents should share responsibilities equally, even if one is on leave.\n\nBut the author's reasoning is based on practicality: the parent on leave is free, so they should handle the night feeds so the working parent can get enough rest. That makes sense because a well-rested parent can function better at work. It's also about balancing the workload. \n\nI don't think the author is in the wrong here. They're prioritizing the working parent's needs to maintain their job performance. Plus, the parent on leave might have more flexibility. So the answer is probably B (No, they aren't in the wrong).\n"
