      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for thinking the parent on parental leave should be the one getting up with the baby at night. The situation is about splitting overnight duties when one parent is off work for six weeks and the other has to work every morning.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the dynamics here. The parent on leave isn't working, so they have more flexibility. The other parent is working early mornings, which might make it harder for them to get up during the night. The author argues that the non-working parent should handle the night duties to help the working parent get enough rest for their job.\n\nI should consider common parental advice. Often, it's suggested that the parent not working should take the night shifts so the working parent can sleep and function better during the day. That makes sense because the working parent needs more rest to perform their job effectively. However, this can vary based on the parents' preferences, energy levels, and other factors. But in the scenario given, there's no mention of any physical limitations or preferences, just a straightforward work schedule.\n\nThe key point is whether the assumption is unfair. If both parents are equally capable and there's no prior agreement, some might argue that splitting the duties is fair. However, the working parent's need for rest might make the author's suggestion reasonable. The question is if the author is wrong for not splitting the duties and instead suggesting the non-working parent should take over.\n\nAnother angle: the parent on leave might also be adjusting to the baby's schedule and might not mind the night shifts. But if the author is making a blanket statement without considering their partner's feelings, that could be an issue. However, the question is about who is in the wrong, not about the best approach. Since the author's reasoning is based on practicality (helping the working parent rest), it might not be wrong. So the answer is probably B, No.\n"
