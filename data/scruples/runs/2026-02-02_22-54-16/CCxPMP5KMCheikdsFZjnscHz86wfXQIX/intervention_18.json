      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the question is in the wrong. The scenario is about whether the parent on parental leave should be the one getting up with the baby at night when the other parent is working.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the arguments. The author thinks that splitting overnight duties isn't right when one parent is working all day. So they're suggesting the non-working parent should handle the night feedings. The user says they don't think the author is wrong, but wants confirmation.\n\nI should consider different perspectives. Parental responsibilities can be tricky. Some might argue that both parents should share duties equally, regardless of work schedules. Others might think it's fair for the parent with more flexibility (the one on leave) to take the night shifts. \n\nBut wait, the parent on leave isn't working, so they have more time. It makes sense that they could handle the middle-of-the-night tasks. The working parent has to get up early and might need more rest. That seems practical. So the author's reasoning is logical from a practical standpoint.\n\nHowever, some people might feel that both parents should pitch in equally to ensure the working parent also gets involved. But the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. If their reasoning is based on practicality rather than fairness, maybe they aren't wrong. It's a personal decision for the family. \n\nI think the answer is B. The author isn't in the wrong because their reasoning is based on the parent's work schedules and the need for the working parent to rest. It's a common approach in many families to have the non-working parent handle night duties.\n"
