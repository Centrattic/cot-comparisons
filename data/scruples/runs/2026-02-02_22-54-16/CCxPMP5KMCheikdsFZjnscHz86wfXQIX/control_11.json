      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the question is in the wrong for thinking the parent on parental leave should be the one getting up with the baby at night. The situation involves splitting overnight duties when one parent is working and the other is on leave.\n\nFirst, I need to consider common parental leave arrangements. Typically, when one parent is on leave, they might take the primary role in nighttime care to allow the working parent to get more rest. The working parent has to get up early for work, so having the non-working parent handle nighttime duties could be logical. But this isn't a strict rule; it can depend on the family's specific circumstances and preferences.\n\nThe question is about whether the author is wrong for this belief. The options are A (yes, they're wrong) or B (no, they're not). The key here is to assess if the author's assumption is universally incorrect or if it's a reasonable perspective. \n\nFactors to consider: \n1. **Work Demands**: The working parent might need more sleep to function well during the day. \n2. **Parental Leave Purpose**: Parental leave is meant to allow bonding and share care responsibilities. \n3. **Alternating vs. Splitting**: Some families alternate nights, but if one parent is already off work, splitting by work schedules makes sense. \n\nThere's no one-size-fits-all answer. The author's reasoning is based on practicality, which is a common approach. However, some might argue that both parents should share duties equally regardless of work schedules. But the question is about being \"in the wrong.\" Since the author is just expressing their opinion, and there's no ethical wrongness in their reasoning unless it's based on harmful stereotypes (which isn't indicated here), the answer would likely be B (not in the wrong). \n\nI should check if there's any cultural or social norms that might influence this. In many cultures, it's common for the non-working parent to take on more nighttime duties, especially if the working parent needs to be alert. So the author isn't necessarily wrong. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
