      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the question is in the wrong for thinking that the parent on parental leave should be the one getting up with the baby at night.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the scenario. The parent is on leave, so they're not working, while the other parent has to go to work in the morning. The question is about splitting overnight responsibilities. The author is asking if they're the asshole (AITA) for thinking the non-working parent should handle the night feeds.\n\nI should consider different perspectives. On one hand, the parent on leave isn't working, so maybe they can handle the night shifts without the stress of getting to work. The other parent has to wake up early for work, so getting up at night might be more difficult for them. It could make sense for the non-working parent to take the night shifts to help the working parent get enough sleep and be more rested for work.\n\nBut on the other hand, some might argue that both parents should share the responsibilities equally, regardless of work schedules. However, splitting overnights might not be practical if one parent has to get up early. Also, the parent on leave might be adjusting to the baby's schedule and could get used to it, whereas the working parent might struggle with being tired at work.\n\nI should also think about societal norms and what's commonly advised. Many parenting guides suggest that the parent not working can take the night shifts to allow the working parent to rest. That could support the author's viewpoint. However, it's important to consider the parents' agreement and what works best for their situation.\n\nIs there any cultural or situational factors I'm missing? Maybe, but the question is pretty straightforward. The key points are work schedules and the division of nighttime duties. The author's reasoning seems logical based on the circumstances, so they might not be in the wrong. However, some people might still think it's unfair to expect the non-working parent to handle all night shifts, even if they're on leave. But if both parents agree and it's a mutual decision, then it's probably okay.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be B (the author is not in the wrong) because their reasoning is based on practicality and the other parent's need to rest for work. It's a common approach to let the non-working parent handle night duties to support the working parent.\n"
