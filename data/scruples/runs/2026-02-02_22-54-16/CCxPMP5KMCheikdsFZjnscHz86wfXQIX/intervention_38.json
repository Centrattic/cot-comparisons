      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the question is in the wrong. The situation is about who should get up with the baby at night when one parent is on parental leave and the other has to go to work.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the scenario. The parent on leave isn't working, so maybe they have more flexibility. The other parent is working, so they have to get up early for work. The author is suggesting that the parent on leave should be the one to handle the overnight duties to avoid disrupting the working parent's sleep and morning routine. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author is wrong for thinking that. Well, it depends on a few factors. Parental responsibilities can vary a lot based on individual circumstances. Some couples might split the night duties equally, but in this case, the working parent might need more rest. If the parent on leave can take over the middle-of-the-night feedings or check-ins, that could help the working parent get enough sleep, which is important for their job performance and well-being. \n\nHowever, the parent on leave might also need rest to manage their own responsibilities during the day. It's possible that they're already doing a lot, especially if they're managing childcare and other household duties. But maybe they can adjust their schedule since they're not working. This could be a way to share the load more effectively. \n\nIt's also important to consider the couple's agreement or what's feasible for them. If the working parent doesn't mind getting up, maybe there's no issue. But the author's reasoning is practical: ensuring the working parent gets enough rest. So, the author isn't necessarily wrong for advocating for that. \n\nOn the flip side, expecting the non-working parent to handle all the night duties might not be fair either, especially if it's causing them exhaustion. But given the context of one parent needing to be alert for work, the author's suggestion makes sense. \n\nSo, I think the author isn't in the wrong here. They're considering the practical needs of the working parent. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
