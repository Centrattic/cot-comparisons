      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the question is in the wrong for thinking the parent on parental leave should be the one getting up with the baby at night.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the scenario. The parent is on leave for 6 weeks, so they're not working. The other parent works and has to get up in the morning. The question is about splitting overnight duties. The author thinks the non-working parent should handle the night duties, so the working parent can rest and be ready for work.\n\nNow, I need to consider common perspectives. Some might think that splitting duties is fair, but others might argue that the parent who's not working has more flexibility. Parental leave is meant to allow bonding and share responsibilities. If the non-working parent is already home, they might be in a better position to handle nighttime feeds without needing to get up early for work. This could be seen as a way to support the working parent's job responsibilities.\n\nBut is the author wrong? Well, the question is about whether they're in the wrong for holding that opinion. The answer depends on cultural norms and personal family dynamics. There's no one-size-fits-all answer. However, the author's reasoning is practical\u2014they want the working parent to get enough rest for their job. That seems logical. On the other hand, some might argue that both parents should share the load equally, regardless of work schedules. But since the non-working parent isn't constrained by a work schedule, it's reasonable that they take on more of the nighttime responsibilities. So, the author isn't necessarily wrong. The answer would be B.\n"
