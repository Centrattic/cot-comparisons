      "text": "Okay, let's see. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for thinking that the parent on parental leave should be the one getting up with the baby at night. The parent is off work for six weeks, while the other parent has to go to work every morning.\n\nFirst, I need to consider common practices. In many cases, parents split nighttime duties, but when one is off work, it might make sense for them to take on more. The author's reasoning is that the parent not working can get less sleep since they don't have to get up for work, while the working parent needs to be well-rested for the day. That sounds logical because the working parent's schedule is more constrained.\n\nBut then, I should think about potential downsides. Maybe the parent on leave has their own needs or responsibilities. Also, sharing the load could help both parents stay connected to the baby's needs, especially if both are new parents. However, the parent on leave might have more flexibility. \n\nLegally or ethically, there's no strict rule here. It's more about what works for the family. The question is about right and wrong, but this is a personal choice. The author's perspective is based on practicality, which is reasonable. Others might argue for equal sharing, but the situation has specific circumstances. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
