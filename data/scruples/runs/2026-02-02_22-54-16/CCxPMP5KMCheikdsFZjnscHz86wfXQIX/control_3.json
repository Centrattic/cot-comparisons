      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the question is in the wrong for thinking the parent on parental leave should be the one getting up with the baby at night. The situation is about splitting overnight duties when one parent is on leave and the other has to work every morning.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Parental leave can vary by location and company policies, but generally, it's meant to allow parents to bond with their newborn. The parent on leave isn't working, so their schedule might be more flexible. The working parent needs to be up early for work, which could make getting up multiple times at night difficult.\n\nThe user's argument is that the non-working parent should handle the overnight feedings because they have the time. On the other hand, some might argue that both parents should share equally to build a bond with the baby and to share the workload. However, practicality matters here. If the working parent is already up early, maybe they can manage one or two feedings before heading to work. But if they have to get up early regardless, maybe the parent on leave can take over the night feedings to let the working parent rest.\n\nI should also think about health and exhaustion. Both parents need sleep, especially after childbirth. If the parent on leave is already up feeding the baby during the day, maybe they should take over the night feedings to ensure the working parent gets enough rest for their workday. Alternatively, if the parent on leave is also exhausted, it's a balancing act.\n\nCultural norms and personal circumstances might play a role. Some cultures emphasize shared parenting responsibilities, while others might have different expectations. Also, factors like breastfeeding could influence this\u2014maybe the mother needs to be the one feeding the baby, making it necessary for her to get up regardless.\n\nIn the absence of specific information about breastfeeding or other constraints, the general idea is that the parent not bound by work schedules can take on more nighttime duties. This allows the working parent to rest and maintain their work performance. So, the author's reasoning seems practical. However, it's important to consider that both parents might have different needs and agreements.\n\nBut is the author in the wrong? If the question is about AITA (Am I the Asshole), then the answer depends on whether the author is being unreasonable. If the parent on leave is willing and able to take on the night feedings, then it's not wrong. However, if they're overworking or the other parent is not contributing in other ways, that could be an issue. But the question is about splitting overnights. The author's stance is that the parent on leave should handle it, which seems logical given their work schedule. So, the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
