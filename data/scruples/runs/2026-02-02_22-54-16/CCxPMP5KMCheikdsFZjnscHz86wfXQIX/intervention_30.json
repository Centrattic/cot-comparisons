      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole?) question is in the wrong. The situation is about who should get up with the baby at night when one parent is on parental leave and the other is working.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author is suggesting that the parent on leave should be the one getting up with the baby at night because the working parent has to get up for work every morning. The other parent is off work for six weeks. The question is whether this is a reasonable expectation, making the author not in the wrong, or if it's unfair, making them in the wrong.\n\nI should consider common societal norms. Parental leave is often structured so that the parent not working can be more available for childcare. So if one parent is already on leave, it's logical that they take on more nighttime responsibilities. However, some might argue that both parents should share the load equally regardless of work schedules. But the working parent has to get up early for work, which might disrupt their sleep more if they have to get up multiple times at night. The parent on leave might have more flexible hours, so it's feasible for them to handle the night feedings or comforting without the added stress of an early work start.\n\nAnother angle is physical and mental health. The working parent might be more tired from getting up early and then dealing with night wakings. The parent on leave might have the capacity to adjust their sleep schedule to handle the nighttime duties. Also, in some cultures, the primary caregiver (often the mother, but not always) is expected to manage nighttime care, but that's changing as more fathers take on shared responsibilities.\n\nI should also think about the practicality. If the working parent is up early for work, they might not get enough rest if they also have to get up multiple times at night. The parent on leave can get more rest by alternating nights or handling most of the night duties. However, it's important to note that both parents should ideally share responsibilities to avoid resentment and burnout.\n\nThe key here is whether the author's reasoning is valid. The argument is that the parent not working should take over night duties since the working parent needs their sleep for work. That seems logical. But could there be exceptions? For example, if the parent on leave has their own needs or if the baby is particularly difficult to soothe at night, requiring the other parent's help. However, the question doesn't mention any such exceptions.\n\nIn terms of fairness, splitting overnights equally (e.g., alternating nights) might be ideal in some cases, but when one parent's work schedule is affected, it's reasonable to adjust. The author is suggesting that fairness isn't about equal time but about considering each parent's circumstances. Since the parent on leave isn't working, they have the flexibility to manage night duties without the added pressure of an early morning.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong for thinking that the parent on leave should handle the night feedings or wakings. Their reasoning is based on practicality and each parent's work commitments. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
