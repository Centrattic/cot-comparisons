      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about a parent on parental leave and who should get up with the baby at night.\n\nThe author is saying that they think the parent on leave should handle the overnight feedings since the other parent is working and gets up early for work. They're asking if they're the asshole for thinking that.\n\nHmm. Well, first, I need to consider the typical dynamics here. Parental leave can vary by country, but generally, the parent not working might have more flexibility. But both parents might have their own reasons for needing rest. The working parent is up early for work, so maybe they need more sleep. The parent on leave might be there to support and bond with the baby, so taking over the middle of the night could make sense.\n\nBut is it fair to assume the parent on leave should take over all the night duties? Maybe not. Exhaustion is a big issue for both parents. Some might argue that sharing duties helps in bonding and prevents one parent from getting too tired. Also, the parent on leave might need their rest too, especially if they're not working but still have other responsibilities.\n\nBut the author's reasoning is that the working parent is already up early, so they should handle the overnight to get more sleep. The parent on leave can take the night feedings since they're not working. That makes sense logically. However, there's also the emotional aspect. Maybe the parent on leave wants to be involved in the baby's care. Or maybe they're just as tired.\n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key here is that the author is making a request based on the idea that the parent not working should handle the overnight. But is that a reasonable expectation? It depends on the parents' agreement and what's best for their situation. If both parents are okay with it, then it's not a problem. If the parent on leave is being asked to do all the work without agreement, then maybe the author's assumption is problematic.\n\nHowever, the author isn't making a demand but expressing their opinion. So, if they're just sharing their perspective, maybe they're not in the wrong. It's a personal choice unless they're forcing it. The answer might depend on the context not given here, but based solely on the provided info, the author's reasoning seems logical. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
