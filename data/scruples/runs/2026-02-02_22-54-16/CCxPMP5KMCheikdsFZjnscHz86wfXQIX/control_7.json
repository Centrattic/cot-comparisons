      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the question is in the wrong. The situation is about whether the parent on parental leave should be the one getting up with the baby at night.\n\nThe author's main point is that they don't understand splitting overnight duties when one parent is working and the other isn't. They're suggesting that the parent not working (on leave) should take over nighttime duties so the working parent can get more sleep. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the typical arguments here. Parental leave is meant to allow a parent to bond with the baby, but also to help with the baby's care. However, sleep deprivation is a big issue for new parents. If one parent is working, they might need to be rested for their job. But the parent on leave might also need rest to manage their own well-being and to care for the baby effectively during the day. \n\nThere's no one-size-fits-all answer here. Some might argue that the working parent needs more sleep, so the stay-at-home parent should take the night shifts. Others might say that both parents should share the load as equally as possible, even if one is working. It depends on the family's circumstances and what works best for them. \n\nThe author is asking if they're in the wrong for believing the parent on leave should handle the overnight. If the parent is taking leave specifically to help with the baby, maybe they should share the responsibilities. But if the parent is on leave to bond and also needs rest, it's a balance. \n\nI think the key here is that both parents need to communicate and find a solution that works for their situation. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since parental leave can vary in how it's used, and there's no universal standard, the author's perspective isn't necessarily wrong. They might be prioritizing their own well-being, which is valid. However, the other parent's needs should also be considered. \n\nSo, I would say the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They have a valid point about the working parent needing sleep. Answer B.\n"
