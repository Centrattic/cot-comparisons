      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for thinking the parent on parental leave should be the one to get up with the baby at night. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: one parent is on leave, so they're not working, while the other has to go to work every morning. The author's question is about whether it's fair for the non-working parent to handle the overnight feedings or tasks. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but they want a second opinion.\n\nI need to consider typical parental leave arrangements. Often, the parent on leave is expected to take on more childcare responsibilities during that time, including overnight care. The reasoning might be that they're not working, so it's more feasible for them to handle those duties. However, this can vary a lot based on the parents' agreement, cultural norms, and the specific circumstances.\n\nBut the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The AITA (Am I the Asshole) context usually looks at social norms and expectations. In many cases, splitting overnight duties when both parents have similar work schedules is common, but when one is on leave, the expectation might shift. However, it's not a universal rule. Some might argue that both parents should share responsibilities regardless of work status, especially if the non-working parent is also managing other tasks during the day.\n\nBut the author's point is about practicality: if one parent has to get up for work anyway, maybe they should handle the overnight, while the other, who's already off, can take over. That makes sense from a practical standpoint. So is the author in the wrong? If the parents have agreed on this arrangement, then no. But if the author is enforcing this without considering the other parent's preferences or if it's causing conflict, maybe there's an issue.\n\nHowever, the question is framed as a general scenario, not a specific case. So, based on common practices and the logic presented, the author's reasoning seems reasonable. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
