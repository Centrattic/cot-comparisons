      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author of the question is in the wrong for thinking that the parent on parental leave should be the one getting up with the baby at night. The situation involves splitting overnight responsibilities when one parent is on leave and the other is working. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. Parental leave often allows one parent to be home with the baby for an extended period, which can be a time to adjust to the newborn. The working parent has to get up early for work, so maybe they are more tired or need more rest. The parent on leave might have more flexibility in their schedule since they're not going to work.\n\nBut is it fair to assign all the overnight duties to the parent on leave? Some might argue that the parent on leave is there to support the family and help with childcare, so it's reasonable. Others might say that both parents should share the workload equally, regardless of work schedules. However, given that the working parent has a more demanding schedule in the mornings, maybe it's practical for them to get more sleep. The parent on leave might have the capacity to take on more during the night since they\u2019re not working.\n\nI should also think about the physical and emotional well-being of both parents. Constantly getting up at night can be exhausting. If the parent on leave is handling all the night duties, they might not get adequate rest either. It's possible that sharing the duties could be more balanced, but the user is specifically asking if the author is wrong for thinking the parent on leave should handle it.\n\nLooking at similar situations, there's no one-size-fits-all answer. Family dynamics vary, and what works for one couple might not work for another. The key is communication and mutual agreement. However, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. If the author's reasoning is that the parent not working can handle the night duties because they're not going to work, that might be a reasonable perspective. It's about practicality rather than fairness. \n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They are making a case based on the work schedules of the parents. Therefore, the answer would be that the author is not in the wrong.\n"
