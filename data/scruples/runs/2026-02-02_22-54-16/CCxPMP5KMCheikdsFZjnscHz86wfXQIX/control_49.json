The situation is about splitting overnight duties when one parent is working and the other is on leave.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the scenario. The parent on leave isn't working, so maybe they have more flexibility. The working parent gets up early for work every day. The author's reasoning is that the non-working parent should handle the night feeds because they aren't tied to a morning schedule. \n\nBut is this a common expectation? Parenting responsibilities often require teamwork. Some might argue that both parents should share the load, regardless of work schedules. However, others might agree that the parent not working can take on more nighttime duties to allow the working parent to get more rest and be functional during the day.\n\nThere's no one-size-fits-all answer here. It depends on the family's circumstances and agreements. The author isn't necessarily wrong for thinking this way, but others might disagree. The key is whether the arrangement is causing conflict. If both parents are on the same page, it's fine. If not, maybe there's a misunderstanding. The question is about whether the author is in the wrong. Since the answer options are A (yes) or B (no), and the community often emphasizes mutual agreement and flexibility, the answer might be B (no), as the author's reasoning is valid in their context, even if others might have different opinions.\n"
