      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the given AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about who should get up with the baby at night when one parent is on parental leave and the other is working.\n\nSo the author is saying they think the parent on leave should handle the overnight duties. The other parent is working and needs to get up early for work. The author is asking if they're in the wrong for thinking that. The options are A (yes, they're wrong) or B (no, they're not wrong).\n\nFirst, I need to consider common perspectives on this. Parental leave can vary by country and company policies, but generally, the idea is to give the parent time off to bond with the baby. However, the practical aspect of sleep schedules is tricky. Some people might argue that the parent who is at home should take on more night duties because they're already off work and have more flexibility. Others might say that both parents should share the load regardless of work commitments, to build a bond and ensure both are involved.\n\nBut the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The key here is the reasoning. The author's argument is that the parent on leave should handle the overnights since the other has to get up for work. This makes sense from a practical standpoint\u2014so the working parent can get more rest for their job. However, some might argue that both parents should contribute equally to nighttime care to prevent burnout and ensure shared responsibility. But the parent on leave isn't working, so they have the time. \n\nIn many cultures, there's an expectation that the parent on leave takes the majority of the nighttime duties. It's also more efficient if the working parent can sleep more to function during the day. So from that perspective, the author's reasoning is logical. However, others might see it as unfair if the parent on leave is already doing more during the day. But the scenario specifically mentions splitting the overnights, not the daytime duties.\n\nConsidering that the question is about the author's stance, the answer might hinge on whether it's considered reasonable to expect the parent on leave to handle the overnights. If someone thinks it's wrong to make the non-working parent handle all the overnights, then the author is in the right. But if the expectation is that both should share equally regardless of work, then the author is wrong. \n\nBut since the parent is on leave, their job is to care for the child. So the author's reasoning is based on practicality. Therefore, the answer might be B (not in the wrong). However, I should be careful here. Some might argue that both parents should share equally, but the parent on leave is the one with the flexibility. It's a common arrangement. So the author is not in the wrong.\n"
