      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read the question again. The person is asking if they're at fault for thinking the parent on parental leave should be the one getting up with the baby at night. They mention that splitting overnights doesn't make sense when one parent is working every morning and the other is on leave for six weeks.\n\nFirst, I should consider the context. Parental leave can be a time when one parent is not working, so maybe the idea is that they can take on more nighttime duties to allow the working parent to rest. But is that fair? Well, everyone's situation is different. Some parents might prefer to share the nighttime duties regardless of work schedules. Others might find it logical to let the one on leave handle it since they're not as time-constrained.\n\nThe author is suggesting that the parent on leave should take overnights. That could be seen as logical because they have more flexibility. However, others might argue that splitting nights is better for both parents' mental health and bonding with the baby. Also, if the working parent is already stressed from their job, maybe they need more sleep. But the parent on leave might also be exhausted from managing the baby alone during the day and nights.\n\nI think it's a matter of perspective. The author isn't necessarily wrong for thinking that way. There's no one-size-fits-all answer. Some couples might agree that the parent not working should handle overnights, while others might want to share. The key is communication and mutual agreement. Since the author is asking if they're at fault, it's possible they're in a situation where their partner or others think they're wrong. But based on the information given, there's no definitive right or wrong. The author's perspective is valid in the context they provided, so they might not be in the wrong.\n"
