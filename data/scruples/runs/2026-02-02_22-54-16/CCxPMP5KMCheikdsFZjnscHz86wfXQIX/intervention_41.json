      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong. The situation is about parental leave and who should get up with the baby at night. The author thinks the parent on leave should handle the overnights since the other parent is working and needs to get up early.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. Parental leave is usually taken for bonding with the baby, and the parent not working might have more flexibility. The working parent needs to be rested for their job, so they can't afford to lose sleep. On the other hand, the parent on leave isn't working, so taking overnights might be manageable for them. \n\nBut is it fair to assume that the parent on leave must always take the night shifts? Maybe there are other factors. For example, some parents on leave might have other responsibilities or need rest too. Also, sharing the load could be beneficial for both parents to adjust to the new baby. \n\nHowever, the author's reasoning is practical: the working parent needs to get up early, so they should have the sleep they need. The parent on leave can take the overnights since they don't have work commitments. This seems logical. There's no inherent wrongdoing in suggesting that. The key is whether the author is imposing this expectation without considering the other parent's needs. If it's a mutual agreement, it's fine. But if the author is forcing this without discussion, maybe that's an issue. \n\nBut the question is about being in the wrong. The original post is seeking validation for their perspective. The author isn't necessarily saying they are the only ones who should take the overnights, just questioning if they're wrong for thinking so. \n\nIn many cases, parents do divide responsibilities based on practicality. So the author isn't in the wrong for this line of thinking. The answer is likely B.\n"
