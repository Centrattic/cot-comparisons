      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the question is in the wrong. The situation is about whether the parent on parental leave should be the one getting up with the baby at night. The author is thinking that since one parent is off work for six weeks and the other has to get up for work every morning, it makes sense for the off-work parent to handle the night feeds. They're asking if they're the asshole (AITA) for that belief.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Parental leave is usually taken to allow the parent to bond with the baby and share in the care. However, each family's situation can vary. The author's reasoning is that the parent not working can take on the night duties, allowing the working parent to get more sleep and be fresh for work. That seems logical from a practical standpoint.\n\nBut then, some might argue that both parents should share the responsibilities equally, regardless of work schedules. However, in this case, the parent on leave isn't working, so maybe they have more flexibility. The working parent might need their rest to function well during the day. \n\nI should also think about possible cultural or societal norms. Some people believe in equal sharing of parenting duties, but others prioritize practicality based on individual circumstances. The key here is whether the author's reasoning is valid given the specific situation. The parent on leave isn't working, so they might not have the same time constraints as the working parent. It could be more efficient for the off-work parent to handle the middle-of-the-night duties, allowing the working parent to rest.\n\nAnother angle: the parent on leave is already not working, so they might have more time to dedicate to the baby. It's a common arrangement in many families where the non-working parent takes on more night duties. Unless there's some other factor not mentioned here, the author's reasoning seems reasonable. \n\nBut maybe there's an assumption that the parent on leave should also be getting rest for when they return to work. However, if the leave is for six weeks, the parent might not be returning to work immediately, especially if it's a maternity or paternity leave. So the working parent's need for rest to maintain their job is more pressing.\n\nI think the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong). The reasoning is practical and considers the working parent's need for sleep. Sharing the duties equally might not be feasible here, and the author's suggestion is based on the specific circumstances of one parent being off work.\n"
