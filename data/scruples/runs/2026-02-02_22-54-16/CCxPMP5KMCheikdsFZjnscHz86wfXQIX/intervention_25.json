      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole?) question is in the wrong. The situation is about whether the parent on parental leave should be the one getting up with the baby at night while the other parent is working. The author of the question is asking if they're in the wrong for thinking that the non-working parent should take the overnight shifts.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the common practices around parental leave and shared responsibilities. Parental leave policies can vary, but generally, the idea is to allow a parent to bond with the baby. If one parent is on leave, they might have more flexibility in their schedule compared to the working parent who needs to be up early for work.\n\nFrom a fairness perspective, it makes sense that the parent who isn't working could take the night shifts since they don't have the time constraints of needing to get to work early. This setup might help the working parent get more rest, which is important for their well-being and job performance. It's also about balancing the workload between both parents. The parent on leave can manage the night feedings, while the working parent can rest. \n\nHowever, there could be exceptions. For example, if the non-working parent is also dealing with postpartum recovery or health issues, it might not be feasible for them to handle all the night shifts. But the question doesn't mention any such exceptions. The author's reasoning is based on the practicality of splitting the overnights when one parent is working and the other isn't. \n\nIt's also important to consider that parental responsibilities should ideally be shared as much as possible. But in this specific scenario, where one parent is off work, it's logical to assign the night shifts to them. The working parent needs their rest for the next day, and the non-working parent can adjust their schedule as they have more flexibility. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. They're making a practical suggestion based on the parents' different schedules. There's no indication that they're being unfair or dismissive of the other parent's needs. They're just trying to balance the responsibilities based on the current circumstances. Therefore, the answer should be B, meaning the author is not in the wrong.\n"
