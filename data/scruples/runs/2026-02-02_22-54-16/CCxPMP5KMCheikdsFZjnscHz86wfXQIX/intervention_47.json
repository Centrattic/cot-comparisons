      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote the question is in the wrong. The original post is about whether the parent on parental leave should be the one getting up with the baby at night when the other parent is working. The person is saying they think splitting the overnights isn't fair because one parent is working and the other isn't. The user thinks the author is not wrong, but wants to know if they are in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. Parental leave can vary by country, but generally, the parent on leave isn't working, so their schedule is more flexible. The working parent might need to be up early for work, which could make it harder for them to get up in the middle of the night. The author is suggesting that the parent on leave should take the night shifts, which might seem logical because they have more free time. \n\nBut I should consider different perspectives. Some people might argue that both parents should share the responsibilities equally, even if one is working. Others might think it's practical for the parent who isn't working to handle the night feedings so the working parent can get more rest. There's also the aspect of bonding with the baby and the physical demands of caring for a newborn. \n\nThe parent on leave might be adjusting to their new role, and taking over nighttime duties could help them bond. However, it's also possible that both parents are exhausted, and the working parent might need rest to function during the day. The key is whether the expectation is reasonable. If the working parent is expected to get up multiple times, they might not get enough sleep, which could affect their job performance and health. \n\nI should check if there are any cultural or societal norms influencing this. In some cultures, the parent on leave (often the mother) is expected to handle more nighttime care, but that's changing as more dads take paternity leave. The question doesn't specify which parent is on leave, so it's neutral. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that splitting overnights isn't fair when one parent is working. The answer hinges on whether fairness is determined by practicality or equal sharing. If the parent on leave can manage, then the author's stance might be valid. However, if the parent on leave is already handling all the daytime responsibilities, adding nighttime duties might be excessive. \n\nI need to consider the potential for gender bias here. If the parent on leave is the mother, societal expectations might weigh in, but the question is about the practicality. The answer might be that the author isn't in the wrong because their reasoning is based on practical considerations, but others might have different views on equal sharing. So, the answer is likely B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
