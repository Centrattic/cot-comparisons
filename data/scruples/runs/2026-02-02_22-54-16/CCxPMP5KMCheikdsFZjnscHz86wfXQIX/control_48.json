      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. The question is about whether the parent on parental leave should be the one getting up with the baby at night, especially when one parent is working and the other isn't.\n\nFirst, I need to consider common practices. I know that parental leave can vary a lot depending on the country and workplace policies. In many cases, the parent on leave might take on more night duties because they're home and not needing to work in the morning. That makes sense logically because the working parent has to be up early for work, so it's more convenient for them to get some uninterrupted sleep.\n\nBut then, I should think about fairness and shared responsibility. Some people believe that both parents should share the duties equally, regardless of work schedules. However, practicality might come into play here. If the non-working parent is already home, they might be more rested if they take the night shifts, allowing the working parent to rest up for their job.\n\nThere's also the aspect of bonding. The parent on leave might want to spend more time with the baby, which could be facilitated by handling night feedings. However, that's more of a personal choice rather than a rule.\n\nAnother angle is the physical and emotional toll. Night feedings can be exhausting, so if one parent is already off work, maybe they can adjust better to the lack of sleep. But again, it's not a one-size-fits-all situation. Some parents might prefer to alternate nights even if one is working, just to share the load.\n\nI should also consider cultural norms. In some cultures, the mother is traditionally expected to do more night feedings, especially if she's breastfeeding. But in others, there's a push for both parents to share equally. However, the question doesn't specify gender, so maybe that's not the main point here.\n\nThe key here is the practicality of work schedules. If one parent has to be up early for work, it's often more efficient for the other parent to handle the night duties. This allows the working parent to get more sleep and be functional during the day. So, the author's reasoning seems logical from a practical standpoint.\n\nBut is there an expectation that both should share equally? Some might argue that fairness requires equal sharing, but when one parent's schedule allows for it, it's reasonable to adjust. The author isn't making a judgment about who should work more but is pointing out the practicality of the situation.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's position is based on practical considerations rather than assigning blame. They're asking if they're in the wrong for thinking that the parent on leave should take the night shifts. Since there's no inherent wrong in considering work schedules when dividing responsibilities, the answer would be that the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
