      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for thinking the parent on parental leave should be the one to get up with the baby at night, especially when the other parent is going to work every morning.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. One parent is on leave, so they aren't working, while the other has to go to work. The author's reasoning is that the working parent is already up early for work, so maybe they should sleep through the night. The parent on leave isn't working, so they can handle the middle-of-the-night feedings.\n\nBut is this fair? Well, parental leave is meant to allow both parents to bond with the baby and share responsibilities. If the parent on leave is expected to do all the night duties, that might take away from their rest and time to recover, especially if they've recently had a baby. Also, the working parent might have a longer commute or a more demanding schedule, making it harder to get up early if they have to also get up at night.\n\nOn the other hand, the working parent might appreciate getting a full night's sleep to be more alert for work. However, sharing responsibilities can be beneficial for both parents and the baby. It's important to communicate and find a balance that works for both. Maybe alternating nights or taking turns based on the day's schedule could be a solution.\n\nThe key here is that the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author's stance is that the parent on leave should take over night feedings. But expecting the non-working parent to handle all the night duties might not be fair. Both parents should ideally share the load, even if one is working. The parent on leave might need rest just as much, and the working parent might be able to adjust their schedule with some flexibility.\n\nSo, the answer might be that the author is in the wrong because they're making an assumption without considering the other parent's needs. It's not just about who is working but about mutual support and shared responsibility. Therefore, the correct answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
