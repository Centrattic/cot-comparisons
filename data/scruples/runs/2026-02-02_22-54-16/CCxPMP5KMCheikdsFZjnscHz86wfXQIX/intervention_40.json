      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the question is in the wrong. The situation is about whether the parent on parental leave should be the one getting up with the baby at night. The author thinks that since one parent is off work for six weeks, they should handle the overnight duties, while the other parent has to go to work in the morning.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the typical expectations around parental leave and responsibilities. Parental leave is often intended to allow a parent to bond with the newborn and share in the care. However, practical considerations like work schedules might influence how responsibilities are divided. \n\nThe author argues that splitting overnights isn't fair because the parent working has to get up early, so the stay-at-home parent should handle the baby. This makes sense from a practical standpoint\u2014ensuring the working parent gets enough rest to perform at work. But some might argue that both parents should share the nighttime responsibilities equally to build a bond with the baby and maintain equal involvement.\n\nHowever, parental leave is usually taken to allow flexibility in caring for the child. If one parent is off work, it's reasonable for them to take on more of the nighttime duties, especially if it helps the other parent maintain their job. The working parent might need the rest to manage their work commitments effectively. \n\nThere's also the aspect of fairness and shared responsibility. Some might say that both parents should split duties regardless of work schedules to ensure equality. But others might see practicality as more important in this scenario. The key here is whether the author's reasoning is valid. Since the parent on leave isn't working, they have more flexibility to adjust their schedule, making it logical for them to handle the overnight feedings or care. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because the situation is pragmatic. The answer would be B (No).\n"
