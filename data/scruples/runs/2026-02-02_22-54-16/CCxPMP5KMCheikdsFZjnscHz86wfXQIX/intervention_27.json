      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) question is in the wrong. The situation is about who should get up with the baby at night when one parent is on parental leave and the other is working.\n\nThe author is saying that the parent on leave should be the one getting up at night because they don't have to go to work in the morning. They don't understand splitting the overnight duties between the two parents. The user thinks the author is not in the wrong but wants a second opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's reasoning is practical\u2014since the working parent has to get up early for work, they might be more tired if they also have to get up at night. The parent on leave isn't working, so they can handle the night feeds without affecting their work schedule. That makes sense from a time management and energy conservation perspective.\n\nHowever, some might argue that splitting the duties helps both parents bond with the baby and share the load. But the key here is the parent on leave isn't working, so maybe the author's approach is more efficient. Also, sleep deprivation is a big issue, so if the working parent is already getting up early, making them get up again at night might be counterproductive and affect their work performance.\n\nOn the other hand, there's the idea that both parents should share the responsibilities equally, regardless of their work schedules. But in this specific scenario, the parent on leave isn't working, so they have more flexibility. It's a temporary situation for 6 weeks, so it might be reasonable for them to take on the night duties during that period.\n\nI think the author is making a logical argument based on the circumstances. The answer would depend on the family's agreement and what's best for their situation. Since the parent on leave isn't working, it's practical for them to handle the night feeds. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
