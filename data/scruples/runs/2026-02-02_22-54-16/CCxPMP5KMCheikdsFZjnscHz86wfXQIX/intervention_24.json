      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole?) question is in the wrong. The situation is about whether the parent on parental leave should be the one getting up with the baby at night, especially since the other parent is working and needs to be up early.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the scenario. The author is suggesting that the parent who is on leave (not working) should handle the night feedings. The other parent is working and has to get up early. The author is asking if they're in the wrong for thinking this.\n\nParenting responsibilities are often a topic of debate, especially with new babies. From what I know, it's common for parents to share nighttime duties, but there are also practical considerations. If one parent is working and needs to be up early, maybe it's logical for the other parent to take over the feedings to avoid the working parent being too tired. But some might argue that both parents should share the load equally, regardless of work schedules.\n\nThe key points here are the parent's work schedule and the need for rest. If the working parent is already stressed from the job, getting up in the middle of the night could exacerbate fatigue. On the other hand, the parent on leave might have more flexibility. However, sleep deprivation is tough on both parents, and expecting the non-working parent to handle all night duties could be seen as unfair if they also need rest for other responsibilities.\n\nBut in many cases, the parent not working might be expected to take on more nighttime duties temporarily to allow the working parent to rest and perform better at work. The question is whether that's a fair expectation. The author's reasoning is that it's practical, so they think they're right (AITA? No). Others might say that both should share equally, but the working parent's need for rest could justify the arrangement.\n\nI need to consider cultural norms and practicality. In some cultures, the parent on leave is expected to do more, especially if the other parent is working. However, it's also important to consider the well-being of both parents. If the non-working parent is doing all the night feedings, they might not get enough sleep either, which can affect their health and ability to care for the baby. But if the working parent is already up early, they might not get the necessary rest.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the parent on leave volunteers or agrees to take the night feedings, it's a shared decision. But if the author is insisting that the other parent must do it, maybe they are being unreasonable. However, the question seems more about the practicality of the situation rather than forcing it. The author is questioning if their thinking is wrong, but their reasoning is based on the parent's work schedule.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's perspective is practical and considers the working parent's need for rest. Therefore, they might not be in the wrong. The answer is B.\n"
