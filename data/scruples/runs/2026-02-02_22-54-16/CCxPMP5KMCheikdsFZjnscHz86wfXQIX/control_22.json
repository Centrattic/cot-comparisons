      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the question is in the wrong. The question is about whether the parent on parental leave should be the one getting up with the baby at night, especially when the other parent is working and has to get up early for work.\n\nFirst, I need to consider common perspectives on parental responsibilities during leave. Typically, when one parent is on leave, they might take on more of the nighttime duties to help the working parent get rest. That makes sense because the working parent is already up early and might be more tired. But is there a \"right\" or \"wrong\" here?\n\nThe author is suggesting that the parent on leave should be the one to handle overnight duties. They're questioning if they're at fault for thinking this. So, the question is whether this expectation is unreasonable.\n\nI should think about factors like shared responsibility, fatigue management, and each parent's ability. Maybe the parent on leave is home to help with the baby but also needs rest. If both parents are expected to share night duties, that could be balanced, but if the working parent is exhausted from their job, maybe the leave parent should take over.\n\nHowever, there's no one-size-fits-all answer. It might depend on the family's circumstances. Some parents might agree that the leave parent handles the middle-of-the-night feedings so the working parent can get more sleep. Others might prefer splitting it regardless of work schedules. \n\nThe key here is whether the expectation is unfair. The author is not necessarily in the wrong if this is a mutual agreement or if it's based on practicality. But if the other parent feels they should share equally regardless of their work situation, that could be a point of conflict. \n\nIn terms of societal norms, sometimes there's an assumption that the parent on leave should take the night shifts. However, this isn't a strict rule. The answer hinges on whether the author's reasoning is valid. Since they're considering the working parent's need to rest for their job, their reasoning is practical. So, they might not be in the wrong. \n\nBut maybe some would argue that parents should share equally, even if one isn't working. That could be a counterpoint. However, the question is about whether the author is in the wrong for their opinion. If their opinion is based on practical considerations, then no, they're not wrong. It's a matter of perspective. \n\nSo the answer would likely be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong for thinking that the parent on leave should handle the night duties while the other is working.\n"
