      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote that question is in the wrong for thinking the parent on parental leave should be the one getting up with the baby at night. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the scenario: one parent is on parental leave (so they're not working), and the other is going to work every morning. The author is suggesting that the parent not working should handle the overnight feedings, and they're asking if they're at fault.\n\nI need to consider cultural norms and common practices. In many cultures, it's often expected that the parent not working takes on more childcare duties during their leave, including overnight care, so they can bond with the baby and adjust to their new role. This helps the working parent get some rest for their job the next day. So from that perspective, the author's reasoning makes sense. They're trying to balance the workload based on the parent's current responsibilities.\n\nHowever, every family is different. Some might choose to split the duties equally even if one parent isn't working. But the key here is the author is arguing for the non-working parent to take the overnights. If both parents agree, then it's fine. But if there's a disagreement, it's more about what's fair for their situation. Since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, if their reasoning is based on practicality and shared responsibilities, then they aren't wrong. They're making a logical argument based on the parent's schedules.\n\nAlso, parental leave is meant to give the parent time to care for the child, so it's reasonable for them to take on those duties. The working parent needs to be rested for work, which is a valid point. So the author's stance is practical and considers the needs of both parents. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
