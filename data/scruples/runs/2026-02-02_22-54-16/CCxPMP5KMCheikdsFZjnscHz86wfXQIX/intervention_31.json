      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the question is in the wrong. The situation is about parental leave and who should get up with the baby at night. The author is saying they think the parent on leave should be the one to handle the overnight tasks since the other parent is going to work every morning.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. Parental leave is meant to provide time off for parents to care for their newborn, so the parent not working might have more flexibility. But the author is suggesting that the working parent should be the one to get up for work, implying that the stay-at-home parent should take over the night duties.\n\nBut wait, if the parent on leave is not working, they might have more capacity to handle nighttime feedings or care. The other parent is already up for work in the morning, so maybe they don't need to get up during the night. It's about balancing responsibilities and considering each parent's schedule.\n\nHowever, this can be a sensitive topic. Some might argue that both parents should share the load equally, but if one parent is off work, it's practical to let them handle the nights so the working parent can get more rest for their job. There's no one-size-fits-all answer here, but the author's reasoning is based on practicality.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the parent on leave is willing and able to take over the night shifts, then the author's stance is reasonable. But if there's an expectation of equal sharing regardless of circumstances, then maybe the author is being unfair. However, the author is just trying to make sense of the situation based on the parents' work schedules. Unless there's some cultural or personal norm that dictates otherwise, the author isn't necessarily wrong. They're considering the practical aspects of the parents' schedules. Therefore, the answer is likely B (No).\n"
