      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the question is wrong for thinking the parent on parental leave should be the one getting up with the baby at night. The situation involves splitting overnight duties when one parent is working and the other is on leave.\n\nFirst, I need to consider common practices and what people generally expect. Parental leave varies by country, but the general idea is that the parent on leave can take more active care of the baby. However, this isn't a strict rule. Some couples split the nighttime duties equally, while others might let the working parent sleep more during the day and take turns at night. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that the parent not working should handle the overnight duties to compensate for the working parent's daytime responsibilities. But others might argue that both parents should share the load regardless of work schedules. There's also the aspect of fatigue and recovery; the working parent might be more tired from their job and need more sleep. However, the parent on leave might have more flexibility to adjust their schedule. \n\nIt's also important to consider the couple's agreement and what works best for them. There's no one-size-fits-all answer here. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the author is making a general statement without considering individual circumstances, they might not be wrong. But if they're making a claim that the parent on leave must handle all the night duties, that could be seen as an assumption that isn't fair in all cases. \n\nSome might say the author is not in the wrong because it's logical to have the parent with more free time take care of nighttime duties. Others might say the author is wrong because both parents should share the responsibilities regardless of work schedules. \n\nLooking at similar situations, often the expectation is that the parent on leave can take more of the nighttime duties, especially if the working parent needs to be alert during the day. However, this can vary. The key here is that there's no absolute right or wrong, but the author's perspective is a reasonable one for some families. Since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, if the answer is B (No), it would mean their perspective is acceptable. If A (Yes), then they should share equally. \n\nI think the answer is B because the author's reasoning is a valid approach, though not the only correct one. It's a matter of personal choice and what the parents agree on. The author isn't necessarily wrong for thinking that way, but it's not the only way either.\n"
