      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the question is in the wrong. The situation is about whether the parent on parental leave should be the one getting up with the baby at night. The author is saying they don't understand splitting the night feedings when one parent is working and the other isn't. They think maybe they're in the wrong (AITA) for this opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Parental leave is usually a time when the non-working parent can be more available for the baby. The idea that the parent not working should handle the night feeds might make sense because they have more flexibility. However, some people might argue that splitting the duties is fairer, especially if the working parent is already up early for work. \n\nBut the key here is whether the author is wrong for thinking the non-working parent should take over nighttime care. There's no one-size-fits-all answer, as parenting styles and family dynamics vary. Some might say it's reasonable for the non-working parent to handle night feeds because they have time, while others might think sharing the responsibility is better for the working parent's rest. \n\nThe author's reasoning is based on the practicality of the non-working parent being available. Since they're not working, they can manage the night feeds without needing to get up early. The working parent can get more sleep during the night and be rested for work. That seems logical. So, the author isn't necessarily wrong. It's a matter of perspective. There's no inherent right or wrong here, just different approaches. Therefore, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
