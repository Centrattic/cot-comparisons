      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The question is about whether the parent on parental leave should be the one getting up with the baby at night, especially when the other parent is going to work every morning. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. There are two parents, one is on leave and the other is working. The author is wondering if it's their fault for thinking the parent on leave should handle the overnight feedings. The main point is the division of overnight responsibilities between the two parents.\n\nParenting is a big topic and there's a lot of discussion around shared responsibilities. Traditionally, there might be some assumptions about the parent on leave taking on more duties, but modern practices often emphasize equal sharing. However, this can vary depending on the parents' agreement, their work schedules, and personal circumstances.\n\nThe key factors here are: the working parent has to get up for work each morning, which might mean they have less flexibility or are more tired during the day. The parent on leave isn't working, so they might have more time and energy to manage overnight duties. But is it fair to assume they should take all of it? That depends on their mutual agreement and the specific situation.\n\nI should consider if the question implies that the author is the working parent or the one on leave. The way it's phrased, the author is asking if they're at fault for thinking the leave parent should handle it. If the author is the working parent, they might believe that since the other parent isn't working, they can manage. But if the author is the leave parent, they might feel the other should share more. However, the question doesn't specify which parent the author is, so that's a bit unclear.\n\nAnother angle is cultural or societal norms. In some cultures, it's expected that the parent not working takes on more childcare duties. But others advocate for equality regardless of work status. The answer might depend on whether the author is relying on traditional norms or if there's an expectation of shared responsibility.\n\nAlso, the duration mentioned is 6 weeks. Maybe during this short period, the parent on leave is expected to handle more. But what if they have other responsibilities or need rest? The question is about whose responsibility it is, not about the amount or fairness beyond the initial split.\n\nI need to check if the author's reasoning is valid. They might argue that the working parent is already up during the day and needs sleep at night, while the leave parent is off and can take over. However, others might say that both parents should share the load even if one is working. It's a matter of perspective and what the couple has agreed upon.\n\nThe AITA (Am I the Asshole) format usually has a community vote, so the answer would be based on general consensus rather than strict rules. If the author is suggesting that the leave parent should take all the overnights without prior agreement, some might say that's unfair. But if it's a mutual understanding, then it's their choice.\n\nIn conclusion, without more context about the parents' agreement or specific circumstances, it's hard to say definitively. But generally, expecting the parent on leave to take all the overnights might be seen as not considering their needs, especially if they also need rest. However, if they've agreed to this arrangement, it's their choice. The answer likely depends on whether there's an agreement, but the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. If the author is making an assumption without considering the other parent's perspective, maybe they are. But if it's a reasonable arrangement given their schedules, maybe not. So the answer could be either A or B depending on context. But since the question is from the AITA framework, the community usually looks at intent and fairness. If the author is being inflexible without discussing, they might be in the wrong. But if it's a mutual agreement, not. Since the question doesn't specify, the safest answer is B (not in the wrong) if it's a mutual decision, or A if they're unilaterally deciding. The original post says the author \"doesn't understand splitting the overnights\" when one is on leave, implying they think it should be the leave parent. If they're assuming that without discussion, maybe they are in the wrong. But if they and their partner have agreed, then not. Since the question doesn't clarify, but the user is asking if the author is in the wrong, the answer might be B because it's a common arrangement, but I'm a bit torn. Wait, the AITA posts often highlight that both parents should share unless they agree otherwise. So if the author is insisting on this without considering the leave parent's needs, they might be the asshole. But if they're just expressing their opinion, maybe not. The question is whether the author is wrong. The AITA community usually values shared responsibility unless there's a specific reason. So the answer could be A if they're not sharing, but if the leave parent is okay with it, then B. Since the post doesn't say there was a discussion, maybe the author is in the wrong for not considering the other parent's perspective. So I think the answer is A.\n"
