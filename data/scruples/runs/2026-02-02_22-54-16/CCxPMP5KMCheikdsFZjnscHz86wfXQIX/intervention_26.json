The situation is about who should get up with the baby at night when one parent is on parental leave and the other is working. The author thinks the parent on leave should take over nighttime duties.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Parental leave policies vary, but generally, the parent not working might have more flexibility. However, the working parent has to get up early for work, so maybe they need more rest. The author's reasoning is that the parent on leave can handle the night feeds since they're not working. \n\nBut is there a right or wrong here? It depends on the couple's agreement and what's best for their family. Some might argue that sharing responsibilities is important, but if one parent is already off work, maybe they should take the night shifts. However, others might say the working parent needs the rest. The question is whether the author is wrong for suggesting the leave parent should take over. The answer might be that there's no absolute right or wrong, but the author's reasoning is logical. So the answer would be B, No, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
