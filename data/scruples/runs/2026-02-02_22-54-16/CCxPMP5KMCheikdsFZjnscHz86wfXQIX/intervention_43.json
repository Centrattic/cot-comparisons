      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for thinking that the parent on parental leave should be the one getting up with the baby at night. They mentioned that one parent is working and gets up every morning, while the other is off work for six weeks.\n\nFirst, I need to consider common parental leave arrangements. Usually, the parent on leave might have more flexibility since they\u2019re not going to work. The working parent has to get up early for work, so maybe it makes sense for the non-working parent to handle the night feedings so the working parent can get enough rest. That way, the working parent is more alert when they go to work each day.\n\nBut I should also think about other factors. For example, some parents might prefer to share the nighttime duties to have equal bonding time with the baby. Or maybe the non-working parent is already handling more during the day, so they might need rest as well. There's also the aspect of physical ability\u2014maybe one parent can't handle getting up at night due to medical reasons or something else.\n\nHowever, the main point here is the author's reasoning. They argue that since one parent is working, the other should take on the overnight duties. That seems logical because the working parent needs to be rested for work. If both parents are sharing equally, the working parent might not get enough sleep before going to work. So, from a practical standpoint, the author's perspective is understandable. \n\nBut is it fair to assume that the non-working parent should take all the night shifts? Maybe there's an implicit expectation that the non-working parent should handle more, but that could be a traditional view. However, parental leave is meant to provide flexibility, and the arrangement can vary based on the family's needs and preferences.\n\nIn many cases, parents do split the duties based on their schedules. The key here is that the author is not forcing anyone but expressing a belief. So, the question is whether their belief is wrong. Since there's no right or wrong answer in terms of fairness, it's more about what's practical and agreed upon by the couple. The author's reasoning is practical, so they might not be in the wrong. But if the other parent is uncomfortable with that arrangement, there could be a conflict. However, the question is about the author's perspective, not the other parent's feelings.\n\nI think the author's logic is sound, so they are not in the wrong. The answer would be B (No).\n"
