      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The question is whether the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for thinking that the parent on parental leave should be the one getting up with the baby at night. The scenario involves splitting overnight duties when one parent is working every morning and the other isn't.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the reasoning behind the author's opinion. They argue that the parent on leave shouldn't have to get up because the working parent is already up for work. That makes sense on the surface because the working parent is already awake, so they might not need the sleep as much. However, the parent on leave is not working, so maybe they need more rest to handle the demands of caring for the baby during the day when they're off. \n\nI should also think about the balance of responsibilities. Parental leave is often intended to allow a parent to bond with the child and take on more childcare duties. If the parent on leave is constantly getting up at night, they might not have the energy to engage during the day. On the other hand, the working parent might be physically present but mentally drained from work, making it harder to care for the baby in the morning.\n\nAnother angle is the fairness and shared responsibility. Both parents might have different needs. The working parent is already up early, so they could adjust their schedule to help at night. But maybe the parent on leave needs the rest more. There's no one-size-fits-all answer here. It depends on the specific circumstances of the parents' health, the baby's schedule, and any existing agreements between the parents.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole?) format usually asks if the person's stance is unreasonable. The author's reasoning is based on the assumption that the working parent can handle the early mornings since they're already up for work. However, this might not account for the parent on leave needing rest to be effective during the day. If the author is dismissing the parent on leave's need for sleep without considering their situation, they might be in the wrong. But if they're making a logical argument based on the parent's work schedule, they might not be at fault.\n\nI should also consider cultural or societal norms. In some cultures, it's expected that the parent not working takes on more nighttime duties. However, this might not always be the case, and personal circumstances can vary. The key is mutual understanding and flexibility between the parents. If the author isn't considering the other parent's needs and is being rigid, that could be the issue.\n\nSo, the answer depends on whether the author's reasoning is too rigid or dismissive of the other parent's needs. If they're making a reasonable argument considering both parties' situations, they might not be in the wrong. But if they're not acknowledging the parent on leave's need for rest, then they could be at fault. The question is whether their stance is unreasonable. Since the parent on leave is not working, it's possible that the author is making a logical point, but it's not the only valid perspective. Therefore, the author might not be in the wrong, but it's a nuanced situation.\n"
