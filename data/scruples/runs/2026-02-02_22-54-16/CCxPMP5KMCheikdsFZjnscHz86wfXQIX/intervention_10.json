      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the question is in the wrong. The situation is about parental leave and nighttime responsibilities with a baby.\n\nThe author is suggesting that the parent on leave should be the one getting up with the baby at night, while the other parent goes back to work. They're asking if they're in the wrong for thinking this. The user thinks the author isn't wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Parental leave can vary by country. In some places, the parent on leave might have more flexibility, but it's not a strict rule. The idea is that the parent not working in the morning can handle the nighttime feedings, allowing the working parent to get enough rest for their job. That seems logical because getting up early for work can be exhausting, especially with a baby's unpredictable schedule.\n\nHowever, parenting responsibilities should ideally be shared. Assuming that the non-working parent should handle all the nighttime duties could lead to burnout. Partners should communicate and find a fair arrangement that works for their specific situation. If the working parent is willing to take shifts, that's good, but if not, the non-working parent might take on more. But the key here is mutual agreement and what's best for the family's well-being.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? They're not making a personal attack but expressing an opinion based on practicality. However, suggesting that one parent should automatically take on more without considering the other's input might not be fair. But in the context of the question, they're asking for validation, not imposing it on others. Therefore, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong; they're sharing a viewpoint that others might agree or disagree with based on their circumstances.\n"
