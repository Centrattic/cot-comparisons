      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong for thinking the parent on parental leave should get up with the baby at night. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThe author is asking if it's their fault (AITA) for believing that the parent on leave should handle the overnight feedings while the other parent is working. The reasoning given is that one parent is getting up for work every morning, and the other is off work for six weeks. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I should consider common practices and societal norms around parental leave and night feedings. In many cases, the parent not working might take on more nighttime responsibilities to allow the working parent to rest and be productive during the day. This helps the working parent maintain their energy for work, which can be physically and mentally demanding. On the other hand, the parent on leave might prefer to have equal or shared responsibilities, especially if they want to bond with the baby or feel they should contribute equally.\n\nHowever, it's also important to remember that each family's situation is unique. Factors like the parents' physical health, work schedules, and personal preferences can influence what's fair. For example, if the parent on leave is already handling most daytime duties, taking on the night shifts might lead to exhaustion. But if the working parent is already stressed from their job, they might need the rest.\n\nThere's also the aspect of shared parenting. Some families prefer to split night duties to promote bonding and to share the workload. However, if one parent is off work, it's logical that they might take on more of the nighttime duties, especially if the other needs to be well-rested for work. This could be seen as practical, not necessarily unfair.\n\nBut does that make the author right? Well, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for thinking that way. If the author's reasoning is based on practicality and allowing the working parent to rest, then it's a reasonable stance. However, if the parent on leave feels overburdened or if there's a cultural expectation of equal sharing, then the author's view might be seen as contributing to an imbalance.\n\nAnother angle: the parent on leave might have the flexibility to adjust their schedule, but they also might be adjusting to the baby's needs and their own recovery from childbirth. The working parent might not have the flexibility to adjust their work schedule, making it more practical for the stay-at-home parent to handle the overnight feedings.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's reasoning seems practical, but it's a matter of perspective. Since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, and given that there's a common understanding that practicality and work demands influence such decisions, the answer is likely B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
