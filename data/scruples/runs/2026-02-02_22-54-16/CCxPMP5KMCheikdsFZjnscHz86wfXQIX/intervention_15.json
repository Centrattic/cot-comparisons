      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole?) question is in the wrong. The situation is about who should get up with the baby at night when one parent is on parental leave and the other is working.\n\nThe author argues that the parent on leave should be the one getting up because they're not working, while the working parent has to get up for work anyway. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong but wants to know the opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. Parental leave is usually meant to help with childcare, so maybe the parent on leave should take the night shifts to give the working parent rest. But some might argue that both parents should share the responsibility equally regardless of work schedules.\n\nHowever, the working parent has to wake up early for work, so maybe it's logical for the non-working parent to handle the night feeds to let the working parent get more sleep. That makes sense because the working parent is already sacrificing sleep by getting up for work, so the non-working parent can compensate by taking over the night duties.\n\nAlso, the parent on leave might have more flexibility to adjust their schedule to help with the baby. It's about practicality and ensuring the working parent is well-rested for their job. But others might say that both parents should split it 50/50 as part of equal responsibility in parenting.\n\nI think the key here is the practical aspect. If the parent on leave is already not working, they can adjust their sleep more easily, whereas the working parent needs to be rested for work. So the author's reasoning seems logical. Therefore, the answer would be that the author is not in the wrong.\n"
