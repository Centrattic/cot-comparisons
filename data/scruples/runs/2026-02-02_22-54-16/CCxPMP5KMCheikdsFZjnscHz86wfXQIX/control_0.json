      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the question is in the wrong. The scenario is about parental leave and night shifts with a baby.\n\nThe author is suggesting that the parent on leave should be the one getting up with the baby at night. Their reasoning is that one parent is working every morning, so the other (on leave) should handle the overnight duties. They're wondering if they're the asshole for thinking that.\n\nFirst, I need to consider common views on parental responsibilities. Parental leave is typically intended to allow a parent to bond with the child and manage care duties while the other parent returns to work. However, this can vary based on the family's specific circumstances and agreements.\n\nSome might argue that both parents should share the load equally, regardless of work schedules. Others might see it as practical for the non-working parent to take over night shifts since they have the flexibility. There's no one-size-fits-all answer here because every family's situation is different.\n\nThe key points are: the working parent needs to be rested for their job, and the parent on leave might have more availability. But there could be other factors, like the parents' preferences, their physical or mental health, or prior arrangements. \n\nSince the question is whether the author is in the wrong, it depends on context. If the author's suggestion is causing conflict without considering the other parent's feelings or the family's agreement, maybe they are being dismissive. However, if they're making a practical suggestion that the working parent agrees with, then it's not necessarily wrong.\n\nThe question is pretty straightforward, and the author is seeking validation for their perspective. Without more context, it's hard to say they're in the wrong. Different people will have different opinions, but the author isn't automatically wrong for thinking that way. So the answer is B.\n"
