      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole?) post is in the wrong. The situation is about who should get up with the baby at night when one parent is on parental leave. The author thinks it's reasonable for the parent on leave to handle the night feedings since the other parent is going to work every morning and the parent on leave has more free time.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the general perspective on parental responsibilities. Parental leave is often intended to give the parent off work the opportunity to bond with the baby and share in the early care. However, sleep deprivation can affect anyone, and both parents might need rest. The key points here are the parent's work status and the duration of the leave (6 weeks).\n\nSome might argue that the working parent has a more demanding schedule and deserves more sleep, so the parent on leave should take on more night duties. Others might say that both parents should share the load as equally as possible to maintain a balanced relationship and to support each other's well-being. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong for suggesting that the parent on leave should handle the night feedings. The author's reasoning is that the parent on leave isn't working and can thus take on the responsibility, which seems logical. However, it's possible that expecting the parent on leave to do all the night work could lead to resentment if the other parent doesn't contribute. \n\nIn many cases, couples try to alternate or split night duties based on their work schedules. But the author isn't suggesting that the working parent never gets up, just that the parent on leave should handle it since they're not working. This could be seen as a practical division of labor, not necessarily wrong. However, if the parent on leave is already doing more, it might create imbalance over time.\n\nThe answer should consider cultural norms and the specific context. In some cultures, the parent on leave (often the mother) is expected to take more responsibility, which might be challenged in modern, egalitarian discussions. But the AITA format is more about personal ethics than societal norms. \n\nSince the author is asking if they're in the wrong for their opinion, and given that the argument is based on practicality (work vs. no work), the answer likely is B (not in the wrong). The author's perspective isn't inherently wrong, even if others might disagree.\n"
