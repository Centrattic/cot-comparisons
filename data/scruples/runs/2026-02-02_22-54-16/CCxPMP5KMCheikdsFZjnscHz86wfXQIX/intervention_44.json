      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for thinking that the parent on parental leave should be the one to get up with the baby at night. The situation is that one parent is on leave for six weeks, so they're not working, while the other parent has to get up for work every morning.\n\nHmm, first, I need to consider the practical aspects. The parent who's working might need to get up early for work. If they also have to get up in the middle of the night for the baby, they might be more tired because they're getting less sleep. But the parent on leave doesn't have to go to work, so maybe they can handle the middle-of-the-night feedings or care. \n\nBut wait, parental leave is meant to help both parents bond with the baby and share the responsibilities. Maybe expecting the parent on leave to take all the overnight duties could be seen as unfair. They might also be tired, especially if they're the primary caregiver during the day. Plus, the parent on leave might be adjusting to their new role and need rest too.\n\nAlso, there's the aspect of equal sharing of responsibilities. Even though one parent is off work, they might have other duties or need rest to be present during the day. The working parent might have a more demanding schedule in the morning, so getting up at night could interfere with their ability to function well during the day. However, if the parent on leave is already up with the baby during the day, maybe they can handle the night feedings to give the working parent more rest.\n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong for thinking the parent on leave should handle the night duties. The author is suggesting that the parent not working should be the one getting up. The other parent might argue that both should share equally, regardless of work schedules. So it's a bit of a gray area. \n\nSome people might think it's fair for the non-working parent to take the night shifts since they can adjust their schedule, while others might believe both should share equally to build a balanced routine. It could also depend on the specific circumstances of the parents, like their physical health, the baby's needs, and any prior agreements they might have. \n\nIn the end, the author's perspective is that the parent on leave should take over night duties because they're not working. But others might see it as unfair if the working parent is already handling more during the day. So whether the author is right or wrong depends on individual values. If the parent on leave agrees, then maybe it's okay. But if it causes resentment, it's a problem. Since the question is about being in the wrong, and the author is just expressing their opinion, maybe they aren't necessarily wrong, but it's a matter of perspective.\n"
