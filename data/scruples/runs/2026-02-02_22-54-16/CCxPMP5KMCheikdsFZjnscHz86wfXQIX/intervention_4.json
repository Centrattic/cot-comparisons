      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the question is in the wrong. The situation is about parental leave and who should get up with the baby at night.\n\nThe original question is: \"AITA for thinking the parent on parental leave should be the one getting up with the baby at night?\" They mention that one parent is working and gets up every morning, while the other is off work for six weeks. The author thinks the parent on leave should handle the overnight duties, and they're asking if they're in the wrong. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong but wants confirmation.\n\nSo, I need to decide if the answer is A (Yes, in the wrong) or B (No, not in the wrong). \n\nFirst, consider common practices. In many cases, the parent not at work during the day might take on more nighttime responsibilities so the working parent can get more rest. That makes sense because the working parent is already up early for work and might need more sleep. However, this isn't a strict rule and can vary based on the parents' preferences, the child's needs, and their individual circumstances.\n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong for thinking that way. The author's reasoning is that the parent on leave is off work for six weeks, so they should handle the overnight duties. It's a logical point: the parent who isn't working can afford to get up more, while the working parent needs to be up early anyway. \n\nHowever, some might argue that both parents should share responsibilities equally, regardless of work schedules. But expecting equality in all aspects when one parent isn't working might not be practical. The key here is whether the author's suggestion is unreasonable. \n\nIn many discussions, it's often advised that the non-working parent take on more nighttime responsibilities to allow the working parent to rest. So the author's thinking aligns with this common advice. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for suggesting this. The answer would be B (No).\n"
