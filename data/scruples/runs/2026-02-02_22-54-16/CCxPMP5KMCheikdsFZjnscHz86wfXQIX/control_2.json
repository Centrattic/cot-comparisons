      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the question is in the wrong for thinking the parent on parental leave should handle the night wakings. The question is about splitting overnight duties when one parent is on leave and the other is working.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the common assumptions here. Parental leave is typically taken by one parent to bond with the child and manage childcare responsibilities. The working parent has to get up early for work, so maybe they need more sleep. The parent on leave might have more flexibility in their schedule. But is it fair to assume they should take all the night shifts?\n\nI should think about equal parenting responsibilities. Some people believe both parents should share duties equally, regardless of work schedules. Others might argue that the parent not working can handle more nighttime care since they're already off work. There's also the aspect of fatigue; if the working parent is already up early, getting less sleep might affect their work performance.\n\nCultural norms vary. In some cultures, the parent not working is expected to take more responsibility for night feedings. However, others advocate for shared responsibilities. It's possible that there's no one-size-fits-all answer here. The key is whether the author's expectation is unreasonable.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the other parent is also expected to split the duties, the author might be seen as not considering the working parent's need for rest. But if the parent on leave has the time and flexibility, expecting them to handle more might be reasonable. It's a balance between fairness and practicality.\n\nSo, is the author wrong? If the parent on leave is willing and able to take more night shifts, maybe the author isn't wrong. But if the other parent is also trying to share equally, the author's stance could be seen as unfair. The answer might hinge on mutual agreement rather than right or wrong. However, the question is framed as AITA (Am I the Asshole), so the community might lean towards one side based on common opinions.\n\nIn many AITA scenarios, the expectation is that parents should share responsibilities. However, practical considerations like work schedules can influence this. The answer might depend on whether splitting is necessary or if the parent on leave can handle it without resentment. If the author is insisting on this without considering their partner's input, that could be an issue. But if both agree, it's not a problem. Since the question is about the author's perspective, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) if it's a mutual decision or A if it's causing conflict without discussion.\n"
