      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of a situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about whether the parent on parental leave should be the one getting up with the baby at night when the other parent is working. The author thinks that the parent on leave should handle the night feeds since they're not working, and they're asking if they're the a**hole (AITA). The user thinks the author isn't wrong and wants to know the answer.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the common arguments around parental responsibilities. Parental leave can be a time when one parent is more available, so it's logical that they might take on more nighttime duties. The working parent is dealing with a full day of work, so getting some rest might be important. However, this can vary based on the parents' preferences and the child's needs. Some might argue that both parents should share the load equally, regardless of work status, to maintain a balanced routine.\n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key here is whether expecting the parent on leave to handle night feeds is unreasonable. From a practical standpoint, since the parent not working has the opportunity to adjust their schedule to accommodate the baby, it's a common arrangement. However, it's also a personal choice and can depend on the household dynamics. The author isn't making a demand but is questioning if their perspective is wrong, which is a matter of opinion rather than right or wrong. \n\nIn such cases, there's no absolute right or wrong, but the author's reasoning is valid. Many people do adopt this approach. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
