      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) question is in the wrong. The situation is about which parent should get up with the baby at night when one is on parental leave and the other has to go to work.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the scenario. The parent on leave isn't working, so they have more flexibility. The working parent has to get up early for work, so if they also have to get up in the middle of the night for the baby, they might get even less sleep. The author is suggesting that the non-working parent should handle the night feeds or wake-ups. \n\nI think the key points here are shared responsibility and the well-being of both parents. Parenting often requires compromise, and both parents should share responsibilities. However, practical considerations matter too. If one parent is already up all night with the baby, they might be too tired to function the next day. On the other hand, the parent on leave might have the time to take on more nighttime duties, especially if they're not working. \n\nBut is it fair to assume that the non-working parent should do all the night duties? It could lead to resentment if they feel they're shouldering more without any rest. Also, sleep deprivation can affect anyone, so both parents might need rest. Maybe splitting the nights isn't the best approach if one parent has to work. The author's reasoning is that the parent not working can handle it, which makes sense because they don't have the added stress of an early morning job. \n\nHowever, some might argue that both parents should share equally regardless of their work schedules, but that might not be practical. The author is suggesting a logical division based on work commitments, which could be seen as reasonable. So, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
