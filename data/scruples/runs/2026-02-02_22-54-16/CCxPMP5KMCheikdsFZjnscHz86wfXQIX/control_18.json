      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person who posted the situation is in the wrong. The situation is about parental leave and who should get up with the baby at night when one parent is on leave and the other has to go to work.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the scenario. The parent on leave is not working for six weeks, so they have more flexibility. The other parent is going to work every day. The question is whether it's fair for the working parent to expect the non-working parent to handle the overnight duties. The author is asking if they're in the wrong for thinking this.\n\nNow, considering common practices, many families do divide parenting duties, especially in the postpartum period. The parent not working might be expected to take on more night duties so the working parent can get more rest and be fresh for work. However, it's also important to consider the non-working parent's well-being. They might be dealing with their own recovery and the demands of caring for the baby during the day. So, expecting them to do all the night feedings could lead to exhaustion.\n\nBut the author's perspective is that since one parent is off work, they should handle the overnight duties. That seems logical from a fairness standpoint. However, in reality, parents often negotiate based on their individual circumstances. Some might prefer to switch nights or take turns if possible. It's also possible that the non-working parent is already doing a lot during the day, so adding nights might be overwhelming.\n\nAnother angle is cultural or societal norms. In some cultures, the mother (if it's the mother on leave) is expected to do more night duties, but this can vary. However, the question doesn't specify genders, so we shouldn't assume. It's more about the parent on leave versus the working parent.\n\nThe key here is whether the author's expectation is unreasonable. If they're suggesting the non-working parent must handle all the nights, that might be seen as not considering their workload. However, the author is asking if they're at fault for thinking that. It's possible that the author is in the right because it's common to split duties based on work commitments. But others might argue that the non-working parent also needs rest.\n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the author's stance is unreasonable. Since the parent on leave has more time, expecting them to take over night duties is a common arrangement. However, it's not a one-size-fits-all situation. If the author is insisting without considering the non-working parent's needs, they might be in the wrong. But if they're just suggesting that the non-working parent can handle the nights given their work-free schedule, that's reasonable. \n\nLooking at similar \"Am I the A-hole\" scenarios, people often get called out for not being flexible or considering both parents' needs. But the author is asking if they're wrong for thinking the non-working parent should do it. The answer might be that the author isn't in the wrong because they're making a logical point, but it's important to acknowledge that each family's situation is different. However, the question is specifically whether the author is in the wrong, not whether their suggestion is the best. So, based on the information given, the author's reasoning is valid, so the answer would be B (No).\n"
