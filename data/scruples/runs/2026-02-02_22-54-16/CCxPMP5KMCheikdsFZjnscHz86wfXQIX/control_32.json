      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The question is about whether the parent on parental leave should be the one getting up with the baby at night when one parent is working and the other isn't. \n\nFirst, I need to consider different perspectives. The author's argument is that since the other parent is working every morning, they should get to sleep through the night, while the parent on leave can handle the night feedings. On the surface, that makes sense because the working parent needs to be rested for their job. But then again, the parent on leave might be trying to get as much sleep as possible to prepare for the physical and emotional demands of caring for a baby full-time.\n\nI remember that parental leave is often intended to give a parent time to bond with the baby, and some people do use that time to adjust to the new routine. However, sleep deprivation is a real issue for new parents. Maybe there's an expectation that both parents share the nighttime duties, but if one is working, maybe it's more practical for the non-working parent to take over the nights. \n\nAnother angle is the physical and mental health of both parents. If the working parent is exhausted from lack of sleep, it could affect their job performance. Conversely, the parent on leave is also dealing with sleep loss, which can be tough. There's also the aspect of fairness and shared responsibility. In some families, they take turns even if one is working, to balance things out in the long run.\n\nI should also think about cultural norms. In some places, it's common for the non-working parent to handle the night feedings, especially if they're not tied to a morning schedule. However, in other cultures, both parents share equally regardless of work schedules. It might depend on the family's agreement and what's feasible for them.\n\nBut the question is whether the author is \"in the wrong.\" If the author is suggesting that the non-working parent should take over the night feedings because the other parent has to get up for work, is that a reasonable expectation? Or is it unfair to the non-working parent who is already sacrificing their job to be available for the baby?\n\nThere's also the possibility that the working parent could adjust their schedule slightly to help out, like taking turns with feedings or having the non-working parent sleep in a bit more. But if the author is advocating for the non-working parent to take on all the night duties, that could be seen as placing an unfair burden on them.\n\nOn the other hand, if the non-working parent is the one who has the flexibility to adjust their sleep schedule, maybe it's a practical solution. The author's reasoning is logical from a work-life balance perspective, but it might not account for the non-working parent's need for rest as well.\n\nIn conclusion, whether the author is in the wrong depends on context. If they're making a general argument based on practicality, it's not necessarily wrong. However, if they're dismissing the non-working parent's needs or assuming that sharing duties isn't possible, that could be problematic. The answer might be B (the author is not in the wrong) because their reasoning is based on the practical need for the working parent to be rested, which is a common consideration in many families.\n"
