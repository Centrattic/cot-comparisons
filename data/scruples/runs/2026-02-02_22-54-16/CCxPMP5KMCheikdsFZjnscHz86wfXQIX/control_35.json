      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The situation is about who should get up with the baby at night when one parent is on parental leave.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the scenario. The parent on leave isn't working, so they have more flexible hours. The other parent is going to work every morning. The author is suggesting that the parent on leave should handle the overnight duties. The question is whether that's a fair expectation.\n\nI should consider different perspectives. On one hand, the parent on leave isn't working, so they might have more time to take care of the baby. It could make sense for them to handle the night feedings or waking up with the baby, especially since the working parent is already up early for work. That might help the working parent get more rest, which is important for their job.\n\nOn the other hand, parental responsibilities should ideally be shared. The parent on leave might also be dealing with their own recovery from childbirth or adjusting to the new role. Plus, both parents might need sleep to function well during the day. There's no one-size-fits-all answer here, as families have different dynamics and agreements.\n\nThe author's reasoning seems logical\u2014having the non-working parent take over night duties allows the working parent to rest. But the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The key here is whether there's a universally accepted right or wrong. The answer might depend on the specific family's agreement and circumstances. If both parents agreed on this arrangement, then it's not wrong. If there's an expectation of equal sharing and the author is insisting without considering the other parent's needs, then maybe. However, the question is about the author's stance, not the other parent's. The author's reasoning is based on practicality, so unless there's a societal norm that dictates otherwise, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. The answer would be B.\n"
