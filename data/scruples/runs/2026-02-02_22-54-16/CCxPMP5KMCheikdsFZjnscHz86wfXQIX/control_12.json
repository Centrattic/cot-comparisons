      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the question is in the wrong. The situation is about parental leave and who should get up with the baby at night. The author is saying they think the parent on leave should handle the overnight duties while the other parent is working. The question is whether they are at fault for that belief.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the common expectations around parental responsibilities during leave. Typically, when one parent is on leave, they might take more responsibility for the baby, but it's not a strict rule. However, each family's situation can vary. The author's reasoning is that the parent on leave doesn't have to go to work in the morning, so they can handle the middle-of-the-night feedings or care. The working parent needs to be up early, so maybe they should get more rest.\n\nBut is there a right or wrong here? Parenting responsibilities are often shared, but when one parent isn't working, some might argue they should take on more, especially if it's more feasible. However, others might say that both parents should share the load equally regardless of work schedules. The key is whether the author's stance is unreasonable or if it's a common practice.\n\nI should consider cultural norms and common advice. Some sources suggest that parents on leave might take more nighttime care to allow the working parent to rest, especially if their job requires early mornings. This can help the working parent maintain their work schedule and reduce stress. So, in that context, the author's belief aligns with a common practice.\n\nHowever, the answer depends on whether the expectation is considered fair. If the parent on leave is voluntarily taking on more without coercion, it's their choice. But if it's imposed without considering their well-being, that's different. The question is about whether the author is in the wrong for thinking this way. If it's a common perspective, then the author isn't necessarily wrong. So the answer might be B (No), because the reasoning is logical given the circumstances.\n"
