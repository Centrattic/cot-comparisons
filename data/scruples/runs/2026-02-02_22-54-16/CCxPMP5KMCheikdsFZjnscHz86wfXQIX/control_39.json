      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the query is in the wrong. The situation is about parental leave and who should get up with the baby at night.\n\nThe author is saying that the parent on parental leave should handle the overnight duties because the other parent is going to work every morning. They're asking if they're the asshole (AITA) for thinking that.\n\nHmm. First, I need to consider common perspectives. Parental leave is typically about one parent taking time off work to care for the child. The parent not on leave is still working, so maybe they have a more structured schedule and might need to be rested for work. The parent on leave is supposed to have more flexibility, so perhaps it's reasonable for them to take the night shifts.\n\nBut then, some people might argue that both parents should share the responsibilities equally, regardless of work schedules. However, the key point here is the asymmetry in their situations. The working parent has to get up early for work, so maybe it's logical for the non-working parent to handle the middle-of-the-night feedings or care. That would allow the working parent to get more sleep and be rested for their job.\n\nI should also consider cultural norms and what's typically expected. In many cultures, the parent on leave is expected to take on more of the childcare duties during that period. However, there's also a growing emphasis on shared parenting. But the situation here is about dividing the night duties specifically when one parent is on leave and the other isn't. The author's reasoning is based on practicality: the parent not working can adjust their schedule more easily.\n\nAre there any other factors? Maybe the parent on leave might be dealing with their own lack of sleep, but they might have the flexibility to manage. The working parent might need to be well-rested for their job. From a practical standpoint, splitting the duties equally might not be feasible if one parent has a more demanding schedule.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the reasoning is based on practicality and not on gender stereotypes (assuming that's not the case here), then maybe not. The question is whether it's fair to expect the parent on leave to handle the night duties. Since that parent is off work, it's reasonable to adjust their schedule to manage the baby's needs, while the working parent prioritizes their job requirements. Therefore, the author's position seems logical and not in the wrong.\n"
