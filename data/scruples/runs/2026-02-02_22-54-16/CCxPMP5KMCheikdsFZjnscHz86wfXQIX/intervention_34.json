      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the original post (AITA) is in the wrong for thinking the parent on parental leave should handle the overnight feeds. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the scenario. The parent is on leave, so they don't have work in the morning. The other parent is working and needs to get up early. The author's reasoning is that since the working parent has to get up for work anyway, it makes sense for the stay-at-home parent to handle the nighttime duties so the working parent can get more rest.\n\nI should consider common practices around parental leave and overnight responsibilities. In many cases, parents split duties based on their schedules. The parent who is off work might take on more nighttime responsibilities so the working parent can catch up on sleep. This is often seen as fair because the working parent is already getting up early for work, so they can sleep in a bit if possible, while the stay-at-home parent can handle the night feeds since they're up anyway.\n\nBut I also need to think about potential counterarguments. Some might say that both parents should share the load equally, regardless of their work schedules. However, the key here is that one parent is on leave and not working. It's reasonable to adjust responsibilities based on their circumstances. The working parent might be more exhausted from their job, so allowing them to get more sleep could be beneficial for their well-being and ability to function during their workday.\n\nAnother angle is the parent on leave might want to bond with the baby during the night. However, if they're handling the night feeds, they might get less sleep. But since they're already off work, they might have more flexibility. Still, it's a personal choice and varies per family dynamics.\n\nThe author's question is whether they're at fault for thinking this way. The answer likely hinges on whether their reasoning is considered reasonable. Since parental leave is a time when one parent is not working, adjusting responsibilities based on work schedules is a common and practical approach. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
