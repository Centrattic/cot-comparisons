      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong for thinking that the parent on parental leave should be the one getting up with the baby at night. The situation is about splitting nighttime duties when one parent is off work for six weeks and the other is working.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Parental leave can vary by country and workplace policies, but generally, the parent on leave might have more flexibility. The author argues that since the working parent has to get up for work, the other parent should handle the night duties. But is this a given?\n\nI should think about the potential reasons behind the author's reasoning. They might believe that the parent not working can afford to stay up more because they don't have an early work schedule. However, it's important to remember that the parent on leave is also adjusting to a new baby, dealing with sleep deprivation, and might need rest to manage their mental health and energy for daytime care.\n\nAnother angle is the fairness of splitting duties. If both parents are sharing equally in the daytime, maybe the nighttime should be shared too, unless there's a specific reason not to. The working parent might need more sleep to function at work, which is important for the family's stability. But the non-working parent might be just as exhausted, especially if they're handling most of the overnight duties.\n\nI should also consider the long-term effects. If the parent on leave is doing all the night feeds, they might not get enough rest, leading to burnout or resentment. Plus, the working parent might feel guilty or disconnected from the baby. It's possible that the author's perspective is pragmatic, but it might overlook the emotional and physical toll on the other parent.\n\nHowever, the original question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the assumption is that the parent not working can handle more, that might not be fair. Both parents have different challenges. The answer might depend on the couple's agreement and their specific circumstances. There's no one-size-fits-all answer here, but if the author is making a judgment without considering the other parent's needs, they could be seen as dismissive.\n\nIn summary, while the author's reasoning is logical from a work schedule perspective, it might not account for other factors like the parent on leave's well-being and the importance of shared parenting responsibilities. So, the answer might be that the author is not in the wrong, but there's room for discussion depending on the situation.\n"
