      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for thinking that the parent on parental leave should handle the overnight duties with the baby, while the other parent, who's working, stays asleep. The question is whether splitting the nights is appropriate here.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Parental leave is typically a time when the parent is not working, so they have more flexibility. The parent who is working has to get up early for work, so maybe it's more practical for the other parent to take the night shifts. But is that fair?\n\nI remember reading that sharing nighttime parenting duties can be beneficial for both parents' mental health and the relationship. However, this might be more feasible when both parents have similar work schedules. In this case, one parent is on leave, so maybe they have more capacity to handle those duties. \n\nBut wait, taking care of a baby at night is exhausting. If the parent on leave is already up, maybe they need rest too. If they're doing all the night feeds and the parent who works is sleeping, it could lead to resentment later. On the other hand, the working parent is already stressed with the job and might not be able to cope with less sleep.\n\nThere's also the aspect of bonding. The parent on leave might want to be the main caregiver during the day and night to build that bond. But both parents should have a chance to participate. However, if the working parent is already up for work, maybe they can take turns. \n\nBut the original question is about splitting the overnights. The author is saying they don't think it's right to split them when one is working and the other isn't. The author thinks the non-working parent should handle it. Is that wrong? Well, it depends on the couple's agreement and what works best for them. If they both agree and it's not causing problems, then maybe it's okay. However, if the parent on leave is overburdened, that could be an issue. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong for their opinion. The answer would depend on if there's a societal or moral standard here. Some people might argue that both parents should share equally, others might think the non-working parent should take on more. Since the scenario is about the author's personal belief, unless there's a clear harm or wrong, it's subjective. However, if the parent on leave is already stressed, expecting them to handle all night feeds might not be considerate. \n\nSo, maybe the author is not in the wrong. But I'm a bit confused. Let me check if there's a standard answer here. In many cultures, it's common for the parent not working to take on more childcare duties, including nights. However, it's also important for both parents to share to prevent burnout. Since the author is suggesting that the parent on leave should handle it, maybe they're right. But the question is if they're in the wrong for thinking that. \n\nHmm. The answer might be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because it's a valid perspective based on the circumstances. But some might argue that splitting is better. Since the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for their opinion, and there's no absolute right answer, the answer would be B.\n"
