      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote the question is in the wrong. The question is about whether the parent on parental leave should be the one getting up with the baby at night, especially when the other parent has to work in the morning. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, parental leave can vary a lot depending on the country and the workplace policies. But generally, the parent on leave isn't working, so their schedule is more flexible. The working parent needs to wake up early for work, which might make it harder for them to get up during the night. The non-working parent can theoretically adjust their sleep more easily since they don't have an early start.\n\nI remember reading that sharing nighttime duties can help both parents get more rest. But if one parent is already getting up for work at the same time as the baby, maybe they're more tired. The non-working parent could take over the nighttime feedings or comfort, allowing the working parent to get a bit more sleep. That might make sense, especially if the working parent is already stressed from their job.\n\nBut there's also the aspect of fairness. If they split the overnights, maybe the working parent gets less sleep, which could affect their performance at work. On the other hand, the non-working parent might not need to adjust to a work schedule, so taking over the night duties could be more manageable for them. However, it's also possible that the non-working parent might be the one who is more rested and available during the day, so handling the night might be feasible.\n\nAnother point to consider is the physical and emotional well-being of both parents. If the working parent is exhausted from both work and night shifts, that could lead to burnout. The non-working parent might have more capacity to handle the night feedings without the added pressure of a job. This could be why some experts suggest that the non-working parent takes on the nighttime duties.\n\nBut there's no one-size-fits-all answer here. Every family dynamic is different. Some couples might prefer to share the load equally, even if it means the working parent gets less sleep. Others might find that splitting based on work schedules is more practical. The key is communication and what works best for both parents.\n\nIn terms of the question, the author is asking if they're in the wrong for thinking the parent on leave should handle the night shifts. If the reasoning is based on practicality and ensuring the working parent can function well during the day, then the author might not be in the wrong. However, if they're not considering the non-working parent's capacity or if there's an expectation of equal sharing without considering work demands, that could be a point of contention.\n\nSo, the answer would hinge on whether splitting the overnights is considered fair. If the working parent needs to be rested for their job, then having the non-working parent take over the nights makes sense. Therefore, the author's reasoning isn't wrong, but it's also a personal decision depending on the family's circumstances.\n"
