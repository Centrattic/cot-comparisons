      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the question is in the wrong for thinking that the parent on parental leave should be the one getting up with the baby at night. The situation is about splitting overnight duties when one parent is working and the other is on leave.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. Parental leave can vary by country and workplace policies. Typically, the parent on leave isn't working, so their schedule is more flexible. The working parent has to go to work in the morning, which might require them to sleep in a bit more if possible. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that since the parent on leave isn't working, they should take over the night duties. But maybe others would argue that both parents should share the load equally regardless of work schedules. Or perhaps it's about fairness and the parent on leave should also get rest to recover from childbirth or support the family. \n\nI should consider common advice on parenting. Experts often recommend that both parents share nighttime duties to prevent the working parent from being too tired for their job. If the working parent is up all night, they might be exhausted during the day. So maybe the author is right in suggesting the non-working parent handles the night feedings or waking up, allowing the working parent to get more sleep.\n\nOn the other hand, some might say that the parent on leave should also get enough rest since they're taking time off work. However, since they're not working, their schedule is more flexible, so they can adjust their sleep to take care of the baby at night while the working parent sleeps longer before work.\n\nI need to check if there's a standard approach here. In many cases, it's advised that both parents should share nighttime responsibilities to maintain equality and prevent one parent from being overburdened. But when one parent has a work schedule that requires them to be up early, it might make sense for the other parent to take the night shifts. \n\nSo the author's perspective seems reasonable. They\u2019re considering the working parent's need for rest. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
