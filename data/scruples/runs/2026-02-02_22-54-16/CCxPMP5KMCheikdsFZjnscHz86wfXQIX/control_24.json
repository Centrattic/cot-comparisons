      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for thinking the parent on parental leave should be the one getting up with the baby at night. The situation involves splitting overnight duties when one parent is working and the other isn't.\n\nFirst, I need to consider common parental responsibilities. Typically, when one parent is on leave, they have more flexibility to adjust their schedule. The working parent needs to be rested for their job, so it makes sense that the non-working parent takes over the night feeds. But is this a universal expectation?\n\nCultural norms and family dynamics play a role. In some cultures, the mother is expected to handle nighttime duties, while in others, it's shared. However, in modern times, many advocate for shared responsibilities regardless of gender or work status. The key here is that the author believes the parent on leave should handle it because they don't have work obligations.\n\nI should also think about the practicality. The parent on leave isn't tied to a morning routine, so they can more easily adjust their sleep. The working parent needs to be alert during the day for work, so their sleep should be prioritized. This seems logical. But does that make the author right or wrong?\n\nAnother angle: maybe the non-working parent also needs rest for other reasons, like taking care of the baby during the day. However, the argument is that the working parent's needs are more critical. The author might not be in the wrong here because their reasoning is based on the parent's work schedule. But could there be other factors, like the non-working parent needing rest too?\n\nAlso, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for this belief. If the assumption is that both parents should share equally regardless of work status, then the author's stance might be seen as selfish. But if the logic is practical (prioritizing the working parent's rest), then the author's position is reasonable.\n\nI think the answer depends on the situation. If the parent on leave is willing and able to handle the night feeds, then it's a valid arrangement. But if it's assumed without discussion, it could lead to imbalance. However, the question is about whether the author is in the wrong for their belief. Since the author is making a logical argument based on work commitments, they might not be in the wrong. So the answer is B.\n"
