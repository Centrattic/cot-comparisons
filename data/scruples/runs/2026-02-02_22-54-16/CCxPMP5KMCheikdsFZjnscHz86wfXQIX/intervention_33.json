      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The question is whether the person who asked if they're in the wrong (AITA) for thinking the parent on parental leave should handle night wakings is actually in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the scenario: The parent on parental leave isn't working, so they have more flexibility. The other parent has to get up for work each morning. The questioner thinks the non-working parent should take over night feedings. They're asking if they're the a**hole for that belief.\n\nI need to consider common perspectives on this. Some people might argue that both parents should share the load equally, regardless of work schedules. Others might think it's practical for the parent not working to take on more nighttime duties since they have the time and aren't rushing to work. \n\nIn many cultures, the working parent might get a bit more sleep to function during the day, so it's logical for the stay-at-home parent to handle more overnight responsibilities. However, there's also the argument about fairness and equal parenting. Even though one parent isn't working, they might have other responsibilities or need rest too. \n\nBut the key here is the questioner's reasoning: they think it's fair because one parent is at work. If both parents are not working, splitting nights equally makes sense, but when one is working, it's practical for the non-working parent to take on more. \n\nI don't think the questioner is in the wrong. They're prioritizing the working parent's need for sleep to function at work, which is a valid consideration. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
