      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for thinking that the parent on parental leave should be the one getting up with the baby at night. The situation is about splitting overnight duties when one parent is working and the other is on leave for six weeks. Let me think through this.\n\nFirst, parental leave is usually taken to bond with the baby and help with the transition. The parent on leave isn't working, so they might have more flexibility. But does that mean they should handle all the night duties? Some might argue that since they're not working, they can take on more at night. Others might say that both parents should share the load as equally as possible, especially since the parent on leave isn't earning money during that time.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that splitting the overnights isn't fair when one is working and the other isn't. But is that necessarily wrong? Well, it's a personal opinion. Parenting styles vary, and there's no one-size-fits-all answer. If both parents agree, maybe it's okay. But if the working parent is exhausted from their job and the other parent is available, maybe the working parent needs rest to perform well at work. However, the parent on leave might want to be the primary caregiver at night to bond. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the author is suggesting that the parent on leave should handle the night feedings, that's a common arrangement, but it's not the only way. There's no inherent wrongness in either approach unless it's causing harm or agreed upon. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong because it's a matter of personal opinion and circumstances."
