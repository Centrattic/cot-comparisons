      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the question is in the wrong. The question is about whether the parent on parental leave should be the one to get up with the baby at night, especially when the other parent is working and has to get up early.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author is suggesting that the parent on leave should handle nighttime feedings, because the working parent has to get up for work anyway. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong and wants to know if that's the case.\n\nSo, the core issue here is the division of nighttime responsibilities. The author's argument is that it makes sense for the non-working parent to take over, since the working parent's schedule is more constrained. But is this a fair assumption?\n\nFrom a general standpoint, parental responsibilities, especially in the early stages of a baby's life, often involve shared duties. However, there's no one-size-fits-all approach. Factors like the parents' physical condition, work demands, and personal preferences play a role. \n\nIn some cases, the working parent might prefer to get up with the baby to spend time together, especially if they're not home much during the day. Alternatively, the non-working parent might be more available and willing to take on that role. The key is mutual agreement and what works best for the family's situation.\n\nThe author's reasoning is practical\u2014avoiding the working parent's disrupted sleep since they need to be up early. But does that make the author right or wrong? It's not inherently wrong to propose a practical solution. However, it's important to consider that each family's circumstances are unique. Assuming that the non-working parent must take over all nighttime duties could overlook other factors, like the non-working parent's need for rest or the working parent's desire to be involved.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? The question is whether their reasoning is valid. Since there's no absolute right or wrong here, but rather a matter of perspective, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for suggesting that approach. However, the answer also depends on how the suggestion is made\u2014whether it's a collaborative idea or an imposition. \n\nGiven the phrasing of the question, the author is seeking validation for their perspective, not necessarily dictating it. Therefore, the answer would be that the author isn't in the wrong for thinking that way, as it's a reasonable consideration based on the given situation.\n"
