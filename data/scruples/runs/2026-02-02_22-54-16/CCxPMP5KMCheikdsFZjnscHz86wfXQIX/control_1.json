      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the question is in the wrong regarding who should get up with the baby at night when one parent is on parental leave.\n\nThe situation is that one parent is on leave for six weeks and not working, while the other has to go to work every morning. The author thinks the parent on leave should be the one getting up with the baby at night. The question is whether the author is at fault here.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the reasoning. Parental leave is meant to allow a parent to care for the child without work obligations. The parent on leave might be there to support the child's needs, including nighttime care. However, splitting the overnights could be a way to ensure both parents get some rest, especially if they're both exhausted. \n\nBut the author argues that since one parent is already off work, they should handle the night duties so the working parent can get enough sleep for their job. That makes sense because the working parent needs to be rested for work. The non-working parent might have more flexibility to manage nighttime tasks. \n\nHowever, parental leave is also a time for bonding and sharing responsibilities. The working parent might need rest, but the non-working parent might feel overwhelmed if they have to do all the nighttime work. It's a balance between fairness, rest, and practicality.\n\nThere's no one-size-fits-all answer here. It depends on the couple's agreement, their physical and emotional capacity, and what works for their situation. The author isn't necessarily wrong for thinking that way because their reasoning is based on the working parent's need for rest. But some might argue that the parent on leave should take the night shifts as part of their caregiving role during the leave period.\n\nSo, considering these points, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer would be B (No).\n"
