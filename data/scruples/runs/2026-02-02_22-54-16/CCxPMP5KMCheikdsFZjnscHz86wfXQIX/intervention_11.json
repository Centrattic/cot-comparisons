      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about whether the parent on parental leave should be the one getting up with the baby at night. The author argues that splitting overnight duties isn't fair when one parent is working every morning and the other isn't. They're asking if they're the asshole (AITA) for thinking that.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Parental leave varies by country and company policies. In some places, parents can take leave or get time off, but the specifics matter. The parent on leave isn't working, so their schedule is more flexible. The other parent has to get up early for work, so they might be more tired if they also have to get up at night. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that splitting the nights isn't necessary when one parent isn't working. But does that make them wrong? Well, parents often have to share duties. Some might argue that both should pitch in, even if one is on leave. However, others might say that the parent on leave has the flexibility to handle nighttime feedings, allowing the working parent to get more rest for their job. \n\nIt's important to note that every family's situation is different. Some might have health issues, breastfeeding needs, or other factors that affect who can or should get up. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for their opinion. Since the scenario is about splitting the overnights, and the author is suggesting that the non-working parent should take on that responsibility, it's a matter of differing opinions on fairness and practicality.\n\nI think the key here is that there's no right or wrong in terms of moral obligation; it's more about what works for the family. The author isn't maliciously trying to burden the other parent but is suggesting a practical approach based on their circumstances. So, the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. However, some might argue that both parents should share equally, but given the circumstances, the author's reasoning is valid.\n"
