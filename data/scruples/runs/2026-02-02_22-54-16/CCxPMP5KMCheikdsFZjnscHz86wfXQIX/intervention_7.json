      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA question is in the wrong for thinking the parent on parental leave should handle the overnight feedings.\n\nSo, the situation is about splitting overnights when one parent is off work for six weeks and the other is getting up for work every morning. The author doesn't understand why they would split the overnights instead of having the parent on leave take care of it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the typical responsibilities during parental leave. The parent not working might be expected to take on more of the nighttime duties so the working parent can get more rest for their job. But sometimes, parents might split duties to balance exhaustion, even if one is on leave. \n\nThe key here is whether it's reasonable for the author to expect the non-working parent to handle the overnights. The author's reasoning is that the parent on leave isn't working, so they can manage the night feedings. The other parent works, so they need more sleep. \n\nBut some might argue that both parents should share the load equally for fairness, even if one is on leave. However, others might say that the parent not working can afford to get less sleep. The question is whether the author's position is wrong.\n\nIn many cases, it's practical for the non-working parent to take on more nighttime duties to help the working parent stay rested for their job. So, the author's perspective seems reasonable. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
