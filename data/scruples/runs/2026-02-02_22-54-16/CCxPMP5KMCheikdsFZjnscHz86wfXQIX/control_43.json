      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the question is in the wrong regarding night shifts when one parent is on parental leave.\n\nThe original question is about whether the parent on leave should be the one getting up with the baby at night. The author thinks that since one parent is working and the other isn't, the non-working parent should handle the night feedings. They're asking if they're the asshole (AITA) for thinking that.\n\nI need to decide if the author is wrong (A) or not (B). Parenting responsibilities can be subjective, but there are some general considerations. Typically, parents split responsibilities based on what works best for their situation. If one parent is on leave, they might have more flexibility to adjust their sleep schedule, while the working parent needs to be up early. It's often argued that the non-working parent can take on more night duties to help the working parent rest for their job. However, this isn't a universal rule. Some argue that both parents should share equally, regardless of work schedules. \n\nBut in this case, the author is suggesting that the parent on leave (who isn't working) should take over the night shifts so the working parent can get more sleep. This seems reasonable because the working parent needs to be alert for their job. The author isn't imposing it, just questioning if their opinion is wrong. \n\nThere's no clear right or wrong here, but the question hinges on whether the author's view is unreasonable. Since it's about personal opinion and practicality, the author's reasoning is logical from a practical standpoint. So, the answer would be B (not in the wrong). However, some might argue that both should share equally, but the scenario allows for flexibility. The key is that the author isn't forcing the other parent; they're sharing their perspective. So, likely B.\n"
