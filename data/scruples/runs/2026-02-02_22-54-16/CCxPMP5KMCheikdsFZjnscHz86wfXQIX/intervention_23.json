      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author of the AITA question is in the wrong. The question is about whether the parent on parental leave should be the one getting up with the baby at night, especially since one parent is working and the other isn't. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation involves a parent who's on parental leave (so not working) and another who has to go to work every morning. The author is suggesting that the parent on leave should take over the night duties, allowing the working parent to get more rest. The author is asking if they're in the wrong for thinking this.\n\nI need to consider cultural norms and common practices. In many cases, when one parent is on leave, they do take on more of the nighttime responsibilities so the other parent can rest for work. This makes sense because the working parent needs to be alert for their job. But there's also the aspect of shared responsibility. Some might argue that both parents should share the load, even if one isn't working. However, practicality often dictates that the parent not working can handle more nighttime duties since they have the flexibility.\n\nAnother angle is that parental leave is meant to allow bonding with the baby, and taking care of the baby at night is part of that bonding. So the parent on leave might actually benefit from being the one to get up. On the flip side, if the non-working parent is already handling most of the nighttime duties, they might get overburdened. But the key here is the working parent needing to rest for work. It's a balance between shared parenting and practical work demands.\n\nI should also think about potential arguments against the author. Some might say that both parents should share equally regardless of work status, promoting teamwork and equality. However, others would support the author's view for practical reasons. The answer likely depends on context, such as the parents' agreement, their physical and emotional states, and any prior arrangements.\n\nSince the question is whether the author is in the wrong, and given that practical considerations often take precedence in such situations, the author's reasoning seems valid. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
