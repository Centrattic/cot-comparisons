      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who posted the question is in the wrong. The situation is about whether the parent on parental leave should be the one getting up with the baby at night. The author is saying they don't understand splitting overnight duties when one parent is working and the other isn't.\n\nFirst, I need to think about common practices. Typically, when one parent is on leave, they might take on more of the nighttime duties because they aren't working in the morning. That way, the working parent can get more rest for their job. But this can vary based on the couple's agreement or what's best for their situation.\n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong for thinking this way. If the author is suggesting that the parent on leave should handle the night feedings because the other parent is working, that's a common perspective. However, some might argue that both parents should share the responsibilities equally, regardless of work schedules. \n\nBut the key here is that the parents might have their own arrangement. The author is asking if they're in the wrong for their opinion. If the author is not imposing this on their own situation but is just expressing their viewpoint, then they might not be in the wrong. However, if they're criticizing others for splitting duties, maybe that's where the issue is.\n\nIn the AITA format, the person usually asks if they're the asshole. The community often looks at intentions and context. Since the author is confused about splitting when one parent is working, it might be seen as a reasonable opinion. But some might argue that it's unfair to assume the non-working parent should take all the night duties. \n\nSo, considering all angles, the answer might be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because suggesting that the parent not working should handle night duties is a common and practical approach. However, it's also important to consider the couple's mutual agreement. But based on the question as presented, the author's stance isn't inherently wrong.\n"
