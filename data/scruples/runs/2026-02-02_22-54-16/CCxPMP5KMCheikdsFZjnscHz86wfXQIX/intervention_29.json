      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about who should get up with the baby at night when one parent is on parental leave. The author is suggesting that the parent on leave should take the overnights since the working parent needs to be up early for work.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the typical expectations. Parental leave usually allows the parent to spend more time with the baby, which can include adjusting to the baby's schedule. If one parent is on leave, they might have more flexibility or be encouraged to bond with the baby during night feedings. The working parent, on the other hand, has to be up early, so getting enough rest is important for their job performance.\n\nBut I should consider both sides. The parent on leave might be doing a lot during the day and also at night, which could be exhausting. However, taking the night shifts could help the working parent get more rest during the night. It's a common arrangement for the non-working parent to take overnights so the working parent can rest. \n\nHowever, there's also the aspect of shared responsibility. If the parent on leave is already handling most of the daytime duties, adding night shifts might be too much. On the other hand, if the working parent is already stressed from work, they might need the rest.\n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong for thinking the leave parent should take the overnights. The author's reasoning is that the working parent is up early, so the leave parent, who isn't working, should take the night shifts. That seems logical from a practical standpoint, but emotions and fatigue can complicate things. \n\nI think the key here is that there's no one-size-fits-all answer. It depends on the parents' circumstances, agreements, and well-being. The author isn't necessarily wrong for suggesting that split, especially if it's working for their situation. They might not be considering the potential exhaustion of the leave parent, but their reasoning is based on practicality. So the answer is probably B, they are not in the wrong.\n"
