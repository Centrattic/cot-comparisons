      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about splitting overnight duties when one parent is on parental leave. The author is asking if they're at fault for thinking the parent on leave should handle getting up with the baby at night, since the other parent has to go to work in the morning.\n\nFirst, I should consider the context. Parental leave varies by country and employer, but generally, it's a period where a parent can take time off work to care for a newborn or newly adopted child. In this case, one parent is on leave for six weeks, while the other is working. The author's argument is that the parent who's not working should take over the night duties so the working parent can get enough rest for their job the next day. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author is wrong for thinking this way. Let's break it down. Parenting responsibilities, especially with a newborn, can be exhausting. Nighttime feedings and wake-ups are common and can disrupt sleep for both parents. If one parent is working, they might need more rest to perform well at their job, which could be a valid reason for the other parent to take on more nighttime duties. However, the parent on leave might also be adjusting to the new baby and might need rest as well, but since they're not working, they might have more flexibility.\n\nBut is it fair to assign all the night duties to the parent on leave? That could lead to them getting less sleep and potentially feeling overburdened. On the other hand, the working parent needs to be rested for their job. There's no one-size-fits-all answer here, but the author is suggesting that the parent on leave should take over, which might not be considered wrong, depending on the circumstances. However, some might argue that both parents should share the load as equally as possible, even if the working parent is more tired in the mornings. \n\nAnother angle is that the parent on leave might have more time to bond with the baby during the day, so taking over at night could be a way to balance that. But if the working parent is exhausted from work, they might not be able to function well. It's a balancing act. \n\nIn many cases, couples do split the night duties based on their work schedules. For example, if one parent has to wake up early for work, the other might take the night shift. So the author's reasoning isn't entirely unreasonable. However, it's important to consider the well-being of both parents. If the parent on leave is also struggling with lack of sleep, that's a problem. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If they're suggesting that the parent on leave should take over all night duties without considering their own needs, maybe. But if they're just trying to make sure the working parent gets enough sleep, maybe not. The key is whether the approach is considerate of both parents' needs. The question is whether the author is wrong for thinking this way. If the community's response (AITA) leans towards the author not being at fault, then the answer would be B. But if the consensus is that both parents should share equally, then A. \n\nI think the author's reasoning is practical, considering the working parent's need for rest. So the answer is B (not in the wrong). But I need to check if there's a cultural or social norm that dictates otherwise. In some cultures, the working parent is expected to take more rest, while the stay-at-home parent handles more childcare. However, modern parenting often emphasizes shared responsibilities. But given that one parent is on leave, it's a temporary situation, and sharing the load as much as possible might be ideal. However, the author's suggestion is based on practicality, so maybe they're not wrong. So, B.\n"
