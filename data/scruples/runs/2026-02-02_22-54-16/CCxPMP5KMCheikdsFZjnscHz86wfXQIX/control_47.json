      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) question is in the wrong. The situation is about whether the parent on parental leave should be the one getting up with the baby at night when the other parent is working.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the scenario. The author is suggesting that the parent not working (on leave) should handle nighttime feedings or baby duties because the working parent has to get up for work each morning. The question is whether this is a reasonable expectation or if the author is in the wrong.\n\nParental responsibilities can be a sensitive topic. Traditionally, there's been some expectation that the parent on leave might take on more of the childcare, but this can vary based on cultural norms, the couple's agreement, and personal circumstances. However, modern perspectives often emphasize shared responsibility and flexibility based on what works best for both parents.\n\nThe key points here are: splitting overnight duties when one parent is off work and the other is working. The author argues against splitting overnights in this scenario, implying the non-working parent should handle it. But is that fair? Well, if the working parent is already up for work in the morning, maybe they can take some nighttime duties to help out. On the other hand, the parent on leave might be trying to bond with the baby and adjust to their new role as a parent. However, getting up multiple times at night can be exhausting, and if one parent is already not working, maybe they can manage the nighttime feeds to allow the working parent to get more rest.\n\nBut the problem is that this is a partnership. Assuming one parent should do all the night duties without considering their own needs or the other parent's input might not be fair. Both parents should ideally discuss and agree on a schedule that works for them. There's no one-size-fits-all answer here. The author's reasoning might be based on practicality (the working parent needs rest), but it's possible that the parent on leave is also exhausted and might not want to take on all the night shifts.\n\nAnother angle: sometimes the parent on leave is the mother, and she might have physical needs (like nursing) or emotional needs to bond with the baby. However, not all parents are the same, and some might choose to share duties regardless. The question is whether the author is wrong to expect that the non-working parent should handle the overnights. If the author is making an absolute statement without considering the other parent's situation or preferences, that could be problematic.\n\nIn many cases, it's about communication and compromise. If the author is assuming that the non-working parent must take over all nighttime duties without discussing it, that could be seen as not considering the other's needs. However, if they are considering the working parent's need for rest, maybe there's a valid point there. It's a bit of a gray area. The answer depends on whether the author is making a fair, flexible suggestion or an inflexible demand.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often values consideration for both sides. If the author is suggesting that the non-working parent should handle it without considering the other's perspective, they might be in the wrong. But if it's a reasonable request based on the working parent's need for rest, maybe not. However, the way the question is phrased, the author seems to be asserting that splitting overnights is unnecessary in this scenario, which might not take into account the non-working parent's need for sleep or their own situation.\n\nSo, considering all angles, the answer could be either A or B. But since the community often looks for empathy and shared responsibility, the author might be in the wrong for not considering the other parent's needs. However, there's also the practical aspect of the working parent needing rest. It's a bit of a toss-up. But since the author is asking if they are in the wrong, and the scenario is about splitting overnights when one parent is on leave, the community might lean towards the idea that both parents should work together and not assume the non-working parent must take all the load. Therefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because they're not considering that the non-working parent might also need rest and that responsibilities should be shared as much as possible.\n"
