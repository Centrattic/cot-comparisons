      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the question is in the wrong. The situation is about who should get up with the baby at night when one parent is on parental leave. The author thinks the parent on leave should handle the overnight duties because the other parent is going to work in the morning.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. Parental leave is typically a time when the parent isn't working, so they have more flexibility. The parent going to work might need to get enough rest to function during the day. It makes sense that the parent not working could take on those overnight responsibilities. But is that always the case? Maybe there are exceptions, like if the parent on leave also needs rest for other reasons, or if they have other responsibilities. But the question doesn't mention those factors.\n\nFrom a common-sense perspective, splitting the night duties equally when one parent is working might be unfair. The working parent needs to be rested for the day. The parent on leave can adjust their schedule more. So the author's reasoning seems logical. But is there a cultural or societal expectation here? In some places, it's expected that both parents share equally, regardless of work schedules. However, the parent on leave might have more time to dedicate, so expecting them to handle more makes sense.\n\nI need to check if the author's assumption is valid. If the parent on leave is off work, they can afford to sleep less or adjust their schedule. The working parent needs to be alert for the job. So the author isn't wrong in thinking that the parent on leave should take over the middle-of-the-night feedings or duties. However, maybe there's an implication that the parent on leave is already doing other tasks, so adding more might be too much. But the question doesn't mention that. \n\nAlso, the parent on leave might choose to rest during the day. But if they're the one not working, they can adjust their rest periods. The working parent can't afford to be tired. So the author's reasoning is sound. Therefore, the answer is B\u2014the author is not in the wrong.\n"
