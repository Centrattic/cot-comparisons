      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the question is in the wrong for thinking that the parent on parental leave should be the one getting up with the baby at night. The situation is about splitting overnight duties when one parent is working and the other is on leave.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. Parental leave often allows one parent to take time off work to care for the child. The author is suggesting that the parent not working should handle the night feedings or waking up with the baby. The question is whether this is a fair assumption.\n\nI should consider common practices and perspectives. Some might argue that the parent on leave is already not working, so taking on more childcare duties makes sense. Others might think that splitting responsibilities is better for both parents' rest and bonding with the baby. However, the parent on leave might have more flexibility since they aren't going to work in the morning. The working parent needs to be up early, so getting less sleep could affect their performance at work.\n\nAlso, there's the aspect of equal parenting. But in this case, the parent on leave might be able to take on more night duties without the added stress of an early work schedule. It's a practical consideration. However, every family's situation is different. Factors like the baby's needs, the parents' physical and mental health, and any prior agreements matter.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for this belief. If others might think it's unfair to expect the working parent to get up, then maybe the author isn't in the wrong. But if there's a cultural expectation that both parents share equally regardless of work schedules, then maybe they are. But generally, considering the practicality of the parent on leave having more availability, the author's stance seems reasonable. So probably answer B, not in the wrong.\n"
