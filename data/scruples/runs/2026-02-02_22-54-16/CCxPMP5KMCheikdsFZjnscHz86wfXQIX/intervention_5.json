      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the question is in the wrong. The situation is about parental leave and who should get up with the baby at night.\n\nThe author thinks the parent on leave should handle the overnight duties because the other parent has to get up for work, while the parent on leave is off for six weeks. They're asking if they're the asshole (AITA) for this opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider common views on parental responsibilities. In many cases, when one parent is on leave, especially maternity or paternity leave, it's often seen as a time to bond with the baby. However, sleep is important for all parents, and sharing nighttime duties can be practical.\n\nBut the author's reasoning is that the working parent needs to rest for work the next day, while the parent on leave doesn't have that constraint. That makes sense from a practical standpoint. The parent on leave can adjust their sleep schedule more flexibly since they aren't commuting or working. It's also about efficiency\u2014having one parent handle it might reduce stress for the working parent who needs to be alert for work.\n\nHowever, some might argue that both parents should share the load equally, regardless of work schedules. But equality isn't always about equal time. It could be about what's most feasible given the circumstances. The parent on leave might have more availability to adjust their schedule, making it a reasonable arrangement.\n\nAnother angle: parental leave is meant to allow bonding and adjust to the new baby. If the parent on leave is handling the night feedings, it might help them bond and also understand the baby's needs. On the other hand, the working parent might feel they're getting less involved. But since they're busy with work, they might not have the same opportunities during the day to participate.\n\nCultural norms vary. In some cultures, the mother is expected to handle more of the night duties, but in others, it's shared. However, the question is more about the practicality given work schedules rather than cultural expectations.\n\nPossible counterarguments: The parent on leave might also need rest to manage their own health and well-being. Over time, lack of sleep can affect their ability to care for the baby or handle other responsibilities. But the author's point is about the immediate practicality of work schedules.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author's reasoning seems logical. They're prioritizing the working parent's need for rest, which makes sense. Therefore, the answer would be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
