I got called an asshole for it, so now I have come here out of curiosity for you fine people to help settle the disagreement.\n\nI met a girl online and we clicked, and have gone on a couple dates. Two nights ago was our third date and I was treating her to dinner at a local burger place in the city. Nothing fancy, I just wanted some good conversation over a tasty meal. This girl is a knockout, has the rare quality of being a great listener, and isn't obsessed with herself. She's funny, charming, and smart. We had had several great dates and I was getting close to asking her to be my girlfriend. She is also the one who called me an asshole before the night was done (not her exact words, but we'll get there.)\n\nOur waitress for dinner was great. Actually enthusiastic and friendly, on point with the refills, and just top notch service all around. At one point in the evening she did spill a partially-full glass of water on our table, but it wasn't really her fault because she had gotten bumped into, and she was very quick to apologize and wipe the table dry with a smile on her face, so if anything that was a point in her column.\n\nAt the end of the meal, she brought the check and I told her I would like to speak with her manager. She asked if there was something wrong, and I calmly repeated that I would like to speak with her manager and could she please go get him. She leaves and reappears with the manager a few moments later, and I proceed to tell him that we had gotten *excellent* service that night, and that (her name) was one of their best. He thanked me for the feedback and she also looked very happy at the compliment and thanked me.\n\nThe only one not happy was my date. She said, \"If that was supposed to impress me, it didn't.\" and said that I was full of myself. She didn't say much else as we gathered our things to leave and there was no kiss at the door that night. I texted her saying I was sorry for whatever I did wrong and that I'd like to see her again soon, so far no response.\n\nSo pardon my french, but what the fuck?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is that he told the waitress's manager she did a great job, and his date was upset about it. The options are A (wrong) or B (not wrong). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The guy and his date went to a burger place. The waitress had good service, even though she spilled a glass of water but handled it well. He wanted to compliment her manager, so he asked for the manager, got him, and praised the waitress. The date was upset, thought he was full of himself, and now they're not talking.\n\nSo why would the date be upset? Maybe she felt that he was trying to impress her by complimenting the waitress? But why would that be a problem? Or maybe she thought he was being overly formal or unnecessary in going to the manager. Alternatively, maybe she felt that the action was condescending or that he was showing off. \n\nBut from the author's perspective, he was just trying to give positive feedback. It's a common practice to compliment good service. However, in a date setting, maybe the timing or the way he did it was off. Did he do it in front of the waitress? The story says he spoke to the manager, so maybe it was a private conversation. But the date might have felt that he was trying to be grandiose or that the compliment was unnecessary. \n\nAnother angle: maybe the date was trying to focus on their time together, and the author's action was a distraction. Or perhaps she found it awkward. But the author's intention was to acknowledge good service, which is a positive action. The waitress was happy, the manager appreciated it. The problem arose with the date's reaction. \n\nIs there a cultural context where praising someone else's service during a date is frowned upon? Maybe not. Generally, it's a good thing. But maybe in their relationship dynamic, the date felt that the author was trying to show off his ability to give compliments or his generosity in some way. Or perhaps she thought he was trying to impress her by being overly formal, which could come off as insincere. \n\nAlso, the fact that the author texted to apologize suggests that he thought there might be an issue. But the question is whether he was actually wrong. If his action was appropriate, then the date's reaction is her issue. If his action was something that could be seen as inconsiderate in the context of a date, then maybe he was wrong. \n\nSo, the key points are: complimenting service is positive, but during a date, maybe the focus should be on the companion. Did he take the spotlight off of her by praising someone else? Or perhaps she felt it was an unnecessary gesture. However, it's common to appreciate good service, and the waitress did a good job. \n\nI think the author was not in the wrong. He did something kind and appropriate. The date's reaction is more about her own expectations or feelings. Therefore, the answer would be B (not in the wrong).\n"
