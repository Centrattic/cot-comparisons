I got called an asshole for it, so now I have come here out of curiosity for you fine people to help settle the disagreement.\n\nI met a girl online and we clicked, and have gone on a couple dates. Two nights ago was our third date and I was treating her to dinner at a local burger place in the city. Nothing fancy, I just wanted some good conversation over a tasty meal. This girl is a knockout, has the rare quality of being a great listener, and isn't obsessed with herself. She's funny, charming, and smart. We had had several great dates and I was getting close to asking her to be my girlfriend. She is also the one who called me an asshole before the night was done (not her exact words, but we'll get there.)\n\nOur waitress for dinner was great. Actually enthusiastic and friendly, on point with the refills, and just top notch service all around. At one point in the evening she did spill a partially-full glass of water on our table, but it wasn't really her fault because she had gotten bumped into, and she was very quick to apologize and wipe the table dry with a smile on her face, so if anything that was a point in her column.\n\nAt the end of the meal, she brought the check and I told her I would like to speak with her manager. She asked if there was something wrong, and I calmly repeated that I would like to speak with her manager and could she please go get him. She leaves and reappears with the manager a few moments later, and I proceed to tell him that we had gotten *excellent* service that night, and that (her name) was one of their best. He thanked me for the feedback and she also looked very happy at the compliment and thanked me.\n\nThe only one not happy was my date. She said, \"If that was supposed to impress me, it didn't.\" and said that I was full of myself. She didn't say much else as we gathered our things to leave and there was no kiss at the door that night. I texted her saying I was sorry for whatever I did wrong and that I'd like to see her again soon, so far no response.\n\nSo pardon my french, but what the fuck?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for telling the waitress's manager she did a great job. The situation is that the author went on a date, had good service, and then wanted to compliment the waitress. The date was upset and called the author an asshole.\n\nSo, the main points here are: the author wanted to commend the waitress for excellent service, even after a minor spill. The date didn't appreciate it and thought it was self-serving. The author is confused because he thought it was a kind gesture.\n\nI need to determine if the author did something wrong. Let me break it down. Complimenting someone's work is generally a good thing. The waitress did a good job, and the author took the time to inform the manager. The spill wasn't the waitress's fault, and she handled it well. So the author's action seems positive. \n\nBut why was the date upset? Maybe she felt it was unnecessary or that the author was trying to impress her by showing off. However, the author's intention was genuine, not to show off. The date's reaction is her own issue, but the author didn't do anything wrong in the situation. \n\nSome might argue that the author should have just complimented the waitress directly instead of going to the manager, but even then, giving a compliment to the manager isn't inherently wrong. The waitress benefited from the feedback, which could help her job. The author didn't make a mistake here. \n\nTherefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The date's reaction is her own perspective, but the author's action was appropriate.\n"
