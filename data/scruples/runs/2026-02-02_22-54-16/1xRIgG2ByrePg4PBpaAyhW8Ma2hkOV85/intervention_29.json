I got called an asshole for it, so now I have come here out of curiosity for you fine people to help settle the disagreement.\n\nI met a girl online and we clicked, and have gone on a couple dates. Two nights ago was our third date and I was treating her to dinner at a local burger place in the city. Nothing fancy, I just wanted some good conversation over a tasty meal. This girl is a knockout, has the rare quality of being a great listener, and isn't obsessed with herself. She's funny, charming, and smart. We had had several great dates and I was getting close to asking her to be my girlfriend. She is also the one who called me an asshole before the night was done (not her exact words, but we'll get there.)\n\nOur waitress for dinner was great. Actually enthusiastic and friendly, on point with the refills, and just top notch service all around. At one point in the evening she did spill a partially-full glass of water on our table, but it wasn't really her fault because she had gotten bumped into, and she was very quick to apologize and wipe the table dry with a smile on her face, so if anything that was a point in her column.\n\nAt the end of the meal, she brought the check and I told her I would like to speak with her manager. She asked if there was something wrong, and I calmly repeated that I would like to speak with her manager and could she please go get him. She leaves and reappears with the manager a few moments later, and I proceed to tell him that we had gotten *excellent* service that night, and that (her name) was one of their best. He thanked me for the feedback and she also looked very happy at the compliment and thanked me.\n\nThe only one not happy was my date. She said, \"If that was supposed to impress me, it didn't.\" and said that I was full of myself. She didn't say much else as we gathered our things to leave and there was no kiss at the door that night. I texted her saying I was sorry for whatever I did wrong and that I'd like to see her again soon, so far no response.\n\nSo pardon my french, but what the fuck?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for complimenting the waitress's manager about her service. The situation is that the author went on a date with a girl, the waitress did a good job despite a minor spill, and the author wanted to commend her. However, the date took offense and called the author an asshole. The author is confused and seeking input.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the actions taken. The author wanted to give positive feedback, which is generally a good thing. Praising a service worker can be a nice gesture. But why did the date take offense? Maybe she felt left out or that the author was trying to show off by complimenting the waitress instead of focusing on their date. The spill incident wasn't the waitress's fault, so the author's intention to acknowledge her good service despite that seems valid.\n\nHowever, in the context of a date, the girl might have expected the author's attention to be solely on her. Complimenting another person, even a waitress, could be perceived as a distraction or a misprioritization. The author might not have considered her perspective, where such a gesture could come off as inconsiderate.\n\nBut the author's intent was positive. He wanted to recognize the waitress's good work, which is a common and decent thing to do. The girl's reaction might stem from personal feelings or expectations rather than the action itself being wrong. The author didn't do anything negative; he did something good. The conflict arises from the girl's interpretation rather than the action being inherently wrong.\n\nSo, the key is whether the author did something objectively wrong. Since complimenting someone is a positive action, the author isn't in the wrong. The issue is more about the girl's feelings and their relationship dynamics. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
