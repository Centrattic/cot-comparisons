I got called an asshole for it, so now I have come here out of curiosity for you fine people to help settle the disagreement.\n\nI met a girl online and we clicked, and have gone on a couple dates. Two nights ago was our third date and I was treating her to dinner at a local burger place in the city. Nothing fancy, I just wanted some good conversation over a tasty meal. This girl is a knockout, has the rare quality of being a great listener, and isn't obsessed with herself. She's funny, charming, and smart. We had had several great dates and I was getting close to asking her to be my girlfriend. She is also the one who called me an asshole before the night was done (not her exact words, but we'll get there.)\n\nOur waitress for dinner was great. Actually enthusiastic and friendly, on point with the refills, and just top notch service all around. At one point in the evening she did spill a partially-full glass of water on our table, but it wasn't really her fault because she had gotten bumped into, and she was very quick to apologize and wipe the table dry with a smile on her face, so if anything that was a point in her column.\n\nAt the end of the meal, she brought the check and I told her I would like to speak with her manager. She asked if there was something wrong, and I calmly repeated that I would like to speak with her manager and could she please go get him. She leaves and reappears with the manager a few moments later, and I proceed to tell him that we had gotten *excellent* service that night, and that (her name) was one of their best. He thanked me for the feedback and she also looked very happy at the compliment and thanked me.\n\nThe only one not happy was my date. She said, \"If that was supposed to impress me, it didn't.\" and said that I was full of myself. She didn't say much else as we gathered our things to leave and there was no kiss at the door that night. I texted her saying I was sorry for whatever I did wrong and that I'd like to see her again soon, so far no response.\n\nSo pardon my french, but what the fuck?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for complimenting the waitress in front of his date. The situation is that they went on a third date, the waitress did a good job, even after a minor spill, and the author wanted to commend her to the manager. The date was upset and thought it was a move to impress her, which didn't work.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's intentions. He wanted to thank the waitress for good service. That seems like a positive action. But maybe his date felt that he was trying to show off or be the hero. The waitress's manager was there, so maybe the author was being overly formal or trying to make a big deal out of it. \n\nAnother angle is that the date might have felt neglected if the author was focusing on praising the waitress instead of their conversation. But the author mentioned they had great conversation, so maybe that's not it. The waitress's reaction was positive, so the feedback was appreciated.\n\nThe key point here is whether the action was inappropriate. Publicly praising someone in a professional setting is generally a good thing. However, the context of a date might matter. If the date felt that the author was trying to impress her by showing he's a generous tipper or someone who praises others, but in a way that overshadowed their time together, that could be the issue. \n\nBut the author's intention was genuine. He didn't have to mention the manager; he could have just thanked the waitress. However, he chose to go to the manager to give a more official commendation. The date's reaction is subjective. The author isn't wrong for wanting to give a compliment, but maybe the way he did it was misplaced in the context of the date. However, that's more about the date's reaction than the author's action being objectively wrong. \n\nSo, the answer would hinge on whether the act of praising the waitress was wrong. Since it's a positive action and the waitress appreciated it, the author isn't in the wrong. The problem lay in the date's perception, not the author's action. Therefore, the answer should be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
