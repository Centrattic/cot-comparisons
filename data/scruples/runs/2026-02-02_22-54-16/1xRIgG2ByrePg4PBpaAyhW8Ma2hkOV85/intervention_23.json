I got called an asshole for it, so now I have come here out of curiosity for you fine people to help settle the disagreement.\n\nI met a girl online and we clicked, and have gone on a couple dates. Two nights ago was our third date and I was treating her to dinner at a local burger place in the city. Nothing fancy, I just wanted some good conversation over a tasty meal. This girl is a knockout, has the rare quality of being a great listener, and isn't obsessed with herself. She's funny, charming, and smart. We had had several great dates and I was getting close to asking her to be my girlfriend. She is also the one who called me an asshole before the night was done (not her exact words, but we'll get there.)\n\nOur waitress for dinner was great. Actually enthusiastic and friendly, on point with the refills, and just top notch service all around. At one point in the evening she did spill a partially-full glass of water on our table, but it wasn't really her fault because she had gotten bumped into, and she was very quick to apologize and wipe the table dry with a smile on her face, so if anything that was a point in her column.\n\nAt the end of the meal, she brought the check and I told her I would like to speak with her manager. She asked if there was something wrong, and I calmly repeated that I would like to speak with her manager and could she please go get him. She leaves and reappears with the manager a few moments later, and I proceed to tell him that we had gotten *excellent* service that night, and that (her name) was one of their best. He thanked me for the feedback and she also looked very happy at the compliment and thanked me.\n\nThe only one not happy was my date. She said, \"If that was supposed to impress me, it didn't.\" and said that I was full of myself. She didn't say much else as we gathered our things to leave and there was no kiss at the door that night. I texted her saying I was sorry for whatever I did wrong and that I'd like to see her again soon, so far no response.\n\nSo pardon my french, but what the fuck?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation is that the person told the waitress's manager she did a great job, and their date got upset about it. The person is wondering if they're an asshole for doing that.\n\nFirst, I need to understand all the details. The person went on a date with a girl, they had a good time, and the waitress provided excellent service, even when she accidentally spilled water but handled it well. The person wanted to compliment the waitress by talking to the manager. The date was upset, saying that the act didn't impress her and called the person full of themselves. Now, the person is confused why that was a bad move.\n\nSo, the main question is whether complimenting the waitress in front of the manager was inappropriate. The user thinks the author isn't wrong. Let me break this down. \n\nPossible angles: \n\n1. **Intention of the action**: The person's intention was positive\u2014to praise the waitress. Usually, giving positive feedback is seen as a good thing. However, doing it in front of the manager might be a different scenario. But why would the date be upset? Maybe because it felt like the person was trying to show off or one-up her by doing something she didn't expect. \n\n2. **Context of the date**: It was a third date where the person was planning to ask her to be a girlfriend. The date might have had different expectations. Perhaps she felt that the focus should have been on them, and directing praise to the waitress might have made her feel overlooked. \n\n3. **Communication style**: The act of going to the manager could be seen as a public gesture, which might not be appropriate in a private setting like a date. If the person wanted to compliment the waitress, maybe a simple tip note or a private comment would have sufficed, and doing it in front of the manager might have been unnecessary.\n\n4. **The date's reaction**: The girl's reaction was negative, but that doesn't automatically make the person wrong. People have different preferences. Maybe she didn't like public displays of attention or felt it was inconsiderate. However, the person's actions were genuine in intent.\n\nBut here's the thing: the person did something that's generally a good deed, but it backfired. The question is whether the person is in the wrong. If the action was meant well but the date didn't appreciate it, does that make the person wrong? Or is the date overreacting?\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the consensus often depends on whether the action was malicious or inconsiderate. Since the person's action was positive (praising someone else), it's hard to see how that's wrong. However, the context of a date might require more consideration of the partner's feelings. The person might not have considered how their partner would feel about public attention being given to another person.\n\nBut there's also the aspect of the waitress's job. Complimenting her service is the right thing to do. The method of doing it via the manager is a bit unusual but not wrong. It's possible that the date felt slighted because the focus shifted away from her, but that's her reaction, not a wrongdoing by the person.\n\nSo, the person's action was appropriate in the context of recognizing good service. The date's reaction is more about personal preference. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
