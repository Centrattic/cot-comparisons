I got called an asshole for it, so now I have come here out of curiosity for you fine people to help settle the disagreement.\n\nI met a girl online and we clicked, and have gone on a couple dates. Two nights ago was our third date and I was treating her to dinner at a local burger place in the city. Nothing fancy, I just wanted some good conversation over a tasty meal. This girl is a knockout, has the rare quality of being a great listener, and isn't obsessed with herself. She's funny, charming, and smart. We had had several great dates and I was getting close to asking her to be my girlfriend. She is also the one who called me an asshole before the night was done (not her exact words, but we'll get there.)\n\nOur waitress for dinner was great. Actually enthusiastic and friendly, on point with the refills, and just top notch service all around. At one point in the evening she did spill a partially-full glass of water on our table, but it wasn't really her fault because she had gotten bumped into, and she was very quick to apologize and wipe the table dry with a smile on her face, so if anything that was a point in her column.\n\nAt the end of the meal, she brought the check and I told her I would like to speak with her manager. She asked if there was something wrong, and I calmly repeated that I would like to speak with her manager and could she please go get him. She leaves and reappears with the manager a few moments later, and I proceed to tell him that we had gotten *excellent* service that night, and that (her name) was one of their best. He thanked me for the feedback and she also looked very happy at the compliment and thanked me.\n\nThe only one not happy was my date. She said, \"If that was supposed to impress me, it didn't.\" and said that I was full of myself. She didn't say much else as we gathered our things to leave and there was no kiss at the door that night. I texted her saying I was sorry for whatever I did wrong and that I'd like to see her again soon, so far no response.\n\nSo pardon my french, but what the fuck?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for complimenting the waitress to her manager, which led to their date being upset. \n\nFirst, the situation: the author went on a date, had good service, and wanted to commend the waitress. They asked to speak to the manager, which initially made the waitress think there was a problem, but the author ended up giving a positive review. The date, however, felt that this was an attempt to impress her and found it arrogant.\n\nSo, the main points to consider are whether the author's actions were inappropriate. Complimenting service staff is generally seen as a good thing. However, the way it was done might have been a factor. The author went through the manager, which is a standard way to give feedback, positive or negative. The waitress was happy with the compliment, so the action itself wasn't wrong. \n\nBut why did the date react negatively? The user's date might have felt that the author was trying to show off or be overly helpful in a way that was unnecessary. Maybe she wanted the focus to be on their relationship rather than the service. It's possible that the date interpreted the action as the author prioritizing acknowledging the waitress over their experience together. \n\nHowever, the author didn't do anything wrong in terms of the waitress's service. It's a common and appreciated practice to give positive feedback through management. The date's reaction is more about personal feelings and expectations rather than the author's actions being objectively wrong. \n\nThe key here is whether the author had a valid reason to give the compliment and if the method was appropriate. Since the service was good, and the standard procedure was followed, the author isn't in the wrong. The date's dissatisfaction stems from her own interpretation, not the author's fault. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
