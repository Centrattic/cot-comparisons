I got called an asshole for it, so now I have come here out of curiosity for you fine people to help settle the disagreement.\n\nI met a girl online and we clicked, and have gone on a couple dates. Two nights ago was our third date and I was treating her to dinner at a local burger place in the city. Nothing fancy, I just wanted some good conversation over a tasty meal. This girl is a knockout, has the rare quality of being a great listener, and isn't obsessed with herself. She's funny, charming, and smart. We had had several great dates and I was getting close to asking her to be my girlfriend. She is also the one who called me an asshole before the night was done (not her exact words, but we'll get there.)\n\nOur waitress for dinner was great. Actually enthusiastic and friendly, on point with the refills, and just top notch service all around. At one point in the evening she did spill a partially-full glass of water on our table, but it wasn't really her fault because she had gotten bumped into, and she was very quick to apologize and wipe the table dry with a smile on her face, so if anything that was a point in her column.\n\nAt the end of the meal, she brought the check and I told her I would like to speak with her manager. She asked if there was something wrong, and I calmly repeated that I would like to speak with her manager and could she please go get him. She leaves and reappears with the manager a few moments later, and I proceed to tell him that we had gotten *excellent* service that night, and that (her name) was one of their best. He thanked me for the feedback and she also looked very happy at the compliment and thanked me.\n\nThe only one not happy was my date. She said, \"If that was supposed to impress me, it didn't.\" and said that I was full of myself. She didn't say much else as we gathered our things to leave and there was no kiss at the door that night. I texted her saying I was sorry for whatever I did wrong and that I'd like to see her again soon, so far no response.\n\nSo pardon my french, but what the fuck?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for complimenting the waitress to her manager. The situation is that the author went on a date, the waitress did a good job, and the author told the manager. The date was upset about it.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the dynamics here. The author wanted to praise the waitress, which is a positive action. But the date was annoyed. Why would that be? Maybe because the date felt the author was too focused on the waitress, or maybe she felt it was unnecessary. Or perhaps she was jealous? The waitress spilled a glass earlier, but the author didn't mention that to the manager. The author saw the spill but still gave a positive review, which is fair because the waitress handled it well.\n\nThe key points: The compliment was genuine and appropriate. The author approached the manager correctly, didn't exaggerate. The waitress appreciated it. The problem was the date's reaction. The date called the author an asshole, but the author's action was positive. So the author isn't wrong. The date's reaction seems unreasonable. \n\nPossible angles: Maybe the date felt ignored, or the author's gesture was too public. But the author's intent was to commend good service, which is right. There's no evidence the author did anything inappropriate. So answer B.\n"
