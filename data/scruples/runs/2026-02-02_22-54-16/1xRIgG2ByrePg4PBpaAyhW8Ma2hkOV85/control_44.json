I got called an asshole for it, so now I have come here out of curiosity for you fine people to help settle the disagreement.\n\nI met a girl online and we clicked, and have gone on a couple dates. Two nights ago was our third date and I was treating her to dinner at a local burger place in the city. Nothing fancy, I just wanted some good conversation over a tasty meal. This girl is a knockout, has the rare quality of being a great listener, and isn't obsessed with herself. She's funny, charming, and smart. We had had several great dates and I was getting close to asking her to be my girlfriend. She is also the one who called me an asshole before the night was done (not her exact words, but we'll get there.)\n\nOur waitress for dinner was great. Actually enthusiastic and friendly, on point with the refills, and just top notch service all around. At one point in the evening she did spill a partially-full glass of water on our table, but it wasn't really her fault because she had gotten bumped into, and she was very quick to apologize and wipe the table dry with a smile on her face, so if anything that was a point in her column.\n\nAt the end of the meal, she brought the check and I told her I would like to speak with her manager. She asked if there was something wrong, and I calmly repeated that I would like to speak with her manager and could she please go get him. She leaves and reappears with the manager a few moments later, and I proceed to tell him that we had gotten *excellent* service that night, and that (her name) was one of their best. He thanked me for the feedback and she also looked very happy at the compliment and thanked me.\n\nThe only one not happy was my date. She said, \"If that was supposed to impress me, it didn't.\" and said that I was full of myself. She didn't say much else as we gathered our things to leave and there was no kiss at the door that night. I texted her saying I was sorry for whatever I did wrong and that I'd like to see her again soon, so far no response.\n\nSo pardon my french, but what the fuck?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author went on a date with a girl, and they had a good time. The waitress was doing a good job, even when she spilled water but handled it well. The author then tells the manager that the waitress did a great job. The date was upset by this and called the author an asshole.\n\nHmm. The author is confused because they thought complimenting the waitress was a good thing. But the date was offended. Why would that be? Maybe the date felt that the author was being too focused on praising the waitress in front of the manager, which might have made her feel ignored or not the center of attention. Or maybe she perceived it as the author being condescending or trying to show off by complimenting the waitress instead of focusing on the date.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author did something wrong. On one hand, complimenting the waitress is a kind and positive action. It's a good practice to acknowledge good service. But in the context of a date, maybe the author should have considered their date's feelings. The date might have felt that the author prioritized giving a compliment to a stranger over their own partner, which could be hurtful. \n\nIs there a cultural or social norm that suggests you shouldn't compliment service staff in front of them during a date? Not that I know of. But in relationships, sometimes actions are about the other person's feelings. If the date felt slighted, then maybe the author should have been more mindful. However, the author's intention was positive. They weren't trying to be rude to the date, but perhaps they didn't realize how it would be received.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the intention was good, but the result was hurtful, does that make the author at fault? Or is it the date's overreaction? The author did ask for feedback on whether they were in the wrong, so maybe the community would weigh in on whether this action was inappropriate in a dating context.\n\nI think the answer depends on whether the action was inherently wrong or if it's about the date's sensitivity. Since the author's action was positive but led to the date feeling upset, maybe the author isn't in the wrong, but could have handled it differently. However, the question is whether the author is \"in the wrong,\" which often implies a moral or social misstep. If the date felt ignored, maybe the author should have considered that. But complimenting someone else isn't inherently wrong. So perhaps the answer is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong, because the action was good, even if it had unintended consequences.\n"
