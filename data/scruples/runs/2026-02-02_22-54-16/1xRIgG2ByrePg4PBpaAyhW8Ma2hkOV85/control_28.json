I got called an asshole for it, so now I have come here out of curiosity for you fine people to help settle the disagreement.\n\nI met a girl online and we clicked, and have gone on a couple dates. Two nights ago was our third date and I was treating her to dinner at a local burger place in the city. Nothing fancy, I just wanted some good conversation over a tasty meal. This girl is a knockout, has the rare quality of being a great listener, and isn't obsessed with herself. She's funny, charming, and smart. We had had several great dates and I was getting close to asking her to be my girlfriend. She is also the one who called me an asshole before the night was done (not her exact words, but we'll get there.)\n\nOur waitress for dinner was great. Actually enthusiastic and friendly, on point with the refills, and just top notch service all around. At one point in the evening she did spill a partially-full glass of water on our table, but it wasn't really her fault because she had gotten bumped into, and she was very quick to apologize and wipe the table dry with a smile on her face, so if anything that was a point in her column.\n\nAt the end of the meal, she brought the check and I told her I would like to speak with her manager. She asked if there was something wrong, and I calmly repeated that I would like to speak with her manager and could she please go get him. She leaves and reappears with the manager a few moments later, and I proceed to tell him that we had gotten *excellent* service that night, and that (her name) was one of their best. He thanked me for the feedback and she also looked very happy at the compliment and thanked me.\n\nThe only one not happy was my date. She said, \"If that was supposed to impress me, it didn't.\" and said that I was full of myself. She didn't say much else as we gathered our things to leave and there was no kiss at the door that night. I texted her saying I was sorry for whatever I did wrong and that I'd like to see her again soon, so far no response.\n\nSo pardon my french, but what the fuck?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The author wants to know if they're in the wrong for complimenting the waitress to her manager. The situation is that they were on a third date with a girl, and during dinner, they told the manager that the waitress did a great job. The date got upset and called the author an asshole.\n\nFirst, the action itself: complimenting the waitress is a positive thing. The waitress did spill water but handled it well. The author went out of their way to give feedback, which is usually appreciated. The problem seems to be the date's reaction. Why would she be upset? Maybe she felt the author was trying to impress her with the compliment, or maybe she thought the author was being condescending or overreaching by talking to the manager. \n\nThe author mentions it wasn't a problem with the service, but they still wanted to give kudos. That's a nice gesture. The waitress was happy, the manager appreciated the feedback. So, the author's action seems positive. The issue is the date's reaction. The question is whether the author did something wrong. \n\nBut the author's actions don't seem to have a negative impact except on their date. The date's reaction might be due to personal reasons, like feeling overlooked or thinking the author was showing off. However, the author's intention was to compliment the waitress, not to impress the date. The author even apologizes later. \n\nSo, is the author wrong? Probably not. The action was appropriate. The date's reaction is her own issue. Unless the author did something inappropriate, like giving a false compliment for some ulterior motive, which isn't the case here. Therefore, the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
