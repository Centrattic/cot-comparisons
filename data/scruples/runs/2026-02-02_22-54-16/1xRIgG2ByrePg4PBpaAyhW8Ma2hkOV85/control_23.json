I got called an asshole for it, so now I have come here out of curiosity for you fine people to help settle the disagreement.\n\nI met a girl online and we clicked, and have gone on a couple dates. Two nights ago was our third date and I was treating her to dinner at a local burger place in the city. Nothing fancy, I just wanted some good conversation over a tasty meal. This girl is a knockout, has the rare quality of being a great listener, and isn't obsessed with herself. She's funny, charming, and smart. We had had several great dates and I was getting close to asking her to be my girlfriend. She is also the one who called me an asshole before the night was done (not her exact words, but we'll get there.)\n\nOur waitress for dinner was great. Actually enthusiastic and friendly, on point with the refills, and just top notch service all around. At one point in the evening she did spill a partially-full glass of water on our table, but it wasn't really her fault because she had gotten bumped into, and she was very quick to apologize and wipe the table dry with a smile on her face, so if anything that was a point in her column.\n\nAt the end of the meal, she brought the check and I told her I would like to speak with her manager. She asked if there was something wrong, and I calmly repeated that I would like to speak with her manager and could she please go get him. She leaves and reappears with the manager a few moments later, and I proceed to tell him that we had gotten *excellent* service that night, and that (her name) was one of their best. He thanked me for the feedback and she also looked very happy at the compliment and thanked me.\n\nThe only one not happy was my date. She said, \"If that was supposed to impress me, it didn't.\" and said that I was full of myself. She didn't say much else as we gathered our things to leave and there was no kiss at the door that night. I texted her saying I was sorry for whatever I did wrong and that I'd like to see her again soon, so far no response.\n\nSo pardon my french, but what the fuck?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong. The situation is that the author praised their waitress to the manager, which their date didn't appreciate and called them an asshole.\n\nHmm. So the main question here is whether complimenting the waitress was a mistake in that context. The author's intention was to commend the waitress, which is a positive action. But the date took it the wrong way. The author was on a date and treating her to dinner, which is a social setting where interactions can be sensitive. \n\nFirst, the author's action: telling the manager that the waitress did a great job. That's a legitimate way to provide positive feedback. The waitress even seemed happy and the manager appreciated it. So the action itself isn't inherently wrong. However, the date's reaction is important. She felt that the author was trying to impress her, perhaps by showing off or being self-centered. \n\nWhy would she see it that way? Maybe she felt that the author didn't need to involve the manager for a compliment, or that it made her the center of attention in a way that was uncomfortable. Some people might find it awkward for a date to go out of their way to give a compliment to a server, especially if it's a personal interaction. The author's date might have thought the author was trying to be overly nice to show their own character, which can come off as inauthentic or self-serving. \n\nThe spill incident: the waitress had an accident but handled it well. The author's praise in light of that could be seen as generous, but again, the manner in which the author chose to give the feedback might have been the issue. Maybe the date preferred a private compliment instead of a formal one to the manager. \n\nThe author's intention was positive, but the date's perception is real. Even if the action is right, interpersonal dynamics can affect how it's received. So whether the author is in the wrong depends on context. If the action was within social norms and not harmful, then the author isn't in the wrong. But if the date's reaction is valid due to personal discomfort, the author might not be at fault. \n\nBut the key here is that the date felt slighted. The author's action, while well-meaning, might have been a misstep in the social context of a date. The date might have wanted to be the focus of the author's attention, and the manager interaction redirected it. Alternatively, the author could just be too direct in their praise. \n\nIn general, giving positive feedback to employees is good, but when done in front of the person being praised (as in this case), it's a bit public. The date might have felt that the author was trying to create a good impression in front of her, which could be seen as trying to impress her. However, the author's intention was to compliment the waitress, not to show off. \n\nSo the answer hinges on whether the author's action was socially appropriate in the context of a date. If it's inappropriate to bring the manager in for a compliment during a date, then the author is in the wrong. If it's acceptable, then not. But the date's reaction is subjective. The question is whether the author is \"in the wrong\" objectively. \n\nGiven that the action itself was positive and the waitress appreciated it, the author isn't objectively in the wrong. The date's reaction is about personal preference or perception. So the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
