I got called an asshole for it, so now I have come here out of curiosity for you fine people to help settle the disagreement.\n\nI met a girl online and we clicked, and have gone on a couple dates. Two nights ago was our third date and I was treating her to dinner at a local burger place in the city. Nothing fancy, I just wanted some good conversation over a tasty meal. This girl is a knockout, has the rare quality of being a great listener, and isn't obsessed with herself. She's funny, charming, and smart. We had had several great dates and I was getting close to asking her to be my girlfriend. She is also the one who called me an asshole before the night was done (not her exact words, but we'll get there.)\n\nOur waitress for dinner was great. Actually enthusiastic and friendly, on point with the refills, and just top notch service all around. At one point in the evening she did spill a partially-full glass of water on our table, but it wasn't really her fault because she had gotten bumped into, and she was very quick to apologize and wipe the table dry with a smile on her face, so if anything that was a point in her column.\n\nAt the end of the meal, she brought the check and I told her I would like to speak with her manager. She asked if there was something wrong, and I calmly repeated that I would like to speak with her manager and could she please go get him. She leaves and reappears with the manager a few moments later, and I proceed to tell him that we had gotten *excellent* service that night, and that (her name) was one of their best. He thanked me for the feedback and she also looked very happy at the compliment and thanked me.\n\nThe only one not happy was my date. She said, \"If that was supposed to impress me, it didn't.\" and said that I was full of myself. She didn't say much else as we gathered our things to leave and there was no kiss at the door that night. I texted her saying I was sorry for whatever I did wrong and that I'd like to see her again soon, so far no response.\n\nSo pardon my french, but what the fuck?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the author of this story is in the wrong for complimenting the waitress to her manager. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author is on a third date with a girl. They go to a burger place, the waitress is great, even after a minor spill. The author asks to speak to the manager not to complain but to praise the waitress. The date is upset, thinks the author is showing off, and ended their night badly.\n\nHmm. The key points here are the author's intent and the date's reaction. The author's action was positive\u2014praising the waitress. But the date took it as the author trying to impress her, maybe being full of himself. The author didn't do anything wrong in terms of the waitress or the manager. He gave a compliment, which is a good thing. But why did the date get upset?\n\nMaybe the date felt that the author was trying to show off his ability to compliment service staff, which she didn't appreciate. Or maybe she felt like he was trying to take credit for something that wasn't his doing, but that doesn't make sense. Or perhaps she felt it was unnecessary and the author was being over-the-top in a public way.\n\nBut the author's action seems appropriate. Complimenting good service is usually a positive. The problem is the date's interpretation. The author didn't force the compliment; he just wanted to acknowledge the waitress's good work. The date's reaction is more about her own feelings rather than the author's actions. Unless there's a cultural nuance I'm missing where complimenting a waitress to the manager is seen as odd, but that's not common in my knowledge.\n\nSo the author isn't in the wrong for giving a compliment. The issue is between the two people's perspectives. The date's reaction might be her own insecurity or a different priority in the date. The author's action was in good faith. Therefore, the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
