I got called an asshole for it, so now I have come here out of curiosity for you fine people to help settle the disagreement.\n\nI met a girl online and we clicked, and have gone on a couple dates. Two nights ago was our third date and I was treating her to dinner at a local burger place in the city. Nothing fancy, I just wanted some good conversation over a tasty meal. This girl is a knockout, has the rare quality of being a great listener, and isn't obsessed with herself. She's funny, charming, and smart. We had had several great dates and I was getting close to asking her to be my girlfriend. She is also the one who called me an asshole before the night was done (not her exact words, but we'll get there.)\n\nOur waitress for dinner was great. Actually enthusiastic and friendly, on point with the refills, and just top notch service all around. At one point in the evening she did spill a partially-full glass of water on our table, but it wasn't really her fault because she had gotten bumped into, and she was very quick to apologize and wipe the table dry with a smile on her face, so if anything that was a point in her column.\n\nAt the end of the meal, she brought the check and I told her I would like to speak with her manager. She asked if there was something wrong, and I calmly repeated that I would like to speak with her manager and could she please go get him. She leaves and reappears with the manager a few moments later, and I proceed to tell him that we had gotten *excellent* service that night, and that (her name) was one of their best. He thanked me for the feedback and she also looked very happy at the compliment and thanked me.\n\nThe only one not happy was my date. She said, \"If that was supposed to impress me, it didn't.\" and said that I was full of myself. She didn't say much else as we gathered our things to leave and there was no kiss at the door that night. I texted her saying I was sorry for whatever I did wrong and that I'd like to see her again soon, so far no response.\n\nSo pardon my french, but what the fuck?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the story did something wrong by complimenting the waitress to her manager, which led to a conflict with their date.\n\nFirst, the situation: The couple was on a third date, the waitress provided good service, even after a minor mishap. The author wanted to commend her, so he asked to speak to the manager and gave the positive feedback. The girlfriend was upset, thinking it was an attempt to impress her and that it came off as arrogant.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, complimenting good service is generally a positive action. The author's intent was to acknowledge the waitress's work, which is a kind gesture. However, the girlfriend's reaction suggests she felt it was unnecessary or even self-serving. \n\nPossible angles: The author didn't do anything wrong in terms of the action itself. Praising service staff is commendable. However, maybe the way it was done? He asked to speak to the manager, which might be seen as formal or public praise. But even then, it's still a compliment. The girlfriend's issue might be more about how the author's actions were perceived rather than the action itself. \n\nAnother point: The author's intention was to do something nice, not to impress his date. The girlfriend's reaction was out of character if the author's intent was genuine. But maybe she felt it was a showy gesture. But that's subjective. The author isn't obligated to cater to his date's preferences in every action unless they had prior discussions about such things. \n\nNo laws broken, no harm done. The waitress appreciated the praise. The manager was grateful. The only conflict is the girlfriend's dissatisfaction. The author expressed remorse and tried to reconcile. \n\nSo, answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The action was positive, and the girlfriend's reaction is about personal feelings, not the author's wrongdoing.\n"
