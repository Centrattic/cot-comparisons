I got called an asshole for it, so now I have come here out of curiosity for you fine people to help settle the disagreement.\n\nI met a girl online and we clicked, and have gone on a couple dates. Two nights ago was our third date and I was treating her to dinner at a local burger place in the city. Nothing fancy, I just wanted some good conversation over a tasty meal. This girl is a knockout, has the rare quality of being a great listener, and isn't obsessed with herself. She's funny, charming, and smart. We had had several great dates and I was getting close to asking her to be my girlfriend. She is also the one who called me an asshole before the night was done (not her exact words, but we'll get there.)\n\nOur waitress for dinner was great. Actually enthusiastic and friendly, on point with the refills, and just top notch service all around. At one point in the evening she did spill a partially-full glass of water on our table, but it wasn't really her fault because she had gotten bumped into, and she was very quick to apologize and wipe the table dry with a smile on her face, so if anything that was a point in her column.\n\nAt the end of the meal, she brought the check and I told her I would like to speak with her manager. She asked if there was something wrong, and I calmly repeated that I would like to speak with her manager and could she please go get him. She leaves and reappears with the manager a few moments later, and I proceed to tell him that we had gotten *excellent* service that night, and that (her name) was one of their best. He thanked me for the feedback and she also looked very happy at the compliment and thanked me.\n\nThe only one not happy was my date. She said, \"If that was supposed to impress me, it didn't.\" and said that I was full of myself. She didn't say much else as we gathered our things to leave and there was no kiss at the door that night. I texted her saying I was sorry for whatever I did wrong and that I'd like to see her again soon, so far no response.\n\nSo pardon my french, but what the fuck?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that he told the waitress's manager she did a great job, and his date got upset, calling him an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's action was trying to compliment the waitress through her manager. He mentions the waitress was excellent, even after a minor spill. So, he wanted to recognize her good service. That seems like a positive action, right? Praise can be important for employees, especially if it's genuine. He didn't do anything wrong in terms of the waitress's job; he's just giving her a compliment.\n\nBut then, his date was unhappy. Why would she be upset? Maybe she felt he was trying to impress her by showing off, or perhaps she thought he was overstepping by going to the manager. Some people might find it unnecessary or even awkward to get the manager involved for a compliment. The author said he did it to commend her, but the date interpreted it as the author trying to be self-important. The date's reaction was a bit strong, but maybe she felt uncomfortable with the public recognition, or maybe she was insecure about the author's focus on the waitress instead of her.\n\nThe author's intent was positive, but the date's reaction might stem from personal insecurities or different social norms. The author didn't do anything wrong in terms of the waitress's treatment. The issue is between him and his date. The author apologized, so maybe the problem is on the date's side. But the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. Since his action was well-intentioned and appropriate, the answer would be B, he's not in the wrong. The date's reaction was her own issue, not his fault.\n"
