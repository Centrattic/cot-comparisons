I got called an asshole for it, so now I have come here out of curiosity for you fine people to help settle the disagreement.\n\nI met a girl online and we clicked, and have gone on a couple dates. Two nights ago was our third date and I was treating her to dinner at a local burger place in the city. Nothing fancy, I just wanted some good conversation over a tasty meal. This girl is a knockout, has the rare quality of being a great listener, and isn't obsessed with herself. She's funny, charming, and smart. We had had several great dates and I was getting close to asking her to be my girlfriend. She is also the one who called me an asshole before the night was done (not her exact words, but we'll get there.)\n\nOur waitress for dinner was great. Actually enthusiastic and friendly, on point with the refills, and just top notch service all around. At one point in the evening she did spill a partially-full glass of water on our table, but it wasn't really her fault because she had gotten bumped into, and she was very quick to apologize and wipe the table dry with a smile on her face, so if anything that was a point in her column.\n\nAt the end of the meal, she brought the check and I told her I would like to speak with her manager. She asked if there was something wrong, and I calmly repeated that I would like to speak with her manager and could she please go get him. She leaves and reappears with the manager a few moments later, and I proceed to tell him that we had gotten *excellent* service that night, and that (her name) was one of their best. He thanked me for the feedback and she also looked very happy at the compliment and thanked me.\n\nThe only one not happy was my date. She said, \"If that was supposed to impress me, it didn't.\" and said that I was full of myself. She didn't say much else as we gathered our things to leave and there was no kiss at the door that night. I texted her saying I was sorry for whatever I did wrong and that I'd like to see her again soon, so far no response.\n\nSo pardon my french, but what the fuck?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author did something wrong by complimenting the waitress to her manager, leading to his date being upset.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author and his date went to dinner, had good service, the waitress was friendly despite spilling a glass accidentally. The author then told the manager the waitress did a great job. The date was not happy about it, called him an asshole, and they didn't kiss goodbye. The author is confused and seeking advice.\n\nSo, why would the date be upset? Maybe she felt the compliment was unnecessary or inappropriately directed? Or perhaps she thought the author was trying to impress the waitress instead of her. Alternatively, maybe she found it awkward or felt it was a waste of time to do that in front of the waitress and manager.\n\nBut the author's intention was to commend the waitress's service, which is a positive action. The waitress was happy, the manager appreciated the feedback. The problem seems to be between the author and his date. The author didn't do anything wrong in terms of the waitress; the issue is the date's reaction. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the author's action was a compliment, which is generally good, but it led to conflict with his date. However, the date's reaction is subjective. The author didn't violate any social rules by giving a compliment. Maybe the date had different expectations for the date night, like maybe she wanted more focus on her instead of the waitress. But that's more about their relationship dynamics than the author being in the wrong. \n\nSo the answer would be that the author isn't in the wrong. The problem lies in the date's interpretation and their personal relationship context, not the act of giving a compliment. Hence, answer B.\n"
