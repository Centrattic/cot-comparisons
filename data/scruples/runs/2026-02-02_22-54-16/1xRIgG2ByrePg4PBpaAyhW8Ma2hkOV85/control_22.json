I got called an asshole for it, so now I have come here out of curiosity for you fine people to help settle the disagreement.\n\nI met a girl online and we clicked, and have gone on a couple dates. Two nights ago was our third date and I was treating her to dinner at a local burger place in the city. Nothing fancy, I just wanted some good conversation over a tasty meal. This girl is a knockout, has the rare quality of being a great listener, and isn't obsessed with herself. She's funny, charming, and smart. We had had several great dates and I was getting close to asking her to be my girlfriend. She is also the one who called me an asshole before the night was done (not her exact words, but we'll get there.)\n\nOur waitress for dinner was great. Actually enthusiastic and friendly, on point with the refills, and just top notch service all around. At one point in the evening she did spill a partially-full glass of water on our table, but it wasn't really her fault because she had gotten bumped into, and she was very quick to apologize and wipe the table dry with a smile on her face, so if anything that was a point in her column.\n\nAt the end of the meal, she brought the check and I told her I would like to speak with her manager. She asked if there was something wrong, and I calmly repeated that I would like to speak with her manager and could she please go get him. She leaves and reappears with the manager a few moments later, and I proceed to tell him that we had gotten *excellent* service that night, and that (her name) was one of their best. He thanked me for the feedback and she also looked very happy at the compliment and thanked me.\n\nThe only one not happy was my date. She said, \"If that was supposed to impress me, it didn't.\" and said that I was full of myself. She didn't say much else as we gathered our things to leave and there was no kiss at the door that night. I texted her saying I was sorry for whatever I did wrong and that I'd like to see her again soon, so far no response.\n\nSo pardon my french, but what the fuck?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author went on a date with a girl, and they had a good time. The waitress was really good, except for a small spill that wasn't her fault. The author wanted to compliment her, so he asked to speak to the manager and gave the waitress a positive review. The date didn't like that, thought he was full of himself, and now they're not talking.\n\nHmm, why would the date be upset? Maybe she felt that the author was trying to impress her by complimenting the waitress, but that's a bit odd. Normally, complimenting someone's service is a good thing. Maybe she thought he was being insincere or trying to show off. But the author's intention was genuine\u2014he just wanted to recognize good service. \n\nWait, sometimes people might feel that bringing up the manager for a compliment is unnecessary, but it's still positive. The waitress was happy, and the manager appreciated the feedback. The author didn't do anything wrong in terms of the waitress's job. \n\nThe girl's reaction seems a bit harsh. If she didn't like the gesture, maybe there's something else going on. Maybe she felt he was too focused on complimenting the waitress instead of her? But the author was on a date with her, so maybe she wanted more attention. However, the author's action was about the service, not a comparison. \n\nIs there a cultural norm where complimenting staff during a date is frowned upon? Not that I know of. Usually, it's a nice gesture. Unless there's some personal issue, but the story doesn't mention that. The author's actions were appropriate. The girl's reaction is more about her own feelings rather than the author's wrongdoing. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. He did something kind and positive. The girl's upset is more about her own perspective or other issues between them. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
