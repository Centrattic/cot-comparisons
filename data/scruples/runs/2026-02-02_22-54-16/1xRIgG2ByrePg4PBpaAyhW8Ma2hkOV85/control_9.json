I got called an asshole for it, so now I have come here out of curiosity for you fine people to help settle the disagreement.\n\nI met a girl online and we clicked, and have gone on a couple dates. Two nights ago was our third date and I was treating her to dinner at a local burger place in the city. Nothing fancy, I just wanted some good conversation over a tasty meal. This girl is a knockout, has the rare quality of being a great listener, and isn't obsessed with herself. She's funny, charming, and smart. We had had several great dates and I was getting close to asking her to be my girlfriend. She is also the one who called me an asshole before the night was done (not her exact words, but we'll get there.)\n\nOur waitress for dinner was great. Actually enthusiastic and friendly, on point with the refills, and just top notch service all around. At one point in the evening she did spill a partially-full glass of water on our table, but it wasn't really her fault because she had gotten bumped into, and she was very quick to apologize and wipe the table dry with a smile on her face, so if anything that was a point in her column.\n\nAt the end of the meal, she brought the check and I told her I would like to speak with her manager. She asked if there was something wrong, and I calmly repeated that I would like to speak with her manager and could she please go get him. She leaves and reappears with the manager a few moments later, and I proceed to tell him that we had gotten *excellent* service that night, and that (her name) was one of their best. He thanked me for the feedback and she also looked very happy at the compliment and thanked me.\n\nThe only one not happy was my date. She said, \"If that was supposed to impress me, it didn't.\" and said that I was full of myself. She didn't say much else as we gathered our things to leave and there was no kiss at the door that night. I texted her saying I was sorry for whatever I did wrong and that I'd like to see her again soon, so far no response.\n\nSo pardon my french, but what the fuck?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for telling the manager his waitress did a great job, which led to his date being upset.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author went on a date, the waitress provided good service, even after a minor spill. The author went to the manager to compliment her. The date got upset, called him an asshole, and there's no response after he apologized.\n\nSo, the main question here is whether the author did something wrong by complimenting the waitress. The date was not happy with this action. The author is seeking validation.\n\nPossible angles: The author's intention was positive\u2014he wanted to acknowledge good service. But the date felt it was unnecessary or maybe even inappropriate. Was the compliment about the waitress an issue in the context of their date? \n\nIn some cases, people might feel that giving a compliment to a server during a date could be seen as inappropriate or even flirtatious, depending on the context. However, the waitress was already their server, so the compliment was about service, not personal. But maybe the date felt uncomfortable, thinking the author was trying to impress her by being overly nice, or perhaps she thought he was trying to one-up her or show off.\n\nHowever, from the author's perspective, complimenting the server is a standard practice and a kind gesture. It's common to give positive feedback to service workers, and the author did it in a way that was professional (talking to the manager) rather than directly to the waitress, which might have been more awkward.\n\nThe waitress seemed appreciative, and the manager thanked him. The problem was entirely with the date's reaction. The author didn't do anything wrong in terms of the service compliment, but he might have misread the date's preferences. However, the date's reaction seems a bit harsh.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, he didn't do anything unethical or inappropriate in terms of the service. He followed proper channels (manager) and gave a genuine compliment. The date's issue is more about her own feelings rather than the action itself. So the author isn't in the wrong; the issue is the date's discomfort or misinterpretation of the gesture.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
