I got called an asshole for it, so now I have come here out of curiosity for you fine people to help settle the disagreement.\n\nI met a girl online and we clicked, and have gone on a couple dates. Two nights ago was our third date and I was treating her to dinner at a local burger place in the city. Nothing fancy, I just wanted some good conversation over a tasty meal. This girl is a knockout, has the rare quality of being a great listener, and isn't obsessed with herself. She's funny, charming, and smart. We had had several great dates and I was getting close to asking her to be my girlfriend. She is also the one who called me an asshole before the night was done (not her exact words, but we'll get there.)\n\nOur waitress for dinner was great. Actually enthusiastic and friendly, on point with the refills, and just top notch service all around. At one point in the evening she did spill a partially-full glass of water on our table, but it wasn't really her fault because she had gotten bumped into, and she was very quick to apologize and wipe the table dry with a smile on her face, so if anything that was a point in her column.\n\nAt the end of the meal, she brought the check and I told her I would like to speak with her manager. She asked if there was something wrong, and I calmly repeated that I would like to speak with her manager and could she please go get him. She leaves and reappears with the manager a few moments later, and I proceed to tell him that we had gotten *excellent* service that night, and that (her name) was one of their best. He thanked me for the feedback and she also looked very happy at the compliment and thanked me.\n\nThe only one not happy was my date. She said, \"If that was supposed to impress me, it didn't.\" and said that I was full of myself. She didn't say much else as we gathered our things to leave and there was no kiss at the door that night. I texted her saying I was sorry for whatever I did wrong and that I'd like to see her again soon, so far no response.\n\nSo pardon my french, but what the fuck?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author told the waitress's manager she did a great job, and their date was upset about that. The date called the author an asshole and now there's no response from her.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author's actions were to compliment the waitress by bringing it up to the manager. That's a positive thing, right? People often appreciate when their work is recognized. The waitress was friendly and handled a spill well. The author wanted to acknowledge her good service, which seems like a kind gesture. So why did the date take it the wrong way?\n\nThe date's reaction is a bit confusing. Maybe she felt that the author was trying to impress her by being generous, but in a way that came off as self-centered. Like, maybe she thought he was trying to show off his own generosity instead of focusing on the date. Or perhaps she was uncomfortable with the situation\u2014getting the manager involved, even for a compliment, might have felt like an unnecessary formality. \n\nAnother angle: some people might perceive complimenting a server during a date as a way to avoid paying attention to their date, or as a sign that the author is more focused on external validation. But in this case, the author did it after the meal, so maybe it was a genuine gesture. However, the date might have felt that the author was trying to impress her through the waitress, which could be seen as trying to manipulate her through third parties. \n\nBut the waitress was genuinely good, and the author was just giving her due credit. The manager appreciated the feedback, and the waitress was happy. The action itself seems positive. The problem is how the date interpreted it. The key here is the intention versus the perception. The author's intention was to commend the waitress, but the date might have perceived it as the author trying to one-up their interaction. \n\nAlso, the fact that the author texted to apologize and there's no response complicates things. The date's reaction was immediate, and now she's not responding, which suggests she's hurt or upset. But whether the author is in the wrong depends on whether the action was objectively wrong or if it's a miscommunication. \n\nIn relationships, it's not always about right and wrong but about how each person perceives things. The author might not be wrong in a moral sense, but if the action caused discomfort in the date, then maybe he should have foreseen that. However, complimenting a server is a normal and positive thing. The date's reaction might be more about her own insecurities or how she felt about the date's dynamics rather than the action itself. \n\nSo, the author's action was positive, but it caused a negative reaction. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong because the act itself was good. It's more about the communication between them. But maybe the author could have handled it differently, like giving the compliment privately instead of through the manager, but that's speculative. The main point is whether he's at fault. I think the answer is B (not in the wrong) because the action wasn't inherently wrong; the conflict arose from the date's interpretation.\n"
