I got called an asshole for it, so now I have come here out of curiosity for you fine people to help settle the disagreement.\n\nI met a girl online and we clicked, and have gone on a couple dates. Two nights ago was our third date and I was treating her to dinner at a local burger place in the city. Nothing fancy, I just wanted some good conversation over a tasty meal. This girl is a knockout, has the rare quality of being a great listener, and isn't obsessed with herself. She's funny, charming, and smart. We had had several great dates and I was getting close to asking her to be my girlfriend. She is also the one who called me an asshole before the night was done (not her exact words, but we'll get there.)\n\nOur waitress for dinner was great. Actually enthusiastic and friendly, on point with the refills, and just top notch service all around. At one point in the evening she did spill a partially-full glass of water on our table, but it wasn't really her fault because she had gotten bumped into, and she was very quick to apologize and wipe the table dry with a smile on her face, so if anything that was a point in her column.\n\nAt the end of the meal, she brought the check and I told her I would like to speak with her manager. She asked if there was something wrong, and I calmly repeated that I would like to speak with her manager and could she please go get him. She leaves and reappears with the manager a few moments later, and I proceed to tell him that we had gotten *excellent* service that night, and that (her name) was one of their best. He thanked me for the feedback and she also looked very happy at the compliment and thanked me.\n\nThe only one not happy was my date. She said, \"If that was supposed to impress me, it didn't.\" and said that I was full of myself. She didn't say much else as we gathered our things to leave and there was no kiss at the door that night. I texted her saying I was sorry for whatever I did wrong and that I'd like to see her again soon, so far no response.\n\nSo pardon my french, but what the fuck?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about complimenting a waitress by telling her manager, which led to his date being upset.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The guy went on a third date with a girl he really likes. They had dinner, and the waitress provided excellent service. He wanted to compliment her, so he asked to speak to the manager and gave the waitress praise. The date was upset by this action, thinking he was trying to impress her and being full of himself. She called him an asshole and they didn't have a good ending to the night.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is at fault here. Let's break it down. Giving a compliment to a waitress seems like a positive action. The waitress handled a minor spill well, and the guy wanted to acknowledge her good service. That's a kind and considerate thing to do. However, the date took offense. Why?\n\nPossible reasons the date was upset: Maybe she felt that the guy was trying to show off or that he was being inconsiderate by making a big deal about the service. Alternatively, she might have felt that he was being overly formal or that the gesture was unnecessary and made her uncomfortable. Or maybe she felt he was trying to impress the waitress instead of focusing on their date.\n\nBut is the guy wrong for doing something that's generally positive? The act of giving a compliment is not inherently wrong. The context here is a date, where the guy's actions might have been misinterpreted. The date's reaction is subjective. The key point is whether the guy did something that's objectively wrong. \n\nThe waitress appreciated the compliment, and the manager was grateful for the feedback. The guy's intention was positive. However, maybe he should have considered his date's perspective. For example, if the date didn't care about the waitress's service and was more focused on their interaction, the guy's action might have been seen as unnecessary attention to the waitress. Alternatively, maybe he should have told the waitress directly instead of involving the manager, but even then, it's a valid way to give feedback.\n\nIs there a social norm that suggests you shouldn't publicly compliment a server in front of their manager when on a date? Not that I know of. People often give compliments to service staff, and doing so through the manager is a common practice. The date's reaction seems personal and possibly misdirected. \n\nSo, the author's actions were appropriate and kind. The problem lies with the date's interpretation and reaction. Therefore, the answer would be that the author is not in the wrong (B). But wait, some might argue that he should have been more considerate of his date's feelings. Maybe he should have discussed the compliment with her first. But given that the waitress's service was good and the compliment was genuine, it's hard to see how that's his fault. The date's reaction is her own issue. \n\nAnother angle: sometimes people on dates might feel insecure if their partner is overly praising others. However, that's more about the date's insecurities than the author's wrongdoing. The author didn't do anything to intentionally make her feel bad. \n\nSo, overall, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer is B.\n"
