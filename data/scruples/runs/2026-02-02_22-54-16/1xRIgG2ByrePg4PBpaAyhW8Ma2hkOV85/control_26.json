I got called an asshole for it, so now I have come here out of curiosity for you fine people to help settle the disagreement.\n\nI met a girl online and we clicked, and have gone on a couple dates. Two nights ago was our third date and I was treating her to dinner at a local burger place in the city. Nothing fancy, I just wanted some good conversation over a tasty meal. This girl is a knockout, has the rare quality of being a great listener, and isn't obsessed with herself. She's funny, charming, and smart. We had had several great dates and I was getting close to asking her to be my girlfriend. She is also the one who called me an asshole before the night was done (not her exact words, but we'll get there.)\n\nOur waitress for dinner was great. Actually enthusiastic and friendly, on point with the refills, and just top notch service all around. At one point in the evening she did spill a partially-full glass of water on our table, but it wasn't really her fault because she had gotten bumped into, and she was very quick to apologize and wipe the table dry with a smile on her face, so if anything that was a point in her column.\n\nAt the end of the meal, she brought the check and I told her I would like to speak with her manager. She asked if there was something wrong, and I calmly repeated that I would like to speak with her manager and could she please go get him. She leaves and reappears with the manager a few moments later, and I proceed to tell him that we had gotten *excellent* service that night, and that (her name) was one of their best. He thanked me for the feedback and she also looked very happy at the compliment and thanked me.\n\nThe only one not happy was my date. She said, \"If that was supposed to impress me, it didn't.\" and said that I was full of myself. She didn't say much else as we gathered our things to leave and there was no kiss at the door that night. I texted her saying I was sorry for whatever I did wrong and that I'd like to see her again soon, so far no response.\n\nSo pardon my french, but what the fuck?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person in question is asking if they're in the wrong for complimenting their waitress to her manager, which upset their date. So, the main issue here is whether the action of giving a compliment was inappropriate in this context.\n\nFirst, the author went out with a girl they liked, and they had a good time. The waitress provided excellent service, even handling a spill gracefully. The author decided to commend her to the manager. The date, however, was upset and called the author an asshole. The question is whether the author did something wrong by doing this.\n\nFrom my understanding, complimenting someone's service is generally a positive action. It's a way to show appreciation for good work. The waitress would likely appreciate the feedback, and the manager might value it as well. So, at face value, the author's action seems positive.\n\nBut why did the date react negatively? The author mentions that the date felt it was an attempt to impress her. She might have perceived the action as the author trying to show off or gain favor in her eyes. If the compliment wasn't meant to impress, then the date's reaction could be a misinterpretation. However, the author's intention might not matter if the action led to the date feeling that way.\n\nAnother angle is that maybe the date was looking for a more personal gesture or felt that public recognition of the waitress was unnecessary in a romantic setting. But that's speculative. The key is whether the action itself was wrong, not the date's feelings.\n\nThe author didn't do anything harmful to the waitress. The action was a genuine compliment. Unless there's a cultural or personal context where such actions are taboo in relationships, which isn't indicated here, the author isn't in the wrong. The date's reaction is more about their personal feelings and possibly their own expectations.\n\nSo, the answer would hinge on whether the author's intention was to impress the date. If the author's goal was to be polite and commend the waitress, then they're not wrong. The date's dissatisfaction is more about her own perception than the action itself.\n"
