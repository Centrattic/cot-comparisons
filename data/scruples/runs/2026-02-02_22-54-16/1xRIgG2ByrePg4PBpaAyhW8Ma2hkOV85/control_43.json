I got called an asshole for it, so now I have come here out of curiosity for you fine people to help settle the disagreement.\n\nI met a girl online and we clicked, and have gone on a couple dates. Two nights ago was our third date and I was treating her to dinner at a local burger place in the city. Nothing fancy, I just wanted some good conversation over a tasty meal. This girl is a knockout, has the rare quality of being a great listener, and isn't obsessed with herself. She's funny, charming, and smart. We had had several great dates and I was getting close to asking her to be my girlfriend. She is also the one who called me an asshole before the night was done (not her exact words, but we'll get there.)\n\nOur waitress for dinner was great. Actually enthusiastic and friendly, on point with the refills, and just top notch service all around. At one point in the evening she did spill a partially-full glass of water on our table, but it wasn't really her fault because she had gotten bumped into, and she was very quick to apologize and wipe the table dry with a smile on her face, so if anything that was a point in her column.\n\nAt the end of the meal, she brought the check and I told her I would like to speak with her manager. She asked if there was something wrong, and I calmly repeated that I would like to speak with her manager and could she please go get him. She leaves and reappears with the manager a few moments later, and I proceed to tell him that we had gotten *excellent* service that night, and that (her name) was one of their best. He thanked me for the feedback and she also looked very happy at the compliment and thanked me.\n\nThe only one not happy was my date. She said, \"If that was supposed to impress me, it didn't.\" and said that I was full of myself. She didn't say much else as we gathered our things to leave and there was no kiss at the door that night. I texted her saying I was sorry for whatever I did wrong and that I'd like to see her again soon, so far no response.\n\nSo pardon my french, but what the fuck?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for complimenting their waitress's manager about her service. The context is that they did this during a date, and their date was upset about it.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author wanted to praise the waitress, which is a good thing. The waitress had good service, even though there was a small spill that wasn't her fault. The author went to the manager to commend her. The date took offense, saying it was supposed to impress her but didn't, and now they're in a conflict.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author was wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). The key here is to evaluate whether the action of the author was inappropriate in the context of their date. \n\nPossible angles: Did the author do something wrong by praising the waitress? Probably not inherently. But maybe the way they did it in front of the date caused the issue. The date might have felt that the author was trying to show off or being self-centered by focusing on complimenting the waitress instead of the date itself. \n\nHowever, praising someone's job is generally a positive action. The waitress appreciated it, the manager appreciated it. The problem seems to be the date's reaction. The author didn't do anything wrong in terms of the waitress's service. The date's reaction might stem from personal issues or insecurity. \n\nSo the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to compliment the waitress. But maybe the date was sensitive about being compared or felt neglected. However, the author's action was a genuine compliment. Therefore, the answer would be B (not in the wrong). \n\nI need to make sure there's no social faux pas here. Sometimes people do things on dates that others might take the wrong way. But in this case, the author did something positive. The date's reaction is more about their own feelings. So the author isn't wrong.\n"
