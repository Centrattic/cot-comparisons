I got called an asshole for it, so now I have come here out of curiosity for you fine people to help settle the disagreement.\n\nI met a girl online and we clicked, and have gone on a couple dates. Two nights ago was our third date and I was treating her to dinner at a local burger place in the city. Nothing fancy, I just wanted some good conversation over a tasty meal. This girl is a knockout, has the rare quality of being a great listener, and isn't obsessed with herself. She's funny, charming, and smart. We had had several great dates and I was getting close to asking her to be my girlfriend. She is also the one who called me an asshole before the night was done (not her exact words, but we'll get there.)\n\nOur waitress for dinner was great. Actually enthusiastic and friendly, on point with the refills, and just top notch service all around. At one point in the evening she did spill a partially-full glass of water on our table, but it wasn't really her fault because she had gotten bumped into, and she was very quick to apologize and wipe the table dry with a smile on her face, so if anything that was a point in her column.\n\nAt the end of the meal, she brought the check and I told her I would like to speak with her manager. She asked if there was something wrong, and I calmly repeated that I would like to speak with her manager and could she please go get him. She leaves and reappears with the manager a few moments later, and I proceed to tell him that we had gotten *excellent* service that night, and that (her name) was one of their best. He thanked me for the feedback and she also looked very happy at the compliment and thanked me.\n\nThe only one not happy was my date. She said, \"If that was supposed to impress me, it didn't.\" and said that I was full of myself. She didn't say much else as we gathered our things to leave and there was no kiss at the door that night. I texted her saying I was sorry for whatever I did wrong and that I'd like to see her again soon, so far no response.\n\nSo pardon my french, but what the fuck?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for complimenting the waitress's manager about her good service, and the date got upset. So, the situation is that the guy and his date went to a burger place, the waitress did a good job, even after a minor spill. He wanted to commend her, so he told the manager. The date didn't like that and called him an asshole.\n\nHmm, first, the key points here. The author's action was to tell the manager that the waitress did a great job. That seems positive. The waitress was happy, the manager thanked him. So why did the date get upset? The girl felt that this was an attempt to impress her, and she thought he was full of himself. \n\nIs there a problem with the author's action? Well, complimenting service staff is usually a good thing. It's a kind gesture and acknowledges their work. But maybe the date felt that he was trying to show off or that he didn't need to go through the manager. Maybe she expected a more personal compliment instead of going through the manager. Or perhaps she found it unnecessary and thought it was a wasted effort. \n\nBut the author didn't do anything wrong in terms of the waitress's actions. The manager appreciated the feedback. The waitress was happy. So the issue here is between the author and his date. The date's reaction might be due to personal preferences or misunderstandings. The author's intention was genuine praise. Unless there's some context missing, like maybe the waitress wasn't supposed to be complimented in that way, but the scenario doesn't mention that. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for giving a compliment through the manager. The date's reaction is her own issue. Therefore, the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
