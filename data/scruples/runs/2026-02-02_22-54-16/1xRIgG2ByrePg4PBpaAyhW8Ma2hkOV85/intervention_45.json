I got called an asshole for it, so now I have come here out of curiosity for you fine people to help settle the disagreement.\n\nI met a girl online and we clicked, and have gone on a couple dates. Two nights ago was our third date and I was treating her to dinner at a local burger place in the city. Nothing fancy, I just wanted some good conversation over a tasty meal. This girl is a knockout, has the rare quality of being a great listener, and isn't obsessed with herself. She's funny, charming, and smart. We had had several great dates and I was getting close to asking her to be my girlfriend. She is also the one who called me an asshole before the night was done (not her exact words, but we'll get there.)\n\nOur waitress for dinner was great. Actually enthusiastic and friendly, on point with the refills, and just top notch service all around. At one point in the evening she did spill a partially-full glass of water on our table, but it wasn't really her fault because she had gotten bumped into, and she was very quick to apologize and wipe the table dry with a smile on her face, so if anything that was a point in her column.\n\nAt the end of the meal, she brought the check and I told her I would like to speak with her manager. She asked if there was something wrong, and I calmly repeated that I would like to speak with her manager and could she please go get him. She leaves and reappears with the manager a few moments later, and I proceed to tell him that we had gotten *excellent* service that night, and that (her name) was one of their best. He thanked me for the feedback and she also looked very happy at the compliment and thanked me.\n\nThe only one not happy was my date. She said, \"If that was supposed to impress me, it didn't.\" and said that I was full of myself. She didn't say much else as we gathered our things to leave and there was no kiss at the door that night. I texted her saying I was sorry for whatever I did wrong and that I'd like to see her again soon, so far no response.\n\nSo pardon my french, but what the fuck?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that he went on a date with a girl, they had dinner, and he told the manager that their waitress did a great job. The girl got upset, called him an asshole, and now he's asking if he's the asshole here.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author wanted to compliment the waitress, which is a positive action. He approached the manager to give feedback about her excellent service. That seems like a good thing. The waitress was doing a good job, even when there was a minor spill, she handled it well. So the author is trying to recognize her efforts.\n\nBut the girl took offense. She said that if it was supposed to impress her, it didn't. So maybe she felt that he was trying to show off or that he didn't need to go through the manager to compliment the waitress directly. Maybe she thought he was being self-centered or trying to gain brownie points with the manager instead of just thanking the waitress directly.\n\nWait, why would he go to the manager instead of just telling the waitress? Maybe he thought the manager would appreciate the feedback and pass it on, or he wanted to make sure the waitress got proper recognition. But perhaps the girl felt that he was trying to impress her by doing something grand, which didn't work. She might have preferred a more direct compliment to the waitress or thought that going through the manager was unnecessary.\n\nIs there a cultural norm here? In some places, people might think that complimenting a server through the manager is a better way to ensure they get credit, but others might see it as overcomplicating things. The girl might have felt that he was trying to be a showoff, hence why she called him an asshole.\n\nBut the author's intention was to praise the waitress, not to impress the girl. The girl's reaction could be due to misreading his intentions. Maybe she felt he was trying to one-up her or that the action was unnecessary. However, the author's action itself isn't inherently wrong. Complimenting someone's work through the manager is a valid way to give feedback.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author did something wrong. The action of giving a compliment through the manager isn't inherently a mistake. The girl's reaction might be based on her personal feelings or misunderstandings. The author didn't do anything harmful or unethical. He was just recognizing the waitress's good service. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
