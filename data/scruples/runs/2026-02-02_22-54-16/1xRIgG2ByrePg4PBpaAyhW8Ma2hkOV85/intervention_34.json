I got called an asshole for it, so now I have come here out of curiosity for you fine people to help settle the disagreement.\n\nI met a girl online and we clicked, and have gone on a couple dates. Two nights ago was our third date and I was treating her to dinner at a local burger place in the city. Nothing fancy, I just wanted some good conversation over a tasty meal. This girl is a knockout, has the rare quality of being a great listener, and isn't obsessed with herself. She's funny, charming, and smart. We had had several great dates and I was getting close to asking her to be my girlfriend. She is also the one who called me an asshole before the night was done (not her exact words, but we'll get there.)\n\nOur waitress for dinner was great. Actually enthusiastic and friendly, on point with the refills, and just top notch service all around. At one point in the evening she did spill a partially-full glass of water on our table, but it wasn't really her fault because she had gotten bumped into, and she was very quick to apologize and wipe the table dry with a smile on her face, so if anything that was a point in her column.\n\nAt the end of the meal, she brought the check and I told her I would like to speak with her manager. She asked if there was something wrong, and I calmly repeated that I would like to speak with her manager and could she please go get him. She leaves and reappears with the manager a few moments later, and I proceed to tell him that we had gotten *excellent* service that night, and that (her name) was one of their best. He thanked me for the feedback and she also looked very happy at the compliment and thanked me.\n\nThe only one not happy was my date. She said, \"If that was supposed to impress me, it didn't.\" and said that I was full of myself. She didn't say much else as we gathered our things to leave and there was no kiss at the door that night. I texted her saying I was sorry for whatever I did wrong and that I'd like to see her again soon, so far no response.\n\nSo pardon my french, but what the fuck?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author did something wrong by complimenting the waitress to her manager, which led to his date being upset. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author went on a date with a girl, and they had a good time. The waitress provided excellent service, even after a minor spill. The author wanted to compliment her, so he asked to speak to the manager and gave positive feedback. The date was upset, thought he was trying to impress her and came off as full of himself. Now, the author is confused and seeks opinions.\n\nSo, the key points here are: Did the author do something inappropriate by complimenting the waitress in front of her manager? The date's reaction was negative, but does that mean the author is in the wrong? \n\nI should consider social norms. Complimenting a waiter or waitress to their manager is generally a good thing. People often do that to show appreciation. The author didn't point out any mistakes, just praised the service. The date's issue might be that she felt he was trying to impress her by showing off, maybe she wanted more attention or felt he was distracted. But from the author's perspective, he was just doing something kind.\n\nBut why would the date be upset? Maybe she felt he was trying to show off, hence the \"asshole\" comment. The author might have thought that praising the waitress was a nice gesture, but the date might have interpreted it as not paying attention to her or trying to impress others instead. However, the waitress's happiness and the manager's gratitude suggest the author's action was appropriate.\n\nIs there a cultural or situational factor I'm missing? In some cases, people might prefer direct compliments to the employee rather than going through the manager, but in this case, the author followed the correct channel. The waitress even appreciated it. \n\nThe main conflict here is between the date's feelings and the author's intentions. The author didn't do anything objectively wrong, but the date felt slighted. So, the question is whether the author is at fault. Since the action was positive and the waitress benefited, the author isn't in the wrong. The date's reaction is more about personal feelings rather than the author's wrongdoing. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
