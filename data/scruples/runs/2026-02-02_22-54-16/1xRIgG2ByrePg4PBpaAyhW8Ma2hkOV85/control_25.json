I got called an asshole for it, so now I have come here out of curiosity for you fine people to help settle the disagreement.\n\nI met a girl online and we clicked, and have gone on a couple dates. Two nights ago was our third date and I was treating her to dinner at a local burger place in the city. Nothing fancy, I just wanted some good conversation over a tasty meal. This girl is a knockout, has the rare quality of being a great listener, and isn't obsessed with herself. She's funny, charming, and smart. We had had several great dates and I was getting close to asking her to be my girlfriend. She is also the one who called me an asshole before the night was done (not her exact words, but we'll get there.)\n\nOur waitress for dinner was great. Actually enthusiastic and friendly, on point with the refills, and just top notch service all around. At one point in the evening she did spill a partially-full glass of water on our table, but it wasn't really her fault because she had gotten bumped into, and she was very quick to apologize and wipe the table dry with a smile on her face, so if anything that was a point in her column.\n\nAt the end of the meal, she brought the check and I told her I would like to speak with her manager. She asked if there was something wrong, and I calmly repeated that I would like to speak with her manager and could she please go get him. She leaves and reappears with the manager a few moments later, and I proceed to tell him that we had gotten *excellent* service that night, and that (her name) was one of their best. He thanked me for the feedback and she also looked very happy at the compliment and thanked me.\n\nThe only one not happy was my date. She said, \"If that was supposed to impress me, it didn't.\" and said that I was full of myself. She didn't say much else as we gathered our things to leave and there was no kiss at the door that night. I texted her saying I was sorry for whatever I did wrong and that I'd like to see her again soon, so far no response.\n\nSo pardon my french, but what the fuck?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story did something wrong by complimenting the waitress to her manager. The situation is that the author and their date went to a restaurant, and the author wanted to praise the waitress for her good service. However, the date took offense and called the author an asshole, leading to the question here.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author met a girl online, they had a few dates, and the third date was going well. The waitress provided excellent service, even after a minor spill that she handled well. The author wanted to commend her, which is a positive action. Usually, giving feedback, especially positive, is encouraged. But the date was upset by this action.\n\nWhy would the date be upset? Maybe she thought the author was trying to impress her by showing off, or perhaps she didn't appreciate being the third wheel. Maybe she wanted the attention to be on them as a couple, not on the waitress. Alternatively, she might have felt that the author was overdoing it, even though it's a kind gesture. Another angle is that the date might have been jealous or felt that the waitress was getting undue attention.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, complimenting service staff is a common way to acknowledge good service and can boost someone's morale. The author didn't do anything negative; they were trying to be polite and appreciative. The manager and waitress were happy with the feedback, so the action itself wasn't wrong in that context.\n\nBut the problem is in the relationship context. The date's reaction suggests that she felt the author's action was inappropriate in their setting. Why would she feel that way? Maybe she thought the author was trying to one-up her by showing off his ability to compliment others, or perhaps she found it unnecessary. It's possible that in the context of a date, especially one where the author was considering proposing a relationship, the act of praising another woman in front of her date might come off as insensitive or dismissive of the current relationship's dynamics.\n\nHowever, the author didn't have any malicious intent. He was genuinely trying to commend the waitress for her good service, which is a positive action in general. The date's reaction is more about her own feelings or expectations rather than the action itself being objectively wrong. Unless there's a specific social norm that says you shouldn't compliment service staff during dates, the author's action isn't inherently wrong.\n\nAnother point is that the waitress's job is to provide service, and giving feedback is part of the customer's role. So the author's intent was positive. The fact that the waitress appreciated the compliment also supports that the action was appropriate.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's action of complimenting the waitress was not wrong in itself. The issue arises from the date's personal reaction, which may be based on her own insecurities or misinterpretations. Therefore, the answer would be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
