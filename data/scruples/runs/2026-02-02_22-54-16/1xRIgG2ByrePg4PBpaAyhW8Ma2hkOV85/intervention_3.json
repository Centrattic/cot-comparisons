I got called an asshole for it, so now I have come here out of curiosity for you fine people to help settle the disagreement.\n\nI met a girl online and we clicked, and have gone on a couple dates. Two nights ago was our third date and I was treating her to dinner at a local burger place in the city. Nothing fancy, I just wanted some good conversation over a tasty meal. This girl is a knockout, has the rare quality of being a great listener, and isn't obsessed with herself. She's funny, charming, and smart. We had had several great dates and I was getting close to asking her to be my girlfriend. She is also the one who called me an asshole before the night was done (not her exact words, but we'll get there.)\n\nOur waitress for dinner was great. Actually enthusiastic and friendly, on point with the refills, and just top notch service all around. At one point in the evening she did spill a partially-full glass of water on our table, but it wasn't really her fault because she had gotten bumped into, and she was very quick to apologize and wipe the table dry with a smile on her face, so if anything that was a point in her column.\n\nAt the end of the meal, she brought the check and I told her I would like to speak with her manager. She asked if there was something wrong, and I calmly repeated that I would like to speak with her manager and could she please go get him. She leaves and reappears with the manager a few moments later, and I proceed to tell him that we had gotten *excellent* service that night, and that (her name) was one of their best. He thanked me for the feedback and she also looked very happy at the compliment and thanked me.\n\nThe only one not happy was my date. She said, \"If that was supposed to impress me, it didn't.\" and said that I was full of myself. She didn't say much else as we gathered our things to leave and there was no kiss at the door that night. I texted her saying I was sorry for whatever I did wrong and that I'd like to see her again soon, so far no response.\n\nSo pardon my french, but what the fuck?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author went on a date with a girl, and they had a good time. The waitress provided excellent service, even after a minor spill. The author wanted to compliment the waitress by speaking to the manager. The date was upset and called the author an asshole. The question is whether the author did something wrong.\n\nFirst, the author's action was to praise the waitress. That seems positive, right? Complimenting someone's work should be a good thing. The waitress even seemed happy with the feedback, and the manager appreciated the feedback. So the action itself isn't negative.\n\nNow, the date was upset. Why would she be? Maybe she felt that the author was trying to impress her by showing off his generosity or attention to service. Alternatively, maybe she felt it was unnecessary or that the author was being self-centered by taking the initiative to compliment the waitress instead of just doing it privately. Sometimes people might have different expectations about such gestures. \n\nThe author thought it was a genuine compliment, but the date perceived it as an attempt to impress her. The key here is the intention versus the perception. If the author's intention was purely to recognize good service, then he wasn't in the wrong. But if the date felt that the action was meant to impress her and it came off as self-centered, that could be a point of contention. However, the author didn't ask the waitress to get the manager to impress the date; he did it because he wanted to commend the waitress. \n\nThe date might have felt that the author was trying to show off, maybe by getting the manager involved, which could be seen as unnecessary. Alternatively, perhaps the date felt that the compliment was better given directly to the waitress instead of through the manager, but the method here seems appropriate. \n\nSince the author's action was positive and the waitress appreciated it, the issue seems to be more about the date's interpretation. The author didn't have malicious intent here. So, in terms of right or wrong, the author isn't in the wrong because he did something good that benefited the waitress. The date's reaction is her issue, not his fault. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
