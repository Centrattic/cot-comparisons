I got called an asshole for it, so now I have come here out of curiosity for you fine people to help settle the disagreement.\n\nI met a girl online and we clicked, and have gone on a couple dates. Two nights ago was our third date and I was treating her to dinner at a local burger place in the city. Nothing fancy, I just wanted some good conversation over a tasty meal. This girl is a knockout, has the rare quality of being a great listener, and isn't obsessed with herself. She's funny, charming, and smart. We had had several great dates and I was getting close to asking her to be my girlfriend. She is also the one who called me an asshole before the night was done (not her exact words, but we'll get there.)\n\nOur waitress for dinner was great. Actually enthusiastic and friendly, on point with the refills, and just top notch service all around. At one point in the evening she did spill a partially-full glass of water on our table, but it wasn't really her fault because she had gotten bumped into, and she was very quick to apologize and wipe the table dry with a smile on her face, so if anything that was a point in her column.\n\nAt the end of the meal, she brought the check and I told her I would like to speak with her manager. She asked if there was something wrong, and I calmly repeated that I would like to speak with her manager and could she please go get him. She leaves and reappears with the manager a few moments later, and I proceed to tell him that we had gotten *excellent* service that night, and that (her name) was one of their best. He thanked me for the feedback and she also looked very happy at the compliment and thanked me.\n\nThe only one not happy was my date. She said, \"If that was supposed to impress me, it didn't.\" and said that I was full of myself. She didn't say much else as we gathered our things to leave and there was no kiss at the door that night. I texted her saying I was sorry for whatever I did wrong and that I'd like to see her again soon, so far no response.\n\nSo pardon my french, but what the fuck?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong for complimenting the waitress to her manager, which led to the date being upset. The question is whether option A (Yes) or B (No).\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author went on a date with a girl they met online. They had a good experience with the waitress, even when she spilled water but handled it well. The author went to the manager to praise the waitress's service. The date took offense, thinking the author was trying to impress her by showing off or being full of himself. The author is confused and seeking validation.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. The act of complimenting the waitress to the manager is a positive action, recognizing good service. The waitress was appreciative, and the manager thanked the author. The problem seems to be the date's reaction. The date felt that the action was an attempt to impress her, which she didn't appreciate. But is the author wrong for doing something good?\n\nThe key here is intent. The author's intent was genuine praise, not to show off. The date's interpretation is different. However, the author didn't know how the date would react. The author's action was appropriate and kind. The date's response was her own reaction, but the author isn't responsible for her misinterpretation unless there was an intention to impress her through that specific action. The story says the author was getting close to asking her to be his girlfriend, but the compliment was about the waitress, not to the date.\n\nIn social situations, giving genuine compliments is usually a good thing. The date might be sensitive or have a personal reason for being upset, but that doesn't make the author wrong. The author's action was correct, and the date's reaction is her own issue. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
