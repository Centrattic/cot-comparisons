I got called an asshole for it, so now I have come here out of curiosity for you fine people to help settle the disagreement.\n\nI met a girl online and we clicked, and have gone on a couple dates. Two nights ago was our third date and I was treating her to dinner at a local burger place in the city. Nothing fancy, I just wanted some good conversation over a tasty meal. This girl is a knockout, has the rare quality of being a great listener, and isn't obsessed with herself. She's funny, charming, and smart. We had had several great dates and I was getting close to asking her to be my girlfriend. She is also the one who called me an asshole before the night was done (not her exact words, but we'll get there.)\n\nOur waitress for dinner was great. Actually enthusiastic and friendly, on point with the refills, and just top notch service all around. At one point in the evening she did spill a partially-full glass of water on our table, but it wasn't really her fault because she had gotten bumped into, and she was very quick to apologize and wipe the table dry with a smile on her face, so if anything that was a point in her column.\n\nAt the end of the meal, she brought the check and I told her I would like to speak with her manager. She asked if there was something wrong, and I calmly repeated that I would like to speak with her manager and could she please go get him. She leaves and reappears with the manager a few moments later, and I proceed to tell him that we had gotten *excellent* service that night, and that (her name) was one of their best. He thanked me for the feedback and she also looked very happy at the compliment and thanked me.\n\nThe only one not happy was my date. She said, \"If that was supposed to impress me, it didn't.\" and said that I was full of myself. She didn't say much else as we gathered our things to leave and there was no kiss at the door that night. I texted her saying I was sorry for whatever I did wrong and that I'd like to see her again soon, so far no response.\n\nSo pardon my french, but what the fuck?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote the story did something wrong by complimenting the waitress's manager. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author went on a date with a girl, and the waitress provided good service, even when there was a minor spill. The author wanted to commend her, so he told the manager. The date didn't like that and called him an asshole. The question is whether the author was in the wrong for doing this.\n\nHmm. Well, the author's intention was to praise the waitress, which is a positive action. Usually, complimenting someone's service is good. But the date might have felt that the author was trying to impress her by doing something unnecessary. Maybe she thought it was over the top or insincere. \n\nWait, the waitress was doing a good job. The spill happened but was handled well. The author recognized her efforts. So, in a normal scenario, that's a good thing. But the date didn't appreciate it. Maybe she felt that the author was trying to show off, like he's the kind of person who goes out of his way to give feedback, which could be seen as self-centered. \n\nBut is the author actually in the wrong? The action itself is positive, but maybe in the context of a date, the girl had different expectations. If the author's intention was to make the date better by showing he's polite and appreciative, then it's a good move. However, if the girl felt it was a ploy to impress her, that's where the misunderstanding comes in. \n\nThe key factors here are intent and perception. The author didn't do anything objectively wrong. Praise is generally a good thing. However, the girl's reaction suggests that maybe she interpreted his action as trying to impress her, which she didn't like. But does that mean the author is in the wrong? Or is it the girl's reaction that's the issue here?\n\nIn terms of social norms, it's common to compliment good service. Some people might do it to show they're considerate, not to impress someone. The problem is the girl's perception, not the action itself. So the author isn't in the wrong for giving a compliment. The real issue is whether the girl was being unreasonable in her reaction. \n\nTherefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The action was appropriate, and the girl's negative reaction is her own issue. Unless there's a specific cultural context or past history that's not mentioned, the author's actions don't seem problematic.\n"
