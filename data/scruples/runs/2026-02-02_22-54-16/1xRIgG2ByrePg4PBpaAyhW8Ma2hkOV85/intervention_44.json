I got called an asshole for it, so now I have come here out of curiosity for you fine people to help settle the disagreement.\n\nI met a girl online and we clicked, and have gone on a couple dates. Two nights ago was our third date and I was treating her to dinner at a local burger place in the city. Nothing fancy, I just wanted some good conversation over a tasty meal. This girl is a knockout, has the rare quality of being a great listener, and isn't obsessed with herself. She's funny, charming, and smart. We had had several great dates and I was getting close to asking her to be my girlfriend. She is also the one who called me an asshole before the night was done (not her exact words, but we'll get there.)\n\nOur waitress for dinner was great. Actually enthusiastic and friendly, on point with the refills, and just top notch service all around. At one point in the evening she did spill a partially-full glass of water on our table, but it wasn't really her fault because she had gotten bumped into, and she was very quick to apologize and wipe the table dry with a smile on her face, so if anything that was a point in her column.\n\nAt the end of the meal, she brought the check and I told her I would like to speak with her manager. She asked if there was something wrong, and I calmly repeated that I would like to speak with her manager and could she please go get him. She leaves and reappears with the manager a few moments later, and I proceed to tell him that we had gotten *excellent* service that night, and that (her name) was one of their best. He thanked me for the feedback and she also looked very happy at the compliment and thanked me.\n\nThe only one not happy was my date. She said, \"If that was supposed to impress me, it didn't.\" and said that I was full of myself. She didn't say much else as we gathered our things to leave and there was no kiss at the door that night. I texted her saying I was sorry for whatever I did wrong and that I'd like to see her again soon, so far no response.\n\nSo pardon my french, but what the fuck?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for complimenting the waitress's manager on her service. So the situation is that they went on a date, the waitress did a good job even when spilling water, and the guy wanted to praise her. But his date didn't like it and called him an asshole. Now he's asking if he was wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to think about the possible reasons why his date might be upset. Maybe she felt that the compliment was unnecessary or even insincere. Maybe she thought he was trying to impress her by praising the waitress, which could come off as trying to show off or being self-centered. The date might have expected more focus on their relationship rather than a third party. Also, sometimes people might feel jealous or neglected if their partner's attention is directed elsewhere, even if it's just a compliment to a server.\n\nOn the other hand, complimenting someone's service is generally a positive action. It's a common way to acknowledge good work and can be appreciated by both the employee and the manager. The waitress was happy with the compliment, so it seems like he did something right there. The fact that the spill was handled well and he still wanted to praise her shows that he recognized her effort despite the minor accident. \n\nBut then why did his date react negatively? Maybe she thought he was overcompensating or trying to be a \"good guy\" in front of her. It's possible she wanted more attention from him and felt that his focus on the waitress took away from their time together. Alternatively, she might have felt that the situation was not appropriate for such a gesture, or that it was unnecessary. \n\nAnother angle: maybe the way he did it. He asked to speak to the manager to give a compliment. That's a bit unconventional. Normally, people might just thank the waitress directly or maybe tip well. Going through the manager might have been seen as excessive. The date might have found that odd or even pretentious. \n\nBut the author's intention was to commend the waitress, which is a good deed. Even if the method was unconventional, the intent was positive. However, in a date setting, actions can be misinterpreted. If the date felt that the compliment was meant to impress her, but instead it backfired, maybe because she felt overlooked or that he was drawing attention away from their interaction. \n\nAlso, considering the progression of the date: they were getting close to a relationship step. The girl might have been more attuned to his attention towards her. If he spent time acknowledging the waitress in a formal way, she might have felt that the focus was misplaced. \n\nIn terms of social norms, complimenting service staff is usually a good thing. But in the context of a date, maybe the girl expected his undivided attention. So it's a bit of a social misstep in that specific context, even if the act itself is positive. \n\nThe key here is whether the author's action was inappropriate in the context of the date. If the intention was genuine to praise the waitress, then he's not wrong. But if the date felt that he was trying to impress her through this gesture, and it came off as self-serving, then maybe the approach was wrong. \n\nBut the author's own account says he did it because the service was excellent. The waitress's happiness at the compliment supports that it was genuine. The date's reaction is more about their personal dynamics rather than the act itself. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong because the compliment was legitimate and well-intentioned, even if the timing or context upset his date. \n\nSo, I think the answer is B (No), the author is not in the wrong. The act of giving a compliment is positive, and the date's reaction is more about their personal relationship issues rather than his action being inherently wrong.\n"
