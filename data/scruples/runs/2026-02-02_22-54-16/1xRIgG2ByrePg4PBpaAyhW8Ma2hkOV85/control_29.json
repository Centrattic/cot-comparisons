I got called an asshole for it, so now I have come here out of curiosity for you fine people to help settle the disagreement.\n\nI met a girl online and we clicked, and have gone on a couple dates. Two nights ago was our third date and I was treating her to dinner at a local burger place in the city. Nothing fancy, I just wanted some good conversation over a tasty meal. This girl is a knockout, has the rare quality of being a great listener, and isn't obsessed with herself. She's funny, charming, and smart. We had had several great dates and I was getting close to asking her to be my girlfriend. She is also the one who called me an asshole before the night was done (not her exact words, but we'll get there.)\n\nOur waitress for dinner was great. Actually enthusiastic and friendly, on point with the refills, and just top notch service all around. At one point in the evening she did spill a partially-full glass of water on our table, but it wasn't really her fault because she had gotten bumped into, and she was very quick to apologize and wipe the table dry with a smile on her face, so if anything that was a point in her column.\n\nAt the end of the meal, she brought the check and I told her I would like to speak with her manager. She asked if there was something wrong, and I calmly repeated that I would like to speak with her manager and could she please go get him. She leaves and reappears with the manager a few moments later, and I proceed to tell him that we had gotten *excellent* service that night, and that (her name) was one of their best. He thanked me for the feedback and she also looked very happy at the compliment and thanked me.\n\nThe only one not happy was my date. She said, \"If that was supposed to impress me, it didn't.\" and said that I was full of myself. She didn't say much else as we gathered our things to leave and there was no kiss at the door that night. I texted her saying I was sorry for whatever I did wrong and that I'd like to see her again soon, so far no response.\n\nSo pardon my french, but what the fuck?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that he complimented his date's waitress by telling the manager she did a great job. His date got upset and called him an asshole. He's confused because he thought it was a nice thing to do.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. He was on a date with a girl he really liked, and he wanted to do something nice. The waitress provided excellent service, even when there was a minor spill that wasn't her fault. He went to the manager to give her a compliment. That seems like a positive action on his part.\n\nBut why was the date upset? Maybe there's something cultural or personal. Some people might find it odd or even condescending for a date to go out of their way to compliment a server, especially if they're trying to impress each other. Alternatively, maybe the girl felt that the compliment was unnecessary or that he was showing off. \n\nBut is that a valid reason to be upset? Complimenting someone else isn't inherently wrong. It's a kind thing to do, and the waitress appreciated it. The girl's reaction seems a bit harsh. However, relationships are about mutual comfort, and if she felt this action was intrusive or inconsiderate, there might be underlying issues. \n\nAnother angle: maybe the girl thought he was trying to manipulate the situation or make himself look better by praising someone else. But that seems a stretch. His intention was clearly to commend the waitress for good service. \n\nThe author apologized, and she hasn't responded yet. So the conflict is between his action (which was positive) and her reaction (which might be based on personal feelings). The question is whether he was wrong. Since the action itself was good, and the problem is her personal reaction, the answer would be that he's not in the wrong. The issue lies with her response, not his action.\n"
