I got called an asshole for it, so now I have come here out of curiosity for you fine people to help settle the disagreement.\n\nI met a girl online and we clicked, and have gone on a couple dates. Two nights ago was our third date and I was treating her to dinner at a local burger place in the city. Nothing fancy, I just wanted some good conversation over a tasty meal. This girl is a knockout, has the rare quality of being a great listener, and isn't obsessed with herself. She's funny, charming, and smart. We had had several great dates and I was getting close to asking her to be my girlfriend. She is also the one who called me an asshole before the night was done (not her exact words, but we'll get there.)\n\nOur waitress for dinner was great. Actually enthusiastic and friendly, on point with the refills, and just top notch service all around. At one point in the evening she did spill a partially-full glass of water on our table, but it wasn't really her fault because she had gotten bumped into, and she was very quick to apologize and wipe the table dry with a smile on her face, so if anything that was a point in her column.\n\nAt the end of the meal, she brought the check and I told her I would like to speak with her manager. She asked if there was something wrong, and I calmly repeated that I would like to speak with her manager and could she please go get him. She leaves and reappears with the manager a few moments later, and I proceed to tell him that we had gotten *excellent* service that night, and that (her name) was one of their best. He thanked me for the feedback and she also looked very happy at the compliment and thanked me.\n\nThe only one not happy was my date. She said, \"If that was supposed to impress me, it didn't.\" and said that I was full of myself. She didn't say much else as we gathered our things to leave and there was no kiss at the door that night. I texted her saying I was sorry for whatever I did wrong and that I'd like to see her again soon, so far no response.\n\nSo pardon my french, but what the fuck?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's dive into this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for complimenting the waitress to her manager. The situation is that he wanted to impress his date by giving positive feedback, but it backfired. The date thought he was being full of himself and didn't appreciate it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The waitress was great, so the compliment was genuine. He went to the manager to give it, which is a common way to recognize good service. But why would the date be upset? Maybe she felt that he was trying too hard or being insincere. Or perhaps she was uncomfortable with the attention the waitress might receive, thinking it's unprofessional or maybe even a bit awkward.\n\nWait, the author mentions that the waitress was friendly and handled the spill well. The compliment was about her service, not about the waitress in a personal way. But the date might have misinterpreted the gesture. Maybe she thought he was trying to flirt with the waitress or that he was being overly self-congratulatory for using the manager to praise her. Or maybe she preferred a more personal thank you instead of going through the manager, feeling it was a bit showy.\n\nI should also think about social norms. Praising a server's job through management is usually a positive thing. However, in a romantic setting, the person might expect more direct compliments to their partner. If the date wanted to be impressed, maybe the author should have focused on her instead of the waitress. But the intention here was to highlight good service, which is a common practice. The date's reaction could be due to misunderstanding the author's motive. \n\nBut is the author actually in the wrong? If the compliment was sincere and the waitress appreciated it, then the author did a good thing. However, if the date felt neglected or that the gesture was inappropriate, maybe he should have considered her feelings. The key is whether the action was respectful and appropriate. Since the waitress's job is to provide service, and the manager is the right person to receive such feedback, the author's action is valid. \n\nSo the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong. He acted appropriately in praising the service, and the date's reaction is subjective. Unless there's a specific reason the date was upset, like a personal issue, the author's intent was positive.\n"
