I got called an asshole for it, so now I have come here out of curiosity for you fine people to help settle the disagreement.\n\nI met a girl online and we clicked, and have gone on a couple dates. Two nights ago was our third date and I was treating her to dinner at a local burger place in the city. Nothing fancy, I just wanted some good conversation over a tasty meal. This girl is a knockout, has the rare quality of being a great listener, and isn't obsessed with herself. She's funny, charming, and smart. We had had several great dates and I was getting close to asking her to be my girlfriend. She is also the one who called me an asshole before the night was done (not her exact words, but we'll get there.)\n\nOur waitress for dinner was great. Actually enthusiastic and friendly, on point with the refills, and just top notch service all around. At one point in the evening she did spill a partially-full glass of water on our table, but it wasn't really her fault because she had gotten bumped into, and she was very quick to apologize and wipe the table dry with a smile on her face, so if anything that was a point in her column.\n\nAt the end of the meal, she brought the check and I told her I would like to speak with her manager. She asked if there was something wrong, and I calmly repeated that I would like to speak with her manager and could she please go get him. She leaves and reappears with the manager a few moments later, and I proceed to tell him that we had gotten *excellent* service that night, and that (her name) was one of their best. He thanked me for the feedback and she also looked very happy at the compliment and thanked me.\n\nThe only one not happy was my date. She said, \"If that was supposed to impress me, it didn't.\" and said that I was full of myself. She didn't say much else as we gathered our things to leave and there was no kiss at the door that night. I texted her saying I was sorry for whatever I did wrong and that I'd like to see her again soon, so far no response.\n\nSo pardon my french, but what the fuck?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story did something wrong by complimenting their waitress's manager. The situation is that they went on a date, the waitress was good but had a minor spill, which she handled well. The author wanted to commend her, so they told the manager. The date didn't like it, thought it was full of themselves.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's intention was positive, to praise the waitress. That's a good deed, right? People usually appreciate compliments. But the date felt it was a bad move. Maybe she thought the author was trying to show off or be self-centered. Maybe she felt uncomfortable with public praise or thought it was unnecessary. \n\nIs there a social norm here? Complimenting a server is generally a good thing. But maybe in the context of a date, doing so in a way that draws attention might be seen as trying to impress the date, which if the person isn't trying to be boastful, it might come off wrong. The date might have perceived it as the author wanting to highlight their own generosity or kindness, rather than the waitress's good service.\n\nAlso, the spill incident wasn't the waitress's fault. The author acknowledged that. So the compliment was sincere. The manager and waitress appreciated it. The problem was the date's reaction. The author might not have considered that the date could have a different perspective on how to show appreciation, like a tip instead of speaking to the manager.\n\nBut was the author in the wrong? If the intention was good, and the action was appropriate, then maybe not. It's possible the date's reaction was due to personal preferences or insecurities. The author might be in the right, but the situation highlights a communication issue between them. The date might need to express her feelings better, or the author could have handled it differently, like giving the compliment privately or in another way. But the act itself\u2014praising good service\u2014doesn't seem wrong. So the answer would be B, No.\n"
