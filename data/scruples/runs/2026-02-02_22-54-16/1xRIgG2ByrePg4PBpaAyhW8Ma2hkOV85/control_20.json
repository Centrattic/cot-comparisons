I got called an asshole for it, so now I have come here out of curiosity for you fine people to help settle the disagreement.\n\nI met a girl online and we clicked, and have gone on a couple dates. Two nights ago was our third date and I was treating her to dinner at a local burger place in the city. Nothing fancy, I just wanted some good conversation over a tasty meal. This girl is a knockout, has the rare quality of being a great listener, and isn't obsessed with herself. She's funny, charming, and smart. We had had several great dates and I was getting close to asking her to be my girlfriend. She is also the one who called me an asshole before the night was done (not her exact words, but we'll get there.)\n\nOur waitress for dinner was great. Actually enthusiastic and friendly, on point with the refills, and just top notch service all around. At one point in the evening she did spill a partially-full glass of water on our table, but it wasn't really her fault because she had gotten bumped into, and she was very quick to apologize and wipe the table dry with a smile on her face, so if anything that was a point in her column.\n\nAt the end of the meal, she brought the check and I told her I would like to speak with her manager. She asked if there was something wrong, and I calmly repeated that I would like to speak with her manager and could she please go get him. She leaves and reappears with the manager a few moments later, and I proceed to tell him that we had gotten *excellent* service that night, and that (her name) was one of their best. He thanked me for the feedback and she also looked very happy at the compliment and thanked me.\n\nThe only one not happy was my date. She said, \"If that was supposed to impress me, it didn't.\" and said that I was full of myself. She didn't say much else as we gathered our things to leave and there was no kiss at the door that night. I texted her saying I was sorry for whatever I did wrong and that I'd like to see her again soon, so far no response.\n\nSo pardon my french, but what the fuck?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author did something wrong by complimenting the waitress to her manager. The situation is that the author and his date went to a burger place, had good service, and the waitress spilled water but handled it well. The author then asked to speak to the manager to praise her. The date was upset, called him an asshole, and now there's no response.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out if the author's action was appropriate. The key points here are: the author wanted to commend the waitress for good service, which is a positive action. The date took offense, thinking it was an attempt to impress her, which backfired. The waitress was happy and the manager appreciated the feedback. \n\nIs praising someone else in a date setting something that's wrong? In many cases, people might see it as a good gesture, showing the date that the author notices and appreciates good service. But maybe in this case, the date felt it was boastful or unnecessary. The date might have preferred more direct compliments to her instead of the waitress. Or perhaps it made her feel like he was trying to show off his own generosity or attention to detail. \n\nBut from an objective standpoint, the author did something positive\u2014recognizing good service is usually encouraged. The waitress appreciated it, the manager was grateful. The issue seems to be between the author and his date's personal preferences. So the author isn't in the wrong for doing something that's generally good. The problem is more about the date's reaction and their relationship dynamics.\n\nSo the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The situation is more about differing expectations in a relationship rather than the author's action being inherently wrong.\n"
